2bd2e755-fa1c-403f-8889-31bef4f89b11,"Kim Kardashian is allegedly “phasing out” mom Kris Jenner, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as her longtime manager, amid reports Kim is ready for a total image overhaul after returning to the spotlight following her October robbery.  That’s according to a new report by Radar Online, who’s claiming that the mother-daughter duo could be caught in a nasty feud as a source alleged that Kardashian has had somewhat of an epiphany during her time away from the spotlight and allegedly has now opened her eyes to see how Jenner “used her” to build the Kardashian brand.  According to the site, Kim is ready to project a very different image from the uber-glamorous money flaunting Kardashian fans used to know and is allegedly ready to kick mom Kris to the curb, at least professionally, in order to do so.  A source alleged to the site this week that Kim now “seems to be thinking that Kris used her to get where she is today,” which Radar Online is alleging could have led to a nasty feud between Jenner and her daughter as well as the reality star reportedly making a pretty big business decision when it comes to her mom.  “[Kim] will never think of [Kris] in the same way again,” the source said of Jenner’s supposed drama with her daughter amid reports she believes Jenner has been “using” her for years.  The site then went on to report that Kim is now in the process of projecting her new toned-down image amid the feud claims with Kris, revealing that Jenner may no longer play such a big part in Kardashian’s career going forward.  “Kim hired a transition team to make sure that she gives off a different image than she did previously,” the source said of Jenner and her daughter potentially parting ways professionally, claiming that “part of this process includes phasing out [Kris’s] management.”  While Kris and Kim have not commented on the claims, this isn’t the first time it’s been reported that Kardashian may be looking to distance herself from Jenner, at least professionally, in the wake of her October robbery in Paris.  Radar Online claimed back in October that Kim Kardashian had grown wise to Kris Jenner’s “money making machine” after taking some downtime at the end of 2016, alleging at the time that Kim has been so busy with her career that she’s failed to realize how much Jenner, who is often referred to as her “momager,” had been controlling her life and career.  “Kim never realized how much [Kris] and the money-making machine was controlling her until this robbery,” an insider told the site of Kardashian’s feelings about Jenner at the time, months before it was reported that the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star is allegedly looking to “phase out” Kris from her career.  “Kim is just starting to think that maybe Kris’s intentions were not pure all along,” continued the source in October, adding that Kim has been doing a lot of thinking about her father Robert Kardashian while taking some time away which has allegedly helped her to get wise to Kris’s seemingly relentless pursuit of fame for herself and her family.  “[Kim] told her family that she wanted to be the girl that her father wanted her to be and not the girl that she became with Kris’s help,” a source revealed last year, just months before it was reported that a feud could be brewing between Kardashian and Jenner.

Rihanna and Hassan Jameel made headlines in June 2017 when they were photographed making out in a pool at a private villa in Spain. Fans believed at first that the guy was a Spanish footballer, but he turned out to be a Saudi billionaire. He is the deputy president and vice chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the largest companies in the world. The Barbadian singer was in an on-and-off relationship with Chris Brown, 28, and it looks like her new beau fears that the “With You” singer might win her back.  A source close to Rihanna, 29, recently told Hollywood Life that Jameel is worried that Brown keeps “lurking in her past” and is being unpredictable. Although RiRi has opened up to her new beau about her past, the Toyota heir is still concerned that Breezy can still win her back. He feels uncomfortable with the idea that the “Kiss Kiss” singer still loves her and might be able to take her back from him anytime.  However, a separate source previously told the same news outlet that Rihanna hopes that the well-heeled Saudi Arabian can help her forget her dark past with Chris Brown. Now, fans are convinced that she has moved on gracefully from Breezy. The “Umbrella” singer recently stepped out with her new flame Hassan Jameel at the Grammys despite keeping their relationship under wraps.  “He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.”  stay pressed.

Following her performance at the Grammys, some fans suggested that Rihanna is pregnant with Jameel’s baby as her tight outfit appears to have shown a tiny baby bump. However, another insider also told Hollywood Life that the Barbadian singer is not pregnant, and is not trying to get pregnant either.

48955c79-6ad6-47d8-9866-9891f27f7a0c,"Living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers and shelves gives us little need to think about storage space. In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn’t demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can’t compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn’t have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don’t have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn’t use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can’t live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,601
5897a109-13f1-46ce-aafe-d65e582f21a6,"Her 'Today' co-anchor Al Roker attacked the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce"" on people over mistakes and called out the New York Times for its participation. ""It's a cheap shot.""  Jenna Bush Hager issued an apology over her Golden Globes snafu on Monday morning's Today.  The NBC News correspondent was covering her first red carpet for the network Sunday when she found herself thrust into the viral news spotlight after interviewing Hidden Figures nominee Pharrell.  ""So you're nominated for Hidden Fences,"" said Bush Hager, mistakenly combining the title of his film, Hidden Figures, with the also nominated Fences, starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. The New York Times' Dave Itzkoff highlighted the moment with a video on Twitter, sparking social media to quickly comment on Pharrell's taken-aback expression.  ""I had an error in the night, which I have to apologize for,"" said Bush Hager, who was joined by Al Roker and Natalie Morales on the NBC morning show. ""When I was interviewing the incomparable Pharrell, who I adore, I accidentally — in the electricity of the red carpet, which I've never done one before — called Hidden Figures 'Hidden Fences.' I have seen both movies, thought they were both brilliant. I've interviewed casts for both of the movies, and if I offended people I am deeply sorry.""  Later in the night, Michael Keaton made the same notable error when presenting the best supporting actress award, sparking the term #HiddenFences to trend on Twitter. While some users posted jokes and memes, others such as Gabrielle Union and Justin Simien noted their disappointment about the confusion and comedian-actress Robin Thede said, ""All movies with black people don't sound alike.""  ""It was a mistake, because ya'll know I'm not perfect,"" continued Bush Hager, who at this point began to choke up and get teary-eyed. ""I am authentic, but a human. And what I didn't want to do is make anyone lesser than who they are. I apologize to both the cast, to Pharrell, but it was a mistake and I hope we can move on.""  Both Roker and Morales swooped in to defend Bush Hager, with Roker blasting the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce on people"" for what he said is a common mistake for live TV broadcasters.  ""We've all been in live situations and you make a mistake,"" said Roker, adding how he forgot Braveheart when he was interviewing Mel Gibson and referred to Jessica Biel as Jessica Alba during his Sunday interviews. ""Honest mistakes happen in live television and this culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce and get on people, it's got to stop. It's got to stop somewhere, because it's pretty ridiculous.""  He then chided The New York Times.  ""For The New York Times to pile on and repeat these tweets, it's a cheap shot,"" said Roker.  Bush Hager conceded that she has thick skin, but ""to act as though I don't care about people really hurt,"" prompting Morales to point out the red-carpet chaos.  ""It's like a mosh pit,"" she said. ""You're getting celebrities coming at you from all directions. It's a lot happening at the same time, and I think you had just interviewed the cast of Fences also, I think you were just right there in the moment, so it happens.""  But Bush Hager wouldn't cop to the excuse and ended with more of her apology.  ""I know how brilliant those films are and I did not want to make anyone feel lesser,"" she said.  Shortly after the segment aired, Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer took to Twitter to say she accepted Bush Hager's apology. ""We all make mistakes, hon! Thanks for your apology!"" she tweeted.

aee43e1f-7c7f-436f-ae35-fb30d7e22824,"The much-talked about ending of the Gilmore Girls revival left many perplexed, some vexed, and pretty much everyone wanting the mystery to be solved ASAP. Now that we know that the show's final words were (major spoiler alert) Rory saying ""I'm pregnant,"" the question of who Rory's baby's father is has left many fans freaking out, especially considering that the words have always been described as final, meaning the mystery might remain unsolved forever. To make matters even worse? One of Gilmore Girls' lead actors, Matt Czuchry, knows the answer — but he's not going to tell you it anytime soon.  In an interview with The Huffington Post published on Friday, Czuchry (who plays Logan Huntzberger) revealed that he and the show's creators, Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, know who the father of Rory's child is. ""[Amy and Dan] did tell me who is the father of that baby,” Czuchry revealed. “If they ever want to reveal that, they can do that, but I think at this particular point, I think the purpose is ... to fast forward and say, what kind of mother would Rory be, what kind of grandmother would Lorelai be [and] in terms of whoever the father is would they be in that person’s life. Would it be different from Christopher or would it mirror that completely? Those stories aren’t told yet. I think the fun is for everybody to come up with those theories and play that out in their minds.”  BUILD Series on YouTube  Come on. That's too tantalizing, but alas, Czuchry is smart not to tell us the truth. Still, Palladino and Sherman-Palladino have addressed the final four words and the ambiguousness of the ending themselves before, and whether Rory will become a parent at all is less definite than Czuchry makes it sound. Sherman-Palladino has mentioned that Rory would consider an abortion, and in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Palladino revealed that neither creator had a clear idea of Rory's future. ""There’s all sorts of options for her out there and actually,"" he said. ""Amy and I have not thought at all what would possibly happen to Rory beyond that moment.""  And if more Gilmore Girls episodes come one day, perhaps the mystery of the baby's pregnancy, and Rory's future, will be solved. Sherman-Palladino seems vaguely open to the possibility of more episodes, telling The Hollywood Reporter. “We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey... So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, ‘Is there more, is there more, is there more?’ — this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.” So the baby's parentage could be revealed in a new Netflix season, in a future interview, or, quite possibly, not at all. Whatever happens, fans will be waiting eagerly to find out.  Image: Netflix",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,597

Katy Perry's conservative Christian past is no secret, but the pop superstar took a trip down memory lane on Saturday night (March 18) while dropping some new truths in the process of detailing her journey to enlightenment.  The reason: Human Rights Campaign's Los Angeles gala dinner at JW Marriott L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles, where Perry picked up the org's highest honor, the National Equality Award. HRC feted the 32-year-old alongside America Ferrera, 32, who took home the Ally for Equality Award, a trophy presented to her by her good friend Lena Dunham. Perry received her award from her own BFF of 11 years, actress Shannon Woodward, who said the singer ""finds a way to act as an ally virtually every single time she performs or speaks publicly.""  BFF of 11 ys @shannonwoodward presents to @katyperry, lauding her as global pop star who created soundtrack to our lives #HRCLADinner @HRC pic.twitter.com/6f36zHaNrQ — Chris Gardner (@chrissgardner) March 19, 2017  For Saturday's edition, Perry first praised her LGBTQ friends for informing her own evolution. ""There’s no other community that has done more to shape who I am today, and there is no other community that I believe in more than you,"" she exclaimed. ""This community here tonight has achieved more progress toward a more perfect union in a short amount of time as any group in our history. So I stand with you and I know that we stand together against discrimination, whether it be in the LGBTQ community or our Latino brothers and sisters or the millions of Muslims in this country.""  Then came Perry's peek at the past. After noting that she speaks her truths and paints her fantasies courtesy of ""little, bite-sized pop songs,"" she referenced her 2008 smash hit single ""I Kissed a Girl."" The lesbian lyrics were just a tease.  ""Truth be told: A) I did more than that,"" Perry purred. ""But B) How was I going to reconcile that with the gospel singing girl raised in youth groups that [was] pro-conversion camps? What I did know is that I was curious, and even then, I knew that sexuality wasn’t as black and white as this dress."" (For the record, she was wearing a Rasario design.)  However, Perry's own curiosity seemed to have gotten repressed by her Christian leanings. ""My first words were 'mama' and 'dada,' 'God' and 'Satan,'"" she related. ""Right and wrong were taught to me on felt boards and, of course, through the glamorous Jan Crouch crying diamond teardrops every night on that Vaseline-TBN television screen. When I was growing up, homosexuality was synonymous with the word 'abomination' … and hell. A place of gnashing of teeth, continual burning of skin and probably Mike Pence’s ultimate guest list for a barbecue. No way, no way. I wanted the pearly gates and unlimited fro-yo toppings.""  As a result of the anti-homosexuality education she received, Perry turned toward prayer.  ""Most of my unconscious adolescence, I prayed the gay away at my Jesus camps,"" she revealed. ""But then in the middle of it all, in a twist of events, I found my gift, and my gift introduced me to people outside of my bubble. My bubble started to burst.""  The ""pop"" happened with the introduction of LGBTQ friends and collaborators.  ""These people were nothing like I had been taught to fear,"" Perry continued. ""They were the most free, strong, kind and inclusive people I have ever met. They stimulated my mind and they filled my heart with joy, and they freaking danced all the while doing it.

c576f2f0-7b65-420e-8339-4df50f55c5bd,"The estate of Tony winner Jonathan Larson will exec produce the live musical of the HIV/AIDS-themed play. Marc Platt is also on board.  Fox has found its follow-up to Grease Live.  Following prolonged negotiations, Jonathan Larson's Tony-winning HIV/AIDS-themed musical Rent is set as the network's next live musical, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Larson's estate is on board to executive produce alongside Marc Platt (La La Land, Wicked). Rent marks Platt's latest live project for following NBC's Jesus Christ Superstar and Fox's newly announced A Christmas Story and last year's Grease. Additional auspices, as well as a premiere date and casting, will be announced later.  The rock musical, loosely based on La Boheme, tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in New York's East Village in the days of the Bohemian Alphabet City and under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning play was created by Larson, who died suddenly before Rent opened off-Broadway in 1996 and then moved to Broadway. Rent won Tony Awards for best musical, book of a musical and original score — all for Larson — and scored co-lead Wilson Jermaine Heredia a win for featured actor for his performance as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen drummer with HIV/AIDS.  ""Rent​​ was Jonathan’s dream of sharing the ​theater and the passion he had for it with a whole new generation,” Julie and Al Larson said in a statement. “None of us could have imagined the massive impact that the messages and themes in Rent would have on the ​theater​ community or the world ... except for Jonathan. We are absolutely thrilled to be continuing Jonathan’s legacy and ​the still-relevant ​themes of ​the show in this way.”    The original Broadway cast also included Adam Pascal, Daphne-Rubin-Vega and Idina Menzel, who all collected Tony nominations, as well as Anthony Rapp, Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs.    ""We are so honored to partner with the estate of the brilliant Jonathan Larson and producer Marc Platt on one of the great musicals of our time,"" said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group. ""The title is so iconic, the music is so beloved, and the themes are as meaningful today as they were when the show first premiered on Broadway. With Marc overseeing this project, we are sure it will have a profound impact on the legions of fans who know and love this musical.""  The production was adapted for the big screen in 2005 with Chris Columbus directing and produced by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan. Stephen Chbosky adapted Larson's book, with nearly all of the original Broadway cast returning to reprise their roles. With a $40 million budget, the pic grossed a disappointing $31.6 million. The play marked its 20th anniversary in 2016 with a tour.  Fox's production will be exec produced by Platt, Adam Siegel, Julie Larson, Al Larson and Revolution Studios' Vince Totino, Scott Hemming and Marla Levine. The original production was produced by the New York Theatre Workshop and on Broadway by Jeffrey Seller, Kevin McCollum, Allan S. Gordon and the NYTW. Larson, for his part, also earned a Pulitzer Prize for the production.  Speaking with THR at the Emmys, Walden said Rent ""would be a dream — a dream your biggest dream"" to land as the network's next live production. ""That would be a title that's perfect for Fox and something that we could do in a meaningful way. Our network is distinguished by cutting-edge programming and being able to take subject matter — whether it was Glee or Shots Fired — I think our brand is perfect for that title. I would love it.""  Rent, with a legion of loyal and diehard fans, has big shoes to fill. Grease Live ranked third this year at the Emmys, collecting a total of five statuettes including for outstanding special class program and directing for Tony winner Thomas Kail (Hamilton).  The news comes after Fox announced A Christmas Story would air in December, opposite NBC and Jennifer Lopez with Bye Bye Birdie. NBC also noted this week that it would tackle Jesus Christ Superstar for Easter 2018. (There remains no word on NBC's A Few Good Men live production.)

Selena Gomez believes she has made the right decision when it comes to on-again, off-again boyfriend Justin Bieber — by choosing not to be with him.  “Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship, like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship,” a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.  “She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process,” the source continued before adding, “She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.”  Sharing the same sentiment, another insider tells Us that the “Wolves” singer, who was the one who broke it off with Bieber, feels like “she got it out of her system.” Helping things is the fact that Gomez, 25, has other exciting things to focus on, like her new single “Back 2 You” which will be released on Thursday, May 10 — a song that many are speculating to have been inspired by Bieber.  Us Weekly exclusively revealed that the former flames, who dated from 2011 to 2014, were officially back together after they were spotted reuniting in October 2017. Their rekindled romance saw the pair going to church, enjoying candle-lit dinners and embarking on romantic getaways together, including a trip to Jamaica in February, when the pair attended Bieber’s father’s wedding.  Despite trying to make their revamped relationship work, one person was not convinced that it was a good idea: Gomez’s mother, Mandy Teefey, who reportedly disagreed with her daughter over her decision to give Bieber another chance despite their past tumultuous relationship. In March, Us Weekly announced that the pair were “taking a break” because of Teefy’s unwavering disapproval of the “Baby” crooner. Since putting their relationship on pause, Bieber, 24, has been spotted spending time with Baskin Champion.

The bride-to-be's beagle was seen living his best life yesterday, peeking out the window while hitching a ride with her Majesty. (They're carpool buddies now. No big deal.)  We haven't even seen Meghan alone in a car with the sovereign, but here's Guy, four legged and all, riding in the back seat with the Queen.    A friend kindly alerted me to a very sweet moment we missed yesterday - the Queen travelling with Meghan's beagle guy spotted by the talented Lainey Gossip https://madaboutmeghan.blogspot.con/2018/05/live-blog-day-before-wedding.html pic.twitter.com/zpQbtg8YeQ — Mad About Meghan (@MadAboutMeghan) May 18, 2018  Much like his mom, Guy has been on an pretty incredible journey over the past few years. Before Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was going to be put down by a shelter in Kentucky after he was discovered in the woods but no one wanted to take him home, according to The Guardian.  He was then taken in by Dolores Doherty, who runs A Dog's Dream Rescue, an Ontario-based charity that saves beagles on the kill list in the US and brings them to Canada for refuge.  After Guy traveled a 500-mile journey to the border, Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Surely enough, Markle turned out to be one of the hopeful dog owners at the event.    Guy has moved to London with Meghan, a Kensington Palace rep confirmed in November. Markle's other dog, Bogart, couldn't make the trip across the pond due to his old age, The Guardian adds.  Queen Elizabeth II with one of her corgis in 1970 Getty Images  A love of dogs is something Markle shares with her grandmother-in-law, who's known to be very fond of corgis. Just last month, Her Majesty's last corgi, Willow, passed away at the age of 14. Perhaps hanging out with her new four-legged friend, Guy, has helped fill that hole.  Markle also instantly connected with the Queen's dogs, saying they laid happily at her feet during tea when she first met them. “For 33 years, [I’ve been] barked at, and this one walks in, and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails,” Harry recalled in their first interview together.  Here's to hoping Guy carpools with the Queen again to the wedding tomorrow.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,474

815e20e6-6abe-43f4-bcf3-10e41b213ef8,"Emmy Award nomination is always an interesting time of year. This year that is perhaps even more true as The Emmy’s made history when Laverne Cox became the first transgender* actor to receive an Emmy nomination (Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series) for her portrayal of Sophia Burset on the Netflix series Orange is the New Black. This is certainly cause for a celebration – we’re celebrating, celebrate with us.  We’re happy for Laverne Cox despite The ViP team (it’s unanimous) holding the unpopular opinion that Cox’s nomination is more political than earned. We’re here for it! Don’t get us wrong, we just also have to be honest. We don’t feel she beat out other potential candidates on OITNB for this category – not with screen time and not with her performance. You’ll also note that while we love, adore and admire (a couple of us are even obsessed with) Kerry Washington just the same – she didn’t make our list either.  Those aren’t the only changes we made to this year’s Emmy’s nod list. Before we get into what should’ve happened let’s talk about what actually happened.  Orange is the New Black dominated the comedy category and helped offer some color to a very white ballot. The binge-watch favorite earned 12 nominations in all, including a nomination for Best Comedy Series. Uzo Aduba (Suzanne “Crazy Eyes” Warren) and Natasha Lyonne (Nicky Nichols) joined Cox in the Outstanding Guest Actress category (the only category with more than one person of color in it), while Taylor Schilling (Piper Kerman) and Kate Mulgrew (Galina “Red” Reznikov) got nods in Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, respectively.  In the past few years, nominations have crept away from networks and toward cable television, which allows for gritty dramas, edgy comedies and a lower season episode count, which means overall less work for writers and production teams and some network folks aren’t happy about it. Netflix has recently joined cable as an outlet for intense storytelling. Between its critically acclaimed series Orange is the New Black and House of Cards, Netflix garnered a total of 31 nominations, impressive for a network only in its second year at the Emmy’s. Cable provider HBO led the networks with a whopping 99 nominations, including 19 for the top-nominated program Game of Thrones.  Even critics’ staple favorites like CBS’s The Good Wife came away with fewer nominations than expected. While nods were secured for Best Actress category frequenter Julianna Margulies (Alicia Florrick), supporting actor Josh Charles (Will Gardner, whose on-screen death came as one of the biggest television shockers of the season), supporting actress Christine Baranski (Diane Lockhart) and guest actor Dylan Baker (cringe-worthy client Colin Sweeney), the program was noticeably missing from the Best Drama Series category. Also noticeably absent from the list was Fox’s new breakout hit, Sleepy Hollow.  Some traditional network shows, however, managed to make the cut. Shonda Rhimes’ fast-paced fan favorite Scandal came away with a Best Actress nod for Kerry Washington’s Olivia Pope and guest actor nods for Joe Morton (Rowan “Papa” Pope) and Kate Burton (Sally Langston).  While Canada hasn’t seemed to have much luck with the Emmy’s (Orphan Black’s Tatiana Maslany), British programs like Sherlock, Downton Abbey and Luther (Idris Elba’s Best Actor in a Miniseries nomination makes his fourth Emmy nod overall) have all made more than one appearance in this year’s Emmy nominations.  Theater apparently also makes good television, as screen adaptations of the plays The Normal Heart and The Trip Bountiful earned Emmy nods. The Normal Heart, which aired on HBO, dominated the Best Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or Movie category, with Jim Parsons, Joe Mantello, Alfred Molina and Matt Bomer taking up four of the six available spots. Mark Ruffalo and Julia Roberts earned nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress, respectively. Cicely Tyson earned a Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie nod for her work in The Trip Bountiful, impressive since the movie aired on Lifetime, which does not traditionally do well in the Emmy race.  Emmy nominations often belong to a closed group (check the lists for best comedy and drama series’ actors for the past five years — the same names come up a lot). And so often the Emmy’s get it wrong. Actually we couldn’t remember the last time The Emmy’s got it right. So, The Visibility Project staff sat down, brainstormed and got to work on fixing the 2014 Emmy’s nomination list. We’ve done a little bit of category shifting in some places, based on quality of performance and the fact that British shows count as shows and not miniseries in our minds.  As our staff writer, Kylee pointed out during our decision-making process, #wethegods, we’ve fixed the list our way and how we see fit. We stuck to the main categories so we added an honorable mentions list of actors that would definitely make the cut if we’d fixed the full list. Our picks are below – enjoy!  Best Drama Series  House of Cards  Breaking Bad  Sleepy Hollow  The Good Wife  Orphan Black  Best Comedy Series  Orange is the New Black  Modern Family  The Mindy Project  Parks and Recreation  Brooklyn 99  Best Actress in a Comedy Series  Uzo Aduba, Orange is the New Black  Dannielle Brooks, Orange is the New Black  Mindy Kaling, The Mindy Project  Melissa McCarthy, Mike & Molly  Amy Poehler, Parks and Recreation  Samira Wiley, Orange is the New Black  Best Actor in a Comedy Series  Louis CK, Louie  Don Cheadle, House of Lies  Neil Patrick Harris, How I Met Your Mother  William H.

He explained to reporters at the Warriors’ Media Day, “The things that he’s said and the things that he hasn’t said at the right times… we won’t stand for it.

8a9bc5de-90d6-44ed-9b04-6711e7ed07f1,"Kanye West has reportedly settled his $10 million lawsuit against insurance company Lloyd’s of London over canceling his Saint Pablo tour in 2016. The cancellation occurred shortly before the rapper’s subsequent hospitalization for exhaustion.  According to TMZ, the insurance company has agreed to pay the majority of the 40-year-old’s claim. Representatives for the rapper have yet to respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  West originally filed the lawsuit in August of 2017, about eight months after canceling the tour dates, claiming the insurance company had stalled on paying out the “multi-million dollar claim” stemming from the canceled concerts.  According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE at the time, West’s lawyers claimed that the insurers made their client go to great lengths to prove his mental breakdown was legitimate and that they were hunting “for some contrived excuse not to pay.”  “Nor have they provided anything approaching a coherent explanation about why they have not paid, or any indication if they will ever pay or even make a coverage decision, implying that Kanye’s use of marijuana may provide them with a basis to deny the claim and retain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in insurance premiums,” stated West’s team in the filing.

According to Page Six, Lovato was spotted holding hands with Abedini in Disneyland over the weekend, causing fans and media outlets to speculate whether they could be dating.  This is only the latest speculation surrounding Lovato’s love life, as the pop singer has never officially confirmed her sexuality– despite alluding to her being bisexual in her song lyrics.  Here’s what you need to know about Demi Lovato’s sexuality:  1. Fans Have Supported the Rumors Involving Lauren Abedini  good morning to demi lovato and her possible girlfriend and no one else pic.twitter.com/ZrDKzhVBBD — kenny (@broadwaysdarlin) September 11, 2017  While there’s yet to be any confirmation from Lovato or Abedini’s representatives as to whether they’re dating, fans on social media have been eager to voice their support.  “Demi Lovato spotted with her rumored new girlfriend Lauren Abedini; a DJ, Producer, charity runner, and feminist!” wrote the Lovato fan account Demipedia. Another humorously tweeted”The good news is that Demi Lovato has a girlfriend.

The bad news is that it isn't me. — ste(screeching into the wilderness)ph (@stphfrndz) September 11, 2017  2. She’s Had Relationships With Several Male Celebrities  Lovato, like most notable celebrities, have dated other people in the industry. According to Pop Sugar, she dated The Cab frontman Alex DeLeon from 2008-09, and later based the breakup song “Catch Me” on him. Lovato also had brief flings with Trace Cyrus (Miley’s older brother) in 2009 and Joe Jonas, her self-proclaimed “BFF,” in 2010.  Her most notable relationship to date, however, has been with Valderrama, whom she dated from from 2010 to 2016. In an interview with Latina magazine, Lovato discussed what attracted her to the That 70’s Show actor:  When I dated white guys, it wasn’t as passionate as my relationship with Wilmer. Maybe that’s just Wilmer. But I do believe that Latin people are just more expressive, more passionate with their emotions. He’s very manly, and he can be stubborn like Latino men can, but he’s protective and he cares so much and loves so hard. I’ve been blessed enough to have him in my life, and not just as my man, but also my best friend.  Since her breakup from Valderrama, Lovato’s been seen with MMA fighter Guilherme “Bomba” Vasconcelos and Abedini.  3. Ruby Rose Claims that She & Lovato ‘Hooked Up’ in 2013  In 2013, model and actress Ruby Rose turned heads when she tweeted that she had a lesbian tryst with Lovato. “I’m like the one person demi has slept with that didn’t sell on naked photos of her so eff off,” Rose tweeted out. She went on to say “Think ill take a few days off social media whilst @ddlovato’s friends attack me for being a ‘scorned ex-lover’ get over it! I liked the hair.”  Furthermore, a source for Life & Style said that Rose and Lovato dated for two years while the singer took a break from her relationship with Valderrama.  A post shared by Ruby Rose (@rubyrose) on Aug 13, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT  Lovato addressed these claims in a 2015 interview with Complex magazine. “Rumours are rumours, and people are going to spread them,” she said. “You can believe what you want, but no, I was not in a relationship with her. By the way, love is fluid.”  The singer added “Whether there’s been rumours with one specific person or not, that’s all that matters. Humans are humans, and when you connect with somebody on a spiritual level it doesn’t matter. I don’t want people to ever look at the past or rumours or anything and try to figure me out.”  4. She Won the GLAAD Vanguard Award for Promoting LGBTQ Equality  While Lovato may be keeping her personal life under wraps, she has made no effort to hide her support for the LGBTQ community. The singer has been so supportive, in fact, that she was given the GLAAD Vanguard Award in 2016, which, according to the GLAAD website, is “presented to media professionals who have made a significant difference in promoting equality and acceptance.”  The award was given to her by close friend and former Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas. “Demi Lovato has consistently used her platform as a successful artist to send messages of acceptance and support to LGBT people everywhere,” said GLAAD President & CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “She is an extraordinary ally who is committed to helping young people embrace who they are and live the lives they love.”  During her acceptance speech, Lovato said “You should always love yourself for who you are,” she said. “The skin that you are in, whether you identify with it and are afraid to tell people, just go for it. You can do it!” Watch the full speech above.  5. She Said She’s Not ‘Denying’ or ‘Confirming’ Her Sexuality  Lovato’s 2015 single “Cool for the Summer” had many fans wondering whether or not this was her coy way of speaking on her sexuality.  The lyrics “Tell me what you want, what you like, it’s ok / I’m a little curious, too” and “Got a taste for the cherry / I just need to take a bite” were taken as an admission that she had at least experimented with women in the past.  In an interview with British late-night host Alan Carr, Lovato continued to play coy about her lyrics. “I’m not confirming and I’m definitely not denying,” she quipped with a smile.  “All of my songs are based off of personal experiences. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with experimentation at all.” Carr joked that he “experimented once and it stuck,” leading Lovato to retort:”Hey, I didn’t say it didn’t stick either.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1359

Six women are suing Weinstein and what they call the “Weinstein Sexual Enterprise”, which they say includes his brother Bob and their co-founded studio The Weinstein Company, claiming they conspired to conceal Weinstein’s widespread alleged sexual harassment.  The plaintiffs argue that, due to the scale of sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, the producer’s “sexual enterprise” should be considered an organised crime group.  Lawyers for the Hollywood mogul filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Tuesday, arguing that it was “fatally overboard”, and would apply to “all women who ever met with Weinstein, regardless of whether they claimed to have suffered any identifiable harm”.  They pointed to Lawrence saying in a previous interview that Weinstein “had only ever been nice to me”, although they did not mention her adding: “Except for the moments that he wasn’t, and then I called him an asshole.”  Both Streep and Lawrence have spoken out against the motion filed by Weinstein’s lawyers, and the producer has since apologised.

Composite: BBC  A spokeswoman for Weinstein said: “Even though Mr Weinstein has worked with hundreds of actresses and actors who had only professional and mutually respectful experiences with him, Mr Weinstein has directed in the future that no specific names be used by his counsel, even where those actors have made previous public statements about him.  “Mr Weinstein acknowledges the valuable input both Meryl Streep and Jennifer Lawrence have contributed to this conversation and apologises.  “Once again, moving forward, Mr Weinstein has advised his counsel to not include specific names of former associates; and to avoid whenever possible, even if they are in the public record.”  In response to the motion, Lawrence described Weinstein as a “predator”.    “For the record, while I was not victimised personally by Harvey Weinstein, I stand behind the women who have survived his terrible abuse and I applaud them in using all means necessary to bring him to justice whether through criminal or civil actions. Time’s up,” she added in a statement.  Her comment follows Streep firing back at Weinstein, who said the action was “pathetic and exploitative” after his lawyers cited her saying she was never harassed by the producer in an attempt to shut the case down.  Lawyers Phyllis Kupferstein and Mary E Flynn wrote that this would include actresses such as Streep and Lawrence who have not made allegations of sexual misconduct.    They pointed to Streep saying Weinstein had always been respectful with her during their collaborations in a statement to the press.    They did not mention that Streep also praised the “heroes” who made allegations about his behaviour, which she said was “inexcusable” and an “abuse of power”.    Weinstein’s lawyers also tried to undermine the lawsuit’s claims by saying Gwyneth Paltrow went on to work with him again after he allegedly harassed her.    The original lawsuit argued the statute of limitations on the allegations does not apply because the alleged victims were under duress not to make the claims earlier.    Weinstein, 65, has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by dozens of women. He denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,653

382a12ac-8704-42be-8ad9-6cec16b9a3e9,"Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image — in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's — will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution — was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing.""In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,896

e1800cee-e0f7-46d5-9e45-2886907591f6,"The actress alleges she was nixed for a role in 'Lord of the Rings' after she rebuffed Weinstein.  A California federal judge on Wednesday has decided that Ashley Judd can move forward in her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein. However, she will only be able to proceed on defamation and tortious interference claims. A sexual harassment claim has been rejected in the first iteration of the lawsuit.  The actress alleges in her complaint that she became Weinstein's victim when the movie mogul made demands on her in a hotel room about 20 years ago. Judd says that she only escaped after relenting to a deal where she would let him touch her if she won an Academy Award. Later, Judd says she was in serious discussions for a big role in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but that opportunity was torpedoed after Weinstein or someone at Miramax told the director that she was a ""nightmare"" to work with.  In a ruling on Wednesday, one day after hearing oral arguments on Weinstein's motion to dismiss, U.S. District Court Judge Philip Gutierrez examined whether Judd had brought a timely lawsuit or whether her claims were barred by statute of limitations.  The actress said she only learned that she was nixed for a role in Lord of the Rings after Jackson recounted what happened in a December 2017 interview. Although Weinstein argued she had a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation, she responded that it was unlikely that a powerful producer and film distributor would reveal something in confidence and disrupt the relationship.  The judge writes that Judd need only raise a plausible inference at this stage that she would have been unable to learn of Weinstein's statements about her to Jackson.  ""At this point, no evidence has been presented about whether it is common in the industry for actors to inquire into why they were not cast, and further, no evidence has been presented as to whether Jackson and Walsh would have informed Plaintiff about Defendant’s statements had she asked them why she was not given a role in the Lord of the Rings films,"" states the order (read here). ""Taking Plaintiff’s allegations as true — as the Court must at this stage — the Court concludes that she has raised a plausible inference that she would not have been able to learn about Defendant’s statements during the limitations period, even if she had conducted a diligent investigation.""  The judge also rules that Judd had adequately pled a defamation claim. Weinstein attempted to argue that if he stated that he had ""bad experiences"" with Judd, this amounted to a non-actionable opinion.  Judd ""argues that she can prove these statements false because Defendant had no previous professional interaction with her and her short two-day experience working on the Miramax film Smoke (where she alleges that she did not interact with Defendant) was uniformly positive,"" writes the judge. ""The Court agrees with Plaintiff.""  As for Judd's sexual harassment claim, the judge writes that he is skeptical that the statute being invoked (California Civil Code Section 51.9) ""can ever properly be applied to a relationship between a potential employer and a prospective employee.""  However, Gutierrez doesn't make a firm determination on whether a claim of this nature would ever fly. Instead, he looks at Judd's description of her single meeting with Weinstein to ostensibly discuss potential roles in films and finds this doesn't fit the type of relationship of someone providing professional services on an ongoing basis — something that would actually be susceptible to sexual harassment in the workplace.  ""[Judd] argues that the statute was intended to cover harassment in 'power relationships,' but the statute does not use that term,"" writes the judge, later adding, ""A prospective employee usually either gets the job after an interview or series of interviews (and then becomes covered under sexual harassment laws applicable to employment relationships), or does not get the job, in which case the relationship ends. The temporary nature of a prospective employment relationship is qualitatively different than the often-more-permanent relationships common with the categories of individuals explicitly listed in the statute.""  Judd tried to position Weinstein's behavior as similar to sexual harassment perpetrated by attorneys, physicians, and teachers — occupations referenced in the code as examples — but the judge says that she hasn't alleged the same kind of professional responsibilities on Weinstein's part.  Gutierrez does note that the law isn't settled on this point. If this issue eventually gets to an appeal, it could become an important and closely watched one in the #MeToo era.  Judd will have an opportunity to file an amended complaint to try again with her sexual harassment claim.  Update:  Theodore Boutrous Jr., attorney for Judd, commented: ""We are very pleased that today the District Court held that Ashley Judd can proceed with her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and continue her effort to vindicate the wrongs he committed against her among so many other women. We are also pleased that the court gave us an opportunity to amend our complaint and present additional facts related to one of Ms. Judd's claims. We will move forward immediately with discovery, including Mr. Weinstein's deposition, and look forward to proving to a jury at trial that Mr. Weinstein defamed Ms. Judd, interfered with her ability to earn a living, and engaged in unlawful business practices. The law should not tolerate this abuse of power to damage another's career.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1022

605008d7-2b13-4776-b0d2-7fe7c6536b9a,"Warning: The following contains spoilers for Thursday’s harrowing Grey’s Anatomy.  Before revealing to Levi and Taryn in Thursday’s Grey’s Anatomy that April was being rushed into the ER, Bailey warned the interns that when they found out who was on the rig, “You’re not gonna lose your minds, you’re gonna hold it together.” Unfortunately, no one gave us that instruction. So I suspect I speak for most of us viewers when I say that, as we watched this singularly upsetting hour of television, we most certainly did lose our minds and did not hold it together. Did Kepner pull through in the end? Keep the tissues handy, and read on…  ‘WE’RE NOT GONNA LOSE HER’ | As the penultimate Season 14 episode began, April was fine, sending out invitations to Jolex’s wedding when her ride honked. “It might be too fancy for me to go to,” joked Jo upon receiving the invite. Meanwhile, Amelia rushed to Owen’s because… Betty was back. And she hadn’t relapsed. She was six days clean. Rather than let the teen out of her sight, she took her to work with her for a consult. At the hospital, Arizona gave Bailey her notice; she was leaving to scrub in at Mount Sinai. The chief was not pleased. Turned out, Amelia’s consult was with Geena Davis’ Herman, who cracked that she and Arizona looked swell before admitting that she was still blind as an earthworm. At the coffee cart, Maggie clarified that she and Jackson were attending the wedding together — sort of their first public outing as a couple. Shortly, Matthew came in on an ambulance — he’d rolled his car and was in rough shape. OK, so now we knew for sure who April’s ride had been. But where was she?!? While Jo revealed that she and Alex had a cake-tasting with Kepner at 11, an ambulance raced back to the scene of Matthew’s accident, Owen in tow. At the site, he spotted April unconscious, her lower extremities apparently chilling in a frigid lake. At that very moment, Mer was back at Grey Sloan asking Jackson if he knew where his ex was. When she received Owen’s text, she elected not to fill in Avery, as he was about to go into surgery. By the time the ambulance arrived at Grey Sloan, Owen reported that April was hypothermic, with no pulse and no vitals, and an EMT added that they had no way of knowing how long she’d been down. “I think we lost her,” said another EMT. “No, we didn’t,” replied her friends almost in unison.  While Mer paged Maggie, Bailey explained to the interns that they had to raise April’s temperature before they could try to jump-start her heart. The team accomplished that by working to pump blood through her body manually. An hour later, with Mer and Maggie still at it, Pierce urged her half sister to tell Jackson. When she ran into Alex in the corridor and he mentioned his appointment with April, Mer burst into tears. (She wasn’t the only one!) In the O.R., as docs took turns pumping blood through Kepner, Alex admitted that he’d hated her at first, because he’d wanted to be more like her. Nurturing, caring, all that good stuff, she just was naturally. “You gotta stop saying ‘was,'” Mer told him. Nearby, Richard operated on Matthew, whose spleen wasn’t looking so good. To feel like she was doing something, anything, Bailey pitched in. “This boy must be cursed,” Webber sighed. He might be onto something there, too. Jackson was fresh out of surgery and informing Jo that he was basically broke when he overheard Casey say they needed all the blood to save Kepner’s life. Not the way he should’ve found out.  ‘DON’T TAKE APRIL, PLEASE’ | Bursting into the O.R., Avery learned that April had been there for three hours. Nothing to do but wait. “And pray,” said Owen, asking everyone to do what April would’ve wanted and pray for her. From there, the group waited to see any sign of a heartbeat in April, and Maggie, eventually convinced that she had, began using the EKG paddles on her over and over. Finally, Pierce actually did get a rhythm, and they — and we — breathed a huge sigh of relief. In recovery, Matthew came to and immediately asked about April. At that very moment, Amelia was noting that Kepner’s brainwaves were slow and irregular. As soon as Arizona found out what had happened, she rushed into her friend’s room and explained that April and Matthew had been seeing each other again for months. They’d even fallen back in love. Soon, Ben arrived and was welcomed with a huge hug by Bailey. Overnight, it appeared, April’s friends sat at her bedside. At this point, to my relief, I was thinking, “OK, she’s gonna pull through!” But then it seemed for an awful instant like she was basically brain-dead. Tearfully, Jackson told April that he didn’t just want to believe she was still there, he would believe it. “I’ll do whatever you want,” he then told God. “Don’t take her away, OK?” And at that second, she squeezed his hand — ever so gently — and opened her eyes. Lord, what an emotional roller coaster! As Amelia reported that April’s reflexes were good, Kepner related that she remembered calling 911, feeling warmer and warmer and safer… “And then I was here,” she said, delighting in pointing out to Jackson that “you prayed for me, and it worked.” She quickly added that she hadn’t died and come back — that was Jesus’ jam. Before they all left her to get some rest, April thanked Owen. “You always come and bring me back,” she said. Later, April thanked Maggie, too, for saving her life, and at last she was reunited with Matthew.  ‘SO YOU DID BRAIN SURGERY WHILE YOU NEEDED BRAIN SURGERY?’ | During Amelia’s consult on Nicole’s case, Grey Sloan’s former Head of Fetal Surgery complained of headaches and dizziness. She also revealed to Arizona that she’d been keeping tabs on her career and was eager to catch up. Ticked at having been abandoned by her teacher, blind or not, Robbins didn’t appear quite so keen to. When Arizona revealed to Herman that she was going back into peds and leaving behind fetal surgery, her former mentor balked that that was unacceptable. After Nicole’s scan, she ordered Arizona not to even consider quitting fetal surgery. “After blind school, I hit a rough patch,” Nicole said by way of explaining why she’d ghosted Robbins. “I went very, very dark.” But hearing what Arizona had been up to had excited her — Herman had succeeded in downloading into Robbins her whole brain! It made her realize that she could teach and create a whole lot more Arizonas. And “that saved my life,” she said. At the same time, Amelia feared that Nicole’s tumor was back, but she just couldn’t find it, damn it. If the tumor was back, Amelia resolved, she was telling Herman that she’d had a tumor when she operated on Nicole. During a spinal tap on Herman, Arizona and DeLuca learned that Nicole didn’t have a tumor. When Amelia then tried to refer Nicole to Koracick to have her shunt put in, Herman revealed that she’d overheard — while in Tom’s bed! — all about her former doc’s huge, honking tumor. Left alone with Arizona, Herman told her that she’d just gotten a grant and wanted to move forward with the Robbins Herman Center for Women’s Health and launch Arizona’s cart program. “Could we do it in New York?” Robbins said. “We could do it wherever you want,” Nicole replied before asking Arizona to warn her the next time she’s lunging in for an embrace.  ‘IT’S GONNA BE SO BEAUTIFUL’ | As the episode came to a close, Betty confessed to Amelia that she hadn’t really been clean for six days and had been too high to miss her son. She’d only come home because she’d been cold. Not surprised, Amelia took her straight to a meeting. When Jackson passed by the chapel on his way out of the hospital with Harriet, he couldn’t help but stop in to say a silent thank you. At home in bed with a snoozing Ben, Bailey appeared to be mulling something over, something big. Jolex looked forward to their wedding; Mer, realizing how lucky she was to have once pulled through a trauma that had been chillingly similar to April’s, took a sweet gaze at Derek’s Post-It wedding vows before placing his cap on top of them in her drawer; and Kepner and Matthew recovered with their hospital beds pushed up against one another.  So, how did you handle “Cold as Ice”? Relieved much? And since April survived, what do you make of Ellen Pompeo’s remark that the finale is “not easy”?

Australia recently published an issue with the headline ""Kim & Kanye: It’s Finally Over! Divorce Papers Signed!"" The cover even showed documents, claiming they proved the divorce. But one never happened.  In fact, the documents on the cover are actually from Kardashian's 2004 divorce from her first husband, Damon Thomas. They are in the public record, so the documents can be easily obtained on the web.  The content in the report is exactly the same as what appeared in In Touch Weekly.That issue included a supposed quote from Kardashian, ""Kanye's not the man I fell in love with."" The cover also claimed West broke down in tears and Kardashian took their three children to live with her mother, Kris Jenner.  At the time the two reports were published, both OK! Australia and In Touch were owned by the same company, Bauer Media. As of July 1, In Touch is owned by American Media Inc., the publisher of Us Weekly, Radar Online and the National Enquirer.  In Touch claimed that Kardashian was pushed ""over the edge"" after they went to Paris in June. A source told the magazine Kardashian was upset after seeing West hug Virgil Abloh at the Louis Vuitton fashion show. But if Kardashian was upset, she did not show it publicly. In fact, she retweeted a video of the scene, adding a heart emoji.  The trip was emotional for Kardashian, since it marked her first time in Paris since she was robbed there in October 2016.  The tabloid report also claims Kardashian told her family she was leaving West after his infamous remarks about slavery to TMZ and his tweets. In reality, Kardashian publicly supported her husband. Later, West did admit he thought Kardashian would leave him.  ""There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, 'Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?'"" he told The New York Times last month. ""So that was a real conversation.""  West also referred to Kardashian's decision to stick by him in his son ""Wouldn't Leave,"" in which he raps, “Told her she could leave me now/But she wouldn’t leave.”  West and Kardashian have been married since 2014 and share three children, 5-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint and 6-month-old Chicago.

Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”“And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”“Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something.

I am just a better version of me than I was 10 years ago,” Hilton said in a video posted on his website Monday. “Do I still have work to do? Can I still be even better? Fuck yeah, but I am not that person in the past. And if you’re trying to keep me in the prison that is the past, then fuck you!”  Hilton then said, “So, actually this video is for Jennifer Lawrence, to say ‘fuck you’! And I’m going to get in trouble for that, but I don’t give a shit.”  See photos: Party Report in Pictures: Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon, Jon Stewart and SNL’s Week Off  As TheWrap previously reported, the Oscar-winning actress scolded Hilton in the November issue of Vanity Fair for posting — and then removing — nude photos of her that emerged in August as part of the massive celebrity photo hack. Kate Upton, Kaley Cuoco and Meagan Good were also targeted.  “He took it down because people got pissed, and that’s the only reason why,” Lawrence said. “And then I had to watch his apology. And what he basically said was ‘I just didn’t think about it’ … ‘I just didn’t think about it’ is not an excuse. That is the exact issue itself.”  But Hilton, whose real name is Mario Lavandeira, wasn’t happy with her characterization of his previous apology.  Also read: Jennifer Lawrence Slams Gossip Blogger Perez Hilton for Posting Her Nude Photos  “She mentions how she was forced to watch the video I made right after her naked photos surfaced online. In that video, I apologized to her sincerely from my heart,” he said in Monday’s video. “And I did so more than once. And I was tempted to apologize to her again, but you know what … No. Fuck that. Life isn’t always what you want. And you don’t always get what you ask for,” Hilton said.  “That video that I made and me explaining my thought process was real, it was sincere, and it wasn’t some bullshit made up excuse.”  He wasn’t finished. After dropping those aforementioned f-bombs, Hilton then called Lawrence out for bringing up his past. And he also strangely brought up actor Robert Downey Jr.  Also read: Meagan Good Rips Fans for Reposting Her Leaked Nude Photos: ‘You Should Be Ashamed’  “When you think about Robert Downey Jr. , you don’t think ‘oh, he’s a drug addict’ or ‘a recovering drug addict.’ You think about that actor that you truly love,” he said.  But eventually Hilton changed his tune and said sorry.  “You were extremely hurt. I contributed to that. I genuinely am sorry,” he said. “I hope that you can look inside my brain and see that I truly, truly did not pre-meditatively, purposely decide to hurt you.

d576a02c-806b-4205-900d-54ac09e01c4e,"On March 24, 2018, one month and ten days after the February 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, student-led pro-gun control “March For Our Lives” demonstrations took place across America, including in Washington, D.C.The word “Our” in March For Our Lives refers to students.From Wikipedia:March For Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.A source of European researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D.C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.Dammegard’s source received the following email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department and forwarded it to Dammegard:Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event. If your are requesting additional information reference this event, please follow the below steps to file your Freedom of Information Act request: https://foia-dc.gov/App/Index.aspx If your have any additional question sor concerns, please feel free in contacting me directly.

Here’s a screenshot I took from page 6 of the 65-page document:Here are some facts:The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018. A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD , which had not existed before February 15 . The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration “ several months prior to the actual event”.Questions:How can Never Again MSD apply for a permit “several months” BEFORE the group had even been formed? How can an application be made for a permit for a “March For Our Lives” demonstration “several months” BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration?See also:UPDATE (March 31, 2018):There are claims that the email from Officer Earhardt is bogus, and that there’s a permit application for March For Our Lives in D.C. which is dated February 20, 2018, but which is an application to the National Park Service, not Metro PD. See “The curious ever-changing dates of March For Our Lives permit application“.I, therefore, asked Professor James Fetzer for the original Earhardt email. Fetzer had obtained the screenshot of the email from Ole Dammegard, whose friend was the person who originally contacted Officer Earhardt about the permit.I just received an email from Mr. Dammegard, with an attachment of the original Earhardt email, indicating the date on which the email was sent to Dammegard’s friend who, understandably, prefers to remain anonymous.I find the above email from Officer Earhardt to be credible. I also have confidence in the integrity of Professor Fetzer and Mr. Dammegard, neither of whom profits from counterfeiting the email — which is something we can’t say about those people who instigate false-flag mass-shooting incidents like Parkland.In the meantime, Professor Fetzer had placed a phone call to Officer Earhardt to confirm the latter’s email. When we hear from Officer Earhardt, I will update this post with that information.Update (April 5, 2018):Officer Earhardt has given 4 different dates for when Metro PD received the permit application.

Ten people were killed and 10 more wounded after a 17-year-old carrying a shotgun and revolver opened fire at the high school about 30 miles from downtown Houston.  According to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, nine of the victims were students. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools.""  According to police officials, the 17-year-old is in custody and has been charged with capital murder and a second person has been detained.  Shortly after the shooting, Watt tweeted, ""Absolutely horrific.""  Watt has been active in the surrounding community since he was drafted by Houston in 2011. Most notably, he started a fundraiser last August that raised more than $37 million for those affected by the flooding from Hurricane Harvey.  The Texans also released a statement.

076191b8-8443-419f-8006-95039fe33b86,"The brand new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres on Sunday, and it looks like it is going to be tense between the sisters. Especially, Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian.  According to an August 1 report by People Magazine, a brand new sneak peek was released of the upcoming season, and it appears that Kim and Kourtney will be at each other’s throats.  In the clip, Kim Kardashian is trying to set up a photo shoot and is having a hard time moving things around to fit it into her very busy schedule. Meanwhile, Kourtney is complaining that she needs to be out of the shoot by four o’clock, which is making her younger sister increasingly angry.  The girls’ mother, Kris Jenner, enters the picture and tries to calm tensions by telling Kourtney to “be nice.” However, she doesn’t help matters. The sisters begin screaming at one another.  “If I’m out by four [o’clock], that’s all I need. If [I get there] and no one’s ready, and I’m, like, lingering around, I’m leaving at 4 p.m., and I don’t care what anyone says,” Kourtney Kardashian states in the clip.  When Kim Kardashian tells her sister that she is supposed to having a meeting and can only schedule it for 7 a.m., Kourtney tells her to reschedule the meeting in an unsympathetic way. This is the straw that breaks the camel’s back, and Kim gets fed up.  “No one wants you in the f—ing shoot. Get the f— out of here and go. … We don’t want you in the shoot,” Kim tells her sister. Kourtney replies that she has no interest in doing the photo shoot anyway, and Kim says, “Good, ’cause you’re so f—ing annoying.”  Kris Jenner takes Kim Kardashian’s side in the argument, telling her oldest daughter that she is being “annoying” and that she has a way of “rubbing people the wrong way.”  Kim then throws the fact that she has the busier schedule and career in Kourtney’s face, saying that she doesn’t have a business to run, so she could never understand how hard it is for her to schedule multiple things.  “Maybe if you had a f—ing business that you were passionate about … but you don’t, so don’t even act like you know what I’m talking about.” At this point, Kourtney Kardashian gets up and leaves the room to gather her things.  Kim Kardashian then goes for the final blow, saying that Kourtney Kardashian doesn’t need to be in the photo shoot anyway, because she’s the “least exciting to look at.”  “I need Kourtney to not be so f—ing annoying with a stick up her a— like she f—ing runs this s—, because she doesn’t.

eb528336-0acf-406b-bc0d-5305318faf78,"When you get the chance to make a Star Wars film and have been a fan of the saga your whole life, it's hard to pass up an opportunity to appear on screen . The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson might not have appeared in his film in an immediately recognizable capacity, but confirmed on the film's commentary track that he grasps Han Solo's golden dice from the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in a close-up shot.  After clashing with Rey on Ahch-To, Luke Skywalker boards the Falcon in an emotional scene, reflecting on his former ally Han Solo having been killed by Kylo Ren. Upon discovering the dice, Luke takes them from where they hung on the ship and pockets them, ultimately handing them over to his sister Leia in the film's final act.  Actor Mark Hamill filmed a majority of this scene, yet Johnson couldn't help but take advantage of the opportunity to lend his own talents to the film by sporting a glove to clutch the dice in the quick shot.  This is Johnson's second appearance in the Star Wars saga, as he was also a Death Star gunner in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The filmmaker returned the favor to Rogue One director Gareth Edwards, who made an appearance as a Resistance trooper during the battle of Crait .  Johnson managed to sneak in quite a few cameos in The Last Jedi, with some being more obvious than others. Actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Noah Segan, who have appeared in all of Johnson's films, both made brief appearances, with Gordon-Levitt lending just his voice to an alien character while Segan played a Resistance pilot.  Tom Hardy, Take That singer Gary Barlow, and Princes Harry and William all shared a scene together where they played Stormtroopers, yet the scene was reportedly absent from the final cut.  Star Wars fans may have recognized saga staple Warwick Davis' voice during the Canto Bight scene, as the actor voiced one of the aliens in the casino. Even Mark Hamill earned an additional role, providing the vocalizations for the alien who attempts to put coins in BB-8.  You can get The Last Jedi on Digital HD now and on Blu-ray March 27th.

89e4d6d0-34c0-402e-af5d-30220a72dc58,"Meghan Markle experienced a roller coaster this week as the newlywed continued to navigate her new life with Prince Harry in the British Royal Family.  Recently, the Inquisitr reported that Meghan Markle took over a royal duty for Queen Elizabeth II later this year when the Queen will step back from responsibilities in the Queen’s Young Leaders program, and Markle will join her husband, Prince Harry in welcoming the young leaders in the program to Buckingham Palace.  Earlier this week, according to an Express report, the 36-year-old Duchess of Sussex joined the Duke of Sussex and the Queen at Buckingham Palace for the Queen’s Young Leader Awards. Markle hit the ground running with her royal engagements after her mid-May royal wedding, and by the looks of their fun giggles at recent events, she and Queen Elizabeth II get along famously.  However, the major faux pas that the new Duchess committed at the Queen’s Young Leader awards that made headlines was her crossing her legs over her knees instead of using the so-called “Duchess Slant,” which involves crossing her legs at the ankles instead of the knees. If that wasn’t enough, though, now another supposed break in royal protocol has come to light. Markle attempted to reach for Prince Harry’s hand as they walked behind the Queen.  null  In a video of the event, Markle, who wore a beautiful Prada dress in pale pink with her hair softly down around her shoulders, reached out to take her new husband’s hand. Instead of taking the Duchess’s hand, the Duke actually pulled his arms in closer to his sides and clasped them in front of him. After the rebuff, the two continued to walk on as if nothing out of the ordinary occurred.  Indeed, as a newlywed, it makes sense to reach out to hold hands when walking especially in stressful situations, but for some reason, the Royal Family does not do that very often. The Queen herself rarely holds her husband, Prince Philip’s, hand during official public engagements, and that seems to set the tone for the family as a whole in their interactions with the public.  Although Prince Harry and Meghan Markle often hold hands, they may not be participating in official royal family engagements when they do so. The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex appear quite affectionate towards each other in their body language. Every move Markle makes right now receives an incredible amount of scrutiny, and this hand-holding rebuff merely is one more of those profoundly analyzed details.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,478
9f8ed898-ae20-4b32-9b43-3e3de3c92714,"Justin Bieber put Hollywood Life on public blast on Friday. The superstar took to Instagram to slam the gossip blog for a false story it published about him and former girlfriend Selena Gomez.  Singling out just one of the numerous, fabricated Jelena claims the website has made up over the years, Bieber called out a story the blog posted on Thursday, May 28 headlined, “Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez: Why Their Church Believes They Should Be Together.”  “Hollywood Life is the most outrageous fake weird non factual garbage website I’ve ever seen,” the 21-year-old ripped on Instagram, alongside a screenshot of the headline.  Explaining why he finally spoke up, Bieber went on, “They literally make up whatever they want and usually I don’t care, but this one is so ridiculous I had to say something. Don’t go to their website and give them any traffic.”  The heartthrob subsequently deleted his Instagram posting, but not before it was picked up by media outlets and commended by his fans.  What’s more insane is how much other outlets quotes their fanfics as facts https://t.co/4vBBbjmDu9 — Anzi (@JustinK007) May 29, 2015  The fake jelena stories are the worst… when they decided to drag the church into it, he had enough — banjokofolake (@banjokofolake) May 29, 2015  Finally he said it…suck on that @HollywoodLife. — JustinBieberCrew.com (@JBCrewdotcom) May 29, 2015  If i ever see a RT on my TL from @HollywoodLife you’re getting automatically blocked i don’t want to see any of their nonsense anymore. — Irene (@Tanziirene) May 29, 2015  selena stans need to chill. he wasn’t being mean to her at all. he’s defending their church, which is important not only to him but her too — Laura (@PraiseNDream) May 29, 2015  In typical Hollywood Life fashion, the blog exploited Bieber and Gomez’s Internet-igniting, joint appearance in a Snapchat story posted by Pastor Rich Wilkerson Jr. from a church-related meet in Los Angeles on Wednesday, (May 27). The pair were also reportedly seen at Hillsong Church in Los Angeles on May 24.  Among the claims Bieber found so “ridiculous” in the site’s subsequent report was a quote from a so-called “source” which alleged, “[Justin and Selena’s] pastors are pretty much all married and they married very young. They are very pro-marriage and pro-family and the feeling in that group is that Justin and Selena belong together.”  The imaginary insider went on, “Justin has said many many times that he believes Selena is his soul mate, and that isn’t something his pastors take lightly. (sic)”  The site also alleged that Selena’s friend Taylor Swift was miffed over Bieber and Gomez hanging out. It’s claimed that “once she [Swift] heard about Selena being with Justin again, she just shook her head and was very disappointed.”  The watchdog website Gossip Cop has since confirmed Swift made no such comment. In addition, both E! News and TMZ reported Bieber and Gomez are not remotely considering reuniting and ran into each other unexpectedly at Wilkerson’s gathering.  “They are definitely not back together whatsoever,” an insider told E! “Definitely not.” The source added that the duo were “cordial and friendly to each other,” and that, “for the first time, it wasn’t awkward. It was harmless.”  Before Bieber deleted his riot act Instagram, fans noticed Ariana Grande was among the thousands who left a comment. The songstress wrote, “yaaaaasss justin yaaaaasss.”  In so doing, Grande joins an ever-expanding list of celebrities who have publicly criticized Hollywood Life for fabricating reports. That list includes Gomez, who previously stated that the site’s stories about her were “never true.” Austin Mahone angry-tweeted the site after it reported a false story about his breakup with Fifth Harmony’s Camila Cabello.  More recently, Hailey Baldwin slammed the site as “absolutely disgusting” after it claimed that she, Bieber, and mutual pal Kendall Jenner, are involved in a sexual love triangle.  Hey @HollywoodLife I think u guys are absolutely disgusting. U should really learn to leave teenagers be and stop writing so much garbage. — Hailey Baldwin (@haileybaldwin) May 13, 2015  Considering the disgraced Hollywood Life topped Gossip Cop’s “Worst Outlet in Celebrity Journalism” report last November, and has just been shamed again by the watchdog site for falsely claiming Bieber recently contacted Gomez about recording a new duet — only one question remains:  Why is any media outlet of repute still citing Hollywood Life as a credible source? Is it at all likely that this repeatedly exposed clickbait-chaser has access to insiders close enough to Bieber and Gomez to back up its risible, 24/7 “Exclusives!”?  Update: Tellingly, the story in question has since been taken down from Hollywood Life’s website since Bieber’s “final straw” statement. Whether the blog intends to remove the rest of its extensive Jelena content remains to be seen.

At the time, the source also told the magazine, ""Roque will receive the [family's] horse farm, their current residence and a one-time payment of $25 million.""  Earlier this month, Lauer was spotted paddleboarding in Sag Harbor at a charity event, just days before news broke that he had sold his Upper East Side apartment for above its $7.35 million asking price.  According to Variety, which first shared news of the sale, Lauer bought the property in August of 2004 for ""a smidgen more than $5.882 million.""    July  In July, Lauer broke his silence in an interview with Radio New Zealand about the ongoing battle over public access to the 16,000-acre, $9.2-million ranch there for which he purchased a lease last year. Known as Hunter Valley Station, the ranch is the only thoroughfare to Hawea Conservation Park.

Lauer told Radio New Zealand that the groups seeking an easement on his property are ""taking advantage of some difficult times I've been through over the past six months"" and added, ""I think they see me as an easy mark.""

He could also head to the farm in New Zealand, which authorities determined he would be allowed to keep after the country launched an investigation into whether he had violated its ""good character"" condition for foreign landowners.  May  Although Lauer has been staying largely silent since the news of his firing broke last fall, the former anchor issued a statement in May in response to a report NBCUniversal released following its internal investigation into the misconduct allegations that cost him his job. In a statement to Variety, Lauer said he was fired after ""admitting to past relationships with co-workers,"" but expressed his disagreement with ""certain aspects"" of the report.    ""There are aspects of the NBC report with which I clearly disagree. However, I spent 25 wonderful years at the network, 20 of those at Today, and I’m extremely proud of what we accomplished as a team. On November 29, 2017, I was terminated by NBC after admitting to past relationships with co-workers. A day later I took responsibility for those relationships, apologized to the people I hurt and promised to begin the process of repairing the damage I had caused my family,"" Lauer said.

Curry said that in 2012, a female staffer confided she had been ""sexually harassed physically"" by Lauer. ""A woman approached me and asked me tearfully if I could help her,"" Curry told the Post.

Lauer and Curry reportedly had a rocky relationship (""I can't believe I am sitting next to this woman,"" he once told an assistant, according to New York magazine), and her tearful sign-off from the show in 2012 included a particularly awkward kiss from Lauer.    Lauer's Relationship with his Today Colleagues  Lauer's replacement on the show, Hoda Kotb, seems to have a friendlier relationship with the former anchor though.

68d96b4e-6016-45f8-bd88-21c3d7d5920c,"There are reports that Taylor Swiftis trying to rekindle her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jake Gyllenhaal. OK! Magazine is reporting that the ""Wildest Dreams"" singer has been contacting her ex ever since he has been in New York City starring in the Broadway show called Sunday in the Park With George.  The tabloid is reporting that a source is saying that Taylor is the one reaching out to the actor since she feels she is now more mature than she was when they dated back in 2010.  The source said, “Taylor was so young when they dated, she wasn’t ready for a serious relationship, but now she’s showing Jake how much she’s matured. She’s excited to see where things go.”  In 2015, a rumor swirled around saying that the stars were in contact with each other, even though she was dating Calvin Harris at the time.  An unidentified source told Star magazine that, “He said he owed Taylor an apology for how things ended between them. In June, Jake ran into Cara Delevingne at The Graham Norton Show and asked for Taylor’s new number. They’ve kept in touch, albeit secretly, ever since.""  This would all be so ironic since Taylor allegedly wrote the hit song ""We Are Never Getting Back Together"" from her Red album about the relationship after her ex's friend asked her if they were giving their relationship a second chance.  “This guy walks in who is a friend of my ex’s and starts talking about how he’s heard we’re going to get back together. And that was not the case. So I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break-up, get back together — just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, ‘This is what we’re writing,’” she once revealed to GMA.  The lyrics in the track said: ""I'm really gonna miss you picking fights / And me falling for it screaming that I'm right / And you would hide away and find your peace of mind / With some indie record that's much cooler than mine.""  In the video for the song, the actor who plays the singer's love interest gives her a scarf which many thought to be a clue that revealed the song was about Jake since she had been photographed wearing one of his scarfs while they were dating.  Since Taylor is now single and so is Jake and they both happen to be living in the same city, we don't see how this could be a problem. There is no confirmation that this is actually happening though and a source close to them told Gossip Cop that there was ""no truth"" to the report.

Caitlyn Jenner has confirmed her youngest daughter, Kylie Jenner, is pregnant. The former athlete, 67, was the first member of the family to formally confirm the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is expecting her first child  Together: Here Kylie is seen with Caitlyn in October 2016 during King Cairo's birthday  A representative for Caitlyn - formerly Bruce - told The Sun when asked how she found out about her daughter's pregnancy: 'All I can tell you is that it was some time ago.'  On Monday Ryan Seacrest, who is a producer on the family's E! reality show, reached out to momager Kris Jenner on air when he was co-hosting Live With Kelly And Ryan from New York City to ask about the beauty's condition. He didn't get a no.  It was during the opening of the morning talk show when Ryan reached for his cell phone and texted the mother of Kylie.  He was hoping she would confirm that Kylie was pregnant. But what he got back, 'Kylie‘s not confirming anything.'  His attempt: On Monday Ryan Seacrest, who is a producer on the family's E! reality show, reached out to momager Kris Jenner via text on air when he was co-hosting Live With Kelly And Ryan from New York City to ask about the beauty's condition  Well, she didn't say no: What he got back was, 'Kylie‘s not confirming anything'; here they are seen on Sunday's KUWTK 10 year anniversary special  But Kylie has shown off her tummy on social media.  Over the weekend she pulled up her shirt and touched her tummy as she posed with her friend Jordyn Woods. It was too difficult to tell if she had a bump or not.  The star was also seen with Travis going to his iHeart Radio performance. Again she wore a baggy T-shirt.

Ryan was seen on Sunday interviewing Kylie for the KUWTK 10 year anniversary special, but the show was taped in the spring, before she likely got pregnant.  The reality star and her rapper boyfriend are said to have broken the happy news to friends earlier this month at the Day N Night Fest in Anaheim.  Jenner is pregnant: Reality star, 20, 'expecting a baby with boyfriend Travis Scott' friends claim; the two are seen here in April, soon after they started dating  Multiple outlets are reporting that the youngest member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan is expecting her first child with her boyfriend of five months.  It is even claimed that Kylie and 25-year-old Travis know the sex of the child - and are having a girl.  A source confirmed the news to DailyMail.com, adding that the young star was around four months pregnant.  TMZ first broke the news, with a report stating that Travis was telling friends his life was about to change.  Hiding her bump? The star shared this photo on Thursday, but it is not know when it was taken  A further source told People magazine that Kylie was overjoyed about her pregnancy.  'It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about,' they said.  Kylie began dating Travis back in April following her split from former long-term boyfriend Tyga, who has a child, son King Cairo, with Blac Chyna (Rob Kardashian's ex).  As news broke of the pregnancy on Friday the rapper added his own thoughts to the mix - Snapchatting, then deleting, the comment: 'hell nah that's my kid!'  Four months ago - around the time she fell pregnant - Kylie went on a charity trip to Peru. Keeping Up With The Kardashians viewers were watching as a private jet made a pit stop in Miami to collect her, after she spent a romantic few days with Travis.  Oh Tyga! As news broke of the pregnancy on Friday Tyga added his own thoughts to the mix - Snapchatting, then deleting, the comment 'hell nah that's my kid!'  In the months since the two have since proved inseparable, and even have matching butterflies tattooed on their ankles.  In recent weeks social media savvy Kylie has been unusally restrained in her posts.  Not normally one to be shy, she has refrained from any full body shots, instead posting cropped selfies of her head and shoulders, while skipping any public events.  On Thursday she shared one full-length shot with a group of friends, but hid her body under a baggy T-shirt.  'Day 1s' she captioned the post - a term commonly used to refer to old friends.  She also shared a few images to promote her latest clothing line for Kendall + Kyle - which launched on Friday.  On Sunday: The star shared this image with her best friends over the weekend  Something to tell us? On Thursday she shared a shot with a group of friends, in which she wore a baggy T-shirt  Kylie has previously spoken of her yearning to have a child, even confiding in her grandmother MJ on an episode of I Am Cait that she planned to be a 'young mom'.  Indeed there was wide speculation that she was expecting a child shortly before her break-up with Tyga back in April.  And while the rumor later proved to be untrue, Kylie made it clear she was keen on the idea of starting a family.  'I feel like 30 is too late!' she said on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. 'Every psychic said that I’m only going to have two kids.'  Her brand: Kylie released new designs for Kendall + Kylie this week; here she is seen in one of the ads shared on Friday  On Life Of Kylie back in July she claimed was ready to get out of the spotlight and have a more normal life.  'I can't do it forever,' Kylie said.  'There is an image I constantly feel pressure to keep up with,' Kylie confesses. 'And then there's the real Kylie.'  The sister of Vogue model Kendall Jenner added: 'I do feel pressure to not let anybody down. Nobody has a perfect life.'  While Kylie may be young to start a family, she certainly has the means to provide for any child.  Already a multi-millionaire in her own right, thanks to her reality career and make-up business, Kylie also owns several huge mansions.  And any new child will have plenty of ready-made playmates.  Kylie's big sister Kim Kardashian and husband Kanye West are currently awaiting the arrival of their third child. The baby - a girl - is being carried by surrogate and is due in January.

Mel C, full name Melanie Chisholm, told the Press Association it was a “shame” her namesake could not make it a full line-up.

During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he’d been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years…that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.  ""She’s just so mad at him for embarrassing her — and her family — over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye’s behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians’ public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort — purportedly to work on his music — Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She’s more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""  She’s put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she’s been living in fear for the family — including kids North, Saint, and Chicago — after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to “f--- Kanye up.”  While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They’re taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in heated conversations, trying to figure out how the hell to shut Kanye up."" And how to keep the family businesses running smoothly.  ""Kim hopes people won’t hold Kanye’s actions against her,"" says the source, ""but Kris has been on the phone tirelessly with the execs they work with to make sure that there are no problems."" Kim is already breathing a little easier now that Kanye’s out of town. ""It’s way less stressful,"" says the source, noting that they hardly speak when he’s working. ""She wants to unwind and not make any rash decisions. But just having him out of LA has already been great for her mental state. And she’s doing whatever she can to be vocal about how Kanye’s opinions are NOT hers.""  But Kim knows his actions reflect on her — and she’s got a big decision to make about their future. As embarrassing as it will be for the reality star to have ""a third failed marriage under her belt,"" says the insider, ""there’s no coming back from Kanye’s latest meltdown. It’s time for Kim to not only distance herself from Kanye, but to make it offcial and divorce him.""  For more on this, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on stands now!

The article claims the actor and MIT professor are designing a “love nest” together, but a rep for Pitt tells Gossip Cop that’s completely false.  According to the National Enquirer, the actor is planning to build a “one-of-a-kind architectural masterpiece” with Oxman, who teaches art, architecture and design at the prestigious MIT Media Lab. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Brad’s not only inspired, he’s entranced with the brilliant brunette beauty.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Pitt and Oxman have “been secretly scouting location sites, looking for a perfect spot to make their artistic vision a groundbreaking reality.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster adds, “He’s nuts about Neri. He wants to build a palace with her… Their ‘special project’ is Brad’s dream come true.”  As Gossip Cop has repeatedly noted, the movie star and professor aren’t dating. Pitt’s own spokesperson has told us this on the record several times, and trusted entertainment publications have backed it up. E! News recently reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends,” while People similarly stated that Pitt and Oxman’s friendship “is not romantic in nature.”  Even if the two were to team up on an architecture project, it certainly wouldn’t be a “love nest.” Of course, this outlet’s narrative is coming from an anonymous and almost assuredly made-up “source.” Meanwhile, Pitt’s rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that there’s “no truth” to the tabloid’s tale and that he’s not designing any type of structure with her at all.  It’s true that the pair met last year through a project at MIT, but they have no plans to construct a building together. Nor have they been “secretly scouting” locations. It’s telling that the unreliable magazine provides zero details about the areas where they’re supposedly exploring.  Unfortunately, the National Enquirer has been pushing a nonexistent romance between Pitt and Oxman ever since the news broke last month that he had visited her MIT class in November 2017. For example, Gossip Cop recently busted the publication for falsely claiming Angelina Jolie was “furious” about Pitt and Oxman’s relationship, and that she might even use it against him in their custody negotiations. And one month before the tabloid discovered the MIT professor existed, the outlet had wrongly reported Pitt had reunited with Jennifer Aniston. The untrustworthy magazine, which seems to change its narrative whenever it’s convenient, clearly has no real insight into the actor’s personal life.

Yet, Chastain says that might be how her Italian in-laws, the parents of her fashion executive husband fashion executive Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, feel about her. Last night when she stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live, she opened up about an awkward season of holiday meals with her husband's family as well as her own — mostly due to her vegan diet and cultural differences.  The two families met in the Alps, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, where things got ""interesting."" ""My family is from Northern California,"" Chastain told Kimmel. ""And his family is from Veneto, Italy. My family doesn't speak [Italian] and his family speaks very little English... It was a very quiet holiday, but there was a lot of pointing and a lot of food.""  That's where the families differed: ""We've known each other for about six years and Americans eat in about an hour,"" says Chastain. ""A meal starts and then it's done. When I went to Italy, I didn't realize that meals last for three or four hours... I don't understand this but Sunday brunch will go from 1 pm to 5 pm. You eat one course and it's delicious. Then the second your plate is done, his mom is putting more food on my plate. So I have a trick where I just push the food around on my plate for hours.""  Chastain's vegan diet, however, poses more of an issue for her in these situations than the duration of the meals. ""In the beginning, I would say I'm vegan. Which is like the worst thing. I don't eat 10 meals and I'm vegan. I would say, 'I'm sorry I can't eat that,' and [my mother-in-law] would say, 'No problem, we have fish'.""  ""Do you think they hate you?"" Kimmel asks, to which Chastain responds, ""Maybe that's why it's so quiet. They just hate me.""  Chastain explained why she went vegan last year, telling W , "" I found myself going to veganism because a friend of mine had a two week vegan food delivery program she wasn’t going to use so I used it, and immediately I just had more energy than I’ve ever had in my life... Being vegan was not anything I ever wanted to be. I just really was listening to what my body was telling me.""

At last count, it's been five years since the world became obsessed with Kylie's lips. Some of her fans even tried using a lip-enhancing tool to get a Jenner-sized pout. (Spoiler: the #KylieJennerLipChallenge did not end well.) For a long time, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star denied getting injections, instead claiming that she had been over lining her lips.

When a guy you like says that, I don’t know, it just really affected me. I just didn’t feel desirable or pretty. “I would overline my lips with the lip liner to create the illusion of bigger lips and then, finally, I was like, this lip liner isn't doing it and ended up getting my lips done.”  Breasts  In 2015, Kylie posted on her app, telling her fans that the secret to her new, bigger boobs was a Victoria's Secret bra.

Referring to the above images, Dr Giannitrapani thinks that Kylie has probably had breast augmentation. ""There is a clear size increase to Kylie's breasts looking at the side profile of these comparison pictures,"" he said. ""Although they are not out of proportion with her frame, they have the characteristics of a breast enlargement in the early stages of healing and look as though they still need time to settle.""

1e858c07-5491-4fbb-8025-5a6dca1fa418,"Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy — especially male hypocrisy.  [ Read Louis C.K.’s statement: “These stories are true” ]  After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct — encounters that took place over a decade ago — Louis C.K.’s publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. “Louis is not going to answer any questions,” Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.  Neither Louis C.K. nor Mr. Kay replied to follow-up emails in which the accusations were laid out in detail, or to voice messages or texts. On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.’s new movie “I Love You, Daddy,” was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”  The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act — an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In “I Love You, Daddy,” which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.  At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.’s manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.’s manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he “never threatened anyone.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,501

Jolie claimed this was evidence of Pitt’s abusive behavior towards their six children.  But now, according to Radar Online, the 16-year-old understands that his mom’s behavior ignited problems in their family, and it is the 42-year-old actress who is the instigator of many of their family woes.

But, whether Maddox winds up with Pitt is still in question.  Pitt and Jolie are still in the middle of hashing out a custody agreement and divorce settlement, but a year and a half after their split, Pitt is happy again and in “high spirits.” After taking time to focus on himself, the 54-year-old has slowly made his way back into the spotlight and is currently dating Neri Oxman, who is a professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab.

I am so proud that you do what you want to do and live your life the way you want you will pass down all of those amazing qualities to your baby girl. You were made to be a mom!”  Meanwhile, Khloe Kardashian is currently pregnant with her first child, and is due at the end of March/beginning of April — so there’ll be another little one added to the mix in just a couple of months!

22e82420-ffc6-47be-b6f9-86d70fa24b3a,"Not so fast! Madonna was hit with a series of “uncomfortable questions” by a judge before she was granted permission to adopt her 4-year-old twin girls from Malawi, the presiding judge said in court documents obtained by The Associated Press on Wednesday, February 8.  “The petitioner is a professional performer and I guarded myself against the danger of her merely reciting a well-rehearsed speech by asking her some rather uncomfortable questions to which she gave very candid answers,” Judge Fiona Mwale said in her ruling, explaining her reasons for approving the adoption.  After pressing Madonna, 58, to explain her intentions in adding two more little ones to her brood of four, Judge Mwale said she was satisfied that the girls would be in good hands with the Material Girl.  “There is no doubt that the petitioner can offer the infants not only the best education money can buy, but also guidance with a high likelihood of ensuring that the two infants grow to be self-sufficient adults,” Judge Mwale said, adding that she is satisfied that Madonna “is motivated by her desire to offer a home, love, protection and guidance to the infants.”  In the court documents, Judge Mwale addressed prior controversies surrounding Madonna’s adoptions in Malawi. “In determining her motives, I questioned the petitioner at length about the impact of her decision which could be construed as robbing Malawi of its most precious resource, its children,” the judge wrote.  As previously reported, Madonna filed for adoption in High Court in Malawi on January 25 but tried to keep the process under wraps until a final decision was made. (The Queen of Pop issued a statement denying her adoption to Us Weekly that same day, claiming that she was in Malawi “to check on the children’s hospital in Blantyre.”) According to the AP, she has already raised $7.5 million for a pediatric surgery ward at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, which is set to open early next year.  Madonna previously adopted son David and daughter Mercy James, both 11, from Malawi in 2008 and 2009, respectively. She is also mom to daughter Lourdes, 20, whom she shares with ex Carlos Leon, and son Rocco, 16, whom she shares with ex-husband Guy Ritchie.  Madonna’s twin girls will retain their birth names as a part of an effort to preserve their identity as Malawian nationals, the court documents said, and their father was at the January 25 court hearing with Madonna. (The twins’ mother died within a week of childbirth due to health complications.)  On Wednesday, February 8, Madonna took to social media to share the happy news. “I can officially confirm I have completed the process of adopting twin sisters from Malawi and am overjoyed that they are now part of our family,” she captioned an image of herself walking between the two little girls. “I am deeply grateful to all those in Malawi who helped make this possible, and I ask the media please to respect our privacy during this transitional time. 🙏🏻 Thank you also to my friends, family and my very large team for all your support and Love!”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

ab0996a7-cef0-4618-a18a-2e2c8940dd7a,"AdvertisementWe have just received information that one of the women accusing Alabama senatorial candidate Roy Moore of soliciting dates from her when she was a teenager and he was in his 30’s is not only a passionate progressive, but she has actually worked for the DNC and is actively campaigning for Moore’s opponent, Doug Jones.Deborah Wesson Gibson, aka Debbie Gibson, was named in the Washington Post article accusing Moore, and social media evidence makes clear that she is a fervent supporter of Jones and Democrats in general, and has even worked for the DNC.Wesson Gibson is a sign language interpreter, who has interpreted at rallies for both Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton.She has also vocalized fervent support for Jones.Also, of course, she is a vocal opponent of Roy Moore and is clearly dedicated to him losing:This is not surprising, considering the timing of these wild stories of Moore courting and even sexually groping teenage girls when he was in his 30’s. Moore has been hated passionately by the left for decades, for his consistent dedication to biblical morality.Consider how suspicious this is – a woman comes forward 39 years later with a vicious never-before-made accusation – and how is one suppose to defend oneself and prove it is a lie 39 years later? Welcome to politics in America.The establishment doesn’t want Roy Moore, a man who can’t be bought or bribed, to pull up their political skirts and overturn their tables of corruption and greed! Roy Moore will win big! Buckle up RINOS…time to meet a real man!Kayla Moore, Roy Moore’s wife, in an exclusive statement to The Activist Mommy yesterday, told us that “The Washington Post has been calling and harassing our friends and family, trying to find garbage. We’ve had people back home telling us they are getting phone calls and when they would tell them good things, the Washington Post would ask them if they knew anything bad on him.”Well, her story continues to be corroborated, as witnesses have come forward saying the Washington Post, a paper that has officially endorsed Jones, has actually been bribing people to dig up dirt on Moore!Go figure! This is exactly what Kayla claims has been happening.Roy Moore had this to say about the fabricated campaign against him:The Obama-Clinton Machine’s liberal media lapdogs just launched the most vicious and nasty round of attacks against me I’ve EVER faced!We are in the midst of a spiritual battle with those who want to silence our message. The forces of evil will lie, cheat, steal –– even inflict physical harm –– if they believe it will silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me.I believe you and I have a duty to stand up and fight back against the forces of evil waging an all-out war on our conservative values!Our nation is at a crossroads right now — both spiritually and politically.Our children and grandchildren’s futures are on the line.So rest assured — I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!The Democrats always pull this stunt. Ever since they saw it work for the Clintons they’ve been trying it every chance they get! But they completely underestimate Roy Moore and the people of God.This is a last-ditch, hail mary pass effort from the Democats to slander a man they’ve hated as long as he has held public office. This fabricated story can’t hold water for long!This statesman is going through the fires of testing for the survival of this nation.

But we need a pillar of hope, and that pillar of hope is Jodie Whittaker.”  The actress won over the producers from the instant she walked into the audition room. “It’s one of those things [where] you don’t know what you’re looking for until you see it,” Chibnall described, hailing Whittaker’s performance as “fresh, funny and very emotional.”  As for how Whittaker’s Broadchurch co-star and former Doctor David Tennant reacted to her casting, the actress said the message conveyed to her was, “This is the most amazing thing that can happen to you, and there are only a few people who know how it feels.”  While Season 11 won’t debut until this fall, fans were already introduced to the 13th Doctor in last year’s Christmas special. Shooting the brief scene was “incredibly nerve-wrecking, because the reveal had [already] happened [in the media],” Whittaker described. “You have no idea what you’re taking on… I was nervous to touch anything. I felt as if I was in someone else’s shoes, which is a wonderful way to start this journey. It was amazing.”  The cast and creative team were tight-lipped on specifics about the new Time Lord, but executive producer Matt Strevens did share that “this Doctor is in love with life” and “treats everything with respect and wonder.”  Whittaker will be joined by three new companions, who are all very different, said Mandip Gill (Hollyoaks), who plays one of the pals. Her character, Yasmin, is a 19-year-old who is “whisked away on this amazing adventure with these people, who become her family, and she’s in awe of the Doctor… The dynamic between the three friends is beautiful.”  When it came time to cast the companions, “we were looking for people who have incredible range, because the tone of the show demands everything,” Chibnall described. “And just truth — bringing emotional truth. It’s really important for us this season, especially. There are big emotional journeys for everyone to go on. All of them aced it, and the chemistry was really apparent.”  In addition to its new ensemble, Season 11 will also feature a fresh take on the sonic screwdriver. Chibnall would only hint that “there is a story [about] how the Doctor comes by” this incarnation of the device.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,544

But today, Kensington Palace announced that the happy couple won't be jetting out of town immediately following their big day. Rather, they are delaying their trip to get back to work.  Meghan and Harry will attend an engagement in the week following their wedding, and then they'll head off to an undisclosed location.    “The couple will be going on honeymoon, but not straightaway,” Kensington Palace spokesman Jason Knauf said, according to People “They will have their first engagement as a married couple in the week after the wedding.”  That schedule is in keeping with what Markle said earlier this year about wanting to ""hit the ground running,"" once she officially becomes a member of the royal family.  Their plan is also similar to when Prince William and Duchess Kate went on their honeymoon. According to royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, ""William and Kate left for their honeymoon in the Seychelles 10 days after their wedding.

Shortly after the House of Representatives voted on a health care bill designed to repeal and replace Obamacare, numerous Hollywood stars took to Twitter to condemn those politicians who supported the bill.  The Republican-backed measure won by a narrow 217-213 vote, with Democrats singing ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye"" as the bill passed the legislative chamber, suggesting that the GOP's support for the bill would cost them in the 2018 midterm election.  ""I feel so confident,"" said President Trump during a live address after the passing of the bill. ""This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it.""  The bill, which now heads to the Senate, where it faces an uncertain fate, will keep children on family policies until age 26 but will cut the Medicaid program for low-income people and end tax penalties in the Affordable Care Act on the health industry and those who earn high-paying salaries.  The bill will also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year and allows states to get waivers to free insurers from coverage requirements, which could cause them to charge people with pre-existing illnesses higher rates than they charge healthy customers.  In a viral video, Jimmy Kimmel expressed his views on equal healthcare for those with pre-existing conditions such as his newborn son. ""If your baby is going to die, and it doesn't have to, it should not matter how much money you make,"" he said while tearing up during his monologue on his show Monday night.  The hashtag #IAmAPreexistingCondition became a trending topic quickly after the bill was passed. America Ferrera, Sarah Hyland, Mark Ruffalo and George Takei took to Twitter to express their views.

ebfc3e98-d05f-4b25-a2d8-ee04828153d1,"The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)  This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.  Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.  Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""  According to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit ""Hollaback Girl"" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.  And, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time — it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. ""I don't have any plans to come back,"" she told the outlet. ""I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.""  The new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani's spot.  The Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair — because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,727

Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population.

Yes, another Royal Wedding is happening—soon! On Friday, October 12th, Princess Eugenie, 28, and her fiancé, Jack Brooksbank, 31, will become the next new royal newlyweds.  On the polished heels of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, another regal celebration is a welcomed jubilee. Here’s what we know about Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank’s planned nuptials.  Princess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York is ninth in line for the coveted throne—just behind her elder sister, Princess Beatrice. As reported by BBC News , Eugenie is a real working royal as a director at a gallery in Hauser and Wirth in London. Jack is a brand manager for Casamigos Tequila (co-founded by George Clooney who might be making his second royal wedding appearance of the year).  Royal watchers will recall that the couple officially announced their engagement via the Royal Family’s Twitter account this past January. As we previously reported , the couple met back in 2011 skiing in the Swiss Alps. From one epic location to meet (and fall in love) the location of their engagement was just as epic—near a lakeside Nicaraguan volcano —ah, young royal love.  After Jack bestowed Princess Eugenie with a stunning pink diamond sapphire engagement ring (so extra) it was announced that their marriage will take place at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor (the same place Harry and Meghan tied the knot).  As reported by Harper’s Bazaar , royal romantics at heart will be able to watch the next set of royals walk down the aisle as TLC will be the only network to broadcast the wedding in the United States. The viewing starts early—4:25 a.m. EST Friday, October 12th. So have your teapot hot and your scones pre-jammed for another English wedding spectacle.  While the past regal weddings have been very pomp-and-circumstance, this one is expected to be the same with an environmental-friendly no-plastic stance.  This past August, British Vogue shared the news that both Princess Eugenie and Jack are planning to have an eco-conscious planned wedding as she and her sister, Beatrice grew up in an “anti-plastic” home. She told British Vogue, “My whole house is anti-plastic now – and Jack and I want our wedding to be like that as well.”  Princess Eugenie, one of the few royals on Instagram, recently posted a regal black and white profile portrait captioning, “#tbt to some serious wedding daydreaming going on here. Pre-wedding vibes.”  Loading View on Instagram  While all anticipated wedding-watchers will have to tune in to see the final look of Eugenie’s wedding attire; it's safe to speculate that she'll wear a tiara. July 23, 1986, the wedding day of Eugenie’s mum, The Duchess of York wore a gifted diamond crown from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Okay, now that’s extra.  The wedding sounds dreamy and all, but still you want to hit the ‘snooze’ button come Friday? No worries, the whole broadcast can be re-played on the TLC Go app—just reheat your tea (and crumpets) and you are good to go watch post-class!

3528bdde-0d3a-4026-9b82-7017c1ab7a50,"Legal battle with ex husband leave's the star's family 'desperately worried about her.'  Despite a tumultuous custody battle with ex Kevin Federline, Radar Online reports that Britney Spears may have other things on her plate that would explain her erratic behavior.  The publication broke the news that Spears is “desperate” for Sam Asghari, her current love interest, to propose, “but he’s dragging his feet and stalling.”  After completing a successful run of shows in Las Vegas, Spears allegedly immediately turned her attention to tying the knot with her 23-year-old boyfriend.  The same source claims that the real reasoning behind Spears being impatient is because of her immediate urge to have children with Asghari.  “All she can talk about right now is having a baby. She wants a girl so bad and she’s madly in love with Sam.”  Asghari however, apparently is hesitant to act on Spear’s marriage advances, citing that he may not be mentally ready to completely settle down with the famous performer.  While this all occurs, Spears also is caught up in a heated legal battle with ex, Federline.  He is reportedly asking the star for more money in spousal and child support to help take care of himself along with their young children, Sean and Jayden.  Matthew Simmons / Getty Images  The same source mentioned that “She’s freaking out over this court deposition and doesn’t see an end in sight to all the ugliness with Kevin.”  Spears met Federline, a professional dancer, in April 2004 and, aside from the fact that he already had a child on the way with ex-fiancée Shar Jackson, whom, at the time, he had only been split from for a very short period. Federline and Spears were engaged by July of that year.  Their marriage ceremony took place on September 18, 2004, with son Sean Preston being born barely a year later. Jayden James, their second son, was born a year after that. However, by November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline and began pursuing other romantic interests.  All of the drama surrounding Spears is prompting those closest to her to state that they are worried she may spiral off into something akin to her most famous public meltdown over a decade ago when she had shaved her head amongst other media-covered reckless acts.  However, the source still described the situation best by saying that “There are still some major demons that Britney has to fight on a daily basis, and her workload never lets up. She feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and her family’s desperately worried about her.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,500

The two, who had been together as a couple for seven years, had been spending quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their Los Angeles home, People reported.  The couple issued a statement through Aniston’s longtime publicist, saying that the decision to separate “was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year,” Page Six reported.  The couple also said they were making the announcement publicly, “in an effort to reduce any further speculation.”  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” the statement read. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The “Friends” star, 49, and Theroux, 46, a screenwriter and actor lauded for his performance in HBO’s “The Leftovers,” were engaged in August of 2012. They married in August 2015 in an intimate but star-studded in the garden of their $21 million minimalist estate in Bel-Air. Jimmy Kimmel officiated, according to Harpers Bazaar.  Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. As she and Pitt were breaking up, Pitt’s romance with Angelina Jolie became public.  The announcement that Aniston and Theroux are done comes just a few days after the actress celebrated her 49th birthday Sunday in Malibu with girlfriends, including Courtney Cox. Theroux, meanwhile, was across the country for New York fashion week, Us Weekly reported.  Sources recently told People that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.  “Justin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,” a source People. “When he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it’s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.”  But Aniston told a story of marital bliss in a conversation with actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, published in September in Harper’s Bazaar. The two shared happy memories of Aniston’s wedding to Theroux. Sedaris, who is a good friend of Theroux’, served as his “best man.”  “Everything about that wedding was perfect,” Sedaris said. “Everyone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy.”  Aniston said it was “fun” to revisit a video of the wedding Theroux had just given her.  But the actress, who has a passion for interior design, also talked about the challenges of working together on updating their Bel-Air mansion, which is featured on the March cover of Architectural Digest.  “They say building houses can make or break a couple,” Aniston said. “I was so used to doing it on my own, and there were moments when I was like, ‘Don’t say no so fast.’ I have this dialogue with my interior designer where I’ll go: ‘No. Hate it. Move. Next.’ That can sound a little abrupt, so I had to retool my attitude a bit.

dd817754-9aab-46fc-a796-819b18603d6f,"Harvey Weinstein’s attorney blasted Asia Argento for “hypocrisy” on Monday, following a report that she had settled a sexual abuse claim brought by actor James Bennett.  Argento was one of Weinstein’s initial accusers, telling the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow that he forcibly performed oral sex on her 20 years ago. Argento has also been at the forefront of the movement to hold Hollywood’s sexual abusers to account.  Weinstein’s criminal attorney, Ben Brafman, argued in a statement that the revelations about Argento undermine her claims against Weinstein.  “This development reveals a stunning level of hypocrisy by Asia Argento, one of the most vocal catalysts who sought to destroy Harvey Weinstein,” Brafman said. “What is perhaps most egregious, is the timing, which suggests that at the very same time Argento was working on her own secret settlement for the alleged sexual abuse of a minor, she was positioning herself at the forefront of those condemning Mr. Weinstein, despite the fact that her sexual relationship with Mr. Weinstein was between two consenting adults which lasted for more than four years. The sheer duplicity of her conduct is quite extraordinary and should demonstrate to everyone how poorly the allegations against Mr. Weinstein were actually vetted and accordingly, cause all of us to pause and allow due process to prevail, not condemnation by fundamental dishonesty.”  Argento has not sued Weinstein, and her allegations are not part of the criminal case against him. Weinstein faces up to life in prison if convicted on six charges of sexual assault and rape.  Argento was accused of having sex with Bennett at a hotel room in Marina del Rey, Calif., in 2013, when the actor was just 17 years old. According to the Times report, Argento agreed to pay $380,000 to settle the allegations.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,339

I’m sorry that this may not be what you want to hear, but it’s our truth.”  The post continued: “Just know there are no negative feelings here, we are simply two people who believed in love, and were open enough to give it a chance. We still care for each other very deeply.”  After asking for privacy, the pair concluded their statement with a thank you to their supporters, writing, “Thank you for your understanding and love while we have shared our vulnerability with the world.”  While Canadian Beauséjour-Savard fell hard for Crawley — who appeared on Juan Pablo‘s season of “The Bachelor” and the first two seasons of “Bachelor in Paradise” — she was infatuated with German contestant Christian Rauch.  Crawley, 36, ended up breaking things off with the distraught Canadian in favor of getting to know Rauch, but that relationship ended up falling apart too.  Beauséjour-Savard, 31, didn’t let a little rejection get him down, though. He reached out via text after the show and the duo reconnected. What followed was a surprise engagement — that included a custom Neil Lane ring — on “The Bachelor Winter Games: The World Tells All” reunion show.  This break-up is the second for a “Winter Games” couple; “Bachelor” favorite Ashley Iaconetti and Canadian firefighter Kevin Wendt split in March.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,378

A source confirms to Us that the pair went their separate ways earlier this year and were last seen together on May 25. When asked, her rep told Us, “I’m afraid I don’t comment on my client’s personal life.”  The Harry Potter star, 27, and Knight, 37, were first spotted together in October 2015, taking in the Broadway musical Hamilton.  Like Watson, who’s a graduate of Brown University, Knight has an Ivy League education, graduating from Princeton in 2003 with a Bachelor’s in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, he got an MBA from Columbia Business School six years ago.  Emma Watson’s Harry Potter Premiere Style Evolution  The Beauty and the Beast actress was protective of their relationship, avoiding talking about her business manager boyfriend in interviews.  In February this year she told Vanity Fair that she no longer takes photos with fans, in order to avoid giving out “tracking data” of where she is and what she’s wearing, and explained that keeping her private life under wraps is part of the way she deals with her worldwide fame.  Emma Watson’s Style Evolution: How She’s Grown Up  “I want to be consistent: I can’t talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home. You can’t have it both ways,” she said. “I’ve noticed, in Hollywood, who you’re dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

Meyers announced the news on Thursday, November 23, during the Thanksgiving episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, alongside his parents, Larry and Hilary Meyers, and his brother Josh, who were his guests on the show.  “I want to take this opportunity now, you guys obviously know, my wife and I are expecting a second baby,” the late-night host said. “Very excited. Thank you! Very excited.”  His mother told the audience the story of when her son called her to give her the good news. “I get the phone call, and my Seth is sometimes a crier. He’s sobbing,” she said. “He said, ‘Because for over a month, I’ve had to pretend that I don’t care what sex it is and I do care, I want a little boy!’”  The comedian, who welcomed his first son Ashe in 2016, said: “That’s true, I really wanted a brother for my son because I was so lucky to have one.”  The Saturday Night Live alum, 43, and the human rights lawyer announced their first pregnancy in September 2015 while attending New York’s Natural History Museum Gala.  “They are so thrilled to become parents and were so happy to share the exciting news with friends and cast members from SNL last night,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.  The couple wed in September 2013 in front of family and friends at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Although the late-night host typically holds back from commenting on his marriage, he did share a sweet memory back in 2014 of Ashe trying on her wedding gown.  “I will never forget the first time she returned from her fitting because she was happier than I’ve ever seen her,” Meyers gushed at the time while attending a NYC luncheon. “Which was a little jarring for me because I had recently proposed to her. Turns out getting a ring from me is less exciting than having Carolina Herrera creating your dress.”  The Late Night With Seth Meyers host also poked fun at Ashe for having food poising the night before their nuptials. “In a testament to my wife’s will and my wife’s strength, she got herself pumped full of fluids, and she railed it and made it to the ceremony,” he said. “When she walked out in her Herrera wedding dress, she looked more beautiful than I had ever seen her look.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

84fcb713-544a-4175-b852-02d0ffe9cce7,"ABC has officially confirmed that Shonda Rhimes political thriller Scandal — the drama that helped usher in an era of programming that better reflects society — would end with its previously announced seventh season.  Channing Dungey, entertainment president at ABC, spoke with reporters about the decision during her pre-upfronts press call with reporters Tuesday and noted that Rhimes always envisioned seven seasons for the fast-paced Washington, D.C.-set soap.  ""I had conversions with Shonda Rhimes where she has had for a while a sense of how she wanted the story to end,"" Dungey told reporters Tuesday ahead of ABC's upfront presentation to ad buyers. ""She said, 'Look, I really feel like season seven is where I want to wrap up this story, because I always prefer to end a show where you're feeling on top as opposed to letting things fizzle out.'""  Season seven will again feature a short number of episodes as Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and outgoing President Fitzgerald Grant (Tony Goldwyn) inch closer to their Vermont dreams. (Season six wraps Thursday with the series on the verge of electing Bellamy Young's former first lady Mellie Grant as its new president.)  ""I do think that audiences, especially fans and Gladiators, who are as loyal to Scandal as they have been, are going to want the story to end in the way that Shonda intended to,"" said Dungey. ""That was a decision she felt really good about, and we support wholeheartedly.""  An episode count for Scandal, which returns in the fall, has not yet been determined.  ""Deciding how to end a show is easy,"" said Rhimes in a statement Tuesday following the press call. ""Deciding when to finish is quite simple when the end date is years away. But actually going through with it? Actually standing up to say: 'This is it?' Not so much. So, next year we are going all out. Leaving nothing on the table. Creating this world in celebration. We are going to handle the end the way we like to handle the important things in our Scandal family: all together, white hats on, Gladiators running full speed over a cliff.""  Rhimes always envisioned Scandal as a show that did not have a long lifespan — her Grey's Anatomy is heading into its 14th season in the fall — and always saw it as a seven-season show. Ahead of the fourth season opener, Rhimes told THR that the drama inspired by the life of fixer Judy Smith wasn't a ""10-season or eight-season show.""  In its sixth season, Scandal has had to reinvent itself following the surprising November election that sent Republican and former reality TV personality Donald Trump to the White House. Suddenly, Rhimes' show about the insane things that politicians do didn't seem so insane. (Producers had to scrap a planned storyline about Russians hacking the show's presidential election when reality hit too close to home, for example.) During an oral history interview with THR in April pegged to the landmark 100th episode of Scandal, Rhimes was vocal about the show's uncertain future in the country's current political climate.  ""Any of the stories we planned now just feel like we're copying what's happening in reality, which is insane,"" she said. ""I used to know how it ended, and then Donald Trump was elected. We had a destination, and I don't know if that's our destination anymore.""  Still, Scandal will leave an incredible legacy behind when it closes up shop for good during the 2017-18 broadcast season. The drama helped usher in a new era of diversity on the small screen when Rhimes cast Washington as fixer Olivia Pope. Washington picked up her first Emmy nomination in 2013 and became the first African-American to be nominated for best drama actress in the past 18 years and fifth overall.  The series also further solidified Rhimes as one of television's most powerful showrunners and helped ABC bolster its Thursday lineup. With Scandal sandwiched between Grey's Anatomy at 8 p.m. and the Rhimes-produced How to Get Away With Murder at 10 p.m., ABC created a ""TGIT""-branded night consisting of three Rhimes-produced dramas.  Next up for Rhimes is the long-awaited launch of Romeo and Juliet drama Still Star-Crossed. And while sophomore drama The Catch was canceled after two seasons, Shondaland — Rhimes' production company with longtime producing partner Betsy Beers — scored a series pickup for For the People, which has been described as a legal version of Grey's Anatomy. All told, Rhimes will enter next season with four shows on the air again: Grey's, Scandal, Murder and People, with a renewal for Still Star-Crossed having the potential to make it five for the second season in a row.  Scandal returns in the fall as part of ABC's TGIT lineup.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,915

They live together, they raise their children together and they work together consistently on theater projects. They were co-directors of the Sydney Theatre Company for years, and he’s written and directed theater projects for Cate many times over the years. They seemed totally solid, right?  Well, last fall, there were some photos of Upton looking and seeming especially friendly and handsy with a 27-year-old actress, a friend who has worked with him and with Cate. The photos were damning, but they weren’t definitive proof of shenanigans. Still, there seemed to be a few tense months, and Cate was even seen without her wedding ring a few times. So what’s new?

Today, the social media star visited the City of Lights for Virgil Abloh's inaugural show for Louis Vuitton. The designer is a close friend and collaborator of Kim's husband, Kanye West. The last time Kim was in Paris was also for fashion week.  TMZ reports that the Wests were ""surrounded by their muscle,"" so they likely took extra precautions with security this time around. Even behind the big men in suits, Kim could be spotted from a mile away in a bright electric blue wrap coat featuring a waist tie and utilitarian pockets with her go-to biker shorts. Kardashian noted on Twitter that she wore Abloh's collection to the presentation.  Getty Images  Her husband, on the other hand, went with his signature athleisure-inspired look with a printed long sleeve tee that reads messages like ""There is only one freedom,"" ""I am loving,"" and ""Awareness.""  Kim's youngest sister Kylie Jenner was also present, wearing a similar bright ensemble. Her iteration, however, was a neon yellow jumpsuit. The trio sat together in the front row.    Getty Images  Kim went dark on social media and stayed out of the public eye after the robbery in her Paris hotel room almost two years ago. However, she eventually opened up about the experience on camera during Keeping Up with the Kardashians, where she recounted jarring details from the incident such as having the gun held up to her head, thinking she was going to die or get raped, being gagged with duct tape, realizing there was no way out, and fearing for her family.  After the episode aired, Kim reflected on the experience on Instagram. ""I would never wish this experience upon anyone, but have learned some valuable lessons & feel so blessed to be safe home with my babies & husband.

f08025dd-8606-48a9-9cae-2dfd9afbc82d,"Photo by Steve Granitz via Getty Images  This Week in 2007 is a weekly column looking back on Lindsay Lohan, the first iPhone, George W. Bush, and everything else we loved about the year 2007.  Today, it's easy to forget how much America detested Spencer and Heidi, a.k.a. Speidi. Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad.  Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! … But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship…you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me … when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person…she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports. ""Actually, [Lauren] told MTV if they didn't stop filming with me she would quit and they told her then quit,"" he tells Broadly in a direct message. (Lauren's representative did not immediately respond to Broadly's request for comment.)  In the third season premiere, fans watched a similar party scene. At a club called Les Deux, Heidi hands Lauren a letter lamenting their dilapidated friendship. It does not mention the rumors. ""She won't fucking admit it,"" Lauren complains. She refuses to see her.  ""It's her problem,"" Heidi tells herself. But when Lauren flees the club, Heidi follows her.  ""You're not my friend anymore,"" Lauren tells her. ""I always feel bad for you,"" Heidi cries. She wants to know why Lauren hates her. ""You know what you did!"" Lauren cries in a scene that has become as memorable as the ""Nancy Jo, this is Alexis Neiers calling"" video.  It was one of the few moments of real drama on a show that mostly consisted of plotless scenes and beautiful shots of Sunset Boulevard. Speidi come across as manipulative villains, while Lauren seems genuine. But during her promotional tour, Lauren went on Regis and Kelly to discuss the ""big split."" The feud was the best thing to happen to The Hills: The episode premiered to a record-setting 3.6 million viewers. Speidi later admitted to ""producing"" drama behind the scenes to boost ratings. There's a reason Spencer and Heidi have become the media's go-to experts on reality TV.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,963

FXX announced that Stephen Falk's relationship comedy, You're the Worst, will be granted a fifth and final season to air in 2018. The announcement came November 15 - the same day as You're the Worst season 4's finale  FX co-President of Original programming Nick Grad said in a statement:  “Stephen Falk has been an extraordinary creative partner to work with over the past four years, and it is in that spirit that we came to the mutual decision to end You’re the Worst with its fifth season. Stephen’s singular vision for the series has been its guiding force from the start and our decision, while difficult, will allow the series to end on its own terms and in a way most satisfying to its devoted fans. We want to thank Stephen, the cast and the crew for everything they’ve done to make You’re the Worst one of the best comedies on TV.”  It may be a bit early to eulogoize You're the Worst (seasons tend to run in the Fall so we're about a year away from the series finale in all likelihood) but while we have the time, Gad is right: this was one of the better comedies on TV. What initially seemed to be a comedy about shitty people falling into something approximating love, You're the Worst evolved into a sophisticated exploration of mental illness, self-destruction, and general human imperfection.  Chris Geere and Aya Cash excelled as star-crossed lovers Jimmy and Gretchen and Desmin Borges, Kether Donohue, and Janet Varney round out the cast as Angelenos all damaged in their own way.  “Making You’re The Worst has been an incredible experience and FX Networks have been dream partners,” creator Stephen Falk said. “I am thankful to have the opportunity to be thoroughly judged whether or not we ‘stick the landing’ -- which is a thing people say now that stupid Breaking Bad had to end so damn perfectly.”  You know what that means. Jimmy and Gretchen are returning to Albuquerque for bloody revenge. Get ready!  You're the Worst Season 5 Release Date  FXX has announced the premiere date for You're the Worst's final season.

I didn’t think she’d actually take one but she did,” Collins recalled. “I saw myself in the photo and my heart dropped. So when my mom saw the film, she saw Lily’s reaction because she knows me the best.”  The scene caused her mom to breakdown.  “The first time she was a bit in shock,” Collins added of her mom’s reaction. “The second time I looked over at the end and she was sobbing; it really hit her hard.”  The Love, Rosie actress also told The Edit that she couldn’t book photoshoots in magazines because she was too skinny.  “I told my publicist that if I could snap my fingers and gain 10 pounds right that second, I would,” she concluded of the experience.

08df367a-7a1b-4c8a-8afc-43c536ed044f,"Whoa. Did the Kardashians get banned from one of the biggest Oscar pre-parties of the year?! A shocking new report claims that the reality superstars were actually forbidden from entering the Raleigh Studios’ ‘Night Before’ extravaganza this year after getting in trouble for their ‘drunk,’ messy behavior in years past. Ouch!  When Hollywood’s biggest stars hit the red carpet at the Oscar pre-parties on Feb. 27, we couldn’t help but notice that a couple famous faces were noticeably missing from the A-list lineup: of course, we’re talking about the Kardashian/Jenner clan! The Internet-breaking family was a no-show at the Raleigh Studios annual pre-party, and as it turns out, it had nothing to do with their busy schedules. In fact, a shocking new report claims that the women were actually BANNED from the VIP festivities after raising eyebrows with their “drunk” behavior in years past! Well, this certainly doesn’t look good for the brand!      Despite being some of the biggest names in Hollywood, the Kardashians were reportedly not welcome at the annual “Night Before” party at Raleigh Studios after displaying what some claimed was some pretty unacceptable behavior, according to a new Star magazine report. The reality TV stars were allegedly all denied an invite to the star-studded event — Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stalone, Kerry Washington and Alicia Vikander were among those who did make the cut, in case you were wondering — after a source tells the outlet Kris Jenner rubbed some people the wrong way with her sloppy behavior at a previous party. “Kris Jenner went years ago and got drunk and no one liked that,” the insider explained to the magazine. HollywoodLife.com has reached out for further comment.  Yikes! How bad could her behavior have been to get her entire family banned from the event? While it’s no secret that Kris is a fan of her vodka drinks — it’s been a running storyline on Keeping Up With The Kardashians for several seasons now — it’s well-known that the majority of her daughters aren’t big on drinking, which makes this whole thing seem rather unfair, don’t you think?  In fact, in it was Khloe Kardashian who recently opened up about her family’s sober ways, admitting that while she and Kris may love their cocktails, the same doesn’t necessarily hold true for the rest of the family. “Kimberly does not drink alcohol whatsoever,” Khloe told Elle magazine. “Pregnant or not, she’s just never been into it. Kendall and Kylie are not into it. Even when Kendall goes to Europe where the drinking age is 18, she’s never—Kendall’s really focused and determined.  “Kourtney used to drink a lot more in college and probably before she had kids. She’s literally been pregnant for, like, six years or breastfeeding, so I think that has obviously changed her life now,” she continued. “My mom has a drink every night with dinner. That’s her thing, and that’s what she loves to do. I don’t like the taste of alcohol like that, so if I drink, I drink for intent. Like, I don’t care to just have a glass of wine. No, I want to get f**king buzzed or drunk. That’s the point!”      Still, that’s not to say that the Kardashians haven’t had their sloppy moments in years past. In fact, it was in a recent episode of KUWTK that we saw a totally wasted Khole go off on Kris during her spectacular Great Gatsby-themed 60th birthday party. In the episode, Kris was just about to give a speech thanking all of her friends and family for celebrating with her when KoKo ripped the mic out of her hand and said, “no one cares about her f**king speech.” Yikes! Maybe there was a good reason to ban the Kardashians after all.  HollywoodLifers, what do you think about the Kardashians reportedly getting banned from the Oscar pre-party?

2a54a48b-1b31-415f-8324-a99180672adb,"Television networks, viewers, readers and restauranteurs are paying tribute to Anthony Bourdain this weekend, one day after he was found dead in a hotel room in France.  His books are occupying six of the top 10 spots on Amazon's bestsellers list, a sign of immense interest in reading or re-reading his books like ""Kitchen Confidential.""  And some of his past TV shows are re-airing in his honor.  On Friday there were pop-up tributes outside Les Halles, the New York restaurant where Bourdain worked in the 1990s. Fans left bouquets and handwritten messages on the walls and door of the shuttered French brasserie.  At CNN in Atlanta, a mourner placed a flower and a note next to a poster of Bourdain in the lobby. And at CNN in New York, an employee placed post-it notes with hearts on one of his posters.  CNN was Bourdain's home for the past five years, so the loss has caused heartache throughout the organization. The network quickly produced an hour-long remembrance that premiered on Friday night and will re-air Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.  Related: Inside Anthony Bourdain's globe-trotting career  Other CNN programs are also honoring Bourdain's legacy.  ""It is hard to imagine he is gone,"" Anderson Cooper said Friday night. ""Hard to imagine he is not just off on some far away journey, hard to imagine he will not soon return with new foods to share, new stories to tell.""  Before Bourdain died, CNN had planned to run a marathon of past ""Parts Unknown"" episodes on Saturday night. The network is moving forward with that plan, but with an adjustment -- the marathon will feature some of Bourdain's all-time favorite episodes.  Additionally, the Travel Channel will air a 12-hour marathon of Bourdain's previous show ""No Reservations"" on Sunday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern.  A new episode of ""Parts Unknown"" featuring Berlin was already scheduled to premiere Sunday at 9 p.m. CNN says it will still air, but now ""with a special introduction by Anderson Cooper.""  That episode will be followed by the tribute special.  Related: How the press can cover suicide without creating a 'contagion'  ""Somebody as vital, as passionate, as alive, as warm as human as Tony Bourdain, I could not imagine, A, that he was gone, and B, that he was gone in this manner,"" Christiane Amanpour said in an interview for the special.  She said his death has ""left a massive hole in"" the world.  The manner of Bourdain's death has also caused CNN and many other news outlets to highlight suicide prevention resources.  All three network nightly newscasts in the U.S. featured the ""lifeline"" number, 800-273-8255, and encouraged people to call for help.  CNN and CNN.com have also been prominently featuring the number.  ""You never know what goes on in anybody's head and you never really know what goes on anyone's heart,"" Cooper said in the CNN tribute.  ""But certainly, you know, the pain he must have been feeling, at least in that moment or in those moments, and the loneliness he must've been feeling -- it's just terribly sad to think about. And makes me very sad for him to have -- to have succumbed to that.""  Asking for help  The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. It's now the 10th leading cause of death in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK  There is also a crisis text line.  The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,740
c4b8fd47-8f98-459f-98b9-0728cd56dae1,"Last night's triple elimination on Dancing With the Stars: Athletes sent half of the competition home, but not the contestants fans expected. Twitter erupted after controversial cast member Tonya Harding, 47, went onto next week's finale instead of fan favorites figure skater Mirai Nagasu and luger Chris Mazdzer.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Harding, known primarily for her involvement in an attack on fellow Olympian Nancy Kerrigan in 1994, has embarked on a comeback tour this year in the wake of the sympathetic biopic I, Tonya. She dedicated this week's rumba to her deceased father, who she says ""never abandoned me,"" and began to cry almost as soon as she took the dance floor.  “When everybody in the world was against me, my dad was still in my corner — no matter what,” she stated.    The teary performance with partner Sasha Farber merited a 33/40 from the judges, tying with Mazdzer and Witney Carson's foxtrot for the fourth best score of the night. The duo also beat out softball player Jennie Daigle and Keo Motsepe in a cha cha ballroom battle, who later went home as well.  Frontrunner figure skater Adam Rippon and Jenna Johnson's near-perfect 39/40 made them a shoo-in for the finale along with football player Josh Norman and Sharna Burgess, but fans were shocked to learn that Harding had made the cut over Nagasu. Social media quickly bemoaned the selection and questioned the show's results.  why do i have to live in a world where tonya harding is in the final round of dwts but mirai nagasu isn’t. i hate??? pic.twitter.com/i99JPJO1vO — erynn (@medgitovas) May 15, 2018  What just happened on #DWTSAthletes How on God's green earth did Tonya Harding land herself in the finale?

""I thought they were going to tell us, 'You're going home,'"" she admitted to reporters backstage after the show. ""I think America has proven that they love me and they wanted to know what happened and now they know. It's really amazing.""  Amazing for Tonya, but some very vocal Dancing With the Stars fans seem to think otherwise.  Is it love or her dancing? 2 different things.... — Annette 🌊 (@dolfin513) May 15, 2018  Love and forgiveness are not the same. — Donna Cook (@DonnaCo94051745) May 15, 2018  ABC has neglected to directly address Harding's backstory on the show, but she pled guilty to hindering the prosecution after ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt, and Shane Stant orchestrated an assault against Kerrigan meant to remove her from Olympic consideration. The subsequent scandal led the United States Figure Skating Association to serve Harding a lifetime ban from the sport.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  “It was nice to see that she had a moment,” Rippon told USA Today of Harding's performance last week, “but it’s also important to remember that skating wasn’t taken away from her – that she was banned because she was part of a bad thing.""

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  A representative for the Austin Police Department tells PEOPLE the precinct received a 911 call shortly after 2 p.m. on Monday and arrived at the scene to find Nance, 31, unresponsive. He was rushed to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.  No cause or manner of death has been determined yet, though Nance’s death does not appear to be a result of foul play. An autopsy is being performed Tuesday, with toxicology results expected to take weeks.  Nance appeared on the ABC reality series when he was 26 and revealed in his Bachelorette introduction package that he had previously struggled with prescription painkillers abuse.  “Right now, life is good, but I haven’t put as much focus on my love life because the way I was a couple years ago, no one would have wanted to be around me,” he said. “I was addicted to prescription pain medicine. It all starts out fun and then somewhere along the road, it just turned into something else. It’s a vicious cycle and it ate away at me for a long time.”  “I’m almost two years sober, now, and it’s not that easy — you have to completely change your way of living,” he continued. “But my life is really, really good today. … I’m happy and I’m content, but there are things missing in my life. I would like to fund my soulmate.”  Following his appearance on The Bachelorette, the musician and Austin native starred in a music video for his song “The Heezy.”  After learning about Nance’s passing, several members of Bachelor Nation took to Twitter to express their condolences, including Maynard.  “So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance. Such a kind heart with so much talent. Sending prayers and love to his family and friends,” she tweeted.  So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance. Such a kind heart with so much talent.

9d48c74e-4804-4868-b1cc-53f15efe945a,"Shonda Rhimes' Scandal will come to an end next year, according to a report from TVLine. The series, which is part of ABC's popular T.G.I.T Thursday night lineup, has been a hit for the network and has helped secure Rhimes' dominance and make a big name out of star Kerry Washington, who plays Washington D.C.'s ""fixer"" Olivia Pope.  This should not come as a huge surprise to big Shondaland fans, as Rhimes herself said that the show would have a shorter shelf life than her original hit, Grey's Anatomy, which is now in its 13th season. ""I feel like there is a finite amount of Scandal to be told,"" she told NPR in 2013. ""So I know what the end of Scandal will be, and I feel really good about that. And I can see where the end point is.""  Thus the show's conclusion was the decision of Rhimes, not the network. Among the advertiser-coveted 18 to 49 demographic, the show was among the 20 highest-rated shows of 2016. The current season averages 5.699 million viewers and 1.46 viewers in the 18-49 demo. While this marks a drop from the fifth season's average of 7.18 million viewers, the current live number is impressive considering the steady decline of live-viewership. Scandal remains one of ABC's most popular series and a large reason why the network routinely beats the other broadcasters on Thursday nights.  These ratings, of course, have allowed the network to pull in a hefty amount in ad revenue. At its peak, Scandal was part of a Thursday night block that brought ABC over half a billion dollars. In 2016, Scandal brought in $75 million for ABC--more than How to Get Away with Murder or The Catch, according to iSpot.tv.  ""What Shonda Rhimes possesses is this extraordinary instinct and compass for what our audience needs,"" then-president of ABC Entertainment group Paul Lee told FORBES in 2013. ""That Shonda is free and has a huge amount of power to pursue her vision is precisely how the magic happens.""  The network isn't the only beneficiary of Scandal's popularity. The show's stars have risen to prominence--and their wallets have grown--with the series. Washington routinely lands high on Forbes' list of highest-paid TV actresses. Last year, she pulled in $12 million, with about half of that coming from her salary from the show. Being on the show has made her well-known enough to land lucrative endorsement deals with the likes of Neutrogena and a commercial with Apple Music.  As a black lead on a broadcast series, Washington's star turn has also brought much-needed diversity to prime time. After the success of Scandal, Rhimes brought another African American woman--Viola Davis, the first black woman to ever win the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama--to the limelight on How to Get Away with Murder. On broadcast TV, only 22.6% of series regulars are of underrepresented racial minorities according to the 2016 Annenberg report on diversity. In dramas, like Scandal, this percentage drops. Unfortunately, that means two dramas with black leads is a big deal for the industry.  “There’s always room for our film and television, for our art, to be more representative of who we are as a culture. I think for me especially, being a person of color and a woman, you really see that intersection,"" she told WWD.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,656

It's a big moment for the model—about time, we say!—but it's not exactly shocking if you have been at all in tune with her meteoric rise to fashion fame . What is surprising? Graham was actually supposed to attend last year's gala. According to her, she was put on hold for the Manus x Machina–themed party , but after no designer stepped up to dress her, the invite fell through. The tea: At the time she thought she had been uninvited because her husband had hugged Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour , who oversees the event, upon meeting her. (You can read the whole story in her upcoming memoir, A New Model . )  This time around Graham's friends at H&M —who have previously dressed stars like Sarah Jessica Parker and Ciara for the evening—raised their hands and made her a stunning red number (see our exclusive look at her fitting below). It was inspired by Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo — the subject of the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, which the gala opens —who's known for her bold use of color and imaginative silhouettes.  “We wanted to create a gown for Ashley that reflected Kawakubo’s love of a garment’s construction,"" says H&M head of design Pernilla Wohlfahrt. ""The off-white corset is subtly deconstructed, the long red skirt is held by hook-and-eye fastenings, and it is boned to echo the construction of the corset—with ruffles of red organza that fall down the whole dress."" So as Graham hits the Met's steps in her one-of-a-kind look, we bring you the scoop on how it came to be, her secrets to red-carpet posing, and the recent wardrobe malfunction she hopes not to repeat.  Pinterest PHOTO: Courtesy of H&M  Glamour: You’re a face of H&M Studio, and you’ve walked the brand's show in Paris ; so how does it feel to be wearing H&M to your first Met Gala?  Ashley Graham: It feels amazing! H&M has been such a big supporter of me from day one—and this further proves that they believe beauty comes in different aspects. And the fact that Anna [Wintour] was like, ""Hey, you can be on the cover [of Vogue ],"" and then was like, ""Hey, you can come to the Met,"" makes me [scream]. I'm Anna Wintour–approved!  Glamour: How has this experience been different from your past red-carpet events?  AG: It’s really a team effort. I've never had so many people involved in what my hair and makeup and nails are going to look like. And I had to be careful [with the dress], because it’s a costume [event] and I want to stay within the theme, but I don’t want to look gimmicky.  Glamour: Right—as a viewer, it's disappointing when people ignore the theme. How did you and the H&M design team pay homage to Comme des Garçons?  AG: Everybody has a take on what that brand feels and looks like to them—[for me], Rei Kawakubo and Comme des Garçons is red, red, red. H&M took that inspiration—and all the great big shapes that you see in Kawakubo's designs—and made this dress. We needed to show shape, because I have a body type that, when covered by a bunch of [volume], looks like a big [blob] walking down the red carpet. So the exposed bustier is a good detail.  Glamour: How much of the design process were you involved in?  AG: The great thing about custom is that you can get involved in the design. I’ve been a part of it from the beginning, but H&M started the process by drawing. They sent over a couple of sketches of different dresses, and I picked my favorite. We edited that a little bit from there.  Pinterest PHOTO: Courtesy of H&M  Glamour: Are there any tailoring secrets you worked into the dress? One-shoulder pieces can be really hard to wear without a bra.  AG: Well, I’m going to wear Spanx— the ones that go past the knee and onto the shin. I’m tucking it them under my [strapless] bra.  Glamour: This all sounds like a dream. But have you had any unglamorous red-carpet experiences lately?  AG: Yes. At the Time 100 Gala, actually. My stylist custom made a silk black dress for me, but I didn’t have a second fitting for it, so it didn’t fit my butt very well. We pinned it and sewed it up, so that it ruched down [the back]—but as I got out of the car, my publicist went, 'Oh my God, Ashley, your butt!' and I looked back and all the seams had busted. So I walked into Lincoln Center with my hands over my butt. Thank God my stylist had thrown a long, black, silky jacket into the car—just to cover my hair in the rain—and that’s why I had a jacket on the red carpet.  Glamour: Speaking of not-so-great moments, have you had any designers say no to making you custom looks?  AG: Well, I’ve been dressed off the rack. It's hard [for designers to make custom at times] because some of the events I go to are last-minute. Custom takes time—no matter what size you are. But being dressed off the rack means, first of all, that someone at the event could be in the exact same outfit as you. It could also mean that it's not a garment that was tailored to your body.  Pinterest PHOTO: Courtesy of H&M  Glamour: Do you think you're different from the guests that H&M has dressed in the past? And if so, how?  AG: I know who else is at the [H&M] table [tonight], and there's another very, very curvalicious woman there. I don’t see how [we] are any different—because if it’s custom, size doesn't matter.  Glamour: True. So what are you most looking forward to tonight?  AG: I’m really excited to geek out on all the celebrities! I’ve been texting Lena Dunham , and she’s like, ""Girl, just stick with me."" I hope Rihanna ’s there. I know Beyoncé won't be there because she’s literally about to pop, but I would love to just be like, ""Hi."" [ Laughs. ] And I hope Andre Leon Talley interviews me when I get to the top [of the stairs]. If he doesn’t, I’m just going to look him in the eye and be like, ""Interview me!""  Glamour: And when you finally take the red carpet, what will you be channeling?  AG: Jenna Lyons gave me really good advice. She said, ""Don’t think 'sexy.' Just think about being your best you. If you’re thinking 'sexy,' you might come off too smoldering—you’re already smoldering.""

However, just a few days ago, news surfaced that Chloe had reportedly separated from her beau of four years, Austin Nichols . As E! notes, a source told Just Jared , ""They have tremendous love and respect for each other, but after almost four years, they just drifted apart. There are no hard feelings.""

As part of a special takeover, the 24-year-old singer sang, appeared in skits, and took part in a sit-down interview with Fallon. One of the highlights of the night was a pre-taped segment where fans of the pop diva were treated to a sing-along with Grande herself to her 2014 hit “One Last Time.”  “I’m here with the one and only Ariana Grande, and we’re gonna do something really fun here in the next room,” Fallon said while standing next to a smiling Grande. “We have some of Ariana’s biggest fans, and they’re gonna do a cover thinking it’s a fan video.

8c91d159-ccd9-4c5b-b9e9-0e59f555cb5d,"The Game of Thrones Season 7 finale was already the longest episode in the history of the series, but a cut scene could’ve made the 79-minute epic even longer — and it would’ve explained a mildly confusing plot twist.  Seeing Arya and Sansa fall for Littlefinger’s bullshit and go at one another’s throats for most of the season was frustrating for many viewers, but it was arguably worth it when the two Stark daughters teamed up and turned the tables on Petyr Baelish. Although the moment was undeniably awesome, it’s a little unclear when Sansa, Arya, and their brother/human computer Bran all got together to sort things out and end up on the same side. In an interview with Variety Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran, explained that they filmed that scene and it didn’t make the final episode.  “We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran’s door and says, ‘I need your help,’ or something along those lines,” Hempstead Wright explained. “So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister. So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she’s like, ‘Oh, s—.’”  Hempstead Wright’s comments seem to confirm that Arya and Sansa weren’t secretly pretending to go along with Littlefinger’s ruse the whole time, as some suspected. Seeing Sansa and Bran actually work this out would’ve made for a nice scene that could’ve helped made the Winterfell plot feel a little more organic, but it also would have made their turn on Littlefinger less shocking.  It’s kind of Season 7 in a nutshell. The story moved fast enough that the showrunners had to leave out so much connective tissue and included some overly convenient plot points, which made the season as a whole feel less cohesive than earlier seasons. That style of storytelling, though, allowed for some great, great moments.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,424

Also read: Miley Cyrus pregnant? Malibu singer has a hilarious response to the baby bump rumours  She wrote: ""RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a s— ton of tufurkey.""  Even after that, Hollywood Life reported that the Wrecking Ball singer wanted to get 'pregnant ASAP' with fiance Liam Hemsworth.  An insider reportedly told the website, ""Miley's totally ready to start a family with Liam.""

But as usual, Gossip Cop exposed the truth behind all these speculations and claimed that the insider's statement is entirely fabricated.  Given that, the Hollywood Life's report looks contrary to its own insider's statements.

Besides this, the songstress clarified in a radio interview a few months back that she is in no rush to have kids.

The streamer announced the premiere date on social media, with the caption, “The tapes were just the beginning.” That came after it teased the reveal in posts earlier Monday saying “The truth is developing” and a live-stream showing two Polaroid photos — leaving fans on tenterhooks for several hours.  Netflix announced the renewal of “13 Reasons” last May, after the freshman season debuted in March 2017 and quickly captured widespread buzz.  The first season of the series, based on Jay Asher’s young-adult book by the same name, centers around the death a high-school girl, Hannah, played by Katherine Langford, who has left behind a series of 13 cassette tapes for her friend and crush Clay (Dylan Minnette) explaining what led her to suicide. The show also stars Christian Navarro, Alisha Boe, Brandon Flynn, Justin Prentice, Miles Heizer, Brian d’Arcy James, and Kate Walsh.  Season 2 picks up in the aftermath of Hannah’s death, as the other characters start their journeys toward healing and recovery. In the upcoming season, Hannah’s parents file a lawsuit against Liberty High School. But, according to Netflix, “A series of ominous Polaroids lead Clay and his classmates to uncover a sickening secret and a conspiracy to cover it up.”  “13 Reasons Why” season 2 is being produced for Netflix by Paramount Television. The show is also executive produced by Selena Gomez, along with Mandy Teefey, Kristel Laiblin, Joy Gorman Wettels, Michael Sugar and Steve Golin.

It ranked as the fourth most-tweeted-about TV show of 2017 (after “Game of Thrones,” “Stranger Things” and “Big Brother”).  Netflix said season 2 of “13 Reasons Why” will carry a new warning video in front of each episode telling viewers about how to get help and pointing them to resources on the website 13reasonswhy.info.

Earlier today, Henry Cavill shaved off his beloved mustache, the source of so much controversy late last year. As a tribute, the Justice League and Mission Impossible star posted a video on his Facebook page to honor his former facial hair.  The video features Cavill in a bath robe telling fans that King Stache is indeed gone. He shared it to his page with the simple message ""#ShavedButNotForgotten.""  You can watch the full video above!  ""I know, it's hard to recognize me without King Stache,"" Cavill said to the camera, before turning his attention to himself in the mirror. ""Sometimes, I have a hard time recognizing myself.""  It was only a matter of time before Cavill threw some shade onto the infamous mustache incident. As you surely recall, the actor had the mustache while filming Mission: Impossible - Fallout and was brought back to the set of Justice League for extensive reshoots. Since he wasn't allowed to shave the facial hair due to his obligations to Mission: Impossible, the mustache had to be removed from Justice League via CGI. We all know how that went.  Staring right into the soul of the camera, Cavill said, ""It's hard for me to admit, this it NOT CGI.""  The video concludes with Sarah McLachlan's ""I Will Remember You"" playing over a montage of photos featuring King Stache. Of course, one of these images is the Cavill's CGI'd face, showing how terrible it looked without the mustache.  Fans have mourned the loss of the beautiful stache all morning. Popular fan artist BossLogic even paid tribute to King Stache by creating a poster, bidding goodbye to the facial hair.  So long, King Stache.

c7ebdff3-579b-4cec-93d6-5b8709f72015,"Twitter is officially doubling its character limit from 140 to 280, with the change set to roll out globally in the next few days.  The announcement comes just a few months after Twitter started testing a 280-character limit for a set number of users around the globe, courting concern from users who were worried that banishing brevity would clog up their timelines.  From Twitter's perspective early tests have been a success, with the social giant noting that where historically 9% of tweets in English used to hit the character limit, this dropped to just 1% when the 280-limit was applied.  The change will affect all users apart from those using Japanese, Chinese or Korean versions of the app; this is because they are less likely to need the extra space due to the formation of these alphabets.  Twitter claims that its initial experiment showed that people who had more room to tweet received ""more engagement"" ie tweets, retweets and likes – something that's likely to be a draw for brands who use the platform natively.  The firm also said that people who partook in the trial said they felt more satisfied with how they expressed themselves on Twitter, and the ability to sift through content. Given the platform's struggle to attract new users in recent years, Twitter is likely hoping this move will help it overcome sluggish growth up its daily user count from the current 330 million.  Banishing brevity  One of the initial criticisms leveled at Twitter was that longer posts would ruin the user experience. However, in a blog post published on Tuesday (7 November) the company was quick to assuage its community, saying that only 5% of tweets sent by users selected for testing were longer than 140 characters and that just 2% were over 190 characters.  Aliza Rosen, product manager at Twitter said: ""We – and many of you – were concerned that timelines may fill up with 280 character Tweets, and people with the new limit would always use up the whole space. But that didn’t happen... for reference, in the timeline, Tweets with an image or poll usually take up more space than a 190 character Tweet.""  When the trial initially launched, many users who had been gifted the extra characters used them to poke fun at the whole concept by way of much wordier messages. In the announcement today Twitter said this was because the function was ""new and novel"" and that this creative behaviour ""normalised"" soon after.  Since returning as chief executive in 2016, Jack Dorsey has made several major changes to Twitter. Earlier this year, the firm announced it would stop counting photos and links as part of the 140-character limit.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,504

The 20-year-old Keeping Up With the Kardashians star revealed her plans for the celebration — or lack thereof — with followers in a series of Snapchat videos on Wednesday, June 27.  “Stormi is gonna be 5 months this weekend, which really is tripping me,” she began the first Snap. “That means we’re halfway to a year — almost — and I’m already thinking about her first birthday and how it’s going to be epic, OK?”  She continued to reveal that she had already decided on a theme, but sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian used it for their daughters’ joint birthday parties earlier in June. “I was going to do super magical unicorn theme, but North and Penelope beat me to it, so I have to think of something else.”  Jenner welcomed her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott on February 1.

I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.”  The Life of Kylie star wasn’t shy about sharing sweet pics and videos of the baby girl until earlier this month, when she revealed that she’s not sharing photos of her little one “right now” after a followers accused her of cutting Stormi out of a selfie.  “Yeah I cut my baby out.

Emma Roberts' Madison Montgomery might have died at the end of the third season, Coven, but her profile's only grown over these past four years thanks to ""Surprise, bitch."" And earlier this month, Roberts confirmed her return to the AHS fold for the upcoming eighth season, Apocalypse.  Given that Apocalypse is the long-awaited Murder House/Coven crossover, Roberts' presence makes sense, and today on Instagram she shared the first actual image of Madison on the Murder House set.  EW notes that Madison is standing in the spot where the gazebo once stood, after Ben (Dylan McDermott) built it to cover the evidence of Hayden's (Kate Mara) corpse. McDermott and Connie Britton are confirmed to return as Ben and Vivien, while Jessica Lange will also reprise her Season 1 role of Constance, making her first appearance on the show since Season 4, Freak Show.  Apocalypse is shaping up to be an all-star season, with a returning cast that also includes Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Kathy Bates, Adina Porter, Cheyenne Jackson, Frances Conroy, Billy Eichner, Gabourey Sidibe, Leslie Grossman, Billie Lourd, Lily Rabe, and Stevie Nicks. Cody Fern, who was a standout in the Ryan Murphy-produced The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, is also joining the show in the role of grown-up demon spawn Michael Langdon.  Producer Alexis Martin Woodall has said the story “begins with the end of the world—and then our world begins... It starts in the real world. It’s very tangible, and it’s a familiar panic.” Creator Ryan Murphy stated that the show takes place in the near future. You can read more details about Apocalypse over here.

Too late for apologies, we truly know how you feel. #Victimblaming or #victimshaming is something u won’t understand because it hasn’t happened to you #MeToo.”  “You say this after tweeting that you only deleted the episode because people ‘weren’t ready’ to hear what you had to say?

10c4b34d-c8b5-452d-b4be-208fc2e081ca,"FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty:  President Obama has made racism worse in America.  So says the African-American actor Morgan Freeman. He told CNN's Piers Morgan that the tea party's opposition to Mr. Obama, the nation's first black president, is rooted in racism.  Freeman claims tea partiers will do whatever it takes to ""get this black man out of here.""  He adds that the tea party shows the ""weak, dark underside of America,"" and that ""we're supposed to be better than that.""  The only black Republican candidate for president pushed right back. Businessman and tea party member Herman Cain says most of the people who criticize the movement have never been to a tea party rally.  Cain says ""name calling"" will continue because opponents don't know how to stop the tea party movement.  Meanwhile - with black leaders grumbling that Mr. Obama hasn't done enough about staggering black unemployment - the president has evoked language that sounds a whole lot like the civil rights era.  He told the Congressional Black Caucus to march with him: ""Take off your bedroom slippers, put on your marching shoes.""  Americans are split on how Mr. Obama's presidency has changed race relations in the U.S.  A recent USA Today/Gallup poll shows 35% of those surveyed said race relations have improved, while 23% say they've gotten worse under President Obama.  41% percent see no change.  Back in 2008, when the nation voted for ""hope and change,"" Americans had a much rosier view of what this president would do for race relations.  Gallup found that the day after Mr. Obama was elected, a whopping 70% predicted race relations would improve.  Here’s my question to you: Has President Obama made racism worse?  Interested to know which ones made it on air?  Rick:  Not really, but a lot of people have grown weary of all the ""race card"" excuses for Obama's very poor performance. And those critical of his performance are really sick of being labeled racist. Presidents are subject to criticism of their actions, policies, and coordination with Congress. This president gets no ""get out of jail free"" card for being black.  Charles:  Yes and no. He has made racism better by allowing us to talk about the issues, debate them and see a black man as a man. We are not there yet completely, but closer. And yes, he has made it worse: just look at the type of president that he has been. Awful. I say this as a black man who voted for him. Maybe we as a nation and we here in the black community might have been better off if Hillary had won or if Colin Powell had been the first black president.  Debbie on Facebook:  No, the president has not made racism worse. People were already racist and when a man of color became president of ""their country"", they stopped trying to hide what was already there.  Barbara:  Somehow his being elected brought the worst out of people. They are having a hard time hiding their racism - just the opposite of what I hoped would happen. It’s a very sad state of affairs. No one can convince me that his race doesn't have a lot to do with the Republicans’ hatred. A lot of these good Christian, family values people are indeed racist.  Bob:  Obama has made everything worse; I think he does it on purpose.  Billy:  Herman Cain's success is proof that the economy is more of an enemy than racism. So in a weird and unanticipated way, he has actually made things better.  M.:  You have got to be kidding me with that loaded question. Short answer: No. He's bi-racial, and I think that many of the Caucasian people (Republicans and Tea Partiers) have a problem with his skin color. He didn't make it worse by running for President. This is one of the worst questions you have ever asked.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,767

The album title comes from the name of a city in Alabama about 25 minutes south of Birmingham. Sam played football at the University of Alabama at Birmingham before moving to Nashville. Once he got to Music City, Sam ended up dating a girl who lived down in Montevallo. Though that relationship is now over, that girl is the main inspiration for the songs Sam wrote and recorded for his debut project.  He tells ABC News Radio, ""I spent a lot of time talking to her about songs. I probably should have included her as a co-writer on a lot of these songs because I spent a lot of time chatting with her.""  Spending so much time with that girl made Sam tap into a vulnerable side of himself he hadn't been able to display on the football field.  ""I got a lot of insight into females in general from being in a close relationship with her,"" Sam says. ""I used a lot of that when writing on the songs, because a lot of the songs are relationship-based. I didn't want it to be just extra-macho.""  While Sam shows his sensitive side on songs like ""Break Up in a Small Town"" and ""Take Your Time,"" he also comes off as a very confident guy on other tracks such as ""House Party,"" ""Speakers"" and ""Leave the Night On.""  Sam explains, ""You know, I think there is a side of me personally that can be vulnerable, and there's also a side that can be the opposite of that.""  He adds, ""I think it takes a strength to be vulnerable, so it is a weird paradox there that I think sort of happens on the album.""

58cce3f8-7d89-4fb2-bf9d-6274aa57b118,"A recently-discovered photograph is turning the mystery surrounding Amelia Earhart’s 1937 disappearance on its head, leading a handful of experts to believe the celebrated aviator and women’s rights role model actually survived her final flight — and was captured by the Japanese.  Shortly after midnight on July 2, 1937, Earhart climbed into her Lockheed Electra at an airfield in Papua New Guinea and took off into the dark, muggy night.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Together with her navigator Fred Noonan, the 39-year-old pilot flew east toward Howland Island, a tiny sliver of land in the central Pacific Ocean, on the final leg of her boldest aeronautical adventure to date – circumnavigating the globe along the equator in a marathon 29,000-mile flight.  And then suddenly, she vanished.  “Gas is running low,” Earhart said in what’s believed to be her final radio broadcast to a Coast Guard cutter assisting with her navigation. “Have been unable to reach you by radio. We’re flying at 1,000 feet.”  The mystery of what happened to Earhart and Noonan has gone unanswered for 80 years.  Now Shawn Henry, a former executive assistant director of the FBI – and the History Channel – have come forward with the two-hour documentary Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence that premieres on Sunday, July 9 at 9 p.m. ET and attempts to answer this question.  Les Kinney/National Archives/HISTORY  Armed with a recently-discovered photograph purportedly taken of Earhart days after she crash-landed on a remote South Pacific atoll, Henry offers up a startling theory of a government cover-up that runs counter to the widely-accepted idea that she died after her plane ran out of fuel and crashed into the ocean.  “This absolutely changes history,” says Henry, who led a team of investigators examining a range of evidence, including plane parts found on a remote Pacific island consistent with the aircraft Earhart was flying.  “I think we proved beyond a reasonable doubt that she survived her flight and was held prisoner by the Japanese on the island of Saipan, where she eventually died.”  Les Kinney/National Archives/HISTORY; (Graphic)Nok Acharee  The theory that the Japanese military could be responsible for the disappearance of the two aviators – who they “may have believed were American spies,” says Henry – has been floating around for decades.  But it’s the discovery of a black-and-white photograph – unearthed by retired U.S. Treasury Agent Les Kinney in 2012 and revealed for the first time in the documentary – that suddenly makes the theory more plausible, adds the former FBI boss.  ‘Top Secret’ File  A longtime Earhart buff who has spent thousands of hours combing through government records, Kinney discovered the photo in a “formerly top secret” file in the National Archives.  “It was misfiled,” he tells Henry in the documentary, referring to the photo which depicts two blurry images on a dock believed to be Noonan and Earhart – who stares out at a nearby ship with her back turned to the camera. “That’s the only reason I was able to find it.”  WATCH: Does This Photo Prove Amelia Earhart Survived Her Final Flight?  By the time Earhart embarked on her around-the-world flight, the Japanese controlled many of the islands in the South Pacific that she and Noonan were flying on this final leg of their adventure.  Kinney insists that any document that directly refers to Earhart as a Japanese prisoner was long ago “purged” from official files to hide the fact that the government knew Earhart was a prisoner and did nothing about it, including one report that totaled more than 130 pages.  NY Daily News Archive/Getty  Kinney’s undated photograph came from an Office Of Naval Intelligence file, he says, and was meticulously examined and evaluated by two of the nation’s top forensic photo analysts, using extensive recognition and proportional comparison technology.  “I can say with more than 99.7 percent confidence that the photo is authentic and untouched,” explains digital forensic analyst Doug Carner.  Facial recognition expert Kent Gibson, who compared known images of Noonan and Earhart with the individuals photographed on the dock, believes it’s “likely” they are the two lost aviators.  “There’s nothing that points me in another direction,” says Gibson, who adds that the figure believed to be Earhart has the “same prominent, athletic shoulders as Amelia” and the same “short, bobbed hair.”  Crash site investigator and former fighter pilot Dan Hampton traveled with Henry to the remote Mili atoll, where it’s believed Earhart crash-landed after flying roughly 850 miles off course during her flight to tiny Howland Island. From there she planned to refuel then continue on Hawaii.  With her fuel tanks nearly empty, he believes she was forced to land on the rocky, coral-strewn atoll in the Marshall Islands.  Islanders have long maintained that the two flyers crash-landed there. And twisted scraps of aluminum found near the atoll decades later were tested and determined to be consistent with the same grade of metal used in planes from the 1930s.  “I’ve never seen a reef you could land an airplane on until I went out there,” says Hampton, who insists he was initially skeptical of claims that Earhart survived her flight.  Vanished Without a Trace  After her disappearance, the government launched what at the time became the largest ever sea and air search. American vessels, however, weren’t allowed into the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands.  No trace of the flyers or their plane was ever found.  Days after their alleged crash landing, Henry believes Earhart and Noonan, along with their plane, were picked up by the Japanese military and taken roughly 200 miles to Jaluit Island, where Kinney’s photograph — which contains the caption: “MARSHALL ISLANDS, JALUIT ATOLL, JALUIT ISLAND. JALUIT HARBOR.” — was later snapped on the dock.  Amelia Earhart waves from the Electra before taking off from Los Angeles, Ca., on March 10, 1937. AP  Forensic analyst Carner identified the ship that the individual presumed to be Earhart appears to be staring at as the Koshu Maru, a Japanese cargo ship.  Behind the ship on a barge is an object resembling an airplane that Gibson calculated to be 38 feet long. Records show that Earhart’s Lockheed Electra measured 38.7 feet long.  The Koshu Maru is believed to have transported the flyers nearly 2,000 miles to the island of Saipan.  In the televised special Henry interviews a former islander, now in her 90s and living in California, who is described as “the last living eyewitness” to have seen Earhart and Noonan after their crash.  Henry and his team traveled to the now-crumbling, vine-choked prison cell in Saipan where they believe Earhart spent her final two years before dying in 1939, possibly from malaria or dysentery.  Not so fast, says Dorothy Cochrane, curator for the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Aeronautics Department, who insists that she’s never seen any “definitive evidence” to suggest that the pair survived their final flight.  Cochrane, who as of press time had not yet seen the History Channel special, describes the idea that Earhart was taken prisoner by the Japanese as a “ridiculous theory.”  She also insists that she’s “not aware of any missing government records [on Earhart] that could be a game changer.”  Henry stands by his team’s findings, but acknowledges that Kinney’s photograph and their other discoveries open up countless new questions about Earhart and Noonan’s fate.  “It is not clear why the U.S. [government] might want to cover up what happened to Amelia,” he says.  “If in fact she was spying on the Japanese, the government may not have wanted the American public to know they put ‘America’s sweetheart’ in that situation and she was captured.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1482
e84f09ee-81f6-44a1-bae2-5e90ca74db41,"As more and more figures in Hollywood speak out about the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements sweeping Hollywood, they are, for the most part, also taking a step away from director Woody Allen, due to the allegations against the director brought forth by Dylan Farrow, Allen’s estranged daughter. For years, Farrow has claimed that Allen sexually abused her when she was a child. (Allen has denied the claims.) Numerous actresses—Greta Gerwig, Rebecca Hall, Ellen Page, Rachel Brosnahan, Kate Winslet—and actors—Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Timothée Chalamet—who collaborated with Allen in the past have publicly spoken out against the director in recent months. But one actress, Allen’s Oscar-winning Blue Jasmine leading lady Cate Blanchett, isn’t quite as ready to step away. In a new interview with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour, Blanchett said that social media—the birthplace of these hashtag social-justice movements—is “not the judge and jury” when it comes to Allen.  In the wake of the Time’s Up movement, Dylan Farrow has been emboldened to share her story more publicly and more often, prompting journalists such as Amanpour to press former- and current-Allen collaborators for their take on the director. Amanpour questioned Blanchett, saying: “How do you juxtapose being a #MeToo proponent, a Time’s Up proponent, and staying silent or having worked with Woody Allen?” She also asked if Blanchett would work with Allen again, given the allegations. The actress responded:  I don’t think I’ve stayed silent at all. At the time that I worked with Woody Allen, I knew nothing of the allegations, and it came out during the time that the film was released. At the time, I said it’s a very painful and complicated situation for the family, which I hope they have the ability to resolve. And if these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they’ve been through court, then I’m a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents. If the case needs to be reopened, I am absolutely, wholeheartedly in support of that. Because I think that there’s one thing about—social media is fantastic about raising awareness about issues, but it’s not the judge and jury.  Blanchett elaborated that her preference for a more codified condemnation of sexual abusers is derived from concern for future victims. “I feel that these things need to go into court, so if these abuses have happened, the person is prosecuted, and so someone, who is not in the shiny industry that I am, can use that legal precedent to protect themselves,” she explained. “Always, in my industry or any other industry, they’re preyed upon because they’re vulnerable.”  Allen, meanwhile, issued the following statement to CBS This Morning back in January after Farrow re-stated her allegations of abuse:  When this claim was first made more than 25 years ago, it was thoroughly investigated by both the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York State Child Welfare. They both did so for many months and independently concluded that no molestation had ever taken place. Instead, they found it likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup. Dylan’s older brother Moses has said that he witnessed their mother doing exactly that—relentlessly coaching Dylan, trying to drum into her that her father was a dangerous sexual predator.  Farrow named Blanchett (and a few other actresses) specifically when pointing out what was, in her view, an incongruity between defending Woody Allen while also declaring that “Time’s Up.”  This article has been updated.

8b14bb1f-f16b-496f-b349-e1e5f13970d5,"Of all the couples that walked the Oscars red carpet together on Sunday night, it’s likely none had the same symbolic significance as Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino. The actresses were among the earliest to come forward with their stories of being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein, bringing into stark relief the impact Weinstein had on their careers and on Hollywood at large. Sorvino, who won an Oscar in 1996 for the Weinstein-released Mighty Aphrodite, told The New Yorker she believed that, by turning down Weinstein’s advances, he had actively discouraged other filmmakers from working with her. Judd, who spoke to The New York Times for the first blockbuster story about Weinstein, said at the time, “Women have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it’s simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.” (Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.)  In December, Peter Jackson told New Zealand’s Stuff that executives at Miramax told him about both Judd and Sorvino, “they were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998. At the time, we had no reason to question what these guys were telling us—but in hindsight, I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing. I now suspect we were fed false information about both of these talented women—and as a direct result their names were removed from our casting list.”  Sorvino tweeted an emotional response to Jackson’s revelation:  Speaking to Vanity Fair’s Krista Smith on the red carpet, Judd and Sorvino spoke about the goals of the Time‘s Up movement: “I want people to know that this movement isn’t stopping, we’re going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,“ Sorvino said:  During the ceremony, Judd will present an award alongside two other women who have accused Weinstein: Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. As Rebecca Keegan reported from the Oscars rehearsals, Sciorra—who claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her, and that her career suffered as a result—seemed visibly overwhelmed to be onstage.  Though the Time’s Up movement, which announced its presence forcefully with pins and an all-black dress code at the Golden Globes, announced it planned to look beyond the red carpet in its activism, Judd and Sorvino’s united presence was a reminder of how striking, and symbolic, a red carpet appearance can be.

The 'Come And Get It' singer's rollercoaster romance with the 'Sorry' hitmaker is said to have ended recently, but her mother Mandy Teefey has suggested she would be the last one to know what the situation is right now.  Tense: Selena Gomez refuses to talk to her mother about her on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber  Asked by E! News for an update on her 25-year-old daughter's relationship with the 24-year-old pop star, she simply replied: 'You would know before I did. We don't talk about it.'  It comes after reports claiming despite the apparent split, Justin still has his former flame on his mind.  An insider told People: 'He isn't dating. He thinks and talks about Selena all the time. The chapter with her is definitely not finished.'  On-again, off-again: Selena's mother doesn't approve of Justin Bieber  Although he has made an effort to develop a better relationship with Selena's friends and family - but they're not convinced he's a suitable boyfriend.  The insider added: 'Justin does care what her friends and family think and has tried to win them over, but some of them are just over it. They're there for Selena and support her no matter what, but don't feel like they need to welcome back Justin.  'If you notice, Selena keeps her friends and Justin separate - when she's with Justin, it's just Justin, and when she's with her old friends, it's just them. They don't really overlap anymore.'  Selena's mother has previously questioned whether Justin, 24, is a suitable boyfriend for her daughter.  And the 'Wolves' hitmaker is said to be focused on rebuilding her relationship with Mandy.  The source told Entertainment Tonight: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too.'",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,371

The pair became engaged in London on July 18, 2018, Priyanka's birthday, before they headed to Mumbair to celebrate their engagement.  Now, they have celebrated their fairytale wedding in style and married at Umaid Phawan Palace in Jodhpur, India, after a week of amazing celebrations.

023cabbd-34c7-4ec0-9120-ba3f5a54091d,"Born in 1971 in Baltimore, Maryland, actress Jada Pinkett Smith landed her big break on the sitcom A Different World. She went on to star in films like The Nutty Professor, with Eddie Murphy , and Spike Lee 's Bamboozled, before her prominent contributions to The Matrix Reloaded and the animated Madagascar. Pinkett Smith later returned to television with starring roles on Hawthorne and Gotham, and helped make Girls Trip a surprise box-office hit in 2017. She is married to actor Will Smith , with whom she has children Jaden and Willow .  Early Life and Career Launch on 'A Different World'  Actress Jada Pinkett was born on September 18, 1971, in Baltimore, Maryland. The daughter of contractor Robsol Pinkett Jr. and nurse Adrienne Banfield-Jones, she attended the Baltimore School of the Arts as a teenager, where one of her classmates and friends was the late rap artist Tupac Shakur.  Following cameos in various TV shows, the diminutive actress got her first big break in 1991 with a recurring role on the Cosby Show spinoff, A Different World. Although her character, Lena James, eventually garnered more screen time, A Different World was running on fumes following the loss of several original characters, and was canceled after the sixth and final season in 1993.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Early Film Career: 'Menace II Society' to 'Ali'  Pinkett Smith's film career took off with the 1993 movie Menace II Society, leading to featured roles in Jason's Lyric (1994), Set it Off (1996), The Nutty Professor (1996), Scream 2 (1997) and Return to Paradise (1998). She went on to appear in Spike Lee's highly controversial Bamboozled (2000), a satire of racial bias in the television industry, and the following year she joined husband Will Smith in the biopic Ali, in which she played boxing great Muhammad Ali's first wife, Sonji.  Big-Screen Stardom: 'The Matrix' and 'Madagascar'  Pinkett Smith soon became known for her role as human rebel Niobe in the films The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003). She voiced the character of Gloria the hippopotamus for Madagascar (2005), returning for its many sequels, before co-starring in the dramas Reign Over Me (2007), with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle, and The Women (2008) with Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Eva Mendes and Debra Messing. Also in 2008, Pinkett Smith made her debut as a director and writer in the independent feature The Human Contract.  'Bad Moms' and 'Girls Trip'  Largely absent from the big screen following her directing debut, Pinkett Smith returned for a supporting role in Magic Mike XXL (2015) and joined the ensemble cast of Bad Moms (2016). Continuing down the path of R-rated comedies, she featured prominently in the surprise hit Girls Trip (2017), with Queen Latifah, Tiffany Haddish and Regina Hall.  Return to TV: 'Hawthorne' and 'Gotham'  In 2009, Pinkett Smith returned to television as the executive producer and star of Hawthorne, playing the titular chief nursing officer. While she won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series, Hawthorne failed to distinguish itself as a medical drama and was canceled after three seasons.  Pinkett Smith followed by joining the cast of Gotham, a small-screen Batman origin story. Her gangster character of Fish Mooney, created specifically for the series, featured prominently in Season 1, though the plot twists kept her sidelined until the second half of Season 2.  'Red Table Talk'  In May 2018, Pinkett Smith launched Red Table Talk on Facebook Watch. Sharing hosting duties with mom Adrienne and daughter Willow, the actress said her show would delve into issues that had affected her family, from differing generational viewpoints. ""My mother is old school, Willow is new school, and I find myself right in the middle,"" she said.  Red Table Talk proved to be a headline-grabber thanks to Pinkett Smith's willingness to share all kinds of personal information, including her admissions that she had undergone vaginal rejuvenation and that she was once addicted to using sex toys.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,793
5a7d1d6e-5359-4b35-b6b7-67fd4b0ce798,"Ivanka Trump is getting some extra notice lately.  Well, more accurately, Trump's eyes are getting some extra notice lately.  As she makes more and more public appearances in her new official role in the White House, people are looking closely and realizing Trump's eyes may not be what they appear.  REUTERS  As it turns out, if you stare deeply into Trump's eyes, you'll notice they change repeatedly over time.  At various different public appearances, Trump's eyes are different colors. Naturally, her eyes -- like her hair -- are brown.  REUTERS  But sometimes, she changes it up. Her eyes have appeared a lighter hazel, green and even blue at various points over time, including during the 2016 presidential election.  Check out the changes for yourself:  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  As you can see, Trump's eyes are a revolution over time.  There doesn't appear to be an exact method to the eye-color-changing madness.  Her eyes were brown when she stared at Justin Trudeau.  REUTERS  But they were green when she had a controversial interview with Gayle King on CBS.  This eye color phenomenon has been noticed at least as far back as early November, when Esquire questioned Trump's eye color.  Then, press representatives did not respond to Esquire's request for comment on if she wears color-changing contacts, so we just have to go off common sense and say that's what's happening (it's more likely than her eyes spontaneously changing color on opposite sides of the genetic spectrum).  Although some women have said their eyes changed colors over the course of pregnancy -- and Trump was pregnant last year -- that doesn't explain why the color hopped around so much.  Maybe she likes the way it looks and it gives her confidence. Maybe she wants to give off a lighter tone to be more likable (see: all the Disney characters with blue eyes), which, yeah, is a racial thing.  And if you really want to go down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole (and I know you do), you could consider the implications of making oneself blonde and blue-eyed. Like what Nazis like.  As this news continues to be reported, many people are wondering why.  Twitter  Twitter  There is certainly a lot going on in the Trump world. But you clicked here, didn't you?

9fa565af-e133-4a42-a572-185a93e257a0,"A senior Iranian cleric and member of parliament has just dropped a bombshell.He is claiming that the Obama administration, as part of negotiating during the Iran Deal, granted U.S. citizenship to 2500 Iranians including family members of government officials.From Fox News:Hojjat al-Islam Mojtaba Zolnour, who is chairman of Iran’s parliamentary nuclear committee and a member of its national security and foreign affairs committee, made the allegations during an interview with the country’s Etemad newspaper, cited by the country’s Fars News agency. He claimed it was done as a favor to senior Iranian officials linked to President Hassan Rouhani, and he alleged the move sparked a competition among Iranian officials over whose children would benefit from the scheme.Several children of current and former Iranian officials live in the United States, including Ali Fereydoun, whose father is brother and special aide of President Hassan Rouhan, and Fatemeh Ardeshir Larijani, whose father Ali Larijani is speaker of parliament.While Zolnour did not mention any names, he obviously was trying to make a political point.“When Obama, during the negotiations about the JCPOA, decided to do a favor to these men, he granted citizenship to 2,500 Iranians and some officials started a competition over whose children could be part of these 2,500 Iranians,” he claimed. “If today these Iranians get deported from America, it will become clear who is complicit and sells the national interest like he is selling candies to America.” The conservative Zolnour, who is in Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s inner circle, added: “It should be stated exactly which children of which authorities live in the United States and have received citizenship or residency.”He said while some were studying in the U.S. others were working in the U.S. “against our national interests.”It’s not clear who he’s talking about and whether he’s confusing a green card with citizenship. And one has to take his political objective into account.But it obviously raises a concerning question.There have been so many things hidden from the public about the Iran Deal if this was one more thing given up in bribe, it wouldn’t be hard to believe.And it shouldn’t be hard to track this down with a little government and Congressional investigation.The problem, of course, too many Obama holdovers in places like the State Department so you can’t get a straight answer.Asked about the cleric’s claim, a State Department spokesperson said: “We’re not going to comment on every statement by an Iranian official.” Fox News analyst and former Obama State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf was dubious of the Iranian official’s allegation. “This sounds like totally made up BS,” she said. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment. A representative for Obama Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson also could not be reached for comment.This would certainly anger Republicans, especially in the wake of the pallets of cash, sanctions relief and giving access to the U.S. financial system that has already been revealed about the deal.And in Iran, they could fuel resentment toward Tehran’s elite. “Many ordinary Iranians are surprised and feel betrayed that children of the regime officials live and work in the U.S.,” Saeed Ghasseminejad, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based research institute, told Fox News. “The regime officials chant death to America but send their children to the U.S., away from the hell they have created in Iran over the past four decades.” Ghasseminejad said some Iranians have called for their deportation from America: “Iranians don’t understand why the U.S. government allows the offspring of the regime officials to live in the U.S., while the U.S. has introduced a travel ban for ordinary Iranian citizens and many Americans are imprisoned in Iran. That is why many Iranians on social media have been urging the U.S. government to deport the children of the regime officials.”The protests have hit the country hard as the economy has continued to crater. The Iran Deal was expected to help the country but the people in the street didn’t feel the difference. And now pulling out of the Iran Deal has facilitated a drop in the value of the rial against the dollar. And as a result of pulling out of the deal, international firms and oil companies have dropped deals with Iran.There’s a lot of jockeying for power behind the scenes here.But it could be interesting if it’s the failure of the Iran Deal that actually deals the final blow to the Islamists and it brings the secularists back.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,851

I wish more people would talk about therapy. We girls, we’re taught to be almost too resilient, to be strong and sexy and cool and laid-back, the girl who’s down. We also need to feel allowed to fall apart.”  Selena On Interacting With Fans In Public: “Somebody I used to hang out with would always get very frustrated with me. But I have a hard time saying no to children.”  Selena On Moving Beyond Disney: “I worked with Disney for four years. It’s a very controlled machine. They know what they represent, and there was, 100 percent, a way to go about things… For a guy there’s a way to rebel that can work for you. But for a woman, that can backfire. It’s hard not to be a cliché, the child star gone wrong. I did respect my fans and what I had, but I was also figuring out what I was passionate about and how far I was willing to go.”  Selena On Life Changing In The Spotlight: I’m a late bloomer. I grew up around adults, but in terms of getting out, having friends. At times I really didn’t know anything but my job… My mom gave up her whole life for me. Where we’re from, you don’t really leave. So when I started gaining all this success, there was a guilt that came with it. I thought, Do I deserve this?”  Selena On Not Feeling Career Pressure Right Now: “For a change,” she says, “it feels like I don’t have to be holding my breath and waiting for somebody to judge a piece of work that I’m doing. I’m not eager to chase a moment. I don’t think there’s a moment for me to chase.”  Selena On Limiting Her Network, Privately And Publicly: “I think seventeen people have my phone number right now. Maybe two are famous… As soon as I became the most followed person on Instagram, I sort of freaked out. It had become so consuming to me. It’s what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict, and it felt like I was seeing things I didn’t want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn’t want to care about. I always end up feeling like shit when I look at Instagram. Which is why I’m kind of under the radar, ghosting it a bit… Look, I love what I do, and I’m aware of how lucky I am, but, how can I say this without sounding weird? I just really can’t wait for people to forget about me.”  The article notes Gomez declined to discuss her relationship with The Weeknd, with the writer saying, “She tells me that everything she has said about her relationships in the past has come back to bite her, and that she will never do it again.” The full issue of Vogue will hit newsstands on March 28.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,688

dd43e67f-082d-4ebb-8f9f-887a7108345b,"Chrissy Teigen has never been shy about her experiences with childbearing (despite the many trolls ), letting other women who have gone through fertility issues and postpartum depression know that they're not alone. After trying for years to get pregnant and undergoing in vitro fertilization, Teigen and husband John Legend welcomed little Luna Simone into their family last year. And soon the Legend-Teigen clan might be getting slightly bigger, with Teigen revealing on Wednesday that the couple will be trying for another baby with her last remaining embyro.  In InStyle 's November cover story , Teigen gets candid about the challenging journey she took to conceive Luna, who turned 1 in April, and, hopefully, baby No. 2. The model and Twitter laureate told the magazine that she wishes she had extracted more eggs during her fertility treatments from a few years ago, because the resulting 20 embryos were narrowed to just three healthy and usable ones.  ""The first little girl didn't work, and then the second is Luna,” she said.  Teigen also elaborated on her experiences with postpartum depression and the decision to speak openly about her diagnosis. At first, InStyle reports, she didn't want to speak up because she didn't understand what she was going through and didn't think she had the right.  “I thought I was just being a selfish a-hole,” she told the publication. Things got better, Teigen says, after she was diagnosed and began taking the right medications. But the supermodel still has to battle through some days and said she's steeled herself for her condition getting more serious if she is going to have another baby.  “I have really good days and really bad days, and I don't tend to talk about the really bad days,” she said. “But I would hate for people to think those days didn’t exist.”  Previously, Teigen penned a moving open letter for us about her experiences with PPD, sharing details of her treatment as well as addressing other women who have faced the condition and the stigma surrounding it.  “I know I might sound like a whiny, entitled girl,” she wrote. “Plenty of people around the world in my situation have no help, no family, no access to medical care. I can't imagine not being able to go to the doctors that I need. It's hurtful to me to know that we have a president who wants to rip health care away from women. I look around every day, and I don’t know how people do it. I've never had more respect for mothers, especially mothers with postpartum depression.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,502
18a0d0af-e925-486e-ab66-130eec143728,"After hearing the news that American Idol would be returning to TV next year, we were full of questions: Who would the next judges be? Would J.Lo continue to serve up amazing glam moments? Would Ryan Seacrest give up his spot at Live with Kelly?  Nevertheless, we were giddy with excitement, and since the announcement that Katy Perry would take one of the coveted judge's seats for the new season, our enthusiasm was brought to a whole other level. Perry seems pretty thrilled by the news too, and the ""Bon Appetit"" singer's reported $25 million paycheck (and what would be the biggest salary in the show's history), according to TMZ, is the cherry on the cake (or in the pie?).  The news came up during Perry's appearance on 103.5 KTU with Carolina Bermudez on Tuesday. The radio show host asked the songstress if it bothers her that the entire Internet is talking about how much she's getting paid for the gig, and Perry had the perfect response for any naysayers: ""I'm really proud that, as a woman, I got paid,"" she said. ""And you know why? I got paid like more than like pretty much any guy that's been on that show. And, by the way, I love men. So I'm a paid woman and I'm ready for a beautiful man.""  No matter how big the payout, Perry's ultimate goal is finding America's next rising star. ""This show is about finding real talent, making peoples' dreams come true and additionally hearing their stories,"" she said. ""I want to see you. I want to hear you. I want to witness you.""

2f7cf716-3c97-4235-b471-941d7c05dbca,"Brad Pitt reportedly couldn't resist canoodling with Jennifer Aniston in a restaurant, causing even more concern for her allegedly troubled marriage to Justin Theroux.  After Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, Twitter found entertainment in imagining Jennifer Aniston’s glee. Jolie had reportedly been at least partly responsible for causing Jennifer and Brad’s split, leading some to speculate that Aniston felt gleeful over the crumbling of Pitt’s second marriage.  In recent months, however, the relationship between Jennifer and Brad reportedly has changed. Even though Aniston is now married to Justin Theroux, Jennifer allegedly just “can’t let go” of Pitt, and it’s rumored to be destroying her romance with Justin, as the Inquisitr reported. Now, Jennifer and Brad have gone from a platonic reunion to a rekindled romance, according to a new report.  Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston: “Always In Love”  Yahoo quoted an insider’s claim that Brad and Jennifer have “always been in love.” Recalling the era when Pitt and Aniston were Hollywood’s golden couple, the source said that Jennifer and Brad have continued to have feelings for each other despite her marriage to Justin Theroux and his marriage to Angelina Jolie.  “They were once the golden couple of Hollywood and apparently Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston still hold a soft spot in their hearts for one another.”  Quoting Woman’s Day magazine, Yahoo reported that Pitt and Aniston recently just happened to encounter each other in Los Angeles during Jennifer’s dinner date. Aniston was with friends at Soho House. During her meal, Brad showed up and joined the group, according to the insider.  Brad Pitt Caught Canoodling With Jennifer Aniston  Even though Aniston and Pitt were in a public restaurant, Brad apparently could not resist the temptation, an observer told the publication.  “Brad kissed Jen’s neck and whispered something into her ear before giving her a knowing glance.”  One insider, the former security guard to Pitt, revealed even more about Brad’s rumored feelings for Jennifer. Kris Herzog told the magazine that even though Pitt was married to Angelina Jolie and Aniston is still married to Justin Theroux, the former lovebirds never lost their love for each other.  Jennifer Aniston’s marriage to Justin Theroux reportedly is troubled amid her renewed romance with Brad Pitt. Francois Mori / AP Images  “Brad and Jen are in love and always have been,” declared Kris.  Moreover, Herzog claimed that Pitt and Aniston have been spending a lot of time together in the wake of Angelina filing for divorce in 2016.  Brad Pitt Not Totally To Blame For Jennifer Aniston’s Allegedly Troubled Marriage  Jolie and Brad famously met on the movie set of Mr. And Mrs. Smith during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer and Brad were married for five years before splitting in 2005. Aniston dated Justin Theroux for four years prior to tying the knot in in 2015.  In contrast, Pitt and Jolie were together for 11 years, although they were married for only two years. They are currently co-parenting six children, ranging in age from 16-year-old Maddox, 14-year-old Pax, and 13-year-old Zahara to 11-year-old Shiloh Jolie-Pitt and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  Brad and Angelina’s divorce has earned extensive publicity, including the battle for custody of the kids. But rumors that Pitt’s renewed romance with Aniston has hurt her marriage to Justin Theroux have remained unconfirmed. People Magazine pointed out that the rumors are linked to the seemingly separate lives that Jennifer and Justin live.  “Despite tabloid claims of trouble due to their frequent distance, Aniston and Theroux’s two-year marriage is solid, [some insiders insist].”  Jennifer and Justin both have busy lives because of their careers, which often force them to work long distances apart. But even though Aniston and Theroux appear to be separated, one of the insiders said that Jennifer and Justin “have figured out a life that works for them.”  As for how Aniston’s rumored rekindled romance with Brad has affected her relationship with Theroux, Pitt isn’t getting all of the blame for any problems. According to the Hollywood Gossip, Jennifer’s marriage to Justin was in trouble even before her alleged reunion with Brad. An insider quoted by the publication said that Aniston’s and Theroux’s relationship “has been crumbling,” and Pitt’s ability to console Jennifer while she’s vulnerable reportedly has made her marriage to Justin even more troubled.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,850

When model Tati Neves, 26, was asked if she kissed the Baby singer , she coyly answered: ""What do you think, if I was sleeping in the bedroom, just me and him?""  That really clears it up then.  Before the interview on Brazilian TV the model allegedly told friends she saw Bieber smoke weed and spent the night with him.  On Globo TV's Fantastico she was asked if she saw a bevy of girls arrive at 3am the same night, believed to bussed in from a nearby club, she replied: ""No. So, I'd already gone into the bedroom with him.""  She also claimed she had taken the video of Bieber asleep, with his beloved baseball cap nearby, the following morning after waking up first.  (Image: Youtube)  She said: ""I was sleeping, and woke up, he was sleeping and I was speaking with a girlfriend.""  Tati, who appears naked on some adult Brazilian websites, is thought to have met Bieber in the Centaurus club in Rio which is notorious for being a brothel.  But Marcus Mion, the owner of the Zax Club in the Barra da Tijuca neighborhood, disputed the model's account.  He said Ms Neves wasn't among the 30 girls the singer chose to go back with him to his rented villa.  (Image: Youtube)  He said: ""I know all the girls who went. I personally went round asking inviting them on behalf of Justin, and I put each one in the van that took them there.""  Two girls were pictured leaving the club with Bieber, although his aides insist he thought it was a private members’ club.  Bieber has now left Brazil and is in Argentina on the South America leg of his world tour.  He has been asked to leave the Hotel Faena in Buenoa Aires because his fans were destroying property and barricade walls put up for his arrival.

When an industry insider remarked to Lauer last week that celebrities are being advised to avoid Kelly’s “Megyn Kelly Today” — amid ratings struggles and awkward snafus with famous guests — a Page Six spy overheard Lauer reply that he “gets it,” adding, “It’s a big problem for them,” meaning Kelly’s show. Insiders were stunned that the veteran “Today” host didn’t try to defend his new colleague.  We’re told publicists have been steering their clients to other shows, partly because of Kelly’s ailing ratings and partly because of the dust-ups with Jane Fonda and Debra Messing. In September — just two days into her run as host of the 9 a.m. hour of “Today” — Kelly upset Fonda by bringing up the actress’ plastic surgery past.  Messing said that she “regretted” appearing on the show after an awkward moment during which Kelly asked a “superfan” audience member, “Is it true that you became a lawyer, and you became gay, because of [co-star Eric McCormack’s character] Will?”  Another reason that Hollywood flacks are booking clients elsewhere is that Kelly is struggling to hang on to viewers. As Page Six recently reported, her numbers are nearly at an all-time low for the famed NBC morning show and she continues to drag down “Kathie Lee & Hoda.”  “This week was the lowest Kathie and Hoda have rated since 2010,” said a source. “It keeps getting worse. Megyn is killing them. It is a real problem and no one wants to book Megyn’s show,” the insider said. Another source added, “They can keep telling you about all the lunches they’re taking her to, but it’s not helping the ratings.”  But a rep for “Today” downplayed any drama, telling us: “Sounds like a few troublemakers are trying to stir up drama where there just isn’t any. Everyone’s doing just fine at the ‘Today’ show.”  NBC crowed this week that “Today” “was the No. 1 morning show outright, topping ‘Good Morning America’ in total viewers and all demos last Monday.”  Related Video 1:55 Megyn Kelly is making morning TV very awkward",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,469
32597ace-5a22-47d2-9114-ab302d3bbef5,"It's been almost two years since Angelina Jolie announced her split from Brad Pitt, and their divorce continues to get ugly.  In court documents filed Tuesday, Jolie's attorneys allege Pitt hasn't paid any ""meaningful"" child support for a year and a half. Now, she's planning to seek a court order for retroactive funds.  NBC News obtained the court docs, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, in which Jolie's lawyers request a status conference with a judge.  ""(Pitt) has a duty to pay child support,"" wrote Jolie attorney Samantha Bley DeJean, NBC reports. ""As of present, (Pitt) has paid no meaningful child support since separation.""  But a person familiar with the situation not authorized to speak publicly disputes the notion Pitt has not been financially responsible for his children, telling USA TODAY Pitt has fulfilled his commitments.  More from USA Today:  ""The aim of Angelina's routine court filing is to provide closure to the marriage in a way that clears a path toward the next stage of their lives and allows her and Brad to recommit as devoted coparents to their children,"" Jolie spokesperson Mindy Nyby tells USA TODAY.  The couple have six children: Maddox, 17; Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12; and 10-year old twins Vivienne and Knox.  On the career front, both actors have been busy. Jolie has been filming ""Maleficent 2"" this summer in London, while Pitt is currently filming Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" alongside Leonardo DiCaprio. Pitt's upcoming sci-fi film ""Ad Astra"" is set for release on January 11, 2019.  Jolie filed for divorce in September 2016, claiming the separation was ""for the health of the family."" The famous couple proceeded to battle publicly – always through their reps – for months over custody of their children.  But Jolie and Pitt seemed to bury the hatchet in January 2017, releasing a joint statement saying they had agreed to handle their divorce in a private forum and would work together to reunify their family.  That changed this June, when their custody struggle exploded in the spotlight once again after multiple outlets reported Jolie could be in danger of losing custody if she didn't start encouraging her children to forge relationships with her ex.  A judge in Jolie and Pitt's divorce case determined that their six children's lack of ""a relationship with their father is harmful to them,"" adding that, ""it is critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother.""  Representatives for Jolie pushed back, calling the reports inaccurate and an unfair depiction of what was going on behind the scenes.  Jolie continues to be represented by divorce lawyer Laura Wasser, Nyby said. Pitt has been represented by Lance Spiegel.

cc6ddba9-b8ec-45ff-bb2e-6b283f2b7d94,"Fans of RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars may have thought they had seen the last of the eliminated queens. However, Ru is always full of surprises and his biggest twist yet happened in the season finale. He brought back the eliminated queens who determined the top two for the season. Because of their decision, Trixie Mattel won Drag Race All Stars 3, and pretty much no one saw it coming. The eliminated queens returning to Drag Race changed everything, because for the first time in the series’ herstory, they had the real power.  In previous seasons of All Stars, Ru had made determinations of who the top queens would be through their performances in various challenges. This season, that changed. The eliminated queens were back as a “Jury of Queer Peers” in Ru’s words. They acted in similar roles to other iconic reality TV shows that maintain a jury pool, like Survivor or Big Brother.  In the end, the top two queens the jury chose were Trixie Mattel and Kennedy Davenport. Then it was between them to see who could win the crown.  This was a much more exciting returning twist than the first time the eliminated queens came back to the competition in Episode 7. Then, it could have given a returning queen the boost to ride and potentially win the competition. However, it ended up being rather anticlimactic. That is because the queen who returned, Morgan McMichaels, was sent back home the week after she’d returned. This second return of the queens was so much more dramatic, though.  Their decision brought up a central question for viewers: What does it mean to be the winning Drag Race Queen? This twist mattered so much because it is what fundamentally changed the competition and its future. In the past, it has been clear that the queen who was most successful throughout the competition deserved to be crowned queen. All Stars 3 was different.  The eliminated queens determined the top two based on who they felt needed the title and money the most. They chose to reward the queens that they felt needed a bigger platform or wouldn’t be as successful on their own without the win. It really was a backhanded compliment when the eliminated queens picked Kennedy and Trixie as the top two. The most successful and deserving queens in the competition were barred from competing, in that sense.  Of course, that meant that Shangela was not going to even get a shot at the crown. She has one of, if not the largest fanbase of any of the queens this season and ended up winning tens of thousands of dollars throughout the competition. It was clear that Shangela had been the front-runner — however, her success outside this competition clearly kept her from being considered for the top two.  Shangela had won more challenges than anyone and she had never lost a lip-sync. She had proven throughout the competition that if it wasn’t BenDeLaCreme who would win, the crown should most logically be hers. Despite that, she wasn’t allowed to lip-sync for her legacy in the end.  But Shangela was not the only one who was robbed of an opportunity. While BeBe had clearly made some enemies with her demeanor throughout the show, she had been consistently one of the best after Shangela. However, it was obvious that the eliminated queens didn't want BeBe to potentially win two crowns. Again, in their view, she didn’t “need” the win.  More than in any previous season of Drag Race, the eliminated queens of All Stars 3 truly mattered. Despite BenDeLaCreme and Shangela absolutely dominating the competition, it was not to be that either of them would wear the crown. Finally, it was the eliminated queens' decision that allowed Trixie to win the crown. While some, (perhaps rightfully) think that twist was unfair or out of place, the season is now over. Ultimately, it is RuPaul’s drag world, and we’re all just living in it.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,763

The star, who recently opened up to The Hollywood Reporter about her estranged relationship with her mother, also defended her interview after it sparked some backlash online.    In a series of tweets posted late Monday night, the “Modern Family” actress wrote, “Rant – Something I wish people would realize… I am NOT trying to be featured on Snapchat, I am not trying to be pap’d everywhere I go, I am literally just LIVING and unfortunately, I can’t do that without paparazzi following me around everyday. I’m not trying to show you my a-- in shorts when I go to the grocery store. I’m trying to live my life. People wear shorts. People have wardrobe malfunctions. No one is perfect.”  Winter continued, “I don’t know what to wear everyday so I look ‘appropriate’ and ‘fashionable.’ Also, screw to always having to look appropriate and fashionable. For what? Society? Who gets to decide what is appropriate and fashionable? I wear what I like and no one should fault me for that. I don’t want people to constantly see me in the news for going to dinner, or grocery shopping, or anything. I want to be in the news when I ASK for it by going to a publicized event. So trust me, I don’t want to see me in shorts putting water in my car every single d--- day as much as you don’t.”  She went on to address the cruel criticism she received after her interview with The Hollywood Reporter, in which she spoke openly about being sexualized by her mother at a young age. “I’d also like to address the tweets I get saying ‘you accused your own mother of sexualizing you yet you’re a w----.’ I was a CHILD being dressed like I was 24. I was 8-13 years old. I wasn’t an ADULT as I am now. As a child, you do what you’re told regardless of what is good for you,” Winter said. The star added, “Just because I DECIDE to show my body occasionally doesn’t mean I’m unintelligent or that I’m talentless or that I have no self respect.”  As Gossip Cop reported, Winter slammed the suggestion that she was “asking for it” by posting a photo on Instagram of herself wearing a bikini while on a boat with her nieces in 2015. After she uploaded the picture on social media, the comments section soon filled with remarks criticizing the actress’s body. Winter later wrote, “It sickens me to think at 17 years old, a photo of myself with my nieces is suggesting that I’m ‘asking for it.’ Celebrate you and don’t let anyone’s comments allow you to think less of yourself.

During this same week last year, CNN averaged 1.191 million. That is a -29 percent collapse.CNN’s average total day viewers disintegrated by -25 percent, 841K compared to 635K.In other words, throughout the day last week, CNN could only attract an average of 635,000 total viewers.Fox News, however, is thriving. Last week, Fox averaged 2.487 million primetime viewers, nearly three times that of CNN’s 844K, and 1.463 million total day viewers, more than twice CNN’s 635K.While MSNBC is in a distant second place behind Fox, it is still leaving CNN in the dust with an average of 1.667 million primetime viewers and 913K total day viewers.Incredibly, CNN’s second week of May this year was even worse than the first week, which was already catastrophic. During week one, CNN attracted a dismal 859K primetime viewers, but that was still better than week two, which dropped even further to 844K. In total day viewers, the anti-Trump channel dipped from a ruinous week one of just 649K viewers to an even more ruinous week two of 635K.Compared to the full month of May last year, the Stormy Daniels Network is collapsing even more in the advertiser-coveted 25-54 age demo.During the full month of May 2017, CNN average 399K demo viewers during primetime. Last week that number collapsed a whopping -35 percent to just 259K. In total day, the damage was -34 percent, from 274K demo viewers to a humiliating 183K.By comparison, Fox News averaged 492K demo viewers during primetime (almost double CNN) and 296K demo viewers during the total day.MSNBC averaged 326K demo viewers during primetime and 190K during total day.The third week of May is already looking like it could be even worse for CNN. On Monday, despite the massive news surrounding the opening of the American embassy in Jerusalem, CNN averaged a dismal 643K total day viewers, compared to Fox and MSNBC’s 1.76 million and 1.13 million, respectively.During primetime Monday, CNN could only attract a scant 765K total viewers.

3cb455cc-0ec5-431b-beb6-5a35cf13307a,"CLOSE A news outlet’s investigation into missing persons in Humboldt County, California turned up a surprising find: one of them is currently appearing on ""The Bachelor."" Buzz60  After Bachelor Nation witnessed her emotional departure, Bekah Martinez (aka Bekah M.) appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Monday night. And while she did talk about her disappearance from Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of ABC's dating show, it was her appearance on a Humboldt County, Calif. missing persons list that was largely on Kimmel's mind.  Humboldt County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Samantha Karges told The North Coast Journal Martinez was reported missing on Nov. 18 by her mother who had not heard from her since Nov. 12. Karges said, ""Martinez had reportedly come to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.""  Offering an explanation as to why she made the missing person's list, Martinez said, ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying that I was on a farm when I was actually on The Bachelor, but no. I had already been eliminated from the show, and I just decided to go up to the mountains with some friends for a couple of weeks.""  ""I was there for six or seven days without phone service, which I thought I was going to have phone service and I told my mother that I would,"" she continued.  Martinez told the late night host that after about a week she felt a strong inclination to return home.  ""I just had this weird feeling on like the sixth or seventh day, I was like, 'I need to go home now,'"" she said. ""So, I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents and then come to find out only 12 hours before my mother had called the Humboldt (County) Sheriff’s (Office) saying that I was missing.""

Well, can you imagine her twirling in a white gown on her wedding day? Hard, isn't it? But fans of the stunning British actress have to prepare themselves for the sight as it is reported that Watson may be engaged and is preparing to tie the knot.  The shocking claim comes from Life & Style Magazine. The tabloid claims that the actress has begun planning her ""dream wedding"" with her techie boyfriend. The Harry Potter star has been rumoured to be dating William ""Mack"" Knight for nearly two years now and the couple are between wedding talks.  Also Read: Beauty and The Beast: Five Emma Watson outfits that eclipse the princess gowns  The news was broken by a diner who was sitting on another table close to Emma and Knight's at dinner in San Diego's Jupiter and Ivy. The curious diner reportedly eves dropped their conversation and overheard the couple discussing their wedding plans.  Talking to the magazine, the diner claimed, ""They could be heard discussing what their dream wedding would be like. They talked about which family members they would invite and where the wedding would take place, in America or London. They even talked about flowers and a honeymoon.""  While this comes as a heart-breaking news for fans, Gossip Cop has clarified that this is a fake story. Debunking the wedding talks, the gossip website contacted sources close to Watson and confirmed that there is no wedding being planned as of now. The site wrote: ""She isn't planning a wedding, and the tabloid's story is simply ""not true."" In fact, there's no reason to believe the actress is engaged to Knight, let alone preparing the nuptials.""  Fans are aware that the actress has kept her private life away from paparazzi and tabloids. Talking to Vanity Fair in February, the actress revealed the reason behind her privacy. She told the magazine, ""I've noticed, in Hollywood, who you're dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus.

05b1b001-a1ac-4fcf-8fea-66301c883070,"  Terry Crews arrives at an event in Beverly Hills, Calif., in November 2017. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Last October, as the #MeToo earthquake was beginning to rip through the Hollywood power structure following abuse allegations connected to producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Terry Crews significantly readjusted the national conversation.  In tweets, the “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star laid out his own claims of experiencing sexual harassment. At a party in 2016, a “high-level Hollywood executive” came up to Crews and “groped my privates,” the actor wrote. Crews later publicly identified the executive as Adam Venit, a longtime industry power-player who represented marquee names such as Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn. Crews went on to file a police report about the incident, as well as a lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor.  But Crews’s revelation reverberated well beyond his own case. His public stand detonated stereotypes by showing a 240-pound former NFL player could also be the victim of sexual assault, thus widening the lens of the #MeToo movement. Time included Crews among the “the silence breakers” named in the magazine’s person of the year feature.  Now, Crews’s legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.  “Terry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “It will be dismissed.”  According to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews’s allegation.  After news of the settlement and Venit’s exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: “ACCOUNTABILITY,” he wrote.  That was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.  “People need to be held accountable,” the actor told “Good Morning America” last November. “This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he’s one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, ‘Who is going to believe you?’”  “The assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,” Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. “As I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man’s horseplay is another man’s humiliation.”  In his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. “Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews’s penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,” the lawsuit stated.  Crews, who was not Venit’s client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of “corporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.”  In court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.  According to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of “the lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.”  But the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency’s internal review determined that Crews’s allegation about Venit was “indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.” The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency’s motion picture group.  Venit’s demotion — and now exit — from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school. He later went on to represent some of the biggest movie stars in the business.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,836
b670daca-b25a-46a8-8d7e-f454ac80a544,"Pizza Hut's new storefronts have the word ""beer"" featured prominently. (Photo: Pizza Hut)  Apparently, the fast-food industry needs a stiff drink.  An increasing number of chain restaurants, such as Taco Bell and Chipotle Mexican Grill, are serving alcohol to lure in new customers who might otherwise go elsewhere to get beer, wine or cocktails.  In the competitive world of fast food, restaurants need an advantage. In the year ending in September, the chains saw no increase in customer traffic, according to the research firm NPD Group. Tacking on alcoholic beverages to an order is a way to drive up sales. Mixed drinks have a markup of as much as 90% and beer, 25%, according to restaurant consultant John Gordon of the Pacific Management Consulting Group.  Taco Bell plans to open about 150 alcohol-selling locations, called Cantinas. There are currently seven, including this one in Chicago. (Photo: Tyler Mallory)  Taco Bell plans to open approximately 150 new locations across the United States that will serve beer and frozen mixed drinks featuring tequila, rum, vodka and whiskey. And Pizza Hut, which serves beer and wine at approximately 3,500 of its sit-down restaurants, is set to add alcohol to the menus at another 200. Chipotle is market-testing a frozen version of its margarita, while Shake Shack, which features ShackMeister Ale and red and white wine, offered a limited-time wine shake to mark the return of the NBC TV show ""Will & Grace.""  ""It creates a little bit of buzz – in both senses of the word,"" said Aaron Allen, an Orlando-based global restaurant consultant. ""A lot of beverages with alcohol will have $3-$8 ticket prices, depending on their promotional pricing. Add a few of those on and you increase the check average. You can drive revenue without having to drive traffic.""  CLOSE Study after study shows that a little alcohol isn’t all that bad for you. Angeli Kakade (@angelikakade) has the story. Buzz60  Reaching for some hooch also helps fast-food and fast-casual chains, which tend to do most of their business at breakfast and lunch, to score more dinnertime action.  ""They've been trying for years to get people to come in at night. ... You're paying rent for that restaurant all day, utilities. You might as well draw as much traffic as you can,"" said Edward Jones restaurant analyst Jack Russo. ""It’s not a huge money-maker by any means. If they can (make alcohol) somewhat affordable, who knows. It might be.""  In 2016, booze accounted for half a percent of sales, or $1.4 billion, at fast-food restaurants and other chains where customers order at a counter, like pizza stores, according to Technomic, a Chicago-based consulting firm that tracks food industry trends.  Jose Juarez enjoyed some ShackMeister Ale with his hot dog lunch on a recent afternoon at Shake Shake in New York City's Madison Square Park. He said he was surprised to see beer on the menu, but happy to pay $5.79 for the 16-ounce plastic cup.  ""I was craving a beer and I got it,"" said the 34-year-old animator, visiting from San Jose, Calif., but he also wondered if the traditionally kid-friendly environment of any fast food restaurant, was the best place to imbibe. ""It's a family place. You don't want a guy who drinks to much. I don't know if it's completely a good idea.""  He's not alone in his concern. Notably, the restaurants won't let you buy brewskis from your car. The chains don't serve alcohol at their drive-thrus. The majority of states have laws that ban open containers of alcohol, like beer cans or wine bottles, in cars.  Anti-drunk driving advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving said it's monitoring the addition of alcohol to fast-food menus and that it's paying attention to overserving, the increased availability of alcohol and the mixed messages it sends to minors.  Chipotle Mexican Grill is testing a frozen version of its classic margarita. (Photo: Chipotle)  ""We're going to watch it very closely,"" said MADD national president Colleen Sheehey-Church. ""MADD is not against the responsible sale of alcohol to adults. The key words are responsible and alcohol and adults... Our concern is the public's safety once people leave the restaurants.""  For its part, Taco Bell said when people go to one of the restaurants that serve alcohol, it's about people relaxing together, not zooming in and out.  ""It's usually a social occasion, a group of friends coming together for dinner or after a night out. Customers tend to hang out a little bit more. They want shareable food and alcohol. Nothing goes better with tacos,"" said spokesman Rob Poetsch.  The greatest concern is about serving alcohol in places that tend to be popular with younger people  ""The more available alcohol is, the more people will drink and the more likely it is you’ll see more problems,"" said Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health associate professor David Jernigan. ""It’s not like adding salads to their menus.""  More: Want booze delivered with your food? Your wait is over.  More: Fast-food chains pressured to revamp kids' meals  More: A Foolish Take: The most productive fast-food chains in America  He cited drunk driving, violence, suicide and alcoholism and worried about the chains' youngest customers.  ""These are family-oriented restaurants. They’re really popular with kids. The idea of fast-food outlets serving alcohol is a message that alcohol is appropriate everywhere. We're talking about a very special product here. We’re not talking about milk. We're not talking about orange juice. We’re talking about 88,000 deaths in the U.S.""  But not everyone automatically says ""cheers"" to the move to booze. Franchisees have to be willing to navigate local liquor laws that determine everything from the time alcohol may be served to servers' ages to food-sales minimums.  For chains with company-owned stores, like Chipotle, a team examines local regulations for each location to determine if it's worth it. About 50% of its approximately 2,300 U.S. restaurants serve alcohol. None are in New Jersey, for example, because getting a license there is expensive.  If Chipotle's frozen margarita test (it introduced a traditional margarita in 2013) is a success, it could be sold nationwide by the end of the year, according to chief marketing officer Mark Crumpacker.  While some chains are reaching for alcohol some are pulling back. Burger King once had six Whopper Bars in the United States. Now, there are only three beer-serving locations — two in Florida and one in Missouri. The company declined to say why it's not adding Whopper Bars.  ""It's not a platform we’re growing,"" said Alex Macedo, president of Burger King North America.  CLOSE A new report shows the rate of adults in the U.S. with alcohol use disorder increased from 8.5 percent in 2001 to 12.7 percent 2013. Video provided by Newsy Newslook  And in January, Starbucks paused the roll-out of the Starbucks Evenings wine and craft beer menu at company-owned stores. Launched in 2010, the program peaked at 340 locations; today, it's offered at only a few U.S. airport cafes, which are run by licensees. However, the chain said it will look to integrate beer, wine and spirits into new retail formats like its new high-end concept Reserve Roasteries.

Chyna, who was accompanied by her lawyer Lisa Bloom, told Lindsey Davis of ABC News that she is filing a temporary domestic violence restraining order to stop Kardashian from posting about her on social media in addition to keeping him physically away from her. ""Good Morning America"" aired a clip from the interview.  She said, ""I was devastated. Of course, I was like, how could somebody post these pictures of me? I'm like, wow, okay, this is a person I trusted. I just felt ... betrayed.""  Bloom said, ""Revenge porn is a crime, a civil wrong and form of domestic abuse.""  Chyna said she decided to take legal action after talking to Kardashian, who is the father of her daughter, Dream. She also alleged that he physically abused her in April.  ""I talked to Rob about everything,"" she said. ""The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me. If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law.""  Chyna said she wants to inspire victims of revenge porn and cyber bullying to take action, and that it's irrelevant that she has posted racy photos of herself in the past.  ""I'm Blac Chyna,"" she said. ""I can do whatever I want. It's my body.""  Chyna also shot down rumors that she got together with Kardashian in order to get revenge on her ex, Tyga, who left her to date Kardashian's half-sister, Kylie Jenner.  ""That's not even my character,"" she said. ""I see all these things on the internet and I never address it because I'm a bigger person. Robert came at me."" She added that she was never trying to use the Kardashians for fame: ""I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardashians.""  Chyna said she has not heard from any of the Kardashians since Rob posted the photos. She addressed rumors circulating about her online spat with Kardashian, who claimed Chyna cheated on him during their relationship (Chyna said the two broke up in December). Kardashian wrote on social media that he was set off after Chyna sent him a video of herself kissing another man.  Chyna admitted to sending Kardashian the video, but said it was to get him off her back.  ""Maybe if I send this video to him, he'll leave me alone,"" she said of her thought process. She added that she never ""liked"" any of the nude photos he posted of her, as rumored, and that she had him blocked on Instagram.

The planned star vehicle will launch later this year.The 32-year-old rising star, whose show does not yet have a name, is expected to make fun of everything and everybody, with no preaching or political agenda — unless, of course, it’s funny. “You can expect the types of jokes my former bosses would tell me we couldn’t do on TV,” Wolf joked in a statement, with Netflix’s vp content Bela Bajaria, adding more earnestly: ""We're thrilled to be working with Michelle, a gifted writer and performer with a singular voice.""The announcement comes some two months after Wolf earned raves for her first stand-up special, Nice Lady, which aired on rival HBO. The special gave Wolf her highest-profile platform to date to tackle subjects ranging from feminism (""I want equal pay!

The couple have three children together—Aimee, 32, Kelly, 31, and Jack, 30. Conflicting, salacious reports immediately began to emerge about the Osbourne’s split. One said that Ozzy had gone missing after his wife threw him out of their home. Another alleged he’d had an affair with a celebrity hairdresser. There were also concerns that Ozzy had relapsed, which happened the last time the couple split in 2013. On that occasion, the Black Sabbath singer apologized on his Facebook page for what he called his “insane behavior” while drinking and using drugs for the previous year and a half.  This time, the couple decided to nip the rumors in the bud before they had a chance to spiral out of control even more. Ozzy told E! News on Monday that the split has nothing to do with a relapse. “I have been sober for three and a quarter years, I have not touched drugs or alcohol in that time. Any reports that I am not sober are completely inaccurate.” A source also told E! that, “[T]he pair mutually agreed that Ozzy would move out of the house temporarily.”  Contrary to what other outlets alleged, Ozzy had not gone missing. He was photographed on Monday morning in Los Angeles. He was also spotted on Tuesday with his daughter Aimee, who’s rarely seen in public.  Sharon Osbourne didn’t attend Monday’s taping of The Talk, but her co-host Julie Chen addressed her absence. “There were many tabloid headlines this past weekend about her and Ozzy. Rumors and speculation that they have split up after nearly 34 years of marriage. Sharon understandably took today off. We are sending all of our love to her and her family, and we ask that you do the same.”  Osbourne not only resumed her duties at The Talk on Tuesday, she discussed what was happening in her personal life. She came onto the set holding hands with the other hosts as the audience chanted “Sharon! Sharon!” When she sat down, Sharon Osbourne sipped from a tall glass of lemonade as opposed to a mug of coffee, because Beyoncé has turned lemonade sipping into the universal symbol of a woman scorned.  “I’ve been avoiding looking at any pictures or reading anything. I know what’s going on,” Osbourne said. “I don’t need to read about it and see about it because it’s like putting salt in a wound. So I don’t need to.”  She thanked everyone who for sending her messages of support before confirming that she had thrown her husband out of their home over the weekend. “It’s true,” Osbourne said. However, “He’s back, and I’m out of the house . . . I don’t know where I’m going, who I’m going with. And I just need time to think. And really think about myself, about what do I really want for . . . Because I’m 63 years of age, and I can’t keep living like this.”  Nevertheless, Sharon Osbourne isn’t sure if she and Ozzy are headed for a reconciliation or divorce. “At this point, I cannot answer that because I don’t know what I want . . . I love Ozzy dearly, you know. He’s given me an unbelievable life,” she dished. ”He’s given me three gorgeous children . . . You know, I love him,” she said on The Talk.  No matter what, she appears to have the support of her children.

e1c996d3-11fc-47aa-a41a-e1fda315665a,"Every day seems to bring a new headline about sexual harassment. It’s crucial to talk about how commonplace this abuse is, but it’s becoming more difficult to do so without becoming exhausted or desensitized. It’s what makes Saturday Night Live’s recent exploration of harassment — a visually soft, musical number from Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Leslie Jones, and Melissa Villaseñor, with guest Saoirse Ronan — feel like a warm shower after a roll through the mud.  Over the weekend, SNL debuted a catchy pop culture parody tackling the unending wave of sexual harassment allegations. This movement seems to have started with Harvey Weinstein, but the ripple has traveled far beyond Hollywood, and into industries and locations across the world. As the song title aptly puts it, “Welcome to Hell.”  Musical comedy is nothing new for SNL, and the show has touched on feminist issues in group parodies before. But the biting juxtaposition of bubblegum pop and sexual harassment feels more like an outtake from the CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which regularly uses musical comedy to deconstruct thorny subjects like mental health and sexism. “Welcome to Hell” is a dead ringer for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s man-hating anthem “Let’s Generalize About Men,” where series co-creator Rachel Bloom and company examine the pitfalls of the male population — and mock the way women talk about them.  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend built its reputation on this sort of egalitarian satire, where its frustrated female characters declare that all men are emotionally stunted children while simultaneously acknowledging that this is absurd hyperbole. (“There are no exceptions / All 3 billion men are like this / All 3.6 billion men.”) It plays on stereotypes from both sides: the women engaging in their proclaimed “primal ritual” of drinking and complaining, the men putting up a tiresome cry of “not all men.” The SNL song, on the other hand, represents a more literal case of ideologies clashing. Its staff can write and perform songs about harassment, but the show has also invited notorious abusers like Casey Affleck to host. (Louis CK has hosted the show four times.)  “Welcome to Hell” is parody, but only in how it chooses to deliver its information. Dressed in pink or pastel and sporting sweetheart looks, these performers do their best bubblegum pop impression while addressing a harsh reality: harassment has always been part of women’s lives. “Oh, this been the damn world,” Strong sings of the recent headlines. Jones pops in to say, “But you do know that it’s like a million times worse for a woman of color, right?” The short even demonstrates some self-defense tactics women are taught: McKinnon holding her keys between her fingers to thwart would-be attackers, or Strong demonstrating acting so crazy, would-be molesters will decide she’s “not worth the trouble.”  The grief people may feel over House of Cards being “ruined” after Kevin Spacey was fired, or whatever surprise they may experience at learning how widespread harassment is, pales in comparison to the frustration that acts as the song’s throughline. Why didn’t women say something? “Well, we definitely did,” Ronan says. “For hundreds of years.” It’s the understatement of the century.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,632

Taking place in Shanghai for the first time in the runway's history, the showcase kicks off at 8pm local time - 12pm GMT.  Joining the models this year for her second VS fashion show is Bella Hadid.  Having made her debut walking for the lingerie giant in Paris last year alongside older sister Gigi, Bella this year is the only Hadid walking after Gigi pulled out just last week.  Also absent this year is the Hadid sisters' good friend Kendall Jenner, who is skipping this year due to a contractual agreement with rival lingerie brand La Perla of which she is the face.  But while Gigi and Kendall are notable absences from this year's line up, there is a smorgasbord of well-known and legendary Victoria's Secret models returning to the runway today.  Adriana Lima, Alessandra Ambrosio, Jasmine Tookes, and Stella Maxwell are all in Shanghai for the show, while Candice Swanepoel regains her place having stepped away from the catwalk for 2016 to have her baby.  Karlie Kloss also returns to the line up having left the brand two years ago.

38ddd6a0-972c-4b58-bb9f-610bb0de8f59,"Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar. Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker. There's much to look forward to, but not before we close out this season one last time with everything that happened after the finale! (In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here .)  Almost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, ""I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!"" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. ""It's just so special with Bindi,"" he told reporters backstage. ""She's a champion of life.""  Bindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks ""to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!""  The Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. ""There's not a thing I would change about this season,"" he told Glamour post-show. ""There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible.""  While Bindi and Derek make the press rounds in New York City, it's no secret that she's itching to get back to her hometown down under. ""I can't wait to get back to all the animals, continue all the conservation work, and carry on in my dad's footsteps.""  Season 21 runner-ups Sharna Burgess and Nick Carter were understandably disappointed not to win the big prize, but they both praised Bindi and Derek for their phenomenal journey this season. ""Bindi was the whole package,"" praised the red-haired stunner. ""She and Derek had a beautiful partnership."" Still, ""it's bittersweet in may ways. Did I really want this to be my first Mirrorball? Absolutely. I would be lying if I said I didn't. But Bindi was undeniable this entire season. She grew so much, and she's just such a beautiful person you can't help but be captivated by her. Both [she and Nick] are winners, and I truly believe that.""  Echoed Nick: ""It was just such a pleasure to be here. I didn't expect to get anything, so anytime something great happened in the competition, it was a pleasant surprise to me."" So what's up next for Nick? Well, aside from getting ready for Baby Boy Carter , his solo album ( All American ) drops today, and he has a movie coming out next year that he wrote and directed.  As for third-place contestant, Alek Skarlatos , he'll be heading on the DWTS Tour this winter, but his immediate plans are much simpler: ""I can't wait to get on the plane tonight to eat. A lot."" But what about his dating life? Any updates on that? ""It's been pretty crazy, honestly. [I haven't had time] for many dates lately."" Added Lindsay: ""I'll be his wing woman on tour!""  During all the hectic action backstage, Allison Holker was a ball of energy, especially for someone six month's pregnant. ""I feel incredible!"" gushed the pro. ""Dancing around with a baby that's the size of a football in your belly is never an easy task, but it's been amazing. Although I never expected to see myself in a sparkly costume on the Dancing With the Stars stage six months pregnant!"" Allison (and husband tWitch) will find out the baby's gender on December 10, ""which is our anniversary too."" In case you're wondering, she'll reveal whether it's a boy or a girl on social media shortly thereafter!  In the meantime, Allison's prepping for her first Thanksgiving in charge of the turkey as long as the nerves don't get the best of her. ""I heard you have to brine it, but I don't even know what that means!"" she laughed. ""I'm watching The Chew to learn techniques!""  One of the biggest stories backstage was the announcement that Len Goodman would be returning to the judges' table next season, and the news was heralded with much excitement from the pros. ""I can't wait,"" admitted Mark Ballas . ""I love Len. We missed him this season. It was definitely different, [so it will be] good to have him back in the driver's seat."" Allison Holker felt the same way: ""I think Len Goodman was the heart and soul of Dancing With the Stars and was such a great leader at the judges' table, along with Bruno, Carrie Ann, and Julianne.""  Casting is currently underway for season 22. If Mark Ballas gets his wish, he'd love to have girlfriend BC Jean compete as a contestant. ""She would be great, but you know [the producers] would probably mess with us and give her to Derek!"" Mark joked. So what was B.C.'s take on this idea? ""Yeah, and we'd probably win,"" she laughed of the possibility of being paired with Mark's best friend and honorary brother.  Speaking of Derek, Mark told us backstage that getting to perform with BC (who he called ""the love of my life"") while Derek and Bindi danced was his favorite part of the evening. ""It was just amazing, cool, and unique. I've been on this show nearly 10 years in a row, and I've never experienced something like that. To be able to perform with the love of my life and in front of my brother for life and the beautiful Bindi was just cool.""  So what's next for Mark and BC? Their hit single, "" Roses and Violets ,"" has been climbing the charts, and the couple is recording an EP right now and hoping to get it out on tour. ""It's all Alexander Jean right now!""  Until, of course, season 22 comes along.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1299
c82ecfc3-6afd-41ac-99f9-029056ad7931,"Where there’s a Danielle, there’s drama.  That’s at least true on The Real Housewives of New Jersey. While OG Housewife Danielle Staub is just a “friend” of the cast this season, Melissa Gorga promises she’s at the heart of much of what goes down in the episodes to come.  “I think Danielle is always good for the wow factor,” Melissa tells ET. “When Danielle comes in, she's very passionate … so, it brings a really good flavor of like that passion, like crazy… I can't explain it, but she brings something to the table.”  Danielle only makes brief appearances in the season nine trailer, most of them in flashes of dramatic moments that have little context. One of those moments is Melissa flipping out while the ladies are in Mexico on their all-cast trip. The 39-year-old screams at, seemingly, Danielle, “You got the wrong f**king girl!”  “I think everyone knows me by now, to have Melissa Gorga, like, wig out and go crazy, you really have to push my buttons to the limit,” she teases. “So, when we're away in Cabo, I have a moment. I watch it back and I'm like, 'Ooh! I look like a tough girl. Oh, my God!’ I'm really not mean like this, but somebody must have pushed my buttons! Let's put it that way.”  Melissa says that as far as she knows, Danielle won’t get confessional interviews this season like the rest of the cast to explain her side of everything. That means viewers will only experience all the Danielle drama through the lens of her co-stars, and most of the cast isn’t on great terms with the 56-year-old. Today, Melissa says it’s really only her sister-in-law, Teresa Giudice, who keeps up with Danielle.  Rodrigo Varela / Getty Images  It’s an unexpected turn for the group, seeing as Melissa, Teresa and Margaret Josephs all served in Danielle’s May wedding to former baseball player Marty Caffrey. The couple split just months later, a move that Melissa admits did not shock her.  “There was tension at the wedding,” she reveals. “You are gonna see it, and you're gonna see us saying something is off here. You know, like, why are we doing this? Yeah, I think I could see. Listen, I'm no pro, but I've been in the game for 14 years of marriage. You know 14 years going strong. So, it's like, I could see when something is not gonna be a match.”  It’s not all Danielle drama this year, though. Melissa is also swept up in family tension, playing monkey in the middle with her husband, Joe, and sister-in-law, Teresa, over the Gorgas not spending enough time with Teresa and Joe’s ailing father, according to Teresa. Still, Melissa says things will never get as bad as they were in her early RHONJ days, when her and Teresa’s husbands got into a brawl at Melissa’s son’s christening.  “We're in a good place,” Melissa shares. “We're not in a bad place, we're just not going to agree on everything. It's not real to agree on everything for her and I.”  “I think if we were friends, it'd be worse because we wouldn't have mutual children that love each other with the same bloodline,” she adds. “So I'd be like, 'B*tch!' It would be different.”  Melissa is currently standing by her sister-in-law as she and her family await a final ruling on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation to Italy. The family submitted an appeal earlier this month.  “I think the next step right now is just to wait it out and pray,” Melissa says. “That's basically what everybody is doing. They're just kinda hoping that it's gonna turn around. It is very sad because, you know, he has four daughters and they love him. Like, they truly -- which all little girls love their daddy -- they want him here. So we are all just praying that it turns around.”  The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.

1b893cb4-0fb3-46a6-9231-ce27a824b0b0,"(JTA) — Most artists would see playing one concert at New York’s Madison Square Garden as a crowning achievement. Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.  Before and after his landmark show last week at the “World’s Most Famous Arena,” the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible — and likely all-time record-breaking — MSG run.  After mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.  “This past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,” he said.  Although Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.  On the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said “both sides” were to blame for the violence that occurred — and that were some “very fine people” among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.  “I had to do something that night,” Joel responded. “The president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, ‘There’s some good people on that side …’ No, Nazis aren’t good people.  “It really enraged me, actually,” he continued. “My old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. … My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.”  While many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.  But the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards — Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form. Lena Dunham, Antonoff’s girlfriend at the time, said he ordered the necklace after feeling like Nazis had become a “mainstream thing again.”  RELATED:  Billy Joel wore a yellow Jewish star.

According to The United States District Court for the Central District of California documents filed Monday — and obtained by The Blast — “Pursuant to Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and by leave of court endorsed hereon, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California hereby moves to dismiss the above-referenced case as to defendant Mark Wayne Salling, without prejudice.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Salling was found hanging from a tree in the area of the Los Angeles River in Sunland, California, according to Los Angeles Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter, and was pronounced dead at 9 a.m. on Jan. 30 at age 35.  According to Winter, his cause of death was asphyxia by hanging and has been ruled a suicide.  The late actor’s attorney, Michael Proctor, confirmed his death to PEOPLE and said in a statement, “Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment. He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother. The Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected.”  WATCH: Mark Salling’s Mom ‘Had a Hard Time Grasping’ His Child Porn Scandal: The ‘Family Is Devastated’  His death came just a month before he was to be sentenced to prison for possession of child pornography.  He was arrested in December 2015 after LAPD’s Internet Crimes Against Children unit obtained a search warrant for his home in Sunland, California. Federal investigators say they found more than 25,000 images and 600 videos depicting child pornography on computers and thumb drives that belonged to Salling. The content depicted children as young as 3 years old being abused, according to court documents.  Salling pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in October. After striking a plea deal in December, he was due to be sentenced in March and expected to serve four to seven years in prison.  “Mark is focused on accepting responsibility and attempting to atone for his conduct,” Proctor said in a statement at the time.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,431
8d5c0153-b466-4581-8477-819af86fffdd,"Former The Walking Dead star Michael Cudlitz, better known to fans of the show as Abraham Ford, has some harsh words for the show he used to be a part of. Abraham met his end alongside Glenn (Steven Yeun) when Negan took his bat Lucille to both their skulls at the beginning of Season 7. In retrospect, it was a pretty good time to leave The Walking Dead.  It was the beginning of the end for AMC's zombie drama, at least until its surprising revival in Season 9 under the welcome stewardship of new showrunner Angela Kang. But the sad fact remains: Seasons 7 and 8 were horrible, no good lousy seasons of television that made so many poor choices I couldn't list them all if I tried.  And the show has suffered for it, with ratings collapsing even as it finally drags itself back from the brink. Indeed, both myself and my colleague Paul Tassi agree that Season 9 is one of the best so far (we talk at length about this in our Walking Dead podcast here.)  In any case, I'm not alone in thinking the past two seasons were hot garbage. Abraham actor Michael Cudlitz had some choice words recently for the show and its lead protagonist, Rick Grimes. Speaking at the Atlanta Walker Stalker Con, Cudlitz laid down some hard truths:  “Let’s be real clear, if he was gonna kill anyone other than me and I had a choice, it would be Rick. Because how many more people was that a—hole gonna get killed?” Cudlitz said, according to ComicBook.com. And while the audience was apparently shocked by this statement, he's not wrong. Rick led his people into one disaster after another. This started long before the disastrous Negan storyline, but Rick reached new heights of recklessness and stupidity as the show's writing quality plummeted.  More Cudlitz:  “’Hey, I got a plan, let’s show up to where all the Saviors are with 500 weapons, have them step 15 feet out into the balcony unarmed, and shoot the windows out above his head.’ You all know that sucked [...] It was like the A-Team showed up.""  Apparently at this point the actor started ""miming stray firing before imitating the showy Savior leader.""  Cudlitz again, mocking the terribleness of this scene which, if Rick had simply shot Negan when he first swaggered out the door, would have put a blessed end to this whole nonsensical plot:  “He’s right there! He’s right there! He walks out the door. It’s not even like he peeks out. He’s like ‘Well, Rick! Ha ha ha! We better run!’”  This is all too hilarious to me, as it really brings me back to my own review of that episode:  Earlier, in Rick's speech, he made clear that only one Savior had to die: Negan. (They go and kill several lookouts right after that speech, so it's more like ""only five people have to die"" but who's counting?) And who should walk out onto his doorstep in plain view of all these heavily armed rebels? Who gives them all the perfect chance to take him out then and there? Who swaggers like he's the king of all he sees, never once worried that maybe Rick had given orders to shoot him on sight? If you guessed Negan, you win. The Big Bad walks right out there like he hasn't got a care in the world. He's soon followed by his lieutenants, including the coward, Eugene, and the traitor, Dwight. It turns out, he had nothing to be afraid of. Despite being heavily armed, despite having multiple weapons with scopes and a clear shot, despite coming to do this very thing, nobody opens fire on Negan. Why? This is one of those incredibly frustrating moments that have come more and more to define The Walking Dead. Because there's really no good explanation as to why nobody shoots Negan the moment he showed his smug face. There's no reason one of the dozens of rebels couldn't have popped him at such close range.  I should point out that Rick also had snipers that expertly took out the Savior lookouts just before all this (so more like 7 or 8 people had to die, just none of them ended up being Negan because Rick eventually spared him out of mercy moments after murdering other Saviors who had helped him.)  In any case, it's quite hilarious to see Cudlitz lay into the show with such naked honesty. Season 8 was just so horrendously awful it very nearly killed the show entirely. For instance, that Season 8 premiere review I linked to up above? That got 424,000 views. My Season 7 premiere review got over 700,000 views. Fast forward to my Season 9 premiere review? 125,000 views, and a steady drop in views ever since.  This isn't just people not watching the show the night of, it's people running for the hills. And it's come to this because nobody at AMC had the nerve to step in and save the show from its incredible mismanagement, terrible writing and lousy direction. I'm not sure where all the blame should sit, and I'm sure fingers could point in many directions, but it's still baffling just how bad it got, and how much better it's gotten thanks to Angela Kang's new leadership.  Another actor present at the convention was Josh McDermitt who plays Eugene and who, as insane as this sounds, probably had the most interesting arc in Season 8, mostly demurred: “I disagree, only because I’m still on the show and like my job,” he said.  Perhaps the most important quote from Cudlitz, or at least the one that speaks to me the most, is this: “It’s like one of those things where you’re so into something and then you’re like, ‘really, guys?’” Cudlitz said. “I get pissed off because I love it.”  I've received so much anger and hate from The Walking Dead fans who said that I was trying to ruin their beloved show, when the whole time I was the one raising the red flags, saying ""Really guys?"" because I am a fan. I am a critic, yes, and it's my job to point out when a show goes astray like this. I feel like finally in Season 9, many of my criticisms of the show have finally been heard and we've seen a remarkable uptick in quality. That's fantastic! (Though now I'm being accused of having turned into a shill or, worse, a taking bribes to say nice things about the show because that's the sad truth about fandom. If you say something critical you're a monster and if you say something nice you're a patsy. Oy vey.)  In any case, bravo to Michael Cudlitz for speaking out. I still wish he'd been the choice for the Fear The Walking Dead crossover, but I think he dodged a bullet there. Or a bat, as the case may be.  As a side note, I think Rick getting killed at the beginning of Season 7 would have been an amazing creative decision and would have, potentially, made for a much more interesting story arc for all involved. Oh well.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1430

59dbab93-47e1-401d-99e3-24e34c9dab82,"Celeb-beloved Body By Simone founder Simone De La Rue and nutritionist-to-the-stars Kelly LeVeque collaborated on BBS, using artificial intelligence to customize fitness and nutrition programs for users.  Leave it to two A-list wellness gurus to democratize customized fitness and nutrition programs for the world. The dream team of Body By Simone personal trainer Simone De La Rue and nutritionist Kelly LeVeque — whose client list includes the likes of Jennifer Garner, Emmy Rossum, Jessica Alba and Molly Sims — have just released an app that gives users access to their expertise for a very nominal monthly fee.  But it’s not just an app stuffed with content — more than 900 minutes of video and hundreds of recipes — that leaves users to their own devices to navigate and motivate. For $19.99/month, the platform actually uses artificial intelligence software to create customized workout plans and nutrition programs for each individual, taking into consideration their specific goals. It tracks progress via measurements and weekly photos, and reminds users via push notifications to work out. “It is programmed to provide the customization of a personal workout with me,” says De La Rue, adding, “This has never been done before in a fitness app.”  But while it may seem the app approach speaks only to the general population, De La Rue says hers and LeVeque’s celebrity clients are “very excited, especially as they are often on set or traveling. They can have their dream team in their pocket.” The impetus for the app was a desire to have a platform available to anyone in the world, since the Aussie trainer on E’s Revenge Body can’t be everywhere at once. For a more 360-degree approach, she wanted to include a nutritionist, and because of their several shared clients (Garner and Rossum among them) and complementary beliefs and philosophies, LeVeque was the ideal fit.  When it comes to nutrition, protein and plants are at the core. Recipes run the gamut and might include Jen Garner’s Chocolate Blueberry #fab4smoothie, with collagen, almond butter, spinach, flax and other nutritious ingredients. Says LeVeque of their approach: “Protein ups collagen, muscle tone and metabolism. Fat benefits hormones, skin and cellular health and does not store as fat as simple carbs do. Fiber for gut microbiome proliferation and detoxification, and greens or veggies deep in color to fight inflammation.” These “fab four” foods are at the core of her recipes.  The workouts mix up methodology to keep things interesting, and never use props so they can be done literally anywhere. De La Rue’s favorite currently: dance cardio. “It’s an incredible workout, burns calories, teaches you coordination, challenges your brain to learn choreography and it’s fun and joyous,” she says. The pair’s one-stop-shop app also doles out motivational words and advice, since that’s key to many people’s success with a new wellness plan.  LeVeque suggests users get up and exercise first thing in the morning, since a fasted workout has the same benefits as intermittent fasting, which causes a surge in human growth hormone and testosterone to help burn fat. Additionally, she advocates for early dinners, before dark — which seems decidedly un-Hollywood but has very Hollywood ramifications. “An early dinner allows for the body to digest the meal, balance blood sugar and clear excess insulin before you head to bed,” says LeVeque, “so you can benefit from a fat-burning, belt-shrinking night of sleep!” We see why Garner and Rossum swear by these ladies.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,675

And she recently married hedge fund manager James Matthews - whose brother is ex Made In Chelsea star Spencer. Here's what we know about the mum of one...  Reuters 8 Pippa is a socialite and sister to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge  Who is Pippa Middleton and what is her net worth?  Philippa Middleton, known to most as Pippa, is the middle child of the three Middleton children - Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and James William Middleton, an entrepreneur whose company sells cake-making kits for birthdays.  The 35-year-old socialite graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in English literature, something she later put to use by releasing her own non-fiction book, Celebrate, in 2012.  Prior to her wedding, she was once voted the Number 1 Society Singleton by Tatler magazine.  According to some estimates, Pippa is worth approximately £750,000.  However, she is most known for almost stealing the spotlight from her sister's marriage by wearing a bridesmaid's dress that turned her bum into a national talking point.  Since then she has been seen at a number of high-class social events and remains close to her sister, but ran into trouble when a data thief hacked into her iCloud and stole thousands of personal pictures.  Getty - Contributor 8 Pippa has one child with husband James Matthews  On October 15, heavily pregnant Pippa Middleton reportedly arrived at the £7,500-a-night Lindo Wing maternity unit - just days after Prince Eugenie's royal wedding.  The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge is said to have been joined at the private hospital with her financier husband James Matthews.  James was pictured carrying two overnight bags as they entered the wing - a £78 Cam Cam Copenhagen baby changing bag and another holdall.  Eyewitnesses say Pippa, 35, was seen smiling as she entered the Lindo Wing, where her nephews Prince George and Prince Louis and niece Princess Charlotte were born.  That afternoon, Pippa gave birth to the couple's son weighing 8lb 9oz at the Lindo Wing.  It's said the family are delighted with the new arrival and mother and baby are doing well.  The Sun on Sunday revealed back in April the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister, 35, and financier husband James Matthews, 43, had announced the news to their friends and family after a 12-week scan.  The Duchess of Cambridge ""could not have been more delighted"" on learning little sister Pippa was pregnant, a friend revealed.  Kate, who gave birth to her third child on April 23, was the first person after Pippa’s husband James to hear the good news.  AP:Associated Press 8 Pippa Middleton holds a bouquet of lilies, peonies and sweet peas from the same London florist as her sister  How did Pippa announce her pregnancy?  After months of reports and rumours surrounding her suspected pregnancy, Pippa Middleton finally confirmed that she is expecting her first child.  Taking to her Waitrose magazine food column to announce the happy news, Pippa wrote: ""I was lucky to pass the 12 week scan without suffering from morning sickness.""  Unlike older sister Kate who has experienced hyperemesis gravidarum with each of her three pregnancies, Pippa has been fortunate enough to avoid the rate morning sickness condition that led to the Duchess of Cambridge being hospitalised for dehydration.  A fitness buff and marathon runner, Pippa also revealed she has also ""stopped running"" only because she ""rather liked the idea"" of giving herself and the baby ""a rest from pavement pounding.""  Rumoured to be due in October 2018, the petite Middleton sister gave a glimpse of her growing baby bump at the French Open in June 2018.  She then gave the world a full view of her blossoming bump at the nuptials of Princess Eugenie and James Brooksbank, dressing a gorgeous emerald green midi dress.  Getty - Contributor 8 Pippa showed off her growing baby bump at the 2018 French Open - the 35-year-old is a keen tennis fan  What did Pippa name her first child?  Pippa and James named their firstborn Arthur Michael William Matthews.  The second name is of significance as not only is it Pippa's father's name but it also belonged to James' younger brother who died in a tragic mountaineering accident on Everest in 1999, just after becoming the youngest British man to climb to its peak.  PA:Press Association 8 James proposed to Pippa in July 2016  Who is Pippa married to?  James Matthews, 42, is a hedge fund manager and is also the older brother of former Made in Chelsea star Spencer Matthews.  He caught her off-guard by popping the question to her in July 2016, less than a year into their relationship.  James proposed with the hefty octagonal diamond ring, which comes with a central 4-carat Asscher-cut diamond stone, and a price tag to rival sister Kate’s own luxury ring.  With an estimated cost of £200,000, the pricey band also boasts a halo of flawless diamonds around the centre - although it’s unclear exactly who designed it.  EPA 8 Pippa is married to millionaire James Matthews  When did Pippa Middleton and James Matthews get married?  Pippa Middleton became Mrs Pippa Matthews on May 20, 2017.  The pair enjoyed a relaxed but lavish intimate ceremony at her local church, St Mark’s Church in Englefield.  We showcased pictures of the stunning venue, which is just six miles from where the Middletons grew up.  The party was held at her parents’ £5million home in nearby Bucklebury, Berks.  A £100,000 marquee was erected at the Grade II Listed location, as the bride-to-be was determined to keep the rain off her guests.  It was also revealed that guests were treated to a Spitfire fly-by.  It is estimated the society ceremony of the year cost £250,000 – ten times the UK average - and that the ceremony took place in front of 350 guests.  Who was invited to James and Pippa's wedding?  Pippa's big sister Kate was there along with the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, who she has struck up a friendship with.  Pippa's niece and nephew Prince George and Princess Charlotte had starring roles in the nuptials.  George was a pageboy while Charlotte was one of her auntie's bridesmaids.  Prior to the big day Kate revealed her nerves at how her two children would behave.  Pippa’s younger brother James was also at the nuptials and so was his on-off girlfriend, the TV presenter and actress, Donna Air.  All of James' family attended with his former reality TV star brother Spencer on best man duties.  Getty Images 8 Prince William and Kate Middleton's children played a part in the wedding  What does Pippa Middleton do for a living?  Pippa's book Celebrate - which focused on social etiquette and party organising - was a widely ridiculed flop, due to Pippa’s obvious observations such as: “There is something very British about tea” and “put a pitcher of water and glasses on a nearby table or side table.”  Last year Pippa filmed a series of reports for US talk programme Today.

It is 100% false and totally made up. — Andy Cohen (@Andy) October 28, 2017  Griffin added that Cohen was a “miserable boss” while her show, My Life on the D-List, aired on Bravo for six seasons.  “The whole time I was working there, I didn’t know how Andy Cohen wanted to be me … I didn’t know Andy Cohen was on the red carpet, trying to be funny and asking questions on BravoTV.com,” she said. “I didn’t know when they ended The D List and I desperately wanted to do a talk show, Andy Cohen would be the first television executive in the history of television to give himself a talk show — which seems to get picked up every season.”  The video comes after Cohen pretended he didn’t know the comedian. Asked about replacing Griffin on CNN’s New Year’s Eve Live, Cohen smiled and told TMZ, “Who? I don’t know her.”  The jab is a reference to Mariah Carey‘s infamous remark about not knowing Jennifer Lopez — “apparently I’m forgetful,” she quipped to Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in 2016.  Griffin retaliated on Twitter, pointing out that the stars have known each other for years.  “Even when it’s on tape, there are doubters? He is NOT kidding w paps. Was my boss for 10 years. Treated me like a dog. Deeply misogynistic,” she wrote.  Cohen, 49, announced he’s joining longtime friend Anderson Cooper on the broadcast earlier this month. Griffin co-hosted with the venerated journalist for 10 years, but CNN cut ties with the comedian in May after she posed for a photo with a mask of President Donald Trump‘s bloodied head in her hand.  RELATED VIDEO: Kathy Griffin Apologizes for Donald Trump Beheading Photo: “I Went Way Too Far”  In her video, Griffin also took aim at TMZ founder Harvey Levin, accusing him of being complicit in quieting scandals surrounding Harvey Weinstein. She also gave out Levin’s phone number, claiming he reported every canceled show following her Trump photo while she and her family received death threats.  “People like Harvey Levin and Andy Cohen honestly just live to take women down,” she said.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,736

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Meghan Markle’s childhood best friend has revealed the real reason her first marriage broke up - and it wasn't a mutual decision.  Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family.

Jackman even described the process that goes into the filming of shirtless scenes, which he said involves drinking ten liters of water a day in the months leading up to the scenes, which he said are accomplished through dehydration.  “It’s sort of unbelievable to me, what I did for seventeen years,” Jackman revealed. “The first one, I thought you could get into shape in three weeks. The director pushed all the ‘shirt off’ scenes to the very end.”  “You stop drinking water about 30 hours before you shoot,” Jackman said, explaining the process. “You lose ten pounds of water weight.”  But now that that’s over, Jackman is already enjoying himself.  “Now I’m eating and loving it,” Jackman told Colbert. “Sometimes waking up at two in the morning just to have breakfast cereal, and then go back to bed.”  “With it still in my lap,” he added.

1171f6ef-8468-43be-935d-52ed81613547,"George Clooney is a generous friend to say the least.  The 56-year-old actor's close pal and Casamigos business partner, Rande Gerber, recently claimed the actor once gave 14 of his close friends -- which he referred to as ""The Boys"" -- $1 million each as a surprise gift in 2013. Gerber dropped the jaw-dropping tidbit during his appearance on MSNBC's Headliners.  ... And the amazing monetary gift wasn't all. Gerber said that Clooney also paid his friends' taxes for the year.  ""There’s a group of guys we call 'The Boys,'"" Gerber shared. ""George had called me and 'The Boys' and said, 'Hey, mark September 27th, 2013, on your calendar. Everyone’s going to come to my house for dinner.'""  At the dinner, Clooney's pals were surprised with designer luggage bags at each seat on the table -- each containing a million dollars in $20 bills. Gerber noted that not all of the actor's friends were rich, with some struggling to support their families.  ""George begins to say, 'Listen, I want you guys to know how much you've meant to me and how much you mean to me in my life,'"" Gerber recalled. ""'I came to L.A., I slept on your couch. I'm so fortunate in my life to have all of you and I couldn't be where I am today without all of you. So, it was really important to me that while we’re still all here together, that I give back. So I want you all to open your suitcases.'""  Not surprisingly, Gerber said he and the actor's pals were ""in shock.""  ""Every one of us -- 14 of us -- got a million dollars,"" he marveled. ""Every single one of us. We're in shock. Like, what is this? He goes, 'I know we've all been through some hard times, some of you are still going through it. You don't have to worry about your kids, you don't have to worry about, you know, school, you don't have to worry about paying your mortgage.'""  ""I mean these are guys that took care of George and now he’s giving it all back,"" Gerber added. ""And George said, 'Not only that, I have paid everyone's taxes so this million dollars is yours.'""  Gerber -- who is independently wealthy -- said he insisted on not accepting the gift, but Clooney refused. The businessman said he ended up donating his million dollars to charity.  Although, Gerber noted that Clooney may have gotten his own reward for his generous gift.  ""That was September 27th, 2013. Now September 27, 2014, he marries Amal,"" he pointed out. ""That's good karma right there.""  In October, Gerber hosted an epic Casamigos Halloween party, escorting both his wife, supermodel Cindy Crawford, and Amal Clooney.

We don't know a whole lot about the identity of this new guy but there is talk he is British and quite well-off. A source close to the Salt actress says that the two met through mutual friends. The romance is only starting and rumors suggest that sparks are definitely flying.  Here is what we know so far about Angie's secret new beau:  1. She is keeping her new man a secret.  “Angie is keeping her cards close to her chest, but she’s very happy,” a source said. “She doesn’t want his identity to be revealed until her divorce from Brad [Pitt] is official, so she’s playing coy whenever anyone asks about her love life. She doesn’t want a media circus around her man.”  2. She's taking precaution to remain discreet.  A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angiiii_jolie) on Jun 28, 2018 at 5:56am PDT  Sources on set say the actress only refers to her new beau “by one initial,” and has asked the producers to arrange her schedule so that she can leave town on weekends. “Apparently, they’re having romantic weekends in the English countryside, away from prying eyes, whenever they get the chance.”  3. Her kids have met him.  “She’s introduced him to the kids already, which is a sure sign that this is more than just a fling,” says the source. “They will always be her priority and she wouldn’t take that step if she didn’t see this romance lasting.”  4.

There was even talk of marriage. But time proved these accusations false. The fact that she is filming Maleficent 2 in London re-ignited these rumors.  5. Other sources close to her say the rumors are false.  A source told People the actress “is absolutely not seeing anyone and will not be. [She] remains focused on her kids” and isn’t interested in getting back in the dating game.  6. She has been linked to other men.

She’d love to get to know Ed and find out what makes him tick.”  7. Brad has been dating, too.  Pitt has been linked to a few other women as well including Margot Robbie — who Angelina supposedly hates. A source told OK! magazine about Brad's pursuit of Margot. “He thinks she’s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now. [He has] tried to woo her for numerous movie projects.

e56d9fb2-3156-4cd0-b007-0a127115022e,"LeeAnne Locken's wedding planning with fiancé Rich Emberlin is in full swing, but there's been some major speculation that their relationship isn't exactly what it seems.  On Wednesday night's episode of The Real Housewives of Dallas, it was revealed that there have been rumors that LeeAnne and Rich have been leading separate lives. Rich's faithfulness to LeeAnne also came into question. Watch the moment, above.  LeeAnne addressed the gossip during a recent interview with Us Weekly. “While I am saddened that a cast member has gone below the belt and has falsely accused my fiancé of infidelity, the reality is that Rich and I are busy planning a wedding, working on all of the details, and beyond excited about our life-long love affair,” she said.  And LeeAnne and Rich aren't taking the rumors too seriously, either. ""After last night’s episode, we laid in bed and laughed until we fell asleep,” LeeAnne told Us Weekly. “And by the way — how could a pirate get away with cheating? Don’t you think he’s the only pirate in Dallas?”  LeeAnne assured The Daily Dish that her relationship with Rich is better than ever when we caught up with her in New York City at the end of September. ""He's my universe. He's everything,"" he gushed. ""He's my security. He's my protector. He's my Prince Charming. He's my provider. And he's my best friend.""

9a6636eb-9b54-4bb4-b879-89034afc8a25,"Amid speculation that Hollywood’s best-known troubled actor Lindsay Lohan may have converted to Islam, a report in Britain’s Independent newspaper suggests the word “converted” may be too strong.  Lohan was seen recently carrying a copy of the Muslim holy book the Quran, and has been public about her Arabic lessons — including drawing jibes online last month when she posted an Instagram image that showed Arabic words above the ostensible English translation, “You’re beautiful.” The Arabic actually read “you’re a donkey.” Lohan said the mistranslation was intentional, part of an inside joke with a friend.  But these steps toward Islam, her spokesperson told The Independent, do not constitute “fully converting” to the religion.  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up  “To my knowledge she is not considering fully converting to Islam, but I know she has been taking a keen interest in the Arabic culture of late,” the spokesperson explained.  Lohan was also looking ahead to “upcoming projects in the Middle East,” the paper reported.  “She also spent some time in Dubai earlier this year,” the spokesperson continued, “and became interested in their way of life.”  Lohan, born and raised Catholic, has dabbled in a series of religious traditions, for a time embracing the Jewish mystical tradition of Kabbalah and Scientology.  She once said she was a “very spiritual person” on Oprah Winfrey’s show, and had “become more spiritual as time has gone on.”  “I’m really in touch, whether it’s prayer or meditation. There are so many powers greater than me in the world. I’ve been blessed and lucky enough to have been given a gift to share with other people.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,346
6058a8e3-813a-4ff7-9771-cac45f6ef1ce,"George W. Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump’s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.During his “American carnage” inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.The harsh rhetoric of Trump’s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it “some weird s--t” and Jimmy Carter saying he “flinched” when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.Story Continued BelowIn Trump’s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the “unwritten rule” that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.“The immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,” George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. “This kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it’s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president… is pretty unusual.”As Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he’s made his displeasure clear.Obama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was “heartened” by the protests following Trump’s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump’s attempts to repeal it.At a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. “I expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,” Obama said Sunday.And on Monday, Obama’s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump’s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn’s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn’s erratic nature.George W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Bush said in an interview with “Today” in February. “We need an independent media to hold people like me to account.”As for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. “I am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,” Bush said.Carter also voiced concerns after Trump’s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women’s movement would be “invigorated” by Trump and that he didn’t see “any glimmer of hope” from the administration on race and gender issues.Bill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman’s presidential campaign, didn’t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. “He doesn’t know much,” Clinton said in late December. “One thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.”George H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.Criticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.“We’ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that’s not really unprecedented,” Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. “If it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.”Current and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter’s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.“There’s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,” he said. “You don’t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.”The most reliable politics newsletter.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.“Most of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,” Mack McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, said.For example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.Others primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.“What would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,” Naftali said. “If we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.”All in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.But Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was “encouraged” by their first post-election meeting.Trump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS’ John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.“He was very nice to me, but after that, we've had some difficulties,” Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was “inappropriate.”As Barack Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about President Donald Trump. | AP PhotoHistorically speaking, Trump’s relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors’ had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. “That one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,” she saidAnd Trump hasn’t shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a “bad (or sick) guy!” as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush “not nice” during the campaign, said the Bush administration “lied” about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton “the WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.”George H.W. Bush and Carter weren’t excluded from Trump’s slights. “Enough is Enough- No More Bushses!” Trump tweeted during the campaign. He also criticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.Steven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.And Carter hasn't always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and — while revealing that he voted for Sanders — Carter said the ""downturn"" of human rights ""preceded 2016.""“President Carter, I think he hopes that he won’t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,” Hochman said. “Actually, I’m sure he would.”Both Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush's chief of staff. He’s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.“They may have personal opinions, but they’re not going to express them,” Skinner said. “Both 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they’ve been both very cautious about what they say.”McLarty, Clinton’s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. “I wouldn't be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,” he said.Getting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today’s events in Washington.“I think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,” he said.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,1921

After several teaser shots of the new campaign—officially called “La Collection Memento N°2“—KENZO and Spears finally unveiled their partnership on their social media channels.  The campaign, shot by legendary photographer Peter Lindbergh, focuses on the idea of cultural icons—something that Spears wholeheartedly embodies. With a heavy focus on denim and the quintessential KENZO motifs, the collection is vast and wide ranging for both men, women and some pieces that may be worn by both genders. One of those motifs, for which KENZO had become internationally recognized, is “the jumping tiger,” developed by Kenzo Takada in the 1970s.  “I was really flattered when KENZO approached me to the face of their 50th anniversary line,” began Spears. “I love the brand, and with denim being a big part of this collection, it made it that much more appealing to me since denim is such a part of my own style.” (Who could ever forget her matching denim-on-denim moment on the Grammy’s red carpet with then-beau Justin Timberlake?)  The collection elevates the ever-popular “athleisure” trend. For the main ad campaign shot, Britney Spears wears the Cropped ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Sweatshirt, the Denim ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Denim Baseball Cap (already sold out), The Mini Denim ‘Kanagawa Wave’ Rucksack and the Denim Shorts.  The collaboration certainly is a match made in heaven. Spears’ is a timeless, American icon, and her reign as the queen of pop will surely last generations to come.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I made a terrible mistake. When someone I knew, someone I had loved as a brother, was accused, I did something inexcusable: I publicly spoke up in his defense,” she wrote. “There are few acts I could ever regret more in this life. I didn’t have the ‘insider information’ I claimed but rather blind faith in a story that kept slipping and changing and revealed itself to mean nothing at all.”  “I wanted to feel my workplace and my world were safe, untouched by the outside world (a privilege in and of itself, the privilege of ignoring what hasn’t hurt you) and I claimed that safety at cost to someone else, someone very special,” she continued.  Dunham also apologized directly to Perrineau, 24.  “To Aurora: You have been on my mind and in my heart every day this year,” she said. “I love you. I will always love you. I will always work to right that wrong. In that way, you have made me a better woman and a better feminist.”  “You shouldn’t have been given that job in addition to your other burdens, but here we are, and here I am asking: How do we move forward? Not just you and I but all of us, living in the gray space between admission and vindication,” she continued.  Dunham said that it was “painful to realize” that she “had actually internalized the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what, protect it no matter what, baby it no matter what.”  “There are some who will think I am writing this to curry public favor (that’s OK, though, I stopped thinking that was an option for me somewhere around 2014, and that’s some kind of freedom),” she added. “I have the only women I want or need in my life. And this is the Women in Entertainment issue, and women in entertainment need healing. Sometimes healing starts with the words: I’m sorry.”  Jay L. Clendenin/Contour/Getty  Perrineau, daughter of Lost star Harold Perrineau, alleged Miller sexually assaulted her in 2012 when she was only 17. She filed a complaint last year about the alleged attack with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office, claiming that she met Miller at L.A.’s Standard Hotel with friends in 2012 and “consumed some alcoholic beverages.” She alleged Miller, then 35, asked them for a ride home, where they all went inside, reluctantly on her part, after arriving.  In her statement for a polygraph test taken in September 2017, she claimed she awoke naked in his bed where he was “having sexual intercourse” with her, against her consent.  Miller’s attorney, Matthew Walerstein, told The Wrap at the time he “categorically and vehemently denies Ms. Perrineau’s outrageous claims,” adding that his legal team had “gathered overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims.”  Dunham and alongside Girls co-creator Jenni Konner then released a statement in which they voiced their support for Miller and insinuated that Perrineau “misreported” the rape. The statement was met with serious backlash, and Dunham later issued an apology on Twitter.  In an interview with New York Magazine last month, Dunham said Perrineau’s allegations went public two days after she had undergone an elective total hysterectomy in the hopes of treating her chronic pain caused by endometriosis, and she was she was “high as a f—ing kite” from the surgery.  When she was asked to comment on the allegations, Dunham — who has been public about her experiences with sexual assault — said she recalling thinking: “Well, people know that I’m an advocate for these issues, so if I say this, they’ll know I’m not coming from X or Y place. … I think I was just like, F— everyone else.

1526b407-cc5c-40c6-a48a-93ad8351bc16,"(WENN) -- Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have reportedly agreed on a settlement in their divorce.    According to editors at TMZ, the estranged couple has been locked in a complicated and time-consuming battle over their property, which has prevented their divorce from becoming final.  Ben and Jennifer did not have a pre-nuptial agreement in place, so all their earnings during their marriage had to split equally.  The superstar couple, who split in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children - Violet, 12, Seraphina, nine, and Samuel, six.  Sources told the gossip site that the final settlement will be filed with the court once Gone Girl star has finished his stay in rehab.    The 46-year-old actress showed up at Ben's Pacific Palisades home in California on Wednesday afternoon and allegedly begged him to get help for his ongoing alcohol abuse issues. She told waiting photographers to give the couple privacy, and said ""it was not a good time"".  Jennifer was then spotted leaving with the actor/director and a person believed to be a sober coach and drove Ben to an unnamed rehab facility.  Friends of the star tell Page Six Ben has been ""struggling"" with sobriety since breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus, and it was photographs obtained by The Blast showing him taking a delivery of alcohol that reportedly forced his ex to take action.

That’s according to People, which says that Bullock released a brief statement saying that she hopes we can rise above the current political climate and join together to help those in need. “There are no politics in eight feet of water,” she says, “there are human beings in eight feet of water.” (Bullock presumably missed Donald Trump’s hurricane response, because he seems pretty confident that there’s a ton of politics in eight feet of water.)  As it turns out, though, this is far from the first time that Bullock has used her superstar status to help people in need. As noted by E! News, Bullock has donated more than $5 million to charities and people in need over the years, including $1 million to 9/11 relief efforts, $1 million to help victims of the tsunami in Indonesia in 2004, and another $1 million to the Red Cross after Hurricane Katrina. The story notes that Bullock doesn’t do it for attention, which is why she’s usually quiet about it, and in a statement Bullock says “we have to take care of one another” and that she’s “just grateful” she can do it.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,277

9836144d-a783-4da8-9f70-c5599e20deb9,"Do you feel it in your fingers? Do you feel it in your toes?  As you may or may not have noticed, Christmas is all around us. ‘Tis the season for novelty pop singles, for children’s nativity plays, for office holiday parties, for happy reunions at airports, for Mariah Carey — in short, for Love Actually.  Richard Curtis’ “ultimate romantic comedy” has been charming viewers every holiday season (and a lot of other seasons, too, if we’re being honest) since it first hit theaters in 2003. In the layered collection of loosely-connected love stories taking place over the weeks leading up to one Christmas in London, everybody has their own favorite Love Actually moment — from a politician’s personal dance party to a controversial cue-card confession to “Are you from England?” But which of the film’s nine narrative threads reigns supreme?  We’ve put them all in order from worst to best, just because it’s Christmas (and at Christmas you tell the truth). Check out our ranking, actually, below!  9. Juliet, Peter, and Mark  It’s cool that Keira Knightley, Andrew Lincoln, and Chiwetel Ejiofor all went on to be insanely famous and beloved. You know what’s not cool? Every single thing about their storyline, especially those unforgivably creepy cue cards. The whole thing leaves a worse taste in my mouth than Juliet’s “terrible taste in pie.” How can Juliet and Mark never tell Peter about their weird little moment? How did Mark even fall in love with Juliet if he never deigned to have a conversation with her… because he was already in love with her?! All the love that exists between this trio is built on secrets and lies. How do we all stand for it every Christmas? To me, this is not perfect.  8. Harry and Karen (and Mia, I guess)  Harry and Karen’s love gone wrong has got to be the most crushing story in the movie because while there’s still hope for Sarah’s heart to mend, Karen knows that “life will always be a little bit worse” following the discovery of her husband’s confirmed infidelity (and their subdued airport reunion at the end reinforces that realization). And if the image of Emma Thompson crying while listening to Joni Mitchell doesn’t absolutely shatter your heart, I honestly have no idea what will.  7. Sarah, Karl, and Michael  The attraction between Sarah and Karl is very underdeveloped, but I guess the gist is that Laura Linney’s radiant goodness and Rodrigo Santoro’s unreasonable handsomeness just inexorably drew them to each other until Karl finally asked Sarah to dance. Alas, while Sarah has probably the biggest heart of anyone in this whole movie filled with great big stupid hearts, there just isn’t enough room in it for her to be both devoted to her brother Michael and to begin a relationship with beautiful, beautiful Karl. Don’t worry, Sarah! Patrick Dempsey will be yours in 14 short years.  6. Colin and the American girls  When we first hear self-proclaimed “God of Sex” Colin tell his friend Tony that he plans to cross the Atlantic to find a girlfriend — based on the infallible logic that no American girl will be able to resist his British accent — we accept it as a dumb cliché and brace ourselves for Colin’s inevitable humiliation at the hands of all the smart American girls who will reject him. But no! It’s got to be Love Actually’s cleverest joke (if one of its rather shallower love stories) that Colin was absolutely right. Good thing that suitcase was chock-a-block full of condoms!  5. John and Judy  The simplest, and one of the sweetest, love stories in Love Actually is that of John and “Just Judy,” who feel no awkwardness whatsoever as they nakedly simulate sex in their work together as body doubles, but blush and giggle and stutter their way through their shy flirtations. When Judy finally admits, “all I want for Christmas… is you!” it lacks the flash of some of the other romantic climaxes, but is no less filled with feeling.  4. Jamie and Aurélia  Yes, their (sort of) bilingual proposal scene is adorable, but it’s also pretty schmaltzy, capitalizing on that cheapest of rom-com setups, the declaration of love before an audience of strangers. (Really, was it necessary for Jamie to attract a whole parade of Aurélia’s neighbors on his way to propose to her?) But it’s hard to resist Colin Firth’s broken Portuguese — or that soaring Love Actually score, played to greatest effect here.  3. David and Natalie  Prime Minister David and his household staffer Natalie first bond, in a quiet unspoken British way, over her tendency to curse and his taste for chocolate biscuits. His door-to-door search of her in “the dodgy end” of Wandsworth is very charming, of course, but his greatest moment as a romantic hero is when he stands up to Billy Bob Thornton’s sleazy American president (we get it, Love Actually, Americans have no class) at a press conference. Yes, he was talking about politics, but there’s no way he would have spoken with such passion if he hadn’t come to really hate POTUS for harassing Natalie.  2. Billy Mack and Joe  Love Actually knew that not all love stories had to be romantic a solid decade before Frozen hit us over the head with it! When rock & roll sellout Billy Mack figures out that his decades-old friendship with “my fat manager” Joe means more to him than anything else, he delivers perhaps the movie’s greatest confession of love: “It’s a terrible, terrible mistake, Chubs, but you turned out to be the f—ing love of my life.”  1. Daniel, Sam, and Joanna  The Christmas concert! The airport sprint! Love Actually’s two greatest set pieces both belong to little Sam and his crush Joanna, and the movie’s youngest heroes would probably earn the top spot on the merit of those scenes alone. But what makes their sweet love story really soar above the rest is how it’s colored by the loss of Sam’s mother at the beginning of the film, and how much Sam’s pursuit of Joanna, assisted by his also-grieving stepfather Daniel, is about embracing and overcoming the “total agony” of love of all kinds. Finally, as additional confirmation that this storyline has been sprinkled with magic Christmas dust, Claudia Schiffer shows up at the end to date Daniel! Love actually is all around.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1291

4ea64f0e-b1d4-4a4d-a0a0-31db3f6cb767,"CLOSE Jay-Z's new album ‘4:44’ is basically his reaction to Beyoncé's 'Lemonade.' USA TODAY  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage — and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.""  ""Things start happening that the public can see,” he continued. “Then we had to get to a point of ‘Okay, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning' … It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed.  “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years – 13 years,” Williams said. “All of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.""  The Grey's Anatomy actor called the breakup ""the most painful experience I’ve had in my life, like, with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart,"" and denied the rumors ""that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.”  Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track.  For Jay fans hoping to see 4:44 live, the rapper announced a 31-city tour on Monday, which kicks off in October.

In case you missed it: Here’s a video recap from the event starring Maya Rudolph, Jane Krakowski, Ana Gasteyer, and more.  On December 17, the musical adaptation of the beloved Christmas movie A Christmas Story hit the small screen in the live television event A Christmas Story Live! With music by Tony and Oscar winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Dear Evan Hansen, La La Land), there was much anticipation leading up to Fox’s second live musical broadcast. (The network first jumped into the scene with Grease: Live in 2016.)  Co-directed by eight-time Tony nominee Scott Ellis (She Loves Me) as the stage director and Alex Rudzinksi as the live television director, the broadcast starred Saturday Night Live alum Maya Rudolph as Mrs. Parker, Chris Diamontopoulos (Waitress) as Mr. Parker, Tony winner Jane Krakowski as Miss Shields, Ana Gasteyer as Mrs. Schwartz, and Andy Walken as Ralphie Parker.  Just as Grease: Live kicked off with a pop star performance from Jessie J, Bebe Rexha opened the broadcast with the new song “Count on Christmas”:  Tony winner Matthew Broderick served as the “grown up” version of Ralphie Parker, narrating the story of the kid desperate for an Official Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot Range Model Air Rifle. In this clip, Broderick narrates the opening scene and audiences meet Walken as young Ralphie singing the Act 1 opener, “It All Comes Down to Christmas.”    Viewers got to know Ralphie’s dad, played by Diamontopolous, a bit better in the next number “The Genius On Cleveland Street” as he dreams of being the best crossword-puzzle solver. It’s the simple things in life:    At school, Ralphie struggled with bullying problems. In this song on the playground, the kids of A Christmas Story Live! sing “When You’re a Wimp.”    In another dream-like sequence, Ralphie saves the day in “Ralphie to the Rescue”:    The famous leg lamp, now symbolic of A Christmas Story, inspires the next number, “A Major Award”:    Pasek and Paul wrote a new song for the December 17 event: “In the Market for a Miracle.” Drama Desk winner Gasteyer played Mrs. Schwartz, the mother of one of Ralphie’s friends, and sang the new song about celebrating Chanukah amidst the typical Christmas festivities. Watch her belt it out here:    In this iconic moment from the movie, Ralphie’s friend Flick gets his tongue stuck to the flagpole in “Sticky Situation”:    In this fantasy sequence, Ralphie’s teacher Miss Shields (Krakowski) wows in a traditional musical theatre showstopper.

Being apart was crucial for them to move on and to realize they were meant to be together.” Ultimately, “buying a home to live in as a couple will seal the deal.”  Although Justin and Selena are clearly happy, as seen in photos from their most recent outing, not everyone is shipping the pair. Selena’s family, who were there for her after the couple’s 2015 split, are reportedly concerned for her well being. “They want Selena to remain healthy,” the source says of her family’s opinions. As you may know, Selena suffers from the auto immune disease lupus, and underwent a lifesaving kidney transplant over the summer. “Now, her family feels “this could be the biggest mistake of her life.”  Jelena shocked the world, and nearly broke the internet, when they reunited at her CA home in late October. However, the pair were not alone. They spent hours on end inside her home with mutual friends. Selena was still dating The Weeknd, 27, at the time of her reunion with the Biebs. However, the pair split just days after. What timing? …  And, that first Jelena hangout was the start of many others to come. Justin and Selena have been inseparable ever since — Being photographed on sweet strolls through CA, riding bikes, out to romantic meals and attending church services. Interesting enough, we may have seen them together more times in the past few weeks than in their entire relationship… and that began in 2009. So, you can infer that they’ve been hanging out A LOT.  The couple or non-couple [they have yet to confirm], were most recently spotted out on a sweet stroll in LA on Nov. 13. A fan caught Jelena walking through what appeared to be a local park. Now, reports are claiming that Justin is patiently waiting for Sel to make him her boyfriend. Do you think she will?

In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund and Tiger Beer in efforts to spread awareness of the decreasing population of the tigers in the wild, she is urging her fans to participate in the #3890TIGERS campaign.  VanCamp recently talked to E! News about the campaign, sharing that the number of tigers left in the wild has lowered down to less than 4,000.  ""To put that in perspective, there are more tigers in captivity in the US than are left in the wild—that's not only shocking, it's heartbreaking. These are incredible creatures at the top of the food chain, yet as powerful as they are, they still our need protection,"" the actress told the news outlet.  As to what the goal of this campaign is, VanCamp stated that the organization aims to double the wild tiger population within five years.  She added, ""With Global Tiger Day this Saturday, we really want to raise awareness for our goal to double the wild tiger population by the next year of Zodiac Tiger in 2022. I also happen to have been born in 1986, another year of the Tiger, so to be able to lend my voice to the wild tigers who have none, means a lot to me and brings it all full circle.""  The fans had noticed that the Canadian actress stayed off social media for a while, even removing her profile picture. Recently, on Instagram, she posted an art with a portrait image of her and a tiger. She explained that the purpose of her disappearance was to raise awareness for the disappearance of these majestic animals.  In the caption, she also urged her followers to participate in the campaign by deleting their profile pictures, creating tiger-related art, or making a donation to the rangers that are responsible for keeping the tiger safe in the wild.  According to People, in the multi-year partnership between Tiger Beer and World Wildlife Fund, the popular brewery company has already donated $1 million to the organization's conservation efforts. They are also reportedly going to match $25,000 worth of donations given to the organization's ""Back a Ranger"" program through the end of August.

3476f173-bce7-4ff4-a3e0-ee02ab0b9a2d,"As Kylie Jenner’s feud with Wendy Williams rages on, Travis Scott is helping Kylie in the best way! Here’s how he’s supporting her amidst Wendy’s continuous disses!  Kylie Jenner, 20, is basking in the joy of being a new mother, but when she hears about Wendy Williams, 53, and her constant verbal attacks on her relationship with Travis Scott, 25, it’s hard not to get a bit frustrated. Wendy has stood by her prediction that Travis will eventually leave Kylie and the baby to live the partying lifestyle of a successful rapper. Before baby Stormi Webster was born on February 1, Wendy predicted that Travis would leave Kylie to raise the baby on her own. However, Travis hasn’t done that, and he doesn’t plan to, a source tells HollywoodLife.com. He’s sticking by Kylie’s side, and proving Wendy wrong.  “Kylie is getting the last laugh in her feud with Wendy Williams thanks to Travis,” the insider says. “Kylie’s not being petty and dwelling on it but yes, she’s pretty thrilled that Travis is proving Wendy and all the haters wrong. Don’t forget, Wendy said some pretty nasty things about how Travis was going to abandon Kylie and Stormi and that has not been the case at all.” Instead, it’s been the compete opposite. “He’s been so solid,” the source continues, adding that Travis is “the best dad and Kylie could not be happier. — She’s falling more in love with him every day.”  Throughout Kylie’s pregnancy, Wendy taunted the young star on her show. She remained adamant about her opinion that Kylie would be a single mother, even before giving birth. “At 20-years-old being pregnant, and I don’t care how much money you have, it’s got to be hard,” the talk show host said on her January 24 show. “The next reality show in the works right now might be, I got a name for you, ‘Kylie Goes It Alone’ because Travis Scott is not sticking around,” she proclaimed while laughing at a photo of the rapper. “Anyway, he’s not sticking around,” she said, once again.  Nonetheless, the couple is still going strong. In fact, Kylie and Travis celebrated Stormi’s one-month birthday on March 1, with both parents gushing over their bundle of joy on social media. First, Kylie took to Snapchat to show off the massive bouquets of pink flowers Travis had sent her in honor of Stormi’s one month in their lives. Then, both parents showed off photos of Stormi — the most we’ve seen of the little one — despite hiding her face in the snaps. Kylie also showed off her 4-week post-baby boy, aka her flat abs, on Snapchat.  Kylie and Travis welcomed a healthy baby girl, Stormi — who was 8 pounds, 9 ounces — at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 1. Kylie didn’t reveal she was pregnant or that she gave birth until February 4 when she released an 11-minute video with never-before-seen footage from her entire pregnancy. Since then, she’s returned to her normal social media use after taking a 9-month hiatus from the spotlight to enjoy her pregnancy in private.

The late-night host, 39, enlisted several of his Carpool Karaoke guests from the past year — including Pink, Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Sam Smith, Kelly Clarkson and Fifth Harmony — to sing a fun-filled rendition of the Christmas classic “Santa Claus Is Comin’ to Town.”  The holiday sketch kicked off with Corden and musician Reggie Watts, who leads the Late Late Show’s house band, cruising around Los Angeles. “The great thing about this time of year is I feel like it’s the only time we’re not judged for driving to work dressed like this,” quipped the British star, who was clad in a red Santa hat and a Christmas sweater.  After singing the tune with his many guests, Corden turned to Styles, 23, and said, “Happy Christmas, Harold.” The former One Direction singer initially stayed silent but smirked slightly. He then leaned in to kiss Corden on the lips, placing one of his hands on the comedian’s cheek and wrapping the other around his head.  “Wow, I did not expect that for Christmas,” the TV personality said with a laugh.

Photos: Shutterstock, Getty Images  If you've spent even .01% of your time watching the Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's love story unfold, you are well aware that comparisons Princess Diana has been invoked pretty often.  The late Princess of Wales has been mentioned constantly since the couple's engagement announcement back in November, and hey, we're just as guilty of waxing poetic about it too. But there's some truth to the comparison, even if you're a skeptic.  The Duchess of Sussex truthfully does have a good amount in common with her mother-in-law, to the point where the first ones to draw the parallel were actually Meghan and Harry themselves. They brought Di up in their engagement interview, where Harry made it clear how close he imagined they would be if his mother was still alive.  ""Oh they'd be thick as thieves, without question,"" Prince Harry said. ""I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me, but then, as I said, would have probably been best friends—best friends with Meghan. It's days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's ... ""  "" ... she's with us,"" Markle finished.  RELATED: Singer Bryan Adams Was Asked Point-Blank About His Relationship with Princess Diana  Who are we to argue with that? Luckily we don't have to, since there's plenty of evidence to back it up, even without Harry's perspective in the mix. Allow us to break it down.  They are humanitarians.  This is probably the most striking comparison drawn between the two royals. Princess Diana was famously activism-focused. Her legacy is one of humanitarian work and beloved reverence now, but during her time as a princess while she was still alive, she was met with heated criticism for doing things like fighting the AIDS stigma in a time when even the U.S. president Ronald Reagan wouldn't acknowledge the disease existed. Not everyone understood what she was doing and why, but in hindsight, it all makes complete sense.  Markle has also shown herself to be an advocate, and she's spoken about gender equality, social justice, and feminism openly. Now that she has a larger global platform, it will be exciting to see what she chooses to do with it.  They're rule breakers.  As Markle gets the hang of this whole royals thing, she's made a few stumbles here and there. She's got good company, though. As some remember, Diana didn't always hesitate to break or bend the rules herself.  After choosing her own engagement ring and writing her own vows, she had Prince William and Prince Harry and insisted they went to school normally. That might seem like a ""no duh"" move now, but according to Good Housekeeping, William was actually the first heir to the throne to attend a public school. Ever.  Image zoom Tim Graham/Getty Images  That makes Markle walking herself partway down the aisle during the royal wedding seem like nothing.  Their parents are divorced.  Diana's father John Spencer and her mother Frances Spencer split when Di was seven years old. Markle went through something similar when her parents, Doria Ragland and the now-infamous Thomas Markle, separated when she was two years old, as she told Vanity Fair.  RELATED: Why Meghan Markle’s Wearing So Much Pink, According to Royal Experts  “What’s so incredible, you know, is that my parents split up when I was two, [but] I never saw them fight. We would still take vacations together. My dad would come on Sundays to drop me off, and we’d watch Jeopardy! eating dinner on TV trays, the three of us,"" she said. ""We were still so close-knit.”  They didn't date their future husbands long before getting engaged.  Harry and Meghan's seemingly whirlwind relationship drew ire from skeptics, since they only met in summer 2016, and were engaged November 2017. Turns out, Diana and her ex Prince Charles were the same before they wed. Princess Diana started dating Charles in summer 1980, and they were engaged by February 1981.  Their engagement rings coordinated.  The likeness of the two royals is physically manifested in the engagement ring Prince Harry gave Markle. Her ring includes two diamonds from Diana's collection, with the center stone being from Botswana.  Image zoom Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images  They weren't born royal.  They share this commonality with Kate Middleton as well. None of them were born into royalty, yet they all learned (and are learning) the ropes in their own ways.  RELATED: Meghan Markle Just Broke Her Silence on Her Marriage to Prince Harry and It’s … Something  All that said, they do have unique differences.  Of course, it's evident that they aren't twins, and it isn't fair to pass them off that way for the rest of Meghan and Harry's lives. The differences are also there. Diana grew up in a well-known British family that had ties to Queen Elizabeth from the get-go. Markle, on the other hand, was born in Los Angeles to a yoga instructor and lighting director.  Unlike Diana, Meghan wore two dresses at her wedding. Markle's family didn't meet the royals until days before the wedding, and her dad still hasn't met Harry, unlike Diana, who had closer ties to the royals long before she started dating Charles. Markle had been married and divorced before marrying Harry. There doesn't seem to be a Camilla Parker-Bowles-like figure in the dynamic between Harry and Meghan like there was for Charles and Diana.

2fe002e3-d80e-4560-b5be-21512d4845e6,"Two former partners of Chip Gaines in the creation of the Magnolia Real Estate Company are suing the “Fixer Upper” star for fraud, claiming that Gaines bought them out without telling them that HGTV had decided to broadcast the show nationally “and that the show prominently featured the ‘Magnolia’ brand name.”  (Photo by Neal Klaeser)  In the 24-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court in Waco, Gaines’s two former partners, lawyers John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark, are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, as well.  Gaines’ spokesman declined to comment on the suit, but his attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX Thursday, “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.""  Lewis and Clark were equal partners with Gaines in founding the Magnolia Real Estate Company in 2007.  The suit says that for the first six years, the company largely operated in Waco with a single real estate agent.  The suit claims Gaines worked out a deal with HGTV for the “Fixer Upper” program without telling his partners and that Gaines planned on featuring the Magnolia brand name.  Gaines bought their shares of Magnolia Real estate for $2,500 each, the suit says.  ""With this insider information in hand, Chip Gaines convinced plaintiffs to sell their membership interests in Magnolia Realty quickly to him before a public announcement that “Fixer Upper” was picked up by HGTV.""  The suit, which also names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive, Scripps networks LLC and High Noon Entertainment which produces the show, claims Gaines pressured Lewis and Clark to sell “before they discovered the company’s value was radically enhanced by ‘Fixer Upper.’”  When Clark balked at the terms of the buyout, the suit alleges Gaines sent a text advising Lewis to tell Clark “to be careful.”  “I don’t come from the nerdy prep school he’s from. And when people talk to me that way they get their asses kicked. And if he’s not ready to do that he better shut his mouth. I’m not the toughest guy there is, but I can assure you that would not end well for [R]ick,” the text read, according to the suit.  Since the show debuted, the suit says, Magnolia has grown from a single-agent firm to one that employs “over 93 real estate agents, and a support staff, and now operates in nearly every major city in Texas.”  In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for Lewis’ and Clark’s interest, payment of salaries, bonuses in-kind benefits and distributions they would have received as partners",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,543

SHOULD David Foster wind up at the piano during his upcoming nuptials to Katharine McPhee, it wouldn’t be the first time he performed at a wedding of hers.  While celebrating her first marriage to Nick Cokas in February 2008, McPhee serenaded Cokas with a rendition of Nat King Cole and Natalie Cole’s Unforgettable at their lavish wedding reception, with Grammy-winning producer Foster on the keys, People reported this week, resurfacing a photo of the performance.  In May 2014, McPhee filed for divorce from Cokas after six years of marriage. The 34-year-old “American Idol” alum confirmed her engagement to Foster, 68, on Tuesday.  “He did it at the top of this mountain in Anacapri [Italy]. Totally dark only stars,” she revealed in a text exchange (via Instagram) with Just Jared’s Jared Eng, before joking: “Thankfully he didn’t push me off the cliff. He said it was one or the other. And in the end he spared me.”  Following news of the engagement, Foster’s daughters took to social media, where Erin, 35, jokingly called her future stepmom “Mommyyyy.” Sara, 37, also wrote, “Out of the country. What did I miss?”  This isn’t the first time Erin and Sara have played around with Foster and McPhee’s relationship status. In September, Sara posted, “Excited about my new step mom” on her Instagram story.  The siblings also believed Foster would find wife No. 5 long before he popped the question to McPhee.  “We love when he is married, in a relationship. He is at his happiest when he is in a relationship,” Erin said in 2016. “He will definitely get married again. He loves being married. Lucky No. 5!”  Foster split from first wife B.J. Cook in 1981 after nine years. He wed Rebecca Dyer the following year, later calling it quits with her in 1986. Following his 14-year union to Linda Thompson, which ended in 2005, Foster married Yolanda Hadid in 2011. Their divorce was finalised in 2017.

With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”  HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”  In addition to writing the pilot, Goldman (X-Men: First Class) will serve as showrunner, and will join Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin as an executive producer. You’ll have to wait a bit to see it, though: Bloys said earlier this year the prequel won’t debut until at least a year after the original GoT wraps up its final season — which won’t start until the first half of 2019.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,298

Sexism is so rife in Hollywood it hardly comes as a surprise when (yet another) male director is accused of something vile towards an aspiring female actress.  Well, this time (in the 1,347th edition of Sexism In Hollywood) it isn’t an aspiring actress making the claim, but Emmy Rossum — Golden Globe nominated Emmy Rossum.  “My agent called me and was like, ‘I’m so embarrassed to make this call, but there’s a big movie and they’re going to offer it to you. They really love your work on the show. But the director wants you to come into his office in a bikini. There’s no audition. That’s all you have to do,” Rossum said during a comedy roundtable hosted by The Hollywood Reporter.  The worst part — and likely the part every woman can relate to — was that Rossum didn’t immediately dismiss the offer, because of such an ingrained culture of sexism whereby attitudes and expectations are actually just pretty normal occurrences. Relate?  “And I actually had this moment like, ‘Well, how good is the part?’” Rossum said. “For a second, I was like, ‘Would I do it? Send me the script. Maybe the character is in a bikini in the movie.’”  But upon getting her hands on the script, Rossum was horrified to know that nope, there was no bikini scene, and actually no nudity at all.  “We really love your work, but we just want to see how tight your ass is,” Rossum said, mimicking the director’s voice. “Are you fucking kidding me? Last time I checked, I’m not a fucking model.”  Yeah, last time we checked a good bum might be a prerequisite for the Victoria’s Secret fashion show but definitely not for much else.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,366

However it seems the Spice Girls may have dashed the fans hopes of a reunion yet again due to claims that Victoria Beckham has allegedly refused to tour.  The iconic pop band's reunion tour is believed to have been called off following rifts between Posh and Melanie C, Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton, reports the Sun.  It's all off! The Spice Girls may have dashed the fans hopes of a reunion yet again due to claims that Victoria Beckham has allegedly refused to tour  While Victoria has always insisted that she would never tour with the band again, the girls thought their original manager Simon Fuller would convince her, an insider told the website.  The women were set to make £30million each following the tour which was due to begin in late September after manager Simon masterminded the comeback.  MailOnline has contacted a representative for Victoria for comment.  The insider claimed that the band was in 'disarray' following 'heated debates between the girls and Victoria'.  Refusal: While Victoria has always insisted that she would never tour with the band again, the girls thought their original manager Simon Fuller would convince her, an insider told the website  The source said: 'Simon was brought in to convince her to take the offer but now he's failed they feel he's used them to put his name back on the map.'  It is claimed that the other girls approached Victoria last week and gave her an ultimatum between them and Simon.  However it is believed that she chose their manager, who managed to turn her brand into an empire.  Back in the day: The iconic pop band's reunion tour is believed to have been called off following rifts between Posh and Melanie C, Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton, reports the Sun  The cause of this latest chapter in the reunion saga is apparently to do with money, with a source stating that Mel B and Mel C are wanting to 'cash in'.  Despite her solo success Mel B's recent account history shows that her company Red Girl Records is £808,568 in debt with her Red Girl Touring Ltd suffering losses of £77,956 last year.  Her financial situation was laid bare in the courts last year as it was revealed her multi-million fortune had been wiped out due to her 'extravagant' lifestyle.  And in another shocking twist to the Mel B and Stephen Belafonte divorce battle, it was claimed the Spice Girls star has just £961 left in one of her company accounts.  Lucrative: The women were set to make £30million each following the tour which was due to begin in late September after manager Simon masterminded the comeback  Accounts filed for Victoria's luxury label, which sells high-end dresses and accessories, saw losses almost double to £8.5 million last year - up from £4.3million in 2015.  Meanwhile husband David's company DB Ventures, which handles the former footballer's endorsement deals, reported a profit of £24.9million after tax in 2016. This is the equivalent to roughly £2million a month.  Sales at VBL remained stable over the year however losses grew on the back of increased investment in the fashion brand's design, marketing and sales.  Earlier this year the former pop star's fashion business was valued at £100million following a major cash injection from former Goldman Sachs banker David Belhassen, the man behind French-inspired bakery chain Paul.  Decision time!

This is true, though it was less of a ""statement"" and more of an anonymous tip from a palace aide to veteran royal reporter Rebecca English.

""It really is just down to personal preference.""

64fce192-070b-4fcd-9745-1e6902f8ba8b,"Britney Spears has lived almost half of her life in the public spotlight. Ever since her debut album, “…Baby One More Time,” was released in January 1999, Britney hasn’t made a move without the paparazzi recording her every movement. The album became the biggest selling record ever by a teenage artist and solidified Britney’s status as a superstar.  Britney back in the day:  [[contentId: 2002137| | size: 75]]  One of the most highly publicized events in Britney’ life is her brief marriage to back up dancer, Kevin Federline who she had only known for three months before marrying him on September 18, 2004. (They were not legally married until October 6 after their prenuptial agreement was finalized.) Since Federline’s ex-girlfriend, actress Shar Jackson was pregnant with their second child at the time, Britney’s engagement and marriage to Federline was the subject of intense media scrutiny. While Federline waited for one woman to give birth to his baby, Britney announced in October 2004 she would be taking a career break to start a family with her new husband.  The newlyweds in 2004:  HOW DID THE BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE RUMORS START?  In 2005, the couple signed a deal for a reality television series, “Britney and Kevin: Chaotic,” a five-episode series chronicling the couple’s relationship from their courtship and engagement to their wedding. The show aired on UPN from May 17 to June 14, 2005 and used footage that was shot during the European leg of Britney’s The Onyx Hotel Tour. Britney had originally intended to shoot backstage footage of the concert tour for a reality show called, “OnTourage” but had to scrap the tour after undergoing arthroscopic surgery following a knee injury while she was shooting a music video.  Britney said about the reality show, “From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art.”  The tagline from the show was, “Can you handle our truth?”  The 5 episode series later came out on DVD:  The show was panned by critics who deemed the show as being too explicit and criticized Britney’s excessive narcissism. In the series, the pop star is seen talking about how the couple’s bedroom antics are “so good” and begs Kevin to let her take the day off “to just fuck all day.” She’s also seen quizzing her staff and crew about their sex lives and favorite sexual positions. During her pregnancy, Britney told reporters that her sex life was the best it had ever been since she conceived claiming, “I think it’s the best. Sex is crazy good.” Talk like this is generally what births and fuels sex tape rumors since the thought process is if the sex is that great, it must have been captured on video especially if the participants involved are celebrities.  A pregnant Britney with Federline. Now we get why they’re smiling:  IS THERE A BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE?  Rumors about a Britney and Kevin sex tape didn’t heat up until Us Weekly said in its October 17, 2005 “Hot Stuff” column that the couple watched “sex tape footage” with their lawyers and that the video was supposedly shot by a member of their entourage. Other rumors circulated that a member of Britney’s entourage copied one of the couple’s personal video tapes and a source reportedly told America’s Us Weekly magazine, “He has threatened to release raunchy footage of the two taken before Spears looked pregnant.”  Britney responded to the US Weekly story by filing a $10 million defamation lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court declaring in court documents that, “My husband and I have not filmed ourselves having sex. Therefore, we obviously did not bring any ‘sex tape’ to our lawyers’ offices for any reason, nor were we concerned that someone from our ‘entourage’ was threatening to release a tape since no ‘X-rated’ tape exists. The entire story is a complete fabrication. In fact, the first time that I heard about the alleged ‘sex tape‘ is when I first heard about the article.” Britney went on to say the report was “damaging” to her career and reputation particularly with her younger audience and pointed out that she had “repeatedly rejected substantial monetary offers to pose in photographs or appear in feature films with my breasts exposed.” Ultimately, a judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that since Britney has “put her modern sexuality squarely and profitably before the public eye,” that she can’t be defamed by rumors of any such alleged sex tape. However, the ruling did not address whether or not the story about a purported sex tape was true.  Guess this is what the judge meant:  Gossip about a sex tape only increased when in November 2006, two months after giving birth to her second child with Federline, Britney filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Another rumor then emerged that Federline was shopping the alleged tape to the highest bidder and using it as leverage to get more money from the divorce proceedings. This was followed by another rumor suggesting Britney would leak the tape herself to prevent Federline from profiting. Britain’s News of the World offered Federline $50 million for the sex tape if it indeed existed.  Hoping to put an end to any and all sex tape rumors, the divorcing couple jointly released an official statement through their attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan. The statement said, “There is not a sex video of Kevin and Britney in existence. It goes without saying that the stories of Kevin attempting to sell such a video are patently false and anyone who reports that they have information of such attempts is either lying or reporting the lie of someone else.” The statement went on to say, “It would be impossible to comment upon and correct all of the other misinformation about Kevin that appears on a daily basis and consequently no attempt has been made, or will be made, to do so.” Britney and Federline’s divorce was finalized in July 2007 after the ex-couple reached a settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.  The short love story ends:  IS THERE A BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE WITH ANOTHER PERSON?  In February 2007, Britney became an unwitting star of a surveillance tape at a nightclub, One in New York City. The video reportedly shows the singer wearing fishnet stockings and a bikini while partying and eventually getting intimate with two female dancers who were fired after the manager of the club saw the video. The New York Daily News reported that a source said there were also pictures of Britney’s naked rear taken while she was trying on clothes with the dancers. The expectation was that it would leak to the internet however, the video still hasn’t surfaced.  Britney with her own dancers during a show:  In December 2007, Britney started dating celebrity photographer Adnan Ghalib who was her boyfriend during her very public mental breakdown at the beginning of 1998. By May, their relationship was over and rumors started that Ghalib wanted to sell a sex tape they had shot while they were on vacation in Mexico in January. Ghalib reportedly told British entertainment magazine, Heat, “There is such a tape. But I won’t discuss prices for hypothetical inquiries. Unless there is a locked-in deal, I will go no further. I am not interested in selling out any other details about Britney.” British newspaper The Sun said a source told them that the two-hour X-rated footage features the pop princess naked wearing just a pink wig. The insider alleges that “The video starts with Britney undressing. She was wearing some cheap clothes that she bought down there in Rosarito. The sex wasn’t particularly kinky but Britney wears a pink wig throughout. At one point in the tape Adnan asks that singer to remove the pink bob but she refused,” the source says. “Adnan tells her to take it off at one point and she says coyly, ‘Take what off? There’s nothing left to take off.’”  Although in October 2008, British tabloid Daily Star quoted a Spears family source as saying that Britney was planning to fight Ghalib in court over the sex tape, nothing materialized and neither has the alleged sex tape.  Britney and Ghalib before their break-up:  BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE SITE?  Although there is a Britney Spears sex tape site, there’s no sex tape available. The site is best for seeing upskirt or nip slip pictures of the singer and there is a nice selection of those since Britney has been known to have a few very public “off” moments. However, clicking on any link advertising a sex tape will only take you to a paid adult website. Also, unfortunately or fortunately, Britney’s All American looks can be copied by many American girls so an internet search will reveal several videos featuring girls claiming to be Britney. In reality, they’re just girls who resemble her. The most circulated video is one of a Britney look-a-like performing oral sex on someone who is supposedly Federline. There’s even one video on the net that claims to be Britney but you can’t even see the people’s faces in the footage.  The best thing for Britney Spears fans to do is to enjoy the various photographs and videos of the pop princess that is out there especially the ones of her in her heyday. Not shy in front of the camera and remember, a Superior Court judge ruled that Britney has no problem putting her modern sexuality before the public eye. So until a real Britney sex tape surfaces, fans will just have to be comforted by her the available modern sexuality that is out there and fortunately for them, there is plenty.  It was 18 year-old Britney’s idea to dress as a Catholic school girl for the video. See her evolution from this:  To this:  Britney was happy to pose nude even when she was pregnant:",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1969
b37a232f-3e14-4de3-add0-769fe0709368,"Nicki Minaj had an awkward camel toe moment at the BET Awards on June 24 during her performance, however, Drake is here for it! We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why he loves the wardrobe malfunction and her style in general!  Drake is Nicki Minaj’s biggest fan! If you keep up with either rapper, you know they have quite a history. From their feud in the past, their rumored romance, Drake’s beef with Nicki’s ex-boyfriend Meek Mill, to their many collaborations including “No Frauds,” it’s clear these two are always going to be in each other’s lives. So, it’s no surprise that when everyone trolled Nicki for her unfortunate wardrobe malfunction at the BET Awards on June 24, Drake would come to her defense. “Drake thinks Nicki’s style and her camel toe are sexy AF. He thinks she is beautiful, talented, and confident enough to rock an outfit even if it highlights her camel toe,” a source close to Drake tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.  For those of you who need a refresher, it all happened when Nicki took the stage at the Staples Center to perform “Chun-Li” and “Rich Sex”. However, her red latex body suit was hugging her in all the WRONG places. She even placed her hand over her private area in hopes of hiding it. But, fans were quick to point it out. “When he saw her BET outfit he was majorly turned on. He thought she looked great,” our insider added.  “Drake thinks Nicki is the only rapper that always looks sexy no matter what she wears. He would still hook-up with Nicki anytime,” the source continued. Talk about determination! “Drake has always felt Nicki was wifey material and her style choices are always sexy,” the source said. We definitely agree.  In the past Nicki has denied Drake, but maybe this time things will be different! Plus, she’s single! As many of you may know, she recently got out of a relationship with Nas.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,401

And Saturday night, at the Warsaw stop of Jay-Z and Beyonce’s “On the Run II” tour, a flying stage that ordinarily enables the singer to hover over the grown got stuck 20 feet in the air, forcing a rather undignified exit.  Stage techs were forced to go old-school to bring Beyonce back down to earth via an ordinary ladder. The band vamped while Beyonce initially appeared reluctant to descend via the ladder — understandable considering her towering heels — but eventually capitulated.  In a fan video (h/t Daily Beast), fans can be heard chanting the singer’s name while one yells in a thick Polish accent, “You can do it!” The fan who posted the video wrote: “Beyoncé’s flying stage got broken at the end of the show in Warsaw and she had to walk down on a ladder. She also gave us a little cute dance!”  The tour kicked off June 6 in Cardiff, UK, and covers 15 cities across the UK and Europe, with the 21-date North American leg beginning July 25 in Cleveland.

They watch in genuine wonderment as their nation’s flag rises and the stadium resounds with the thunderous tones of their national anthem. These awe-inspiring moments draw the eyes of half the world to the Olympic Games, where spectators marvel at the unfathomable tenacity and strength of the world’s best athletes.  Yet those triumphant moments provide only superficial insight into an athlete’s tumultuous trek to victory. Their journeys took stamina and determination, but for too many athletes, it also took much more: their innocence, pride, self-worth and well-being, a merciless charge in exchange for success.  In too many cases, the winner is expected to take it all – the psychological and physical pain, the sexual abuse and the animosity of teammates in silence and with unfaltering national pride. Nowhere is this more evident or troubling than in USA Gymnastics.  Clad in sparkly, red-white-and-blue spandex, the female USA gymnasts are images of strength, grace and patriotism. Winning consecutive Olympic golds in 2012 and 2016, in addition to world championships in 2011, 2014 and 2015, the USA Women’s Gymnastics program has distinguished itself as a force to be reckoned with. The women have not only racked up quite the collection of gold medals, but they have also accrued millions of views and brought abundant media attention to the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.  During the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 38.7 million viewers tuned into NBC’s broadcast of the Women’s Gymnastics final, where the U.S. women dominated. In fact, in 2012, four of the five members of the “Fierce Five” ranked in the “Top 10 Most Clicked Athletes” on NBC’s Olympics.com, with Gabby Douglas leading with over 23 million clicks to her page. These women are the pride and joy of the U.S. Olympic Committee, not to mention national and international sensations.

But the thinly veiled facade is beginning to fade, most notably with the well-founded sexual abuse allegations against USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, by over 150 women and girls, according to CNN.  Among those victims were gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber. They each had a story to tell, rife with gruesome details of long-term abuse.  It is the dismaying story of McKayla Maroney, a “Fierce Five” member and silver medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, that perhaps most aptly encapsulates both Nassar’s menace and USA Gymnastics’ negligence. In the fall of 2017, Maroney made a startling announcement via Twitter that Nassar had abused her from the time she was thirteen years old until she left gymnastics in 2016, according to Time Magazine.  “I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting,” Maroney said. The gymnast recounted a particularly traumatic event on a flight to Tokyo when Nassar gave her a sleeping pill. The next thing Maroney remembered was waking up alone with Nassar in his hotel room enduring one of his “treatments.” She was 15 years old.  While it is shocking that a predator like Nassar was able to worm his way into this esteemed organization and continue his abuse for years without notice, the organization’s handling of the travesty was unprofessional, unpardonable and downright unethical.  While USA Gymnastics commended Maroney’s courage when she publicly announced the horrors she endured, it soon came to light that a year earlier, the organization made her “sign a non-disclosure agreement as part of a financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment,” according to NBC.  On Dec. 20, 2017, Maroney filed a lawsuit on the grounds that the agreement she signed was “hypocritical, immoral and in this case illegal,” said Maroney’s attorney. In response, on Jan. 16, 2018, USA Gymnastics ensured that it would not hound Maroney for any money should she choose to speak out. But even with this turnaround, the sheer reality that this rectification was even necessary is utterly unspeakable.  A symphony of voices rose in corroboration of Maroney’s claims, and 156 women delivered grievous and powerful statements in front of Nassar’s very eyes during a seven-day-long trial. Aly Raisman, team captain of both the “Fierce Five” and the “Final Five,” has become a vocal advocate for her fellow victims and delivered a harrowing testimony at Nassar’s trial.  “I have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully. And both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success,” Raisman said. “But did they reach out when I came forward? No.”  You might also like: Love or a Gold Medal? Two Olympic Ice Skaters Break Up to Win  But the sins of the organization did not develop overnight. In fact, this sickening culture laid down its roots many years ago. The Washington Post reported that since 1982, “more than 290 coaches and officials associated with the United States’ Olympic sports organizations have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct,” spanning 15 Olympic sports. Yet even aside from all the sexual abuse, the organizations’ transgressions still run deep, and if you pay close enough attention to history, the signs are evident.  One of the Olympics most spectacular and inspirational moments for the U.S. occurred during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, when U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug was exhorted by coach Bela Karolyi to perform the last vault on a critically sprained ankle. Despite her injury, she completed the vault, and led the U.S. women to victory over the Russians for the first time ever. However, malevolence lurks even in the Games’ most glorified moments.  The first feeling the video elicits from viewers is almost always one of admiration for the 18-year-old Strug, who somehow miraculously landed on one foot. But when you witness the agonizing pain on this young girl’s face, and Karolyi’s seemingly heartless coercion, the picture slowly turns from heartening to unsettling. To make matters worse, one of the doctors helping Strug off the stage is none other than Larry Nassar himself.  From being forced to practice on broken limbs, doping at the urging of coaches and acquiescing to irrational diets, Olympic athletes withstand unthinkable afflictions and tribulations en route to domination at the Games.  The 2017 feature film “I, Tonya,” provided yet another startling reminder of the cutthroat nature of the Games; it resurrected the 1994 attack on U.S. Olympic ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, which soon implicated Tonya Harding, her own teammate and possible conspirator in the attack.  You might also like: Randolph College’s Meredith Alwine Is Lifting Herself to the 2020 Olympics  Without the most fundamental trust and security shared between teammates, coaches and doctors, the Olympics will cease to be a place where athletes can flourish. It will become their personal hell. Olympic gold medal winner Shawn Johnson even went so far as to say in a YouTube video on her channel, “I think gymnastics is the best sport in the entire world, but if I had a daughter right now, I wouldn’t put her in it.”  With news stories, personal testimonies and unearthed history inundating almost every media platform, it has become increasingly difficult to look past the Games’ faults and focus on their worth. In order to preserve an honorable tradition and progress in a positive way, major reform is necessary.  The U.S. Olympic Committee needs to genuinely recommit itself to cultivating an organization characterized for its emphasis on unity, not duplicity. In addition, the U.S. Olympic teams must forge environments that do not alienate future generations of athletes, but instead encourage and ignite the most inspired work and dedication they can give.  There is a black, rotting hole corroding the Games from the inside, and now is the time to wipe it out. Let the upcoming PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games be the birthplace of a new era, so when these world-class athletes take the stage, country flags ascending and anthems blaring, they can be filled with authentic, unadulterated ardor for the organization and country whose names they proudly bear.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1631

Unfortunately, after years of serving as Hollywood’s golden couple, Brangelina’s reign has come to an end. With so much attention being paid to Angie’s most recent beau, why not reflect on some of her past relationships? Some of which are likely to surprise you!  Jonny Lee Miller  Prior to Pitt, Angelina had actually been married twice. The first was to fellow actor Jonny Lee Miller, who she met on the set of the 1996 film Hackers. The loved-up pair got hitched six months after shooting ended and ultimately divorced three years later, though they remain friends to this day.  Billy Bob Thornton  Those who recall it may associate Angelina and Billy Bob Thornton’s relationship with her darker, wild-child days. The eccentric couple got married in Vegas after two months of courtship, during which they became famous for their frequent PDA, 20-year age difference, and wearing vials of each other’s blood. Their marriage came to an end in 2003.  Val Kilmer  After starring alongside one another in the film Alexander Val Kilmer, rumors began swirling that Angelina had begun a romance with . The press was quick to point out that Kilmer, age 44 to her 29, was the second in a series of significantly older boyfriends in Angie’s life. Ultimately, the fling was kept private and brief.  Nicolas Cage  Considering the immense star power of both involved, you would think we would hear more about the rumored relationship between Angelina Jolie and Nicolas Cage. However, their short 2003 fling was kept so quiet that only a few sightings of them being romantic at parties were ever reported in the media.  Jenny Shimizu  For decades, Angelina Jolie has been open about her attraction to both men and women. However, only one woman has ever been known to steal the starlet’s heart: model and actress Jenny Shimizu.

ab5f22a3-eeb4-4a4a-8468-d4f29b105a13,"Share  Fans of Netflix’s cult favorite sci-fi drama series Sense8 have long been excited that the show will do something never done before by an original Netflix series: Return from cancellation. And as of Friday, June 8, the two-hour finale is available to stream on Netflix. The special was directed by Sense8 creator Lana Wachowski and promises to give fans a proper conclusion to the series.  The series about eight people connected through cosmic ways was canceled by Netflix weeks after its second season premiered. Wachowski credited “the passionate letters, the petitions, the collective voice that rose up” from the legion of die-hard Sense8 fans with the show’s revival, according to the heartfelt letter she shared on the show’s official Facebook page.”Improbably, unforeseeably, your love has brought Sense8 back to life.” This is quite surprising since the show’s official Facebook page informed fans days after the show’s cancellation that their petitions and messages were heard but not enough to bring the show back to Netflix.  The letter not only revived hope of Sense8‘s return to our lives but also gave the most definitive answer as to why it was canceled in the first place. In the letter, Wachowski stated Netflix did “love the show as much as we do, but the numbers have always been challenging.” She did not clarify if the numbers she was referring to were low viewership data, the expensive production cost, or both. Either way, that point is now moot in the face of the show’s return and opportunity for closure.  Despite the finality of its brief return, there’s still a sliver of hope that Sense 8 could continue on even further. At the time of its revival from cancellation, Wachowski would not rule out even more Sense8 in the future, writing, “After that … if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know.”  The new two-hour special is the second of its kind in the series. Two days before Christmas in 2016, Netflix released a two-hour holiday special called Happy F*cking New Year.  Sense8 was part of Netflix’s cancellation spree that saw fan-favorites The Get Down, Marco Polo, and the star-studded drama Bloodline canceled within eight months of each other. Unfortunately for fans of those other series, they have not enjoyed the swift resurrection that Sense 8 received.  Update on June 8: The series finale is available on Netflix.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,461

After overcoming the urge to jump from that balcony, Bundchen committed to a full lifestyle change: Trading in cigarettes, wine and sugary coffee drinks for a clean, plant-based diet.  ABC News  She said she is teaching her children health habits and asks them to help tend the family's garden.

The shocking claims comes before the Tuesday premiere of Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders special, as cast members have spoken out about the killings.  The Menendez brothers shot their parents Jose, 45, and Kitty, 47, dead while they were at home watching TV on August 20, 1989.  Their father, an entertainment executive, was shot point-blank in the back of the head with a 12-gauge shotgun but Kitty tried to get away and was found lying in a pool of blood in the hallway, shot in the arms, chest and face.  While both Lyle, then 21, and Erik, then 18, were found guilty in March 1996 and ordered to life in prison without parole - actors on the show, which premieres Tuesday, how have expressed sympathy for the killers.  Some even feel they should be released from behind bars, they exclusively told DailyMail.com.

Gus Halper (left) and Miles Gaston Villanueva (right) play the brothers and said their punishments don't fit the crime. Lolita Davidovich (center), who plays their mother, said she believes the men deserve parole and said what they did was 'understandable'  The brothers, who initially blamed the killings on the mob, later claimed they shot their parents in self-defense after years of horrible sexual and emotional abuse by their father.  Lolita Davidovich, who plays slain mother Kitty in the NBC crime drama, said: 'I hope they do get parole. I think they deserve parole. I believe from the get-go, the next day, they regretted it...for sure.  'It was an act of passion, it was stupid, immature and it was tragic. So all four lives ended tragically.'  Davidovich, speaking at the 11th annual PaleyFest Fall TV Previews in Beverly Hills, added: 'No killing is justifiable but it is understandable. These boys' lives were torture and it was a rage killing.  'Premeditated by a day or two to get to the guns but they clearly couldn't endure anymore of the psychological, physical and emotional cumulative effect.  'The male brain doesn't form fully until the mid to late 20s - and they were kids. So the reality for them and expectations and the father's philosophy and it was a total warped reality. These boys deserve a lot of empathy.'  Lolita hopes that the show may help make people locked in 'pressure cooker situations' to reach out for help rather than committing rage actions.

These boys' lives was torture and it was a rage killing'  Leading actress Edie Falco, who plays defense attorney Leslie Abramson says that she feels the brothers' brutal retaliation after years of abuse made sense.  She said: 'We know who did this, but it does matter knowing the details behind this.  'To know exactly what happened to them 18 years previous to this murder, it matters - and it is stuff people should know.  'Edie says that the boys' excuse was backed up by more people all corroborating what we originally heard from the boys.'  The actors playing the brothers - Gus Halper (Erik Menendez) and Miles Gaston Villanueva, (Lyle Menendez) - also have 'empathy' for the pair.  Villanueva said: 'Does the punishment fit the crime? The answer is no and the reason is because of all the abuse that led up to it.  'I don't think it was right (they committed murders) and I think they would be the first to admit it was wrong. They made a huge mistake.'  Halper added: 'We want people to care about them. Hopefully people will come away with a better sense of what actually happened and the truth behind it. There is nothing in it that is untrue.'  The pair claimed that Erik will not watch the show, but is making his own documentary about the killings. Lyle will watch the series even though it is 'painful'.  Lolita Davidovich, who plays slain mother Kitty in the crime drama, said: 'I hope they do get parole. I think they deserve parole. I believe from the get go, the next day, they regretted it'  Actors playing the brothers think their sentence is too harsh, with Miles Gaston Villanueva saying: 'Does the punishment fit the crime?

Hopefully people will come away with a better sense of what actually happened and the truth behind it. There is nothing in it that is untrue'  In January, Lyle told People that the two brothers remain close even though they are held in separate prisons.  'Our relationship has never changed,' Lyle, now 49, spoke from California’s Mule Creek State Prison. 'It’s very close. We write each other regularly.  'We even play chess through the mail, but it’s a little slow.'  Their story made headlines and shocked the US over several years following the slaying of Jose and Kitty Menendez.  The public's journey started when news broke of the murder on LA news channels after the brothers called 911 upon 'finding' their parents brutally murdered at their home.  At first they pleaded their innocence adding that the mob may have carried out the killings - given both parents were shot in the knees.  Later the case took a twist when the brothers confessed to the murders through their Beverly Hills therapist Jerome Oziel.  His girlfriend Judalon Smyth, played by Heather Graham in the show, went to police after she heard an audiotape of a therapy session in which the brothers discussed the killings.  After a first trial ended with two deadlocked juries, Los Angeles DA Gil Garcetti ordered a retrial. It led to the brothers being convicted of murder in March 1996  Now, Erik (right) spends time with terminally ill prisoners; Lyle (left) has been president of the inmate government for 15 years and runs a support group for prisoners who have endured childhood sexual abuse  The show centering on the horrific murders airs on September 26 on NBC  Smyth went from being a key prosecution witness to a witness for the defense later.

After a first trial ended with two deadlocked juries, Los Angeles DA Gil Garcetti ordered a retrial.  It led to the brothers being convicted of murder in March 1996.  Judge Stanley M. Weisberg of Los Angeles County Superior Court heard the jury not hand them the death sentence, but rule they should serve life imprisonment without parole.  Lyle insists that he and Erik have attempted to 'find meaning beyond the tragedy'.

Hosted by The Tonight Show's Jimmy Fallon at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, the star-studded event proved to be full of surprises.  Sweeping the movie awards was the critically-acclaimed musical La La Land, which broke the record for most wins by any one film. It won all seven of the categories it was nominated in, including a Best Actor statuette for Ryan Gosling, Best Actress for Emma Stone and Best Director for its auteur Damian Chazelle.  ""There was something about these characters and what they're going through that feels very human and natural even in their fantastic circumstances,"" said Stone backstage, speaking of the Lionsgate movie-musical. ""Struggling and falling in love is something I think everybody can relate to in some way.""  Heavier fare also won out: the coming-of-age story Moonlight took home Best Picture, one of its six categories, while the August Wilson play adaptation Fences earned a nod for its female lead. ""It's not every day Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen,"" said Best Supporting Actress winner Viola Davis of the movie, which grossed $40.7 million at the box office. ""It doesn't scream moneymaker, but it does scream art.""  On the TV side, The Night Manager took home three awards, more than any other. (The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story, The Crown and Atlanta nabbed two apiece.)  Here’s the full list of winners, in the order in which they were presented:  MOVIES  Best Supporting Actor  Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Nocturnal Animals  Best Original Score  La La Land  Best Original Song, Motion Picture  ""City of Stars,"" La La Land  Best Supporting Actress  Viola Davis, Fences  Best Actor, Musical or Comedy  Ryan Gosling, La La Land  Best Screenplay  Damien Chazelle, La La Land  Best Animated Film  Zootopia  Best Foreign-Language Film  Elle  Best Director  Damian Chazelle, La La Land  Best Actress, Musical or Comedy  Emma Stone, La La Land  Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy  La La Land  Best Actor, Drama  Casey Affleck, Manchester by the Sea  Best Actress, Drama  Isabelle Huppert, Elle  Best Picture, Drama  Moonlight  TELEVISION  Best Actor, Television Drama  Billie Bob Thornton, Goliath  Best Actress, Television Series Comedy or Musical  Tracee Ellis Ross, Black-ish  Best Television Series Comedy or Musical  Atlanta  Best Performance by an Actress In A Mini-series or Motion Picture Made for Television  Sarah Paulson, The People v.

b9319423-6d36-4cdb-a7c5-56104fc4dd8b,"There's no need to worry about Ellen DeGeneres' marriage to Portia de Rossi. How do we know? DeGeneres said so herself.  The 55-year-old comedian took some time out of her talk show on Wednesday to address rumors that have surfaced in the last several months suggesting she and de Rossi are split-bound.  ""The other day I was at the hair salon getting these extensions put in,"" DeGeneres joked. ""And there were tabloids all over the hair salon... and on one of them, Portia and I were in the top right-hand corner. And I thought, 'Oh that's so sweet, they're honoring us.' But then I read the headline underneath. And it said, 'Ellen and Portia Marriage Crumbles.' And I was like, 'Oh, what happened? They seemed so happy.' And then I was like, 'Wait, I'm Ellen.' And I should know if that was happening.""  The talk show host's monologue took a more serious turn -- at least for a little while -- when she shot down the rumors.  “It’s so ridiculous to me. There’s not one ounce of truth to any of it. I’m very happily married. In fact, the only thing we ever argue about is who loves who more. That is all. It really is true,"" she said. ""And we argue if we’d let a kangaroo carry us around in its pouch for a year. I would. She wouldn’t. She’ll change her mind. Who wouldn’t want to be in the pouch of a kangaroo for a year? Hopping around. And she’s like 'no' but anyway.”  And if an announcement about some big change in her life ever needs to be made, DeGeneres promised, ""I'll announce it here first.""  DeGeneres and de Rossi married in August 2008 after four years of dating. At the time, the talk show host called herself ""the luckiest girl in the world.""  Keep in touch!

e6a86563-0f6b-40ec-9b17-453778f3129e,"Brown, however, tried and failed to get Tran’s case against him dismissed, and his attorney was admonished for not addressing LaCour’s petition. Here’s what went down: Tran’s lawyers notified the court seven days in advance that she would be unable to attend the hearing in person due to work obligations, and instead planned to participate via phone. Gossip Cop has learned that at the hearing, Brown’s camp tried arguing for a dismissal, on the grounds that Tran should have given 12 days’ notice, not seven.  As Gossip Cop reported, Tran obtained a temporary restraining order against Brown in late February, accusing him of harassing her, assaulting her, and threatening to kill her. The model-actress’ best friend LaCour was also awarded a temporary restraining order after making similar allegations. Both are now seeking to get permanent stay-away orders against the singer.  Initially, the judge the was inclined to agree. But Brown’s legal team apparently failed to recognize this was a joint hearing with LaCour, who was in the court room ready to testify. “What they didn’t take into consideration was the other case,” one person who was at the hearing tells Gossip Cop exclusively. We’re told Brown’s attorneys “came swooping into court” expecting to get off easy on the technicality with Trans’ absence, but the judge pointed out that Brown “didn’t show up either,” despite another petitioner “ready to go.”  Gossip Cop hears Brown’s attorney tried to argue he had not been served in the cases, but evidence was presented to show he was properly served the restraining orders for both Tran and LaCour. Upon seeing that, “his lawyers began to struggle because they had no clue” about the second case, we’re told, and were not prepared to argue it. Furthermore, the judge accused his side of making a “mockery” of the court. He granted their request for a continuance but demanded Brown appear at the next hearing, which is slated for June 15.  And in an indication of how seriously the judge is taking these matters, the next hearing will be an evidentiary one, in which both sides must present evidence regarding the allegations. It’s also worth noting that Brown’s lead attorney, Mark Geragos, wasn’t even the one who represented him on Tuesday. Rather, a female lawyer was sent in his place. Last month, Tran’s manager slammed Geragos for accusing her of making up the domestic violence allegations for self-promotion.

17574a3f-90cd-469f-bfab-5d966920bd2b,"Embed from Getty Images  One of my most shameful celebrity “crushes” is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he’s a total douchebag. I can’t help it though – there’s something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can’t always explain why we’re attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he’s my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.  Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music’s biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky — and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer— who counts Katy Perry as an ex — at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ­Kendall’s sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: “Kendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other’s company and hanging off everything the other ­person said. Diplo was ­stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ­wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.” The pair’s flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall’s love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party — thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald’s — basketball star Blake walked straight past ­Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood — although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: “Kendall has a lot of male interest and isn’t keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ­flattered at the attention he was showing her.” I also hear Kendall is being paid around £450,000 per ­episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.  [From The Sun]  I’m sure some of you will be like “Kendall wasn’t flirting with Diplo because she’s gay.” First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It’s not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it’s more than likely she’s a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it’s likely that she’s the most “quiet” about her love life among the sisters. So… basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it’s true love. And she’s probably ashamed of herself and she’ll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f–king hot).  Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.

We’re wrapped up all warm and cosy in a Land Cruiser while our guide, wearing nothing more than shorts and a T-shirt, turns and asks what we want to see. Lets go find some cats, we say. As the sun rises we bound off into Kruger National Park on a jeep convoy.  Thousands of animals roam this vast space, an area roughly the size of Scotland. While the park is home to 147 species, the main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo. Picking our way through the bush it’s difficult to spot anything. There are rustles and strange sounds in the long grass but I can’t see any animals. The tracker perched on the bonnet with his rifle is much better at it. Despite (and very probably because of) being at risk of predators, he seems to notice the smallest of movements in the distance – he’s an expert at finding exotic shapes, everything from hippos and lone giraffes to zebras.

The background is as important as the animal. Arriving at the scene of sleeping lions, I was very aware of the beautiful colours behind hi  Every now and again we stop to look at footprints and even fresh poop.  The main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  It looks like elephants passed through overnight. The rangers can read what direction they took and even how long ago. Soon enough, we gasp and nudge each other as he sights a leopard through the trees. It’s hunting something that we can’t make out. Impressed to find it stalking prey, we sit watching in silence. We see another safari vehicle and they report there are elephants near the river so we decide to leave our hungry feline to hunt alone.  NATALIE CHALK Nathalie Chalk on safari  The ground is dry and cracked due to a two-year drought, which has left parts of the park looking scorched with dead trees and uprooted branches. It’s hard to see how anything could thrive in this landscape. Yet as we approach the river, it’s like we enter a different country. There are lush mahogany and marula fruit trees – a favourite snack of the park’s vast herds of elephants. And this is where we find once such group.  GETTY The main draw is the Big Five – that’s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  On the banks are 30 elephants, including babies, close to their mothers, young bulls jumping on each other and adult males spraying water. It’s like being backstage on a David Attenborough documentary – peeking into their secret lives off-camera. As our guide talks quietly about how an elephant’s ear resembles the shape of Africa, they begin to stroll our way. The herd is making its way to the road and coming straight towards the vehicle. It’s an uncomfortable mixture of excitement and terror. As we look at them, they stare back. Some of us get nervous. We hold our breath, grit our teeth and fall silent as they get closer. I am about to be nuzzled by the largest land animal on Earth.  I wish I had good rapport with nature. Instead I want to slide down the seat in front and hide under my blanket. Before turning to stone, I remember thinking what long eyelashes they have. Soon we are surrounded as they cross behind and in front. Some swing their trunks, which is how they smell, while others walk by munching on prickly branches. It’s the mother who stands guard. The guide tells us not to worry but we’re not convinced.

The ploy works and after 40 minutes, the herd strides off at their own slow pace. When they are far away enough, we all breathe out. Now that was worth getting up for. We’re welcomed back to safety of Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve just before 10am with warm face cloths and drinks. Being on a game drive can make you hungry so I have a three-course feast, filling up at the buffet, ordering eggs benedict and washing it down with a glass of bubbly and a muffin to celebrate our once-ina-lifetime experience.  WIREIMAGE Prince Harry stayed at the Bush Lodge at Sabi Sabi Private Game Reserve earlier this year  The lodge is a labour of love for managers Lauren and her husband Rod who take care of a cluster of 25 fi ve-star suites all offering panoramas of the bush. Inside, it has an Out Of Africa feel with its thatched roof, wooden tables and animal artefacts on the walls. It’s no wonder Prince Harry stayed here earlier this year. Everyone though is treated like royalty with guides escorting you back to your room each night. You couldn’t be closer to wildlife, with baboons swinging from the furniture and impalas on the doorstep. The next morning the birds act as our wake-up call.

As we head back to camp, word comes over the radio of a lion killing a buffalo. We arrive in darkness to watch the mother at work. With Sabi Sabi we don’t share our finds with other safari tours. As a private reserve, it has its own plot of the park, which if we duck under the branches, we can drive off road to follow animals.

ee823f1b-3209-4b7d-91db-af6138f8f200,"Chelsea Handler has reportedly ditched her friendship with Jennifer Aniston to forge a relationship with Brad Pitt, proving once and for all that celebrity friendships in Hollywood are little more than smoke and mirrors. Chelsea Handler and Jennifer Aniston were long time BFFs and did everything that best friends would do, including hate each others ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, and ex-husbands’ new partners.  In fact, Handler has been especially vitriolic towards Angelina Jolie in the past, publicly speaking out against Jolie for ‘stealing’ Brad Pitt away from Jennifer Aniston. Yes, it takes two people to break up a marriage, but Handler always reserved her vitriol for Angelina Jolie, much like the rest of Jennifer Aniston’s close-knit BFF crew (albeit none as vocally as Chelsea Handler).  However, Chelsea and Jennifer have allegedly had a falling out recently, as they’ve barely spent any time together and are clearly (and visibly) on the outs with each other. Some reports claim that this is because Chelsea has been spilling secrets about Jennifer’s marriage to Justin Theroux, and others claim that it was just them naturally growing apart. Regardless, Chelsea’s already gone as far as to find a new BFF in Charlize Theron, and Jennifer? Well, she’s busy with her new husband and working hard to reboot her TV career.  As this has all been happening, a new report from Radar Online claims that Chelsea has been in the process of replacing her friendship with Jennifer Aniston with another relationship – this time with Jennifer’s ex, Brad Pitt! Radar’s source explains, “Chelsea never hated Brad for what he did to Jennifer; she always blamed Angelina Jolie for the nasty split. But now that she isn’t friends with Jen, Chelsea is free to work with Brad. Chelsea has long been a fan of Brad’s Plan B production company and is talking with them about a few projects.”  Plan B is one of the most prolific production companies in town, and has won several Oscars over the past few years. As such, any working actor or actress would jump at the chance to work with them, ex-best friends and ex-grudges aside. It’s likely that Chelsea Handler cozying up to Brad Pitt has little to do with getting back at Jennifer Aniston for cutting off their friendship, and more to do with her own career movement.

1253ee89-e879-4905-af90-da932f7cfd34,"Has Mariah Carey forbidden boyfriend Bryan Tanaka from seeing her without clothes or makeup on? That’s the sensational claim that’s been made in an article by Star Magazine. Apparently, Carey is so upset about her weight gain that she refuses to let Tanaka see her unless she’s fully clothed and made up.  But Gossip Cop, a site that’s well known for debunking celebrity rumors, is claiming that the story is nothing but fake news.  As Gossip Cop reports, Star Magazine has alleged that Mariah Carey gained 60 pounds during the summer and she has been hiding her body from her backup dancer-turned-boyfriend.  “Bryan has told Mariah that he loves her no matter what she weighs, but Mimi still won’t let him see her without clothes on,” their reported insider said.  The article goes on to say that Mariah has had special mirrors and lighting installed in her home which make her look thinner than she really is. She has reportedly done this because she thinks that making changes to her home would be easier than changing her body.  But Gossip Cop contacted Mariah’s press rep who has denied that these rumors are true. Mariah’s rep says that the story is a fabrication and “ridiculous.”  After the show it's the after party ???? @mastrosofficial A post shared by Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on Aug 1, 2017 at 1:19am PDT  #fbf Wearing a @charbelzoecouture in #Barcelona thank you for the beautiful dress!

As Billboard reports, Carey recently shared a trailer for All I Want For Christmas Is You, an animated movie based on her hit Christmas song. The story will revolve around a young Mariah who wants nothing more than to get a particular puppy for Christmas. Her uncle tells her that the only way she can get the puppy is if she takes care of his dog over the holidays which leads to a very adventurous Christmas.

ff81ff03-7a51-4f70-86aa-4e8751a4d357,"Jennifer Lawrence was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 15, 1990. She got her big break at 14, when she was discovered while vacationing in New York City with her family. She quickly landed a part in the TV series The Bill Engvall Show, followed by roles in films that included The Burning Plain, Winter’s Bone, X-Men: First Class and The Hunger Games. She later reprised her role playing Katniss Everdeen in Catching Fire and the two-part Mockingjay. Lawrence won an Academy Award for her work in David O. Russell 's Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and continued to work with the director on American Hustle and Joy, winning Golden Globes for all three projects as well.  Lawrence was an athletic child, involved in cheerleading, field hockey and softball, and thought she might be a doctor when she grew up. She did some modeling and community theater, but never dreamed that she’d become an actress.  Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky. She has two older brothers, Blaine and Ben, and her parents, Karen and Gary, owned a farm just outside the city.  Start of Acting Career  Lawrence’s big break came when she was discovered at 14 while on spring break in New York with her family. A stranger asked to take her picture and took her mother’s phone number, then called the next day to ask her to do a screen test. Things happened quickly after that: Lawrence stayed in New York City for the summer, acting in commercials for MTV and filming the 2007 thriller Devil You Know with Lena Olin. (The film was shelved due to lack of distribution and was eventually released in 2013.) Soon after, Lawrence and her family moved to Los Angeles, where she had small roles on the series Medium, Monk and Cold Case, before landing a part on the TBS series The Bill Engvall Show. While working on the series, she also appeared in feature films including The Poker House and The Burning Plain alongside Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger.  After The Bill Engvall Show was canceled, Lawrence went on to appear in the critically acclaimed Winter’s Bone in 2010, which earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Opportunities continued to pour in, and in 2011 Lawrence appeared in The Beaver with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and Anton Yelchin. She also took on the role of Mystique in X-Men: First Class.  In 2012, Lawrence became a box-office sensation as Katniss Everdeen, the lead in The Hunger Games, the film adaptation of the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic state, Lawrence's character must participate in an event in which 24 teens fight to the death as televised entertainment. The film broke box-office records on opening weekend, and Lawrence reprised her role in 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as well as the two-part Mockingjay (2014 and 2015). As of late 2015, the franchise has earned more than $2.8 billion dollars at the global box office.  'Silver Linings' Oscar  Other 2012 releases for Lawrence included the thriller House at the End of the Street, co-starring Elisabeth Shue, and two dramas with Bradley Cooper: The Falling and Silver Linings Playbook, which earned an array of award nominations and a Golden Globe win (best actress in a comedy or musical) for Lawrence. She took home the Oscar for best actress at the Academy Awards in February 2013. Lawrence seemed overcome with emotion as she accepted the honor.  Lawrence continued to work with Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell on 2013's American Hustle, playing the emotionally complex wife of a con artist (Christian Bale). The film co-starred Amy Adams and Cooper. Lawrence received her third Oscar nod for the part, and won her second Globe. In 2014 she co-starred again with Cooper in the little seen drama Serena before once again captivating moviegoers as the mutant Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  'Joy' and 'Mother'  Lawrence, Cooper and Russell later signed on to bring the story of Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano to the big screen, with Lawrence taking on the title role. Joy had a Christmas Day 2015 U.S. release, and Lawrence soon won her third Golden Globe for her performance. Days later she received another Oscar nod. At 25, she became the youngest performer in history to have earned four Academy Award nominations.  Continuing with her high-profile work, in 2016 Lawrence co-starred in X-Men: Apocalypse and the science-fiction film Passengers. The following year she made an impressive leap into the horror genre with the critically acclaimed Mother.  Jennifer Lawrence attends the 'Passengers' Paris Photocall at Hotel George V on November 29, 2016 in Paris, France. (Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)  The Wage Gap Essay  In October 2015 Lawrence wrote an essay, which was featured in Lena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny, entitled ""Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co‑Stars?""  Discovering she was paid less than her American Hustle male co-stars via the Sony hacking scandal, Lawrence ultimately blamed herself for not negotiating for more pay.  ""When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d*cks, I didn’t get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need,"" she explains.  However, Lawrence admitted she didn't fight for a better salary because she was afraid of how she'd be perceived. ""I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,' "" she confessed. ""This is an element of my personality that I’ve been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don’t think I’m the only woman with this issue. Are we socially conditioned to behave this way? ... Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn’t 'offend' or 'scare' men?""  In her own fiery way, Lawrence concluded she would no longer tolerate inequitable pay for fear of being less liked. Her essay caused a great deal of buzz in the media about ongoing gender wage gap issues.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1260

e584276b-d326-461a-a6f2-41056004a37d,"If you think it’s hard watching Scandal‘s Olivia Pope get the hook, try being the guy breaking the fierce fixer’s heart.  When last we tuned into the sophomore ABC drama, President Fitzgerald Grant (played by Tony Goldwyn) was dealt two blows — first with the discovery that his road to the White House took a very sketchy detour. But in tandem with that, he realized that the love of his life was among the election-rigging scheme team.  Oh, and also during that very bad day he ushered a frail Supreme Court Justice to her death, to boot.  TVLine spoke with POTUS’ portrayer about his first (and difficult) reading of that dynamics-changing script, the “devastating” actions of she whom Fitz had put on “the highest pedestal,” and the Season 2 scene that has surprised him the most.  RELATED | Scandal Post Mortem: Shonda Rhimes Defends Killer Twist and Fitz’s Shocking Decision  TVLINE | We’re coming off quite an episode. What do you think raced through Fitz’s head when Verna revealed to him the truth about the election rigging?  It was, I think, a three-part reaction. Maybe four parts. First, it was complete shock at what she was saying to him, because at first he thought she was in her delirium. When he does realize what she’s saying, the realization that Olivia was involved is absolutely crushing for him because, you know… he “gets” Mellie. And he’s not terribly shocked that Cyrus is an opportunist, even though he’s deeply hurt and disappointed. But Olivia is someone who Fitz had put on a pedestal — the highest pedestal, really. She is someone he came to rely on as a reflection of the best part of himself or the man that he aspired to be, which was the antithesis of his father. So her having betrayed him in that way invalidates everything for him and confirms his worst fears, in a sense, about himself. If she is corrupt, then everything loses all meaning. And that’s absolutely devastating.  TVLINE | And the way Verna drove the dagger in a bit further, with the comment about his father….  When Verna says, “I owed it to your father” to tell you the truth… That’s a moment where he, for me, was first saying, “[My father] wins. He was right about me,” and I think the bottom falls out of his life. And when I walk to the [hospital room] door, in that moment I think he has the opposite reaction. He sort of feels, “I’m not going to let [my father] win. He’s not going to beat me. I made a commitment to be something, to do this job right. And this was not my decision to steal [the election].” I think he believes he could have won it, maybe, and he’s not going to let Verna, this sort of surrogate for his father, take him down — so he makes this insane decision to kill her.  TVLINE | Actors, of course, can be very protective of their characters. What was your reaction when you heard for the first time that Fitz would end Verna’s life?  We got this script very late; I don’t think any of us got it before the table read. So when we sat down to read it out loud together and I got to the scene that precedes that — at Verna’s funeral, when Olivia comes up to me and says, “I will wait for you Fitz. I’ll wait as long as you need,” and I turn to her and say, “Oh yeah, about that; I changed my mind” — I was completely shocked. I literally couldn’t speak the words. I couldn’t figure out where that came from because [it preceded the flashback to Verna’s reveal]. As far as I knew, the last time I spoke to Liv, I said, “Wait for me,” and suddenly coming out of my mouth are these words that are the antithesis of what I’ve felt. I somehow forced the words out and [series creator] Shonda [Rhimes] looked at me and mouthed, “It’s going to be OK, don’t worry.” And then the scene came up, the scene with Verna that followed, and I realized, “Oh my God, I’m going to kill her.” I was shocked by that, but I was less shocked than I was by my reversal with Liv. I couldn’t process that. I had, like, a literal and physical reaction.  TVLINE | I wanted to ask about that funeral scene. Up until then, every scene between you and Kerry Washington was either simmering or boiling over. Was it kind of odd for you two to do your first scene where it was just ice cold?  Because I didn’t understand what was informing it, reading it was really bizarre. But actually doing it wasn’t so hard for me because I had the context of how much her betrayal meant to me. Kerry would have a very different perspective on this, but for me, at that moment, Fitz feels that’s he’s been completely used by her, that everything he attributed to her was phony and she was no different from the rest of them and all of her protestations of loving him and blaming him and being a victim of him, and the Sally Hemmings business, was all bulls–t. That she really wanted him president because she wanted to trade on that power. I suddenly saw her as the worst kind of political opportunist who, sure, in one sense, can say she was in love with me, but she wasn’t in love with me. She was using me. Remember that scene where we touch the Constitution and I say, “It’s everything” and she says, “It’s everything. It’s a new world”? To connect in terms of our political ideals was so profound for him, and to have that betrayed was the worst thing that could possibly happen.  VIDEO | Scandal Sneak Peek: Fitz Gives [Spoiler] the Big Chill, David Deals With a Bloody Mess  TVLINE | Adding to the bittersweetness of the funeral scene was the look Olivia was giving Fitz as she said, “I’ll wait for you.” Her eyes were like saucers and so full of hope. She had this new outlook on a future she had thought impossible just a few scenes prior.  I know. And she’d always been the opposite. I’d always been the one fighting for her and she was pushing me away constantly, so to all of a sudden have that switched…. It’s brilliantly written. In a way, it’s so easy to play because the writing was so good. And now I’m fascinated to see where this is going to go, because I don’t know — how do they reconnect?  TVLINE | Meanwhile, where do things stand with Mellie and Fitz in this Thursday’s episode, picking up 10 months later?  You know, it’s not good. You’ll see this week. It ain’t good. He said, “You’re all I’ve got…. You’re the only one who has always been honest about who you are,” and I think that he credits her with that. They try to make it work. They do try, but it’s very, very difficult and I think that sends Fitz into a real tailspin. He’s very depressed, so it’s not going to be easy with Mellie.  TVLINE | The one confrontation we didn’t see was with Cyrus. How are things between the president and his chief of staff?  Fitz boxes Cyrus out. This is never explained, but for me, he has to keep Cyrus close because he can’t fire him, because he knows too much. If Cyrus were to turn against him, that would be very bad, so he has to control Cyrus. Fitz is in a very tough place right now.  TVLINE | Out of Season 2 to date, which scene or moment has surprised you the most?  The one I mentioned [above]. That scene in the church when I tell Olivia I’ve changed my mind, and I say that mean thing to her about how sleeping with my mistress is one thing, but marrying her is another.

Believes Nicole Eggert, But Scott Baio Won't be Prosecuted for Sexual Assault  EXCLUSIVE  Scott Baio will not be prosecuted for allegedly sexually assaulting Nicole Eggert during the run of ""Charles in Charge,"" but we've learned the D.A. found her credible.  Sources familiar with the case tell us on Wednesday Nicole met the L.A. County Deputy D.A., who is reviewing the case. Our sources say the D.A. found Nicole's allegations ""credible."" As we reported, Eggert claimed Baio repeatedly molested her between ages 14 and 18. Baio insists they had sex only once ... when she was 18.  Our sources say the D.A. called the case ""potentially prosecutable"" ... were it not for the statute of limitations.  Under current law there's no statute of limitations if an adult sexually assaults a minor. But, when the alleged assaults occurred in the '80s, the statute of limitations was 3 years, which means it has long since run out.  There's an argument that old cases could still be prosecuted if the statute hadn't run when the law changed, but in this case the statute ran before the law changed, so case closed.  Eggert tells TMZ, ""I always knew this case was beyond statutes of limitations and unfortunately the DA would not be able to prosecute Scott Baio. However I also knew the importance of laying the groundwork for any future victims of Baio's that may come forward and to warn parents who might unknowingly allow their children to be alone with this molester.""  She goes on ... ""I could no longer keep up the lie he conditioned me into and felt it a Mother's responsibility to put the truth out there.""

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I don’t hang out with these people at all,” she said, referring to the influx of famous friends she came in contact with after the success of her debut album Pure Heroine at age 16.  When the interviewer suggested that she was a member of Swift’s so-called “squad,” Lorde jokingly rolled her eyes. “You know, you make friends in different places, but I think for the most part I’m not, like, calling my idols for advice necessarily.”  Lorde, who reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with her latest album Melodrama, said the best way for her to mentally process meeting her musical heroes like Beyoncé and Swift is to pretend it’s another world.  “The second you think too hard about it, you’ll just go insane, so it’s best to be like, ‘We’re in wonderland and it’s just what happens around here,'” she said.  She and the 1989 songstress seem to have a close bond. In March, Swift broke her social media silence to promote Lorde’s new single, and in November, threw her a star-studded 20th birthday bash at Carbone in New York City.

There are certain places you can’t go together; certain things you can’t do,” she said. “There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship — it’s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.”  Lorde eventually apologized for the comment on Twitter, writing that she “f—– up & it was really insensitive.”  didn't mention taylor, but regardless, i fucked up & that was really insensitive. i'm sorry 🌹 — Lorde (@lorde) June 20, 2017  Attention to Swift’s so-called “squad” mostly began in 2015 after the release of her star-studded “Bad Blood” music video, which featured Selena Gomez, Zendaya, Lena Dunham and Gigi Hadid, among others.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,534

c3ddd0e1-ca37-47c6-87e9-334f55760780,"Celebrity makeup artists work with some of the biggest stars in Hollywood and the entertainment industry. Their job is to make the stars look their best when they appear in public for movie premieres, fashion shows, awards ceremonies and other red-carpet events. These professionals may also work on the sets of movies, TV shows and theatrical productions. Although makeup artists generally make low or average salaries, celebrity makeup artists tend to make more money than the typical makeup artist.  Job Description  Celebrity makeup artists work closely with their clients, many of whom are A-list celebrities. They use their expert knowledge of lipsticks, eyeliners, blushes, moisturizers, shampoos and conditioners, and other products to help their clients look their best or to achieve a desired look. They must understand the effects of stage lighting on a person’s appearance and apply makeup accordingly. Celebrity makeup artists generally work in comfortable, well-lit settings. They may be required to work odd hours, depending on their client’s schedule.  Hourly and Daily Wages  Hourly wages for makeup artists working with celebrities in the motion picture and television industries is typically quite high. The website Celebrity Net Worth estimates hourly rates at $41.31 — about double that of a regular makeup artist who works in a salon. According to Crystal Wright, president of Crystal Agency and author of ""The Hair, Makeup & Fashion Styling Career Guide,"" top celebrity makeup artists can make as much as $2,500 in a single day.  Video of the Day Brought to you by Sapling Brought to you by Sapling  Annual Wages  Annual wages for makeup artists who work with Hollywood celebrities are also quite high. Celebrity Net Worth estimates the average annual salary is $85,930. This is almost double that of regular makeup artists, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics says made $45,010 per year as of May 2009.  Employment Outlook  Of the roughly 38,000 makeup artists working in the United States as of 2006, only 2,100 worked with celebrities in Hollywood and the entertainment industry, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Needless to say, this field is extremely competitive. For those who work on film sets, the job may be somewhat unstable and fluctuate according to filming schedules. Celebrity makeup artists may increase their earnings by designing their own line of makeup products, publishing books and endorsing beauty products.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,438

Thank you, everyone, for all your love and support during this difficult time.”  Bobby, the owner of Zarin Fabrics, beat thyroid cancer in 2009 but it returned in 2013 and spread to his lungs. In November 2016, Jill revealed that the cancer had spread to his brain, but said in a statement at the time that they were determined to “remain strong.”  She was hopeful after he left the hospital in August 2017 after undergoing chemotherapy. “It’s been the most emotional time in our lives and couldn’t have gotten to where we are without help from many,” she captioned an Instagram pic that showed them out to dinner. “I wake up everyday now so grateful to see Bobby getting stronger.”  The couple celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary earlier this month.  “Happy 18th! Anniversary to the love of my life Bobby Zarin. Bobby is the most perfect man I know,” the 54-year-old reality TV star captioned a photo collage of them together. “He never loses anything, never forgets anything and when I think he is wrong… he is always right!”  An insider told Us Weekly in November 2017 that Bobby was “really fighting” as he encouraged his family to go about their daily routines. “Bobby’s not giving up but there’s not much fight left,” the insider added.  He is survived by Jill, his three children from a previous relationship — Jonathan, David and Jennifer — and stepdaughter Ally.

A Little Havana plot near Marlins Park – the home of the city’s baseball team – was felled by Miami's hatred for the Marlins Park venue.  In January he announced he had finally found his site, in the Overtown district. But the area, described by the Miami Herald in December 2016 as “ground zero” for the city’s opioid crisis, was soon deemed unsuitable.  On Thursday, with his deep-pocketed business partner Jorge Mas beside him, he unveiled his fifth plan – a $1 billion (£760m) project to be called Miami Freedom Park, involving the leasing and redevelopment of the city-owned Melreese golf course near Miami International Airport. The plan would include the construction of a 25,000-seat stadium, plus restaurant and retail space, office buildings, hotels, athletic fields and a public park.  In addition to the privately-funded construction, Beckham's group would also pay $4-5 million in annual rent for the 73 acres of land, as well as state, county, city and school board taxes, reaching an estimated total of $44 million.  His presence in the city on Thursday was celebrated by football fans, with hundreds trying to pour into the city commission meeting. But it was lamented by golf aficionados, deeply concerned at the loss of the city’s only public course.  Even sports stars turned against Beckham.  Ray Allen, a former star of the basketball team Miami Heat, urged people to sign a petition against Beckham’s plan, arguing that it will mean the end of the city’s First Tee youth golf programme.  “Melreese has an awesome First Tee program that is ran out of this course that really teaches young children the game of golf and gives them a public place to play,” he said.  “Not to mention all the great tournaments and events the course hosts. If you’re familiar with Miami at all, there aren’t too many public courses for our kids to play at.”  Orlando “El Duque” Hernandez, a former Major League Baseball pitcher, donned the orange First Tee polo shirts worn by protesters, and said he volunteers for the programme.  The agonising wait for Beckham was prolonged by Ken Russell, chairman of the commission, a man who was perceived as the swing vote among the deeply divided group. He criticised the Beckham group for not conducting any outreach in the neighbourhood immediately east of Melreese. He then sought verbal assurances from them on issues from the replacement of lost park space, to the question of who would pay for cleaning up contaminated soil.  He also wanted assurances that workers on the project would be paid a living wage.  “We can continue to negotiate,” said Mr Russell. “But I’m not ready tonight.”  A new hearing was set for 10am on Wednesday.  Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami who has spoken passionately in favour of the referendum, expressed his frustration with the commission’s decision to defer the vote.  “I really wish they would’ve made a decision tonight,” he said, in comments surely echoing Beckham’s own thoughts. “So then we could have moved to the next phase.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,635

95899e14-5566-4b2d-a36b-dbf786c1400c,"Pippa Middleton knows what it’s like to have someone steal the spotlight at a wedding – in part, because she herself did exactly that at her own sister’s wedding. Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton‘s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa’s dress than Kate’s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.  Since then, Pippa’s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride – and in this particular circumstance, it’s almost a given that it will happen to her.  According to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry’s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry’s friend’s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry’s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she’s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.  Sources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, “She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan’s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.”  According to the same source, Pippa is now employing a “no ring, no guest” policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses – which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it’s Prince Harry we’re talking about, you think he wouldn’t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law’s wedding, given that he took her to a friend’s wedding?  What do you guys think?

As I'm more than sure you are aware by now, it's pretty much blindingly obvious that Kylie Jenner is pregnant.

Whether it's her change of tact on Instagram, the fact the had a crib delivered to her house or the latest campaign from Calvin Klein in which she can be seen covering her tummy, Kylie Jenner is pregnant.  However, as the rumors began to become more and more concrete, it was suggested that Jenner and her beau had split up. While it was never confirmed that Kylie and Travis had decided to go their separate ways, a source has revealed to Insider that the two stars had a blazing row at Kris Jenner's house and things turned nasty.  “Kylie and Travis got into a blowout fight after he showed up unexpectedly to her mother Kris’ house, where she’s been staying lately. She flipped out on him and accused him of cheating on her with several women during her pregnancy, including a girl that she is kinda friends with!”  The source continued, saying that the rapper had been doing all that he could to try and win Kylie back, but the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star was having none of it.  “He has been trying to do everything he can to win her back, including sending her flowers and gifts,” the source said. “But she is just so emotional right now that she doesn’t know what she wants. The fact that they are still talking and in communication leads some of her friends to believe that they will fix things before the birth of the baby.”  Although Kylie had disappeared from the public eye since the rumors, according to Entertainment Tonight, she’s not planning to hide the fact that she’s a mom once she gives birth.  “Kylie has been chilling at home for the most part and just living her best life. She has really enjoyed this time away from the spotlight. It’s the first time she can remember in her entire life not being followed by cameras and she’s just trying to enjoy this privacy,” a source told the website.  The source continued, saying: “she’s definitely not going to deny that she’s had a baby, or continue to evade questions about it at all.”  The outlet also learned that ""this isn’t a permanent thing. As soon as the baby is born, she will make an announcement and introduce the baby to her fans. She will also address the fact that she went ‘dark’ on social media and in the public.”  The source claims that Kylie will announce the birth on Instagram and also claims that the 20-year-old is extremely excited to be a mother. “Yes, she will release a photo and yes, she will acknowledge the baby. She’s excited to continue to be her authentic self, and that will soon mean being a mother and sharing that with her fans.”  So while there may be trouble in paradise, it looks like we will finally be getting the news we've all been waiting for shortly.

Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan’s off to a good start as her future husband.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,523
a0fe1660-c29f-4fbe-b400-f19843bfea64,"Johnny Depp’s behavior on the red carpet premiere of his latest film “Murder on the Orient Express” was questioned on Saturday night after several news outlets accused the actor of showing up drunk.  The British newspaper The Sun reported that the actor “allegedly reeked of booze” when he appeared on the red carpet and his security team had to “practically hold him up” as he made his way down the press line.  Other outlets, The Daily Mail and The Mirror, alleged that Depp was guided down the red carpet past fans and slurred his words when interviewed.  “At one stage he even seemed to forget the name of his co-star (and the film’s director) Kenneth Branagh,” The Mirror reported.  RELATED: Hollywood agent suspended after Terry Crews’ public sexual harassment accusations  A source told The Sun that Depp was spotted out partying in London the night before the premiere and said, “Johnny was having big old night and was told off for smoking three times while inside. He was annoyed people were staring at him, too.”  Depp’s rep has not yet commented on the rumor though another source reportedly said that Depp was “not drunk” despite the bad press.  “These reports are completely false. Johnny was not drunk at the premiere. He came straight from set to the premiere,” a source told “E! News.” “His security was maneuvering him around the carpet as he has done for years.”  “Murder on the Orient Express” premieres in theaters on Nov. 10 and stars several of Depp’s previous co-stars, including Penelope Cruz, Michelle Pfeiffer, Leslie Odom Jr., Josh Gad and Judi Dench.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,320
6f0c7ab0-532a-4f53-beaf-facc8ca8c427,"A Married at First Sight star whose wife verbally abused him when they were off camera has revealed that they were getting a divorce following their latest blowup.  Jonathan Francetic, 29, watched his wife Molly Duff, 25, move out of their shared apartment immediately after he showed one of the show's relationship experts a recording of her calling him 'f*****g disgusting' during an argument.  On Tuesday night's episode of the Lifetime reality series, Jonathan and Molly both told their family and friends that they were getting a divorce after less than two months together.  Scroll down for video  Not-so-shocking: Jonathan Francetic, 29, and his wife Molly Duff, 25, told their family and friends that they were getting a divorce on Tuesday night's episode of the reality show  Drama: Jonathan recounted to his friend Blake how he and Molly had moved out after he showed one of the show's relationship experts a recording of her verbally abusing him  'It feels like failure,' Jonathan told the camera before meeting his friend Blake to share the bad news.  The former financial associate, who lost his job when he agreed to appear on the reality series, recounted how he and Molly had gotten into a fight during their recent trip to Florida.  Jonathan explained that he recorded her belittling him to show the experts because she was a completely different person when the cameras weren't rolling.  'We have already determined that we were getting divorced,' he told his friend.  'I've put so much into this marriage that I'm devastated,' he admitted in his testimonial.  Dunzo: 'We have already determined that we were getting divorced,' he told his friend  Awkward: The former financial associate, who lost his job when he agreed to appear on the reality series, also had to tell the other male participants about the divorce  Harsh words: Meanwhile, Ryan Buckley (left), 29, claimed that he wouldn't be heartbroken at all if he and his wife Jaclyn Schwartzberg, 29, got a divorce  Molly, meanwhile, failed to mention the recording when she told her sister Jenny that she had moved out of their apartment.  'It's very obvious at this point that we both want a divorce,' she said. 'He's made it very clear.'  Both Jonathan and Molly were dreading their separate get-togethers with the show's other participants because they knew they would have to admit that they were getting a divorce.  'I have to tell them my marriage is just over,' Jonathan said. 'I feel like a loser.'  He was once again forced to recount how he recorded Molly berating him and showed it to Dr. Jessica Griffin, who pointed out that it was verbal and emotional abuse.  Uncomfortable: Molly also felt awkward telling Jaclyn (right) and Shawniece Jackson, 29, that she was getting a divorce  Playing innocent: Molly once again glossed over specifics when she explained why she and Jonathan were giving up on their marriage  'Molly and I have already decided that it's a no,' he said. 'We both know that we are walking into decision day saying no.'  Although Jonathan and Molly were the only couple who didn't consummate their marriage, the other guys were understandably shocked by the revelation.  Meanwhile, Molly once again glossed over specifics when she told the girls that she had moved out and was getting a divorce.  She claimed their marriage couldn't work if their physical chemistry didn't increase, noting that Jonathan was unable to be patient with her without constantly blowing up over their lack of intimacy.  Towards the end of the episode, Jonathan had to tell his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were calling it quits.  Stressed: Jonathan was understandably nervous before telling his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were getting a divorce  Family ties: However, they were nothing but supportive after he shared his news  He explained that the visit was even more awkward because his mother had expected Molly to be with him. Cheryl was invested in their marriage and had already exchanged phone numbers with Molly's mom.  However, when Jonathan told them that he was getting a divorce, they were nothing but supportive. His stepfather even told him that he admired him for taking a chance on love.  Jonathan was the only person on the show who gave up his apartment for good, and now he was trying to figure out where to live.  'I don't have a job, so I can pick any place,' he joked. '[It is the] silver lining of being homeless and unemployed.'  While Jonathan was away, Jaclyn Schwartzberg, 29, went over their apartment to help Molly pack. Molly said she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could part amicably and leave the show in a good place, but he never responded.  Tough luck: When Jaclyn helped Molly pack her things, Molly revealed that she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could party amicably, but he didn't respond  Blindsided: Jaclyn was shocked when Ryan told her that he hadn't decided what he was going to say on decision day  The couple's breakup was weighing on the rest of the newlyweds, who were also unsure if they were on the verge of getting a divorce.  When he had the guys over to his apartment, Jaclyn's husband Ryan Buckley, 29, confessed that he was having trouble talking to his wife, explaining that she shuts down whenever he shares his concerns that their constant fighting was unhealthy.  Not only did he admit that he didn't feel close to her anymore, he claimed he didn't even care about her.  'If I were to cut ties, I honestly wouldn't be heartbroken at all,' he said, pointing out that it was a warning sign that he didn't feel anything when he thought about divorcing his wife.  Both Jonathan and Jephte Pierre, 26, thought Ryan was all over the place with his feelings and was likely acting out of fear.  Stunned: 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us,' she said  Back on? Just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day  Giving it another go: Ryan and Jaclyn shared a kiss after making up yet again  When Jaclyn returned home from her girls' night, he made it clear that he was on the fence about their marriage, which left her feeling blindsided.  'I am completely caught off guard,' she said in her testimonial. 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us.  'I know we've had our battles and our wounds, but I thought we were on the same page, so I am feeling very blindsided.'  Ironically, just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day as an apology for how he had been treating her.  And Ryan wasn't the only one going to extremes. Jephte also ended up picking a silly fight with his wife Shawniece Jackson, 29, after they had a disagreement over who would drive that day.  Trouble in paradise: Shawniece and Jephte go into a fight about who was going to drive  Confused: 'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she said in her testimonial  'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she asked, while her husband confessed to the cameras that her behavior had left him questioning whether or not she was the person he really wanted to be with forever.  Although Shawniece didn't believe it was a big deal that she decided she didn't want to take her car that day, Jephte thought it was a warning sign that she wasn't a woman of her word.  'I am still figuring out who she is, and I don't like when you say something and then do something different,' he admitted in his testimonial.  'I'm not sure if that's the person I want to be spending the rest of my life with,' he added.  Shawniece, on the other hand, seemed more confident in her own decision, but noted that the stress of the show's finale may have had a negative impact on her husband as he attempted to figure out his future.  Tense: Jephte admitted that he was not sure Shawniece was the type of person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, while she was nervous that he was going to ask for a divorce  Bouncing back: Although Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her  'Maybe he is just stressed out — I guess about final decision — so who knows?' she said of his behavior.  With decision day right around the corner, Shawniece was worried that their latest squabble could be a sign that they are headed for divorce.  'When he gets super annoyed with me, it just makes me really nervous and really scared for the future 'cause we only have a few days before final decision,' she says in her testimonial.  Although Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her.  'I am just proud that we are able to come back from the situation and be at the place where I know we can be,' Shawniece told the camera.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1857
51943b81-62a4-4f28-aa29-1e06b6c07fc9,"Vanessa Paradis is married!  The 45-year-old French actress and director Samuel Benchetrit tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Saint-Simeon, France, on Saturday.  According to the French newspaper Le Parisien, the couple's wedding was attended by a few dozen guests, including singer Matthieu Chedid and Paradis' two children, Lily-Rose and Jack Depp, whom she shares with Johnny Depp. Paradis and the Pirates of the Caribbean star dated from 1998 to 2012.  Paradis looked stunning in a cream-colored wedding gown with sheer long sleeves and an embroidered veil. She accessorized her blonde curly locks with purple and pink flowers. Benchetrit opted for a blue suit on his special day.  The newlyweds began dating in 2016 after working together on the film Chien. This is Paradis' first marriage. Benchetrit was previously married to French actress Marie Trintignant from 1998 to 2003, with whom he shares 20-year-old son Jules. The writer also has an 11-year-old daughter, Saul, from his previous relationship with Anna Mouglalis.  Earlier this week, Paradis reportedly missed the Paris premiere of her latest film, A Knife in the Heart, due to her son's ""serious health problems.""

bf022c56-ad54-4f3b-b4ee-b10410031145,"Tab Hunter, the '50s heartthrob who starred in ""Damn Yankees"" and ""Battle Cry,"" came out as gay in his 2005 memoir. (Photo: Simon & Schuster)  Tab Hunter, the All-American movie star who made teen hearts race in the 1950s with his blond good looks and blue eyes, has died at 86, his longtime partner Allan Glaser confirmed to USA TODAY.  Glaser said Hunter collapsed in front of their home in Santa Barbara, Calif., and went into cardiac arrest after a blood clot migrated from his leg to his heart. He added that medical personnel spent six hours trying to revive him, without success.  He would have turned 87 on Wednesday.  In addition to his hit movies, his recording of “Young Love” topped the Billboard pop chart in 1957.  But in his 2005 memoir, “Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star,” Hunter recounted the stresses of being a love object to millions of young women when he was, in reality, a gay man.  “I believed, wholeheartedly – still do – that a person’s happiness depends on being true to themselves,” he wrote. “The dilemma, of course, that was being true to myself – and I’m talking sexually now – was impossible in 1953.”  Born Arthur Andrew Kelm, his screen tab (slang for “name” at the time) was fabricated by Henry Willson, the same talent agent who came up with the names Rock Hudson and Rory Calhoun.  The legend goes that Willson said to the young man: “We’ve got to find something to tab you with. Do you have any hobbies?” His client answered, “I ride horses. Hunters.” Agent: “That’s it! We’ll call you Tab Hunter.”  With no dramatic training, Hunter was cast in a minor role in the 1950 drama, “The Lawless.” The fuss over the young actor began two years later when he appeared bare-chested opposite Linda Darnell in the British-made “Island of Desire.” Soon his handsome face and muscular build appeared on magazine covers. Warner Bros., alert to the increasingly important youth market, signed him to a contract.  Hunter made a flurry of movies in the latter half of the 1950s, aimed at capitalizing on his popularity with young girls. The films included such war dramas as “Battle Cry” (with Van Heflin) and “Lafayette Escadrille” (Clint Eastwood in a small role). He made the Westerns “The Burning Hills” (Natalie Wood) and “They Came to Cordura” (Gary Cooper, Rita Hayworth). And he made romantic comedies like “The Pleasure of His Company” (Fred Astaire, Debbie Reynolds.)  A highlight was the 1958 “Damn Yankees!,” an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical with Gwen Verdon and Ray Walston in their Tony-winning New York roles and the original director, George Abbott, sharing direction with Stanley Donen.  Besides the movies, he displayed his athletic skills – he had been a figure skater as well as horseman – in a TV special, “Hans Brinker, or the Silver Skates.”  As with so many pop idols, his fans grew up and a new generation sought other favorites. His slide followed the classic pattern: to a television series (“The Tab Hunter Show,” on NBC, 1960-62); European films (“The Golden Arrow”) and cheap kid flicks (“Ride the Wild Surf.”) In his memoir, he took pains to note that “Ride the Wild Surf” was his only beach-party movie; his “Operation Bikini,” despite its title, was “yet another war movie.”  Over the years, he also played small roles in “The Loved One,” “The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean” and “Grease 2.”  In the 1980s, he won new fans by appearing in cult movies with Divine, the 300-pound transvestite, notably John Waters’ 1981 “Polyester” and Paul Bartel’s 1985 “Lust in the Dust,” co-produced by Hunter himself.  Of “Polyester,” Hunter wrote: “Everybody got the joke. … For both John and me, our collaboration paid huge dividends: I’d helped ‘legitimize’ his brand of movie, and he made me ‘hip’ overnight.”  Hunter appeared on Broadway in 1964 in Tennessee Williams’ “The Milk Train Doesn’t Stop Here Anymore” opposite the formidable Tallulah Bankhead. The play closed within days, and he said it was “completely buried under Tallulah’s offhanded trademark campiness.”  Hunter was born in 1931 in New York City, the second son of a mechanic and his German immigrant wife. His father left the family two years later and the boy took his mother’s name, Gelien. Young Arthur Gelien grew up in San Francisco and Long Beach, California, and joined the Coast Guard at 15, lying about his age.  While in New York, he saw Broadway plays and became interested in acting. Back in California, Willson arranged for a two-word role in a small Western, “The Lawless.” He got $500 and a new name.  In his memoir, he said that his career flourished despite some innuendo and smear articles in the scandal sheets – “clear evidence that despite its self-righteous claims, ‘Confidential’ magazine did not influence the taste and opinions of mainstream America.”  Writing the book was difficult, he told The Associated Press in 2005, “because I’m a really private person. I grew up full of denial. I just didn’t like any suggestions or questioning of my sexuality.”  In 1960, Hunter’s boy-next-door reputation did take a hit when he was charged with cruelty for allegedly beating his dog. (He was acquitted). In recent years, Hunter appeared in dinner theaters and organized film projects. After living on a ranch in New Mexico for a time, he took a home in Montecito with his Glaser.  He didn’t dwell on his Hollywood career or regret losing it. “I had my fling, and I was very fortunate,” he remarked. “But that’s all in my past.”  George Takei, another actor-turned-gay activist, honored him on Twitter Monday, writing, ""Tab Hunter was so much more than a teen heartthrob—he was a celebrated actor, trailblazer, and an icon for the LGBTQ community. Brad and I extend our deepest condolences to his husband, Allan Glaser. RIP, Tab. You will be sorely missed.""  Zachary Quinto, who came out in 2011, noted on Instagram how he had gotten to know Hunter over the last year. ""What a life! Such a rich experience. such a vital and generous nature. and such a pioneer of self-acceptance and moving through this world with authenticity as his guide. he will be missed greatly. may he rest in peace.""  Harvey Fierstein, who won Tonys for acting in ""Torch Song Trilogy"" and writing ""La Cage aux Folles"" and ""Kinky Boots,"" called Hunter a ""gawjuss gay icon.""  Sad to report that Tab Hunter, the gawjuss gay icon, and true gentleman, has left the building. We shared some good laughs back in the 80’s. I was always fond of this dear man. — Harvey Fierstein (@HarveyFierstein) July 9, 2018  Contributing: Maria Puente, USA TODAY  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2u8UsZS",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1433

The world's highest paid reality star was targeted at her exclusive apartment in the French capital during fashion week in October.  Thieves made off with her 20-carat Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring worth £3.5million and a case of jewellery with a value of £5.24million.  Jewellery stolen from Kim Kardashian after she was held at gunpoint during a raid in Paris could be funding terrorism, a new report has claimed  The reality TV star was targeted at her apartment in Paris and armed thieves made off with her 20-carat Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring worth £3.5million, pictured  Her hands and feet were bound with cable ties during the robbery and she is believed to have been dumped in her marble bath tub during the terrifying heist.  Nine men and a woman have since been arrest and charged with armed robbery, and are believed to be providing details of what happened to the jewels to police.  But now US gossip website RadarOnline has claimed that the missing jewellery has been linked to Islamic jihadists.  An unnamed source, who is described as a European official monitoring funding of terror groups, told the site the stolen items have been tracked to black market dealers in Belgium.  Nine men and a woman have since been caught and charged with armed robbery, and they are providing details of what happened to the jewels to police  He explained: 'There’s reason to believe the jewelry stolen from Kim Kardashian is going directly into the coffers of terror groups.'  However, fellow US gossip website Gossip Cop claims that sources close to the wife of rapper Kanye West say the allegations about terrorism are 'nuts'.  Kim's hands and feet were bound with cable ties during the robbery and she is believed to have been dumped in her marble bath tub during the terrifying heist in October  Their source said the 36-year-old has 'no knowledge' of her jewellery being linked to terrorism.  It comes after police sources in France, who are investigating the terrifying raid, admitted the cache of jewels stolen from Kim has almost certainly been melted down or re-cut and sold off.  An enquiry source told the BFM TV channel that Ms Kardashian ‘is unlikely to get them back’.  Jerome Guillochon, president of a French jewellers federation, told the news outlet: ‘They separate the stone from the metal.  ‘On one had, they will melt the metal, and on the other, they will usually cut the stones completely, in order to remove all markings or modify the shape.  ‘Because if there is a typical shape in exceptional jewellery, if there is a ring in the shape of a cushion, they can perhaps cut it in circles.’  Ms Kardashian’s ring had the name of the sports company Adidas carved into it, and was easily recognisable.  Mr Guillochon said technical equipment including lasers would have been used to alter the jewellery, and then it could have fetched millions on the black market.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,566

1c8465ac-150f-4884-a077-ad578ad343b8,"Kim Kardashian will not leave Kanye West despite all the rumors.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have seen their names mentioned in hundreds of rumors over the years and they aren’t slowing down. Amid the backlash that West is receiving for making controversial comments, reports are coming out that their marriage could be coming to an end soon. Most of those rumors also insinuate that Kardashian is planning to end the marriage.  According to a recent report from Grazia, Kardashian is planning to leave West and even has an “escape plan” to leave him.  “Things between her and Kanye are at a breaking point. The marriage has been under increasing pressure lately and she fears all the controversy Kanye is causing is reflecting negatively on her and her family. There’s concern this marriage is on borrowed time. Kim may come across as his long-suffering wife, but she has been ready to leave on a number of occasions and has had multiple exit strategies in place over the years.”  Gossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Kardashian has “exit strategies” and an “escape plan” in place to get away from West. She has shown some frustration with his controversial comments, but the two seems to be doing just fine despite all of the rumors.  “None of this adds up to a divorce. In fact, Kardashian’s rep has already gone on record to tell Gossip Cop it’s ‘false’ she’s intending end the marriage. That will be evident in a few days, when the couple marks their fourth wedding anniversary on May 24.”  Kardashian has come out and publicly joked that West is the cause of her first gray hair.  “[Kanye] gave me my first gray hair this week, and I am blaming that on him.”  That is nothing to write home about as far as divorce rumors are concerned. She also went on to state that West is doing well and is out in Wyoming working on new music.  “He’s doing really good. He’s in Wyoming recording, he has a couple of albums coming out, so he’s just focused on that.”  West even took to Twitter to post a picture of Kim with fire emoji’s as the only description. Obviously, he still finds his wife incredibly beautiful.  Rumors are going to continue swirling. Nothing is going to change on the fake report front when it comes to Kardashian and West, but this report can be ignored now that Gossip Cop has debunked it.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,479

Well all I can say is if it’s good enough for Lindsay Lohan, (girl, what are you) all waiting for?”  Running alongside London Fashion week, the event, which charges up to £200 for tickets, features shopping, runway shows, talks and workshops – including a ‘sharia legal hub’.  More than 40 designers from around the world showcased scarves, hijabs and loose-fitting maxi dresses at the annual style showcase organised by Haute Elan, who consider ‘modest fashion’ to be one of the fastest growing consumer markets.  Rumour mills abuzz as Lindsay Lohan spotted wearing headscarf  In January, Lohan deleted all the pictures on her Instagram account and changed her bio to ‘Alaikum salam.’  However, the actor has not yet revealed whether she is converting to Islam, while her representative refused to respond to a question proposed by a Daily Mail correspondent too.  Lindsay Lohan reveals her ‘Muslim’ side  When appearing on the Turkish talk show Haber Turk later year, she explained that the Quran she was holding was actually just a gift from some friends.  “My very close friends, who have been there for me a lot, in London are Saudi and they gave me the Quran and I brought it to New York because I was learning,” said Lohan.  In a post that’s now deleted, the starlet took to Instagram to give a sneak peak on her upcoming fashion line. And, by the modest looks of it, seems like it will be comprising hijabs.  Captioned as, “New Fashion Line coming soon ….#fashion”, the star is seen wearing a headscarf, with her face half hidden.  The actor had also said that she had tried praying “the Muslim way” and even fasted during Ramazan. “I did Ramazan for three days with my friend from Kuwait. It was hard but it was good. It felt good,” she said.  Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.  Read full story",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,584
ea68ea02-0fd8-4f74-a2b5-4f93ef4bd26b,"When newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle cozy up to each other, NBD, but when Kate Middleton tapped the knee of Prince William — her husband of nearly seven years — during an interview in December, the moment was internationally scrutinized. At the royal wedding of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Kate and William took special interest in each other, going so far as to lean over poor Camilla to converse:    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Prince William, Camila, and Kate Middleton in the pews of St George’s Chapel at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s May 19, 2018 wedding. Getty Images  Although body language typically reflects a couple's emotional connection, you can't fully interpret it without context — particularly when observing how a royal couple behaves in public, according to body language expert Blanca Cobb based in North Carolina. ""They may be more reserved [than other couples] in their public displays of affection, but that doesn’t meant they love each other any less or aren’t excited about each other,"" Cobb says.  To better understand what *really* goes on behind palace doors, Cobb analyzed a handful of the couple's closest public encounters:  1. When Kate Leans Over Camilla  Getty Images  In the midst of a royal wedding, there's no such thing as a private moment — but boy do William and Kate try! Above, they attempt to converse, leaning forward to make eye contact without overstepping into Camilla's personal space, Cobb observes. ""William and Kate prefer to be together and share moments privately,"" she says. So much for seating charts!  2. When Kate Tapped William's Knee  Kate taps William’s knee during a filmed interview. (December 2017)  Despite the recent hoopla surrounding this exchange, it isn't *really* about affection or romance, according to Cobb, who sees tapping as a way to signal, ""Hey, we can both relate,"" in lighthearted situations. That said, touching doesn't necessarily happen between any two people: ""There's a level of familiarity, comfort, and likability in touch. Through touch you connect with your partner. You let them know that they’re important to you,"" Cobb says. ""Gentle touches, playful moments, and sincere smiles show that they enjoy each other’s company and have fun together.""  3. When They Walked Arm-in-Arm  The couple walks together after a rowing race in Germany. (July 2017) Samir Hussein/ Getty Images  Cobb says couples who synchronize their movements are emotionally in sync, and in the photo above, Kate and William both lead with their left legs. ""This shows they are in tune with each other,"" Cobb says. Because Kate walks slightly ahead of William in this photo, it's a sign that she may be a dominant force in their relationship, according to Cobb.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  4. When They Stood in the Stands  The couple holds horns while watching the London Marathon. (April 2017) Samir Hussein / Getty Images  ""Body mirroring is another sign you’re really digging your partner,"" Cobb says, pointing out the way Kate and William both lean toward their left, and they both rest their left forearms on the railing.  5. When William Wrapped His Arms Around Kate  William embraces Kate during London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  ""You can get a temperature reading of how hot a couple is for one another by their physical proximity and the level of touch,"" Cobb says. Although this doesn't appear to be an intimate moment, since Kate and William aren't locking eyes, ""they’re seizing the moment with physical closeness that brings them closer emotionally,"" Cobb says.  6. When Kate Draped Her Arms Around William  The couple embraces during the London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  Cobb isn't concerned that the couples' eyes don't meet during this embrace, since they're watching a sports game. ""Her hands are relaxed on his shoulders, they're standing body-to-body with no air between them, and while his hands fall away from her a little, his fingers look relaxed with no tightness,"" Cobb says. ""They are very relaxed and comfortable expressing themselves the best way they can, as royals.""  Cobb thinks nothing of the way Kate is tilting her hips away from William in the photo above, in part because it's difficult to determine how much room Kate had to shift around in the stands. And because Kate and William tend to act demure around each other, facing each other, hip-to-hip, would seem out of character for them, anyway.  7. When Kate Air Kisses William  Kate kisses William on both cheeks after his polo team wins a competition (July 2011). Samir Hussein / Getty Images  Kate and William rarely kiss in public, and this cheek kiss would be a rare exception — except that Kate doesn't actually touch her lips to William's face. ""You can't say she doesn't feel emotion for her husband,"" Cobb says. ""There's still no tension here. Kate is reaching out to him, has a relaxed bend in her arm, with her fingers relaxed on shoulder.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  William, on the other hand, looks less comfortable receiving affection in this context. ""He's body blocking by holding the gift between them,"" Cobb says, although this doesn't mean these partners don't show fondness toward each other. ""It could be that this is the extent of affection they're willing to demonstrate in public.""  8. When They Were Young  The couple poses for photo on the day of their university graduation. (June 2005) Middleton Family/Clarence House via GettyImages  ""Putting your hand on someone's stomach is more intimate than placing it on the shoulder or back,"" Cobb says. ""Although it's unclear whether William is trying to hold Kate's hand there or move it away, there's no curvature to his fingers, which means there no tension. He's most likely holding Kate's hand in place — a sign of mutual comfort.""  9. When Kate and William Lean In  The couple sits side by side during a graduation ceremony. (October 2018) ARTHUR EDWARDS/AFP/Getty Images  ""Legs can be used as a psychological barrier expressing interest, disinterest, or discomfort,"" Cobb says of decoding lower-body language. ""William crossing his right leg toward Kate allows her into his space, so he's emotionally drawing her in.""  Kate leaning toward William suggests she's equally into him. ""We move toward things we like and are attracted to,"" Cobb says.  10. When William Touched Kate's Lower Back  The couple attends media event. (December 2017) Karwai Tang/ Getty Images  ""Couples who love each other want to touch each other, since it can convey your love without you having to say a word,"" Cobb says of William placing his hand on Kate's lower back. ""The back placement is a nice, intimate compromise, since if he goes any lower, he goes near the tush, and the shoulder seems too formal.""  11. When The Newly Marrieds Kissed On The Buckingham Palace Balcony  The couple kisses on their wedding day. (April 2011)  Cobb says the couple's wedding kiss is the least intimate interaction of them all. ""It was their wedding day! They should have been touching and embracing heart-to-heart,"" she says. Instead, they stand apart, without even holding hands, and reach only their lips toward each other to meet.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  During the kiss, Kate and William open their eyes at different moments before Kate ultimately pulls away. ""It signals a disconnect, since people who are really into each other automatically close their eyes to feel the moment, the breath of the other person, and the sensation of lips touching,"" Cobb says. ""It looks like they're going through the motions. I also get the sense she’s a little shy, embarrassed, or unsure, since she giggles right afterward, and raises her shoulders — it's a nervous moment for her."" But hey, not everyone gets married in front of thousands of people!  The Bottom Line:  ""This isn't a typical couple, they're people of royalty with rules to follow on public decorum,"" Cobb says. ""I think what happens behind closed doors can be very different from what you see in public.""  Get all the health and fitness news directly in your feed. Follow Facebook.com/CosmoBod.

2ca38a49-78a6-402c-abd2-51efbf6c68b9,"Kourtney Kardashian may be at it again. In recent weeks, both Kim Kardashian and her younger sister, Kylie Jenner have welcomed new baby girls after super secret pregnancies. Add in the fact that middle-sister Khloe is also pregnant and expecting her first child in early April, according to her Twitter, and the Kardashian clan couldn’t be happier. Still, you’ve heard the saying ‘when it rains it pours.’ Sure enough, ENews’ sneak peeks of the newest episode airing this Sunday, February 25 show Kourtney dishing to her sisters about a potential little cousin for brand new babies, Chicago and Stormi. So, straight up: Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant? Is she really going to freeze her eggs?  While there are no confirmations at this point that Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant, Kourtney’s own words suggest she’s got baby number four on her mind. And we know KUWTK crews film episodes several weeks to months before they air. Spoiler videos for this Sunday’s episode, “Trimester Trouble,” reveal Kourtney’s plan to freeze her eggs as “insurance,” that she can have a fourth child in the future. So will we know at the end of this episode if Kourtney’s going to freeze her eggs?  Kourtney also revealed that she uses an IUD as birth control with her current boyfriend, model, Younes Bendjima, 24. Adding, however, that she wouldn’t mind taking it out if her partner wanted children in the near term. It seems that the Kardashian women are on a pregnancy roll. But what about the boys, or should we say, Kardashian Kastoffs?  Kardashian Exes Talk Babies and New Boyfriends  Khloe’s ex-husband, Lamar Odom discloses in a not-yet-aired interview with Access Hollywood, that he’s happy for Khloe about her pregnancy with new boyfriend, Cavaliers player, Tristan Thompson. Lamar can be heard saying that, “it couldn’t happen to a better person,” US Magazine reports. Still, he admits hearing the bombshell Khloe divulged in the season 13 finale, that she was only “fake trying” to get pregnant while she was married to him, was “hurtful.”  Similarly, Kylie’s famous on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend, Tyga had good things to say about Kylie and her new baby. He told radio interviewer, DJ Akademiks that, “there’s no bad blood, no problems.” And while the 28-year-old rapper didn’t comment on Stormi specifically during this interview, he did admit that he and Kylie still “communicate.” And that did nothing to squash internet rumors that Tyga may be the biological father of the 20-year-old cosmetics mogul’s new daughter.  And what about Kourtney’s ex and baby-daddy, Scott Disick? The man who got Kourtney Kardashian pregnant three times in the past is plenty busy hitting the town with new girlfriend, 19-year-old Sophia Richie, younger daughter of Lionel Richie. And on the Rob Kardashian front, there’s not much news yet. Momager Kris’s only son, Rob, has not found love again. At least not after his much-publicized breakup with Blac Chyna, the mother of one-year-old Dream Kardashian.

When the actress took the part of a worker at a secret government facility on Homecoming, an upcoming political thriller on Amazon, she knew just who she wanted as her co-star: her old pal Dermot Mulroney.  She lobbied for him to join the show, and on March 8, it was officially announced that Dermot, 54 — who starred with Julia in My Best Friend's Wedding and August: Osage County — would play her character's boyfriend.

""Even though Julia's reminded him that Dermot is happily married with children, Danny's jealous.""  It's just one of many issues causing problems in Julia and Danny's marriage. The cameraman and cinematographer ""is at the end of his rope,"" the insider tells Life & Style. ""Julia and Danny are constantly quarreling. Their 15-year marriage is on the rocks, and they could even split.""  Julia and Danny have been drifting apart for years. ""Her controlling ways, their different approaches to parenting, and his desire to have his own career, and be the man of the house have all contributed to arguments,"" says the insider. But recently, things have gotten worse. ""They have been living separate lives,"" the insider notes  Julia, Danny, and their three kids in August 2015. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Instead of focusing on repairing his marriage to Julia, 50, Danny, 49, ""has been devoting his time to the kids [twins Hazel and Finn, 13, and son Henry, 10], friends, and jobs away from his wife."" When he's home, the insider says, he often stays across the street from their beachfront compound, in a house they bought in 2016 that was originally meant for guests or nannies. The rift is only continuing to grow. ""Julia is a super-protective parent, which has caused friction with Danny, who believes in being more relaxed,"" explains the insider.  But when it comes to other men, he's anything but. When Julia called hunky survivalist Bear Grylls ""a man's man"" after they completed a charity trek across Africa together in 2017, ""that really got under Danny’s skin,"" says the insider. Danny was also seething after his wife turned into what he called a fawning ""sports groupie,"" the insider says, when they spent time with British and Spanish soccer stars at meet-and-greets in 2016 and 2017.  Danny's insecurity extends to his career, too: He hates being seen as Mr. Julia Roberts. ""For a long time, Danny viewed Julia's success as his own failure. It triggered a fear that he was not good enough, and the fact that Julia controls everything at home made it worse,"" explains the insider. ""Feeling insecure and competitive with your partner is no way to live.""  Though they love each other, friends fear they can't go on like this much longer.

The Mean Girls actress, 30, said she was stopped by a woman who asked her to take her headscarf off. “She opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started immediately apologizing, but then said ‘But please take off your headscarf,'” Lohan told U.K. television show Good Morning Britain. She added: “And I did, it’s okay. But what scared me was in that moment — how would another woman who doesn’t feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel?”  Lohan, who has been photographed carrying a Koran and says she finds “solace” studying the Muslim holy book, said she didn’t know why she was asked to take her headscarf off but found the experience “really jarring.” She told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid: “I’m from New York — I’m born and raised there, but I was a little intimidated.”  When Reid asked the Parent Trap star why she was wearing the headscarf, she said it was “out of respect” for the Turkish women she had met with on her trip. “I was… leaving Turkey and… when I see certain people I feel more comfortable acting the same way as the other women — that’s just a personal respect issue for me that I have,” she said.  When Morgan asked Lohan about her views on President Donald Trump, Lohan said she thought he should be given a fair chance. “I don’t agree with his policies and the things he is doing,” she said. “But at the end of the day he is the president right now. So what’s the point of picking on someone instead of seeing what they’re capable — or not capable — of.” However, she added that she did think his Twitter account should be taken away “or deleted.” Watch the clip below:",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,387

It's been nearly two years since Angelina Jolie left Brad Pitt and took their six kids with her in September 2016. But even after all this time, they have yet to finalize a divorce and custody agreement.  That's apparently now causing problems for the star, who allegedly wants to take their children -- Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 -- with her to London where she'll film Disney's ""Maleficent 2"" this summer. Brad is based in Los Angeles, where Angelina also bought a home in 2017.  In a May 23 report, Page Six writes that Hollywood sources familiar with her film have revealed Angelina, 42, ""is furious since she wants to bring the couple's brood with her while the film shoots."" The implication is that her current custody arrangement with Brad -- the terms of which have remained confidential -- doesn't allow her to do that at will.  ""They are figuring out how it would work, but she is not happy,"" a source told Page Six. ""She wants to take the kids to London with her while she's shooting -- and she's frustrated with the process. They're talking about how it would work.""

4fb28784-07df-4364-aa3f-0e059b7cad86,"There's a certain assumption that when you pose nude in your younger days, you'd prefer to keep that image embedded forever in the minds of those who saw it.  Throw that assumption out the damn window.  For seven Playboy cover models, at least, there's no time like the present to revisit their former snaps, as they proved in a shoot by Ryan Lowry and Ben Miller for the magazine.  As chief creative officer Cooper Hefner (oh yes, there's a relation) relays in an Instagram video, it is in fact what he gave his mother for Mother's Day.  Turn up your 🔉: We re-created some of our most iconic covers and one our models happened to be @cooperbhefner's mom. Look out for the cover reveal on 6/4. A post shared by Playboy (@playboy) on Jun 3, 2017 at 6:30pm PDT      ""In the spirit of celebrating the women who’ve made Playboy what it is – an exuberant celebration of beauty, sex, and the beauty of sex — we invited seven special Playmates from over the years to come back and recreate their iconic covers. In the process, they remind us that beauty is ageless, sex appeal is timeless and exuberance is eternal,"" notes the article.  And frankly, we couldn't agree more. Take a look, for example, at Kimberley Conrad Hefner (former wife of Hugh Hefner and mom of Cooper, as well as Marston), in her 1988 cover, and today.  Conrad Hefner, who was raised partially in West Vancouver, was 26 at the time of her original shoot — she's now 54 and divorced from Hef, but still has fond memories of her time at the Mansion.  ""There was a common misconception that I put the kibosh on the partying at the Mansion. It had nothing to do with me. The Playmates still came over, but it was nice to have them call and say, ‘Hi! I’m coming up!’"" she told the publication.  Renee Tenison was the magazine's first African-American Playmate of the Year in 1990.  She was 22-years-old at the time, and is now 49.  Of course, it's somewhat ridiculous it took until that point to have any diversity on the cover, but Tenison remembers a different kind of squabble.  ""When I did Playboy, there was a little bit of controversy because I was the first African-American Playmate of the Year and some women were saying I was being objectified. But I said, ‘Well, if you’re pro-choice, shouldn’t I have the right to choose what I want to do?’ .. If you look back, all the big models from Christy Turlington to Naomi Campbell posed nude. I see it as art. Not everybody sees it that way, but that’s how I see it,"" she told the magazine.  Lisa Matthews, billed as the ""all-American girl,"" took on the task in June 1991.  She was 22-years-old at the time (perhaps that's the magic Playboy cover model number?), and is now 48.  Then there's Candace Collins, who has the oldest cover in the bunch.  She was 22 at the time of her December 1979 photo, and is now 60. She started out working at the infamous Playboy Clubs in St. Louis and Chicago, reports Chicago Magazine, and eventually graced two covers and a centrefold.  With the recent rise in popularity of boudoir photography, it probably should come as no surprise that more and more women (and men) are not only willing to take off their clothes in front of a camera, but clamouring for it.

And it seems like Kourtney Kardashian is none too pleased with her younger beau's jealousy.  The 39-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is said to be 'frustrated' with her 25-year-old boyfriend airing out his grievances in a public forum it was reported by E! News on Wednesday.  A source for the entertainment publication said: 'Kourtney doesn't appreciate Younes posting his feelings in a public forum and being impulsive.  Peachy: Kourtney Kardashian, 39, is said to be 'frustrated' with her 25-year-old boyfriend airing out his grievances in a public forum it was reported by E! News on Wednesday after she posted this racy snap two days prior  'She's frustrated that he continues to get upset about it. She isn't going to stop doing what she's doing and feels like he needs to understand and deal with it.'  As the former amateur boxer makes his living scantily-clad in front of the camera it is interesting to note that he would feel this way.  The insider explained: 'Younes gets jealous and can be possessive of Kourtney. When she posts half naked pictures, he gets very upset.  'He wants her for himself and doesn't want to share her with the world.'  Dislike: Her boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, (pictured) is said to not be a fan of her sexy selfies  The two recently returned from a trip in Europe which lasted over several weeks as the male model is said to be 'missing her like crazy and got emotional,' however, Kourtney believes that he needs to get over it as it's part of her job and brand.  The source explained: 'Kourtney has explained its part of her job and it's not going to change. But it still makes him uncomfortable and upset. He overreacted and put up a comment without thinking it through.  'Then he realized what he did made it even worse. He was just not thinking in the moment and got emotional.'  The report comes just two days after the reality star posted a very revealing snap o her curves on Instagram on Monday.  She proudly flaunted her bodacious figure in a floral patterned thong bikini as she posed with her back to the camera while kneeling on the grass.  Contradiction? As Younes is a male model he often posts snaps of himself scantily-clad  However one person who doesn't seem to be the fan of the image is her 25-year-old model boyfriend Younes Bendjima.  According to The Shade Room, the model deleted a comment on the snap which said: 'that's what you need to show to get likes?'  On Monday, PEOPLE reported he has never been a fan of Kourtney's 'sexy pictures on social media.'  'He doesn't want his girlfriend to do that,' a source told the magazine. 'He gets that it's her job, but he has always had a problem with this. This is the stuff that made them split in the past.'  Bendjima publicly expressed his dislike when he commented on the reality star's most recent Instagram post, writing: 'This is what you need to show to get likes?'  Younes' comment has since been deleted.  Several of the KUWTK star's pals including sister Kendall Jenner and model Bella Hadid approved.  'Yes tooshie,' Kendall wrote.  'Wow. Yup,' Bella said.  And Blink-182's drummer Travis Barker commented on the image with a single hand clap emoji.  'He doesn't want his girlfriend to do that,' a source told the magazine.

Her raven-colored tresses were worn down under the fashionable headwear as she let her natural looks show by wearing minimal make-up.  Kourtney captioned the racy image: 'don’t be shady, be a lady.'

Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.

Turns out that David took part in PBS' genealogy series Finding Your Roots recently and discovered that he's distantly related to the Vermont senator, ""he's in the line... like a third cousin, or something,"" David revealed at a panel promoting Season 9 of Curb Your Enthusiasm at the Television Critics Association summer press tour.

STILL WALKING          Alden (Callan McAuliffe)      Prediction: Lives    A Savior turned Hilltopper, Alden is one of the newest additions to the cast. So far, his story really seems to revolve around Maggie. Is he a possible new love interest? That's the popular fan theory at the moment. Too bad Maggie's leaving the show this season...

Now, he's an important member of the communities as a trained doctor. Avi Nash is a main cast member in season 9 and it'll be interesting to see how his story evolves in season 9. He should be relatively safe.        Enid (Katelyn Nacon)      Prediction: Lives    Enid began her time on the show as a loner and has over the years become a vital part of the Hilltop.

With a fakeout last year, Tara is probably safe.            Dwight (Austin Amelio)      Prediction: Lives    I'm going with what I know from the comics about Dwight. He lives on for several arcs in the book, so there's no reason for me to suspect he'll die in season 9. The only question is whether he'll return to the show this season or at all...        King Ezekiel (Khary Payton)      Prediction: Dies    Ezekiel lost a lot in the war against Negan, including his beloved Shiva. But things are looking up for Ezekiel this year, as he rebuilds his kingdom and begins a relationship with Carol. Which is exactly why he'll die this year.

The war is over and she's found peace now that Negan, who killed her beloved Abraham, is behind bars. The show has focused more on her these last two years and we expect new showrunner Angela Kang will find interesting ways to explore this character.        Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt)      Prediction: Lives    We've said it for several seasons: the mullet will never die and season 8 proved that when he survived working for Negan against Rick's coalition.

The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  For this album, Swift has been experimenting with beat-forward electro-pop, steering clear of her previous country roots and eschewing her past detours into lite dubstep drops. Instead, her music references ’80s and ’90s sounds in its own style of minimalist rock-pop: a little bit punk, a little bit rap-sung, and plenty of catchy melody for good measure. And the lyrics? As ever, Swift stays personal, as past lyrics have alluded to the headlines and personalities that have influenced her path through stardom.  Some super-fans have already listened to Reputation at private sessions hosted by Swift in London and her home in Rhode Island. But the rest will have to replay “Gorgeous” for three more weeks.

Jenner, 67, completed gender reassignment surgery in January, according to her new memoir, ‘The Secrets of My Life’. The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’.

The photo shoot promises to be Caitlyn's finest hour since she first announced her transition in an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July  Although the Kardashian-Jenner clan is said to be ‘wholly supportive’ of Jenner’s transition, sources close to the family say the prospect of a nude shoot is ‘their worst nightmare’  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody, 33.  ‘Brody told them that Caitlyn has planned and booked a full nude photo shoot and they were like, that’s unacceptable, it’s taking things too far,' the source said.  ‘They’re hoping the shoot doesn't come to pass because that would be their worst nightmare. Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner’s surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‘She knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,’ said the source. ‘But she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‘I am Cait’ shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated […] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‘I am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner’s ‘unpredictable’ behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‘[The book] is definitely something that she’s wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‘But the family were like, it’s probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‘They were worried because she’s been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.’  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson’s defense team during his 1995 trial.  The disgraced football star was acquitted of the charges but, in 1998, was found ‘responsible’ for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial.  Writing in her memoir, Jenner says she was in a car with Kardashian a few years after the murders when he said: 'I would’ve been okay with it if they had gotten him [Simpson] in the first trial.'  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old’s plan from her model son Brody  She added: 'The implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.’  According to a family insider, Kris and the four Kardashians now rarely speak to Jenner.  The insider said: ‘Kylie and do [talk to Jenner]. They do keep in communication and they’re fully supportive [of her transition].  ‘But when Kylie and Kendall do speak with her, it’s always secret – they don’t want to bring it up to their mom or sisters because it causes a lot of drama, so they keep it secret and between them.’  The source added: ‘It’s just the Kardashian part of the family that hasn’t been talking to her. They feel like she had been riding on their coattails long enough for the fame and that she is really milking it for all its worth.  ‘They feel if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own - a lot of these things that she’s doing are trying to one-up them and trying to gain the spotlight back.  ‘While [the operation] was inevitable, they think her plan to do the nude spread is over the top. That’s something that is really annoying to them.’",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1141

On Tuesday, photos and videos surfaced of the NBA player allegedly getting close to an unidentified woman at an N.Y.C. lounge over the weekend. TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.  Despite the allegations of infidelity — a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is “a serial cheater” — the insider says the mother-to-be is likely to stay with Thompson.  “She’s a hopeless romantic and she’ll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She’s having a child with Tristan, and she’s going to try to rebuild this,” the source says.  Adds the source: “Khloé could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That’s actually even worse.”  Prior to meeting Thompson, Kardashian was in a nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Odom. They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom  “Khloé spent so much time with Lamar just excusing away the obvious, turning a blind eye to what was so clearly happening, that it would be impossible for her not to feel like a fool if she made the same sort of mistakes again and just ignored that N.Y.C footage [of Thompson[. That’s not the way a man deeply in love with the mother of his child behaves. It’s just not. And Khloé can’t lie to herself and tell herself otherwise,” the source says.  RELATED VIDEO: Did Khloé Kardashian’s Boyfriend Get Too Close to Another Woman Right Before She Gives Birth?  “The thing about Khloé, though, is she’s a big believer in knowing someone’s back story and understanding how it motivates them. With Lamar, her heart broke for everything he’d been through in the past, losing his mom and his grandma and his baby boy, and she used that as a justification for why he struggled so much with addiction and cheating. She’s got a big heart — too big sometimes,” the source shares.  Thompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016, when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with Thompson’s first child, 16-month-old son Prince Oliver. Neither has addressed whether he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig.

Tristan Thompson and Jordan Craig David Livingston/Getty; Jordan Craig/Instagram  Tristan Thompson and Jordan Craig  “With Tristan, she believed his back story that he was never even that committed to her or in love with Jordan, and that he’d never meant to be with Jordan long-term,” the insider explains.”Khloé let herself believe that he’s a really good guy with a good heart. She might still believe that, honestly.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  With the baby’s arrival imminent, Kardashian has been nesting in Cleveland with the NBA player. A source previously told PEOPLE she planned on giving birth there, and her famous family would fly in, including mother Kris Jenner, who is already in Ohio with Kardashian.  While her future with Thompson remains unknown, the Good American jeans founder is focusing her attention on her unborn daughter.  “The only thing Khloe can do now is focus on her baby,” the source says.”What’s happened over the last 24 hours changes a lot of things, but it doesn’t change everything: It doesn’t change that Khloé has dreamed of becoming a mom, already loves her baby so much, and that soon her dream is going to come true.”  “She can’t wait to meet her little girl, can’t wait to hold her,” says the insider, adding, “and so for right now, the focus is just on getting to that day as safely and healthily as possible.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,968

Scott Disick and Sofia Richie were spotted packing on the PDA at the VIP Opening of Maddox Gallery in West Hollywood on Thursday, October 11.  “Scott and Sofia have a cute and effortless rapport,” an insider told Us Weekly, noting that at one point during their outing, Disick, 35, even fixed the 20-year-old model’s hair for her.  The insider added: “They both looked great — Sofia [looked] stunning and put together and Scott [had] what looked like a new haircut. Later, they stood posted up by the very crowded bar, relaxed, neither of them drinking.”  Us Weekly also caught up with Paris Hilton at the event — where guests sipped on specialty cocktails provided by Guillotine Vodka — who gushed over Richie and her relationship with the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star.  “Whatever makes her happy,” Hilton, 37, told Us. “I love Sofia. She’s so sweet and mature. I’m so proud of her. I’ve known her since she was born. She’s a very smart girl.”  As for whether Hilton thinks Disick is “the one” for Richie, the Simple Life alum added: “I can’t comment on that, but she’s beautiful, she’s successful, she’s killing it and I’m so proud of her.

9680bd64-c5ab-4ddb-b1b8-2ed2d48d0a84,"(CNN) Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.  The reality star appeared in court Monday morning with her attorneys as she sought to stop what she alleges is cyber-bullying by Kardashian.  Kardashian posted personal information last week about his relationship with Chyna on his Instagram account, including sexually explicit images of his former fiancée whom he accused of cheating on him and using him for his fortune.  Outside of court, Chyna's attorney Lisa Bloom said they were granted everything they sought in their petition.  ""As we have said all along, revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Bloom said. ""It is also a crime in California and 38 other states.""  Attorney Robert Shapiro represented Kardashian, who did not appear in court.  Shapiro said his client stipulated to the restraining order and agreed to follow all the conditions.  The attorney said Kardashian's concern now ""is the health and welfare of the baby and both parents are going to work toward that goal.""  ""I, personally, on Mr. Kardahsian's behalf apologized and offered our regrets as to what happened in the past couple of days,"" Shapiro said. ""Now we move forward to do one thing and one thing only, what ever is in the best interest of the child.""  Chyna echoed that sentiment in a brief statement she made after the hearing.  ""I'm just going to get back to co-parenting Dream,"" she said.  In the petition, Chyna, whose legal name is Angela White, alleged that Kardashian swore at her in front of her 4-year-old son, King, and got angered when she attempted to call King's father during an argument back in April.  ""Rob immediately grabbed my phone and pushed me to the ground by aggressively shoving me by the side of my arm and hitting me on the side,"" the declaration read. ""I fell down from the blow to my side. I was sore and it hurt to walk.""  The next hearing in the case has been set for August 8.  Earlier the model and entrepreneur appeared on ""Good Morning America"" with Bloom in an interview which aired Monday morning before the hearing.  Chyna told ""GMA"" she was ""devastated"" by Kardashian's actions.  ""Like, this is a person I trusted,"" she said. ""I just felt...betrayed.""  She denied claims she engaged with the photos by liking some of the images her ex posted, saying she has Kardashian blocked on Instagram.  She said she decided to pursue legal action after speaking with her former love with whom she shares an eight-month-old daughter, Dream.  ""The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me,"" said Chyna, whose real name is Angela White. ""If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law.""  Bloom said on Friday she had filed for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian on behalf of her client.  California has laws regarding ""revenge porn"" in which a person can be charged for publicly releasing unauthorized nude images of another person to cause them emotional distress.  The former couple has had a tumultuous relationship that's been documented on both social media and their E! reality series ""Rob & Chyna.""  Things were also complicated by the fact Chyna shares a son with rapper Tyga, who left her to begin dating Kardashian's younger sister, Kylie Jenner.  On Monday's ""GMA"" appearance, Bloom defended Chyna against those who say the reality star already exposes a great deal of herself in her own social media postings.  ""Any explicit photos that she may have chosen to post in the past that's her choice,"" Bloom said. ""This is like saying that a woman can't be raped if she previously chose to have sex with someone. It's her body, it's her choice,each and every time.""  Chyna said she and Kardashian split in December and there is absolutely no hope of a reconciliation. She said she has not heard from any of his family members since Kardashian's social media postings last Wednesday.  Chyna addressed speculation that she got pregnant as a revenge ploy against the Kardashians or to get money out of the reality mogul family, Chyna denied it.  ""I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardsahians,"" she said.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,833

The 32-year-old musician has admitted that whilst she “struggled” for a long while when it came to speaking publicly about her struggles with mental health, she admits she felt better once she had someone to confide in, and says keeping her battle to herself only made her problems worse.  She said: ""I have struggled for a long time, both being public and not public about my mental health issues or my mental illness. But, I truly believe that secrets keep you sick.”  Gaga spoke as she honoured her mother Cynthia Germanotta, with the Global Changemakers Award at Children Mending Hearts' Empathy Rocks fundraiser over the weekend, and said that whilst she realises it’s “safer” for her to speak out now that she’s a star, she hopes her work with the charity will help other people come forward too.  She added: “I realise that it's actually safer to say how I feel. What Children Mending Hearts is doing today rocks because it's safer for others who feel like me.”  The ‘Million Reasons’ singer also highlighted the importance of having “real honest conversations” about mental health, and urged everyone to put more “kindness” into the world.  She said: ""We bring people together to have real, honest conversations and to be kind. Kindness is not an afterthought to our work. It is the driving power for everything we do. It is the lens we view every challenge through. It is framing the way we put everything around every possible solution. To me, almost every problem you can think of can be solved with kindness. At least it could be made better. Kindness has a soft undertone. Sometimes people think it is weak. It is tremendously powerful. It can change the way that we view each other.

4eee056d-a094-4235-85bb-4ca0421980c6,"Johnny Depp. Getty Many entertainment stars love the finer things in life, but it seems even the earnings of an A-lister like Johnny Depp couldn't sustain his wild indulgences.  The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star is currently in a public-relations tailspin after his messy divorce with actress Amber Heard, who alleged he had abused her, and his filing a $25 million lawsuit against his former business managers at The Management Group. (TMG has countersued.)  Things didn't get any better for Depp on Wednesday when The Hollywood Reporter published a feature that went deeper into Depp's financial woes.  TMG's Joel Mandel claims that even though Depp has earned more than $650 million in the more than 13 years the company represented the star, Depp didn't have enough cash to cover his $2 million in bills each month.  Depp's extravagant spending habits reportedly include $3.6 million annually for his 40-person staff, $350,000 monthly for maintaining his 156-foot yacht, $30,000 monthly for wine, and $5 million the star says he spent to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.  TMG says it met with Depp numerous times over the years to try to get Depp to sell some of his expensive items. On one occasion, he agreed to sell his $10 million yacht that he spent $8 million to renovate, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Another year, TMG almost got Depp to sell his French chateau — on which he spent $10 million to renovate — but he got cold feet after prospective buyers came calling, according to the former business managers, and it has since been relisted for $39 million.  Johnny Depp will be seen next in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,"" out May 26. Disney Depp has routinely earned $20 million up-front paychecks for the movies he's been in since the success of 2003's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" He also gets 20% of the backend per picture, according to The Hollywood Reporter — a source said that was $40 million from the backend of each ""Pirates"" movie and $55 million from his profit on the 2010 hit ""Alice in Wonderland,"" which earned over $1 billion worldwide.

eedf4bca-ec56-4fcc-9639-f523fb8ff7de,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Erik Ortiz  A Milwaukee man whose ill-timed bathroom break on a Delta flight in April grabbed headlines after his subsequent removal was caught on cellphone cameras has sued the airline claiming racial discrimination.  In a complaint filed Tuesday in Wisconsin federal court, Kima Hamilton, who is black, alleges that Delta Air Lines wouldn't have violated his civil rights and booted him from the Milwaukee-bound flight if he were white.  The incident began when Hamilton's plane was delayed on an airport tarmac in Atlanta. According to the 40-year-old art teacher, he desperately needed to use the bathroom and knew that announcements asked passengers to remain seated.  While the lavatory was steps away, a flight attendant stopped him before he could get to it and told him that if he went, the pilot would have to be alerted and the plane would lose its place in line for takeoff.  But Hamilton couldn't bear another seven- to 10-minute delay, he said, and was ""experiencing an emergency."" Again, he said, he was warned about getting up.  Related: Delta asked man to leave flight after using restroom, videos show  ""At this point, Hamilton had to make a literal choice between relieving himself in the lavatory or in his clothing,"" according to the suit. He chose the former — taking about 30 seconds in the restroom, the suit adds.  That set off a chain of events that led the plane to return to the gate to have Hamilton removed.  Other passengers used their cellphones to capture employees talking to Hamilton, who was frustrated and could be heard asking why he had to be taken off.  ""Mr. Hamilton was never confrontational. He was very polite. He only asked for clarification throughout,"" passenger Michael Rosolino told NBC affiliate WTMJ.  Hamilton's lawsuit said other similar incidents have occurred involving white passengers who were allowed to remain on their flights. His case was one that followed heightened scrutiny over passengers being kicked off airplanes for various reasons.  Related: Airplane Mode: Tracking a new era in travel  Delta said in a statement at the time that their flight crews are ""extensively trained to ensure the safety and security of all customers.""  The cost of half of Hamilton's flight was subsequently refunded, but he had to pay triple to book a new ticket home, he said.  His lawsuit is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. His attorney could not be immediately reached for further comment Thursday.  Delta said in a statement that it is ""imperative"" that passengers comply with crew instructions ""during all phases of flight, especially at the critical points of takeoff and landing, which our findings indicate this customer did not do.""  The airline said it takes claims of discrimination seriously, but declined to comment further citing pending litigation.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,547

Read more: 'Stranger Things' fields harassment allegations  Heaton, a British citizen, was denied entry into the U.S. last October, as reported by USA Today. Although he wasn't arrested and no charges were filed, officers at Los Angeles International Airport detected a small amount of cocaine on the actor's belongings after a routine inspection by a customs canine. Heaton, who plays Jonathan Byers on Stranger Things, was returned to London and missed out on the show's L.A. premiere event for the second season.  The actor now says the incident is “all sorted,” and he reveals to Flaunt magazine that the public scrutiny he received over the experience was “fucking awful,” as noted by the NME. Hearton admits that his newfound fame from Stranger Things served as an impediment in relation to the drug debacle:  “It was hard,” he says. “Everything happened so fast, and I hadn't come to terms with the fact that I was famous. When something steps in from the work you are doing and breaks into your personal life…you feel kind of vulnerable. All of a sudden it becomes a very big story and it gets really blown out of proportion.” After reporters showed up on his parents' doorstep in Yorkshire, England, the actor says he “just wanted to go back. I want to work and continue to work.”  At the time of the cocaine possession reports, Heaton released an official statement admitting that he was “sorry to all the fans and my Stranger Things family for missing the premiere. We are all so proud of this season and I would never want this story to negatively impact the show.”  The actor's expected to return as Jonathan Byers for the upcoming third season of Stranger Things.

In fact, he doesn't really have any feeling about Meghan Markle at all, since he doesn't even remember her from their Deal or No Deal days.  Though Meghan, 37, was a model on the game show that Howie hosted, the 63-year-old told Dr. Oz this week that he had no recollection of working with her, and it came as a surprise when he learned the Duchess of Sussex was on the show.  Nope! Howie Mandel said this week that he wasn't invited to the royal wedding  Blending in: The 63-year-old also admitted he didn't remember Meghan Markle  Rising star: Meghan worked as a 'suitcase girl' on Deal or No Deal at the start of her acting career, between 2006 and 2007  Beautiful ladies: The two definitely met, though it doesn't seem like the future Duchess made an impression on Howie  In a preview clip of an episode of The Dr. Oz Show set to air on Thursday, Howie dishes as best he can on Meghan — which is to say, he doesn't really dish at all.  'I was not invited to the wedding,' he says, answering Dr. Oz's question.  When prodding to share what he recalls of working together — Meghan was on the show briefly in the mid-2000s — Howie didn't have much to tell.  'What do I remember? I'm going to be totally honest with you. Nothing. I don't remember Meghan. I don't,' he said.  Gesturing to a photo of Meghan as a briefcase girl, Howie said, 'I saw that picture when she became the Duchess or when she got engaged.  'I saw that picture and they went, ""She was a Deal or No Deal model,"" and I go, ""Really? Really? What number?"" Then that picture, put up that picture again, as I was trying to remember, what number was she? There's no number even on her case. So, how do you know she was actually a model?  'I think she's just a young lady with a lot of baggage,' he joked.  Working the camera: The now-37-year-old was one of 26 women who had to carry a suitcase that was filled with a monetary amount, ranging between one penny and $1 million  Exciting: Her go-to briefcase number was 24, and she knew how to nail the necessary excitement for players who eliminated small dollar amounts  Surprise! Meghan appeared on the show ten years before she met Prince Harry, and said in 2013 that she did it in order to 'make ends meet' while auditioning for other roles  Meghan carried briefcases with more than one number during her time, but it was most frequently the number 24.  Speaking about her more, Howie had some generic, nice things to say.  'She's a wonderful, beautiful, young lady and I'm so happy for her. All I want for each and every person, they don't even have to be on my show to be successful and healthy,' he said.  When asked about Meghan at a Television Critics Association event in August, Howie joked that she was 'slightly duchessy' before praising all the women who held up the briefcases on the show.  'Not everybody will have the opportunity to meet royalty, but these are all accomplished people that have something substantial — they’re not just standing there holding a case,' he said.  'They have careers, they have hobbies, they have families, they’re entrepreneurial—they’re all people. So, when somebody like Harry meets somebody who just happened to be on our show, there’s a lot to offer.'  Revealed: Chrissy Teigen, 33, said she was on Deal or No Deal when Meghan was, and had only nice things to say about her  No big: Howie doesn't seem to crushed about not getting an invite  Diva?He did, however, joke that she was 'duchessy' earlier this year  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said  Meghan, meanwhile, reflected on her time on the show in a 2013 interview with Esquire.  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said, adding that it was 'in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet.'  Some of Meghan's fellow models also had nice things to say.  'I am especially a fan of Meghan,' Chrissy Teigen told Mail on Sunday this year. 'I was on Deal or No Deal with her and she was lovely. Now everyone asks me what she was like and I say, “Sorry, no dirt. She’s gorgeous.”'  'Meghan is beautiful, smart, talented, I feel she absolutely deserves to be a princess,' former suitcase girl Aubrie Lemon told Inside Edition.  'One day she was next to me getting fitted for her dress, and the next day she's going to be the future princess,' Leyla Milani joked, before adding: 'She was always reading scripts behind the scenes when we had our down time... she was always working on her craft.'  Smile pretty: It was 'in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet,' she said  Winner! Although she revealed that she never had the winning case, Meghan certainly knew how to put on a show while appearing on the show in a series of very provocative outfits  There she goes! At the start of each show, Meghan would have to stroll down some stairs with her fellow models, carrying a suitcase in one hand and smiling at the camera (pictured with 11)  Over on the new episode of Dr. Oz, Howie also delved into more serious issues, talking about his mental health. The comedian and entertainer has spoken out before about struggling with OCD and anxiety.  In this interview, he recalled being on the Howard Stern show 25 years ago when he started to have a panic attack.  'But the truth is, because people think because I'm a comedian they thought I was joking,' he said. 'I started having an anxiety attack, which feels like a heart attack.  'Then in my panic I said, ""Howard seriously, I go to a doctor and I have OCD. I see a psychiatrist and I feel like I'm going to die right now. You've got to please, you got to let me out.""  Playing along: Howie also played a jokey game of Deal or No Deal with Dr. Oz, and opened up about his anxiety issues  Once Howard let him out, he realized that the show wasn't on break, and he'd set that all on air.  'I said, ""Oh, my God. I just said that publicly, on national radio."" So number one, I thought my poor family. I outed myself as a mentally unstable person. How are my kids going to be able to go to school?  'I mean, it's going to be horrible, number one. Number two, my career is over because who's going to hire, any show cost millions of dollars. Who's going to hire somebody who has mental health issues?  'Remember this is 25 years ago and it was the darkest day of my life.

9d4d99af-1cdb-47a2-8910-96a22653c466,"January 2nd, 2005, was a very important day in seven-year-old Katie Flynn’s life.She was one of the flower girls at her aunt Lisa’s wedding, along with her younger sister Grace.Over 200 friends and relatives had gathered on a beach in Long Island to witness Lisa and David exchange their vows and join in holy matrimony.The guests watched on as Katie and Grace walked down the isle with their beautiful dresses and innocent smiles – but nobody could have known this was to be the last day of young Katie’s life.After a long day of love, laughter and festivities, the bride’s parents, Christopher and Denice, along with her sister, Jennifer, Jennifer’s husband, Neil, and their two young daughters, Katie and Grace, got in the limousine that would take them home.“I remember looking in on the limo and seeing Kate and waving goodbye and she waved goodbye and never thought that was going to be the type of moment where you’re seeing people for the last time,” the groom, David, told CNN.The limousine left the Long Island wedding and joined the highway. They could never have known that a drunk 24-year-old, Marin Heidgen, was also on the road. Heidgen, driving on the wrong side of the road, hit the limo head-on, causing a devastating accident.Police reports revealed that Heidgen’s blood alcohol level was more than three times the legal limit. He had consumed at least 14 drinks and had been driving at 70 miles an hour, on the wrong side of the highway, for at least two miles before the catastrophic accident occurred.The driver of the limousine, 59-year-old Stanley Rabinowitz, was killed instantly after being crushed by the engine. The bride’s father, Christopher, broke both of his legs in several places after being thrown to the floor. He later had to have one amputated. His wife, Denise, was also seriously injured, and little Grace was stuck in the folds of the wreckage.Despite having a broken back, Neil attempted to crawl from the car to seek help. Meanwhile, Jennifer, who had injured her foot, was desperately searching for Katie, who had been lying on the side seat at the time of the crash.Then, Jennifer Flynn came across something that no mother should ever have to witness – her daughter, Katie, had been decapitated by her own seat-belt.One of the first responders on the scene was Michael Tangney, the bride’s uncle and a policeman himself. He had been at the wedding just hours before:“I was walking to the rear of the limousine when a gentleman was coming away from it, and he said, ‘Don’t go back there. It’s bad,’” Michael Tangney said. “I opened the rear door to the limousine and realized it was my family.”But, tragically, the worst was yet to come.Michael Tagney would witness Jennifer emerging from the wreck with her daughter’s head in her hands. Katie’s body remained in the car, still in the dress she had proudly worn for the wedding only a few hours previous.For the next hour, Jennifer sat next to the road. She kept Katie’s head on her lap and watched as the rest of her family was freed from the wreckage of the destroyed vehicle.Eventually, she let her daughter go; handing her to Michael. Before she did so, she kissed her daughter’s face one last time.The event altered the lives of the whole family. Martin Heidgen was sentenced to 18 years in prison for two counts of second-degree murder – though nothing, of course, can ever bring back Jennifer’s daughter.Jennifer and Neil have bravely chosen to talk openly about their story, in the hope that it might prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again.“Since no one should have to live the life I do, I felt a responsibility, an obligation, to stand up and tell our story,” Jennifer said.“I hope that by experiencing the devastation that we survived that night, and still continue to live through, people can see the seriousness of drunk driving as the crime it really is. Hopefully we will save more in the future.”The fact that people still drive drunk will come as no surprise to you.I’m sure you’ve seen your fair share of stories on the news and watched it happen in movies.

According to the outlet, the Mobb Deep rapper choked while eating an egg. He died at the age of 42 on June 20 at a Las Vegas hospital, where he was being treated for complications from sickle cell anemia.  “It is with extreme sadness and disbelief that we confirm the death of our dear friend Albert Johnson, better known to millions of fans as Prodigy of legendary NY rap duo Mobb Deep,” a publicist for the hip-hop group confirmed in a statement to Rolling Stone at the time. “Prodigy was hospitalized a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by a sickle cell anemia crisis. As most of his fans know, Prodigy battled the disease since birth. The exact causes of death have yet to be determined. We would like to thank everyone for respecting the family’s privacy at this time.”  A public memorial service was held for Prodigy at New York City’s Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel on June 29. The stars in attendance included fellow Mobb Deep rapper Havoc, The Roots drummer Questlove, Fat Joe, 50 Cent and Remy Ma.  The “Quiet Storm” rapper performed his final concert at the Downtown Las Vegas Events Center on June 17, just three days before his death.  Prodigy is survived by wife Ikesha Dudley, son T’Shaka, daughter Fahtasia, brother Greg, stepdaughter Kiejzonna and step-granddaughter Brooklyn Harris.

6ab47419-f99c-4d32-ad07-1118f70b17e5,"Wonder Wheel is a 2017 American period drama film written and directed by Woody Allen, and starring Jim Belushi, Kate Winslet, Juno Temple, and Justin Timberlake. The film is set in the early 1950s at an amusement park on Coney Island, and named for the park's Ferris wheel. The story follows the second wife and the estranged daughter of a carousel operator as they both pursue affairs with a life guard.[4]  The film served as the closing night selection at the 55th New York Film Festival, on October 14, 2017,[5] and was released on December 1, 2017, by Amazon Studios.[6]  Plot [ edit ]  Mickey Rubin, a Coney Island life guard with aspirations to be a playwright like Eugene O'Neill, narrates through the fourth wall. Carolina, the daughter of Humpty Rannell, arrives at the boardwalk looking for Ginny Rannell, her father's second wife who works as a waitress at the clam shack. She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay, on the condition that she saves money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitress job where she works.  Ginny used to be an actress and was happily married, but caused her husband to divorce her by being unfaithful. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets in trouble by setting fires. She is unhappy with Humpty and living on the boardwalk, and has been carrying on an affair with Mickey for a few months. Humpty is an angry and loud recovering alcoholic who runs the Carousel ride, and goes fishing with his friends to bring dinner home. But he starts to find more joy and patience for life with Carolina around, and he pays for her to go to night school.  Mickey is attracted to Ginny because of her age and experience, and because he views her as a damsel in need of saving. He and Carolina accidentally meet some time later, and he becomes attracted by Carolina's story. He thinks he is in love with her, but is conflicted with his feelings for Ginny. Ginny steals money from Humpty to buy Mickey an expensive watch as a birthday present, which he refuses to accept. By this time, Ginny has become suspicious of Mickey's feelings for Carolina and is jealous.  Mobsters Angelo and Nick come around, asking Humpty, and the owner of the clam shack, about Carolina's whereabouts. Carolina takes Mickey on a date to a Brooklyn pizza parlor, and her boss innocently tells this to Angelo and Nick. Ginny telephones the pizza parlor to warn Carolina but begins to stutter, realizing her opportunity to have Carolina away from Mickey, and hangs up. Mickey tells Carolina the whole truth about his feelings for her and his affair. Instantly feeling compassionate for everyone involved, Carolina decides to walk home alone to process the information and decide what she should do, not wanting to hurt Ginny or her father or Mickey. We see Angelo and Nick's car following her as she leaves the pizza parlor.  When Carolina does not come home, Humpty asks Mickey the next day if he saw her after the date. Mickey investigates, and finds out Ginny called the pizza parlor but did not speak. Piecing it together, he confronts Ginny, who has started drinking and getting made up in one of her glamorous stage costumes. She pulls a knife out of the drawer and asks Mickey to kill her, but he leaves. Humpty comes back, sinking back into alcoholism after the police found no trace of Carolina, and tells Ginny he needs her help again to function in life. He tries to find a positive outlook and invites her to meet his friends' wives on a fishing trip, but she coldly refuses, keeping their rut in life status quo.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Casting [ edit ]  Kate Winslet was the first actor who came on board for the film, in July 2016,[7][8] followed by Juno Temple and Jim Belushi.[9] Allen, describing the casting process, said that, ""The first person I cast was Kate Winslet, then I cast a young girl named Juno Temple who I thought very much of,"" and ""I cast Jim Belushi who I thought was absolutely perfect for it.""[10] Talking about the film, Winslet – who was previously attached to Allen's 2005 drama film Match Point but left the project to spend more time with her family – said, ""I play the lead. My character is called Ginny, and she's a waitress in a clam house... It was probably like the second most stressful part I've ever played, but the experience itself was just utterly incredible.""[11]  Allen later signed Justin Timberlake in the role of a lifeguard,[12][13] saying that ""I was doing this film and I thought, who could I get that would be an interesting guy to play a lifeguard in about 1950? I was sitting and talking with my brain trust. Someone said, 'What about Justin Timberlake?'""[10] On August 19, 2016, Tony Sirico joined the cast.[14] In September 2016, Jack Gore, Steve Schirripa, and Max Casella rounded out the cast of the film.[15][16][17]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography began in Coney Island on September 15, 2016.[18] On the same day, filming took place at Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn around Hudson Avenue and Gold Street.[19] Timberlake and Temple were spotted filming at Brighton Beach on September 16, 2016,[20] and Winslet and Timberlake filmed scenes at Coney Island on September 19, 2016.[21]  Release [ edit ]  The film premiered as the closing film of the New York Film Festival on October 14, 2017. It was theatrically released on December 1, 2017, the same day as Allen's 82nd birthday.[6]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  Wonder Wheel grossed $1.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $13.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $14.9 million.[3]  In the United States the film made $125,570 from five theaters in its opening weekend (an average of $25,114), marking a 61% drop from Café Society's debut the previous year.[22]  In France, the film was released on January 31, 2018 and sold 20,147 tickets on its opening day, marking the lowest of any Allen film in over 15 years.[23]  Critical response [ edit ]  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 180 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Wonder Wheel gathers a charming cast in an inviting period setting, but they aren't enough to consistently breathe life into a Woody Allen project that never quite comes together.""[24] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating ""mixed or average reviews"".[25]  Graham Fuller for Screen International wrote a positive review, praising Allen, ""It would be going too far to say Wonder Wheel is an instant Woody Allen classic, but it’s a reminder that he’s still a force to be reckoned with.""[26]  Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave Wonder Wheel three out of four stars, and lauded Winslet's performance, writing ""there are valid criticisms of Wonder Wheel as a film that feels more like a stage play – its claustrophobic atmosphere can be stifling. But even covering familiar ground, Allen finds the blunt truth at its core. As Ginny is stripped of her fantasies and exposed to the harsh glare of reality, Winslet stands her ground, as if to say attention must be paid. It should be. Her performance is absolutely astounding.""[27]  Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nash found the film to be relatively weak, giving it a C- rating, and stating: ""The love triangle is stagy and unfolds with way too many complications and betrayals. It's undercooked even by the filmmaker's own late-career standards. Yes, Coney Island has never looked more gorgeously golden-hued (thanks to cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), but Allen has seldom been less sharp.""[28]  Accolades [ edit ]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1687

On Friday, the fast food chain dropped five songs on a new mixtape, including several diss tracks taking aim at its biggest competitors in the fast food world.  ""The mixtape drops now. Not pulling punches. We Beefin’,"" Wendy's official Twitter account posted.  The playlist, titled ""We Beefin',"" is now available on Spotify, Apple Music and Google Play. It has album artwork that features a single image of Wendy's signature square burger patty. The chain tweeted a preview of the art earlier this week.  Lyrics from the track ""Clownin',"" take direct jabs at McDonald's mascot, Ronald McDonald: ""You hide from funk / That's prolly why you go paint your face / My meals are great, people lining up like everyday / Leave you in shame, make you run back to Cirque du Soleil / That's cold game / But what you expect from tryna play / Won't say no names but you a clown / Get it, OK?""  Another track titled ""Rest In Grease,"" calls out McDonald's broken ice cream machines: ""You No. 1? That's a joke / Why you ice cream machine always broke? / Why you drive-thru always slow? / Why you innovation just can't grow? / It's queen Wendy, need I say more?""  Meanwhile, the song ""Holding It Down,"" takes aim at Burger King with lyrics: ""The problem is you didn't recognize I give no clucks / So wrap it up, turn these chickens to rubber ducks / And BK, don't think that you got away / You copied my old menu and put it out on replay.""  To make it clear these tracks weren't just aimed at any old restaurant, Wendy's even tweeted a Spotify link to the playlist directly at McDonald's. ""Don't sleep on this mixtape,"" the chain wrote with flame and burger emojis.  Wendy's has been steadily gaining praise among fans for its creative use of social media to troll its fast food rivals. In November, Wendy's slammed McDonald's over a Black Friday tweet that went awry. The chain also sent out a fiery tweet after McDonald's announced most of its locations would begin making its Quarter Pounders with fresh beef instead frozen patties. Wendy's has long prided itself on using fresh, never-frozen patties.  ""So you’ll still use frozen beef in MOST of your burgers in ALL of your restaurants?

e8ffed75-0636-4159-a849-e740aefe25c0,"I’ve been saying for a solid year that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s marriage seemed very strange. They barely seemed to spend any time together, and it wasn’t like their time apart was just about competing work schedules at all. Things got even stranger in the past week, with Jennifer celebrating her 49th birthday in Malibu, all while Justin was in New York, hanging out with his dog and not doing anything particularly important. I told you guys I was getting a weird feeling about JustJen. And look, I was right. Justin and Jennifer are over.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage — and seven years as a couple, the Associated Press reports. The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin’ in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest. The decision comes just days after the actress’s 49th birthday, which she and Theroux spent apart. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering alongside pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday. Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends.  [From People]  I mean… again, I’ve been thinking for a while that they were barely even together at this point. He was always in New York or traveling for work. She stayed in LA. Was it all that time apart that ultimately destroyed their marriage? Honestly – and I’m not saying this just to be mean – I never believed they had the most solid foundation in the first place. They got together when he was living with his then-longterm girlfriend Heidi Bivens. He hated the idea of moving to LA, and she pretended to move to New York for a short time to make him happy, but she gave that up. It took forever for them to go through with the wedding, and it was reported in People Magazine that HE was the holdout, that he was always wary of becoming Mr. Jennifer Aniston. I don’t know. It just felt like there was always too much going against them. Anyway, I’m sure we’ll be hearing a lot more in the days, weeks and months to come. So long, bizarre quartz engagement ring!  Update: Here’s the Associated Press’s piece, which includes the statement they made together:  The couple says in a statement released through her publicist Thursday that the decision to split “was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.” The couple says they are making the announcement publicly “in an effort to reduce any further speculation.” “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,” says the statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. “Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.” Aniston and Theroux say they are “two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  In case anyone was wondering if the “Poor Jen” narrative was going to be revived, there’s your answer.

ad8e1352-f190-44ca-9ba7-dc3d7138ea5c,"It’s no secret that former Scientology follower Leah Remini has her sights set on taking down the controversial religion, but in a recent roundtable interview for The Hollywood Reporter, she said it’s her “passion” in life to put an end to it.  According to Remini, many members of her personal team, along with her managers, have tried to dissuade her from talking so frequently on the topic, especially since her show, Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, has taken off.  “Everybody on my team told me not to,” she confessed at the roundtable. “They want me to be an actress. They don’t want me to be known as somebody who does a show about Scientology. I’m like, ‘What am I going to do? Not do it? This is my passion.'”  READ MORE: 7 shocking things we learned from Leah Remini’s Scientology series  “The Church of Scientology has been in the news, but more so for fodder and a headline,” she continued. “What we are trying to do is show that this is a real thing that’s tearing families apart. People really had no idea. It was like, ‘Oh, this is that crazy thing where Tom Cruise is jumping on a couch and everybody believes in aliens?’  “I think that worked for a very long time to sell headlines. But we’re showing how a person actually can get there, and that’s what’s resonating. Also, we’re standing up to a bully and, in a culture where people are feeling apathetic, we’re representing a group of courageous people who are saying, ‘No, I’m going to do something about it.'”  Remini, 46, along with ex-elite Scientologist Mike Rinder, 62, are currently shooting Season 2 of the popular exposé show, which seeks to tell the unheard stories of people who’ve managed to leave the religious organization. Along the way, the viewer gets some insight into Rinder’s and Remini’s experiences as well.  Both of them are now classified by the church as “Suppressive Persons” (SPs) — people who seek to speak ill of Scientology — along with any journalist looking to tell a negative story about the religion. The treatment that befalls SPs is meant to be so unbearable, and in some cases so completely life-ruining, that they’ll cease their crusade to bring down Scientology.  READ MORE: Leah Remini alleges further Scientology abuses for show’s upcoming second season  So far, nothing seems to be stopping Remini.  “It’s not me, that’s the thing… I’m telling their stories,” she said. “When [the production staff and I] leave, they go back to their regular lives, and they’re the ones the church goes after. When we air a show, I go, ‘Just know, within minutes your daughter is going to be saying horrific things about you on the church hate website.’ Literally every single person who has done a story about Scientology has a hate website on them.”  In fact, both Remini and Rinder have such sites dedicated to them — a common technique Scientology uses. The church has made a website titled “Who Is Michael Rinder?” (Here is a page — in the exact same design format as Rinder’s — dedicated to criticizing Remini’s show.) On the site, Rinder is called “a vicious wife beater,” a “deadbeat,” and a “father from hell.” None of those declarations has been proven.  This isn’t really a shocking new fact, since Scientology’s practices have been well documented, but what’s jarring is how far the religious organization will go, and what methodology it’ll use to bring someone down once they’ve “disconnected” from the church. Remini, Rinder and several others recounted on Aftermath how private investigators and other agents affiliated with Scientology would follow them endlessly, try to destroy their careers and even threaten their extended family.  READ MORE: Leah Remini: Tom Cruise could ‘end’ Scientology if he wanted to  Despite the organization’s tactics, Remini is not afraid of whatever repercussions she might personally face.  “Don’t misunderstand me,” she said. “People who know me know that I have a very big mouth, and I have been that way since I was a kid. But I never want to give the organization of Scientology the idea that anybody is scared of them. We are not. And the more they react in the way that they do, it makes me think we’re doing the right thing.”  In Season 1 of Aftermath, viewers saw how hostile Scientology members can be when confronted. In many instances, Remini and Rinder were being tailed; when approached, the alleged stalker either denies it or doesn’t say a word before quickly leaving the scene.  WATCH BELOW: The latest on Scientology  The only thing Remini admits to being scared of is hearing the Scientologists’ stories of abuse and forced separation from family. Every time she gets ready to listen to a story, she says, she’s afraid that it’s going to be worse than she thinks it is — and it often is.  In an incredible show of trust, Remini says she gives out her personal cellphone number to all guests on her show in case they need to get in touch.  Season 2 of Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath is slated for Summer 2017 on A&E.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1083

PHEEEEEWWWW, that would have been too much to handle.Houston – It seems new National Rifle Association President (NRA) president Jim Porter may have found himself in a bit of hot water. Not long ago he made his feelings about the Civil War known when he referred to it as the “War of Northern Aggression.” In that same speech he referred to President Obama as a “fake president” and Attorney General Eric Holder as “rabidly un-American.” However none of those remarks that anyone could deem as racist compare to his remarks made at a recent press conference discussing his new leadership role at the NRA.“I’m very proud to be taking the lead here at the NRA. We need to really buckle down and strap on our best arguments to defend what is our God-given rights. No more northern folk tryin’ take away what is rightfully ours. I will not stand by and let some liberal-elitists try to ruin what has made this country great, especially a liberal of, you know, a different breed.”When asked to clarify Porter said,“I don’t have to clarify. You know gall darn well what I mean. In fact, it’s only a matter of time before we can own colored people again. They sure as hell won’t be our leaders. It’s out-right embarrassing. The War of Northern Aggression made it all possible, and you be best to know it’s all gonna change back. I’ll be on the front lines making sure it happens. I don’t want my grandkids growing up taking orders from a colored man. It’s our God-given right to keep them as property and keep them in line.”Several at the NRA, including vice president Wayne LaPierre, have since tried to distance themselves from Porter’s remarks. LaPierre said, “They brought him in over me to try and liven things up, calling me boring and rehearsed. Next time they’d be better off just making me president.”-- ADVERTISEMENT --It’s still unknown if the NRA and Porter will write an apology and retraction to his comments.

""We're seeing it here, how often he had his arm around her waist, and she would reciprocate with her arm around him,"" Wood explains.  ""That kind of ritualistic habit of touching each other in the same way is very comforting to your partner,"" she continues. ""It says, 'When we're out together, I'm going to always do this...I never want to be more than an arms length away.'""  One thing to keep in mind about Brad is that he is a ""C personality type,"" according to Wood. This means that his facial expressions are more subtle; he tends to smile less in photos or save his smiles for more intimate, private moments.  Getty Images  2000: When they got married.  Notice Jens's smile in this photo. Wood describes it as ""real pleasure,"" which makes a lot of sense considering the photo was taken just months before Brad and Jen's wedding. And despite the space between them—which is a huge indicator of distance in a relationship—Wood says the relationship was in a good place; the pull away must have been due to movement here. We know this because other clues override the separation: the smile on Jen's face, the way their fingers are interlocked, and the placement of their feet.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Feet were very important in Wood's analysis of Brad and Jen. She points out that they often stand on the ""same plane,"" meaning that ""one mate doesn't step forward,"" and that ""this is a couple that is equally balanced in power and affection."" This was not the case in Brad's relationship with Angelina Jolie, who was always several steps ahead of him in all their photos together.  Getty Images  2004: The year before their divorce.  Look at how unusual—and almost awkward—their bodies are positioned in this photo. It's one of the few times we see Brad and Jen not in a mutual touch (think back to the first photo), but rather keeping to themselves by lying their hands flat on their own laps. Also, the fact that Brad's leg is crossed away from Jen is a clue that there is some stress in their relationship.  ""Jen is making all the effort to be seen with him as his mate, as a unit, and as a couple,"" Wood explains. ""She's doing this big lean of her shoulders and a big lean of her head, saying 'We are a couple.'""  Wood, who has studied many photos of Brad and Jen as a couple, says their body language toward the end of their relationship didn't show many signs of a split. But she recalls seeing a photo in 2004 of Brad with Angelina on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and knowing there would be trouble. ""I looked at them on that balcony together and I go, 'She's spider woman, she's gonna get him.' I had never been that strong about a photo read before,"" she says.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux  Splash News  2011: When they first met.  In one of the first photos of Justin and Jen together, we saw him tenderly kissing the side of her head, which Wood says was ""not a top-down kiss,"" meaning it's not the kind of kiss that says, ""You're my child or you're less-than.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This was a meaningful embrace that showed equanimity. Wood points out that they stopped walking down the street to share a moment together, and that's really important in the beginning of a relationship.    Also, notice how Justin and Jen are pressed against each other. This kind of body language ""shows the desire to be closer—to be merged at another level."" There is tension on Jen's face, though Wood said this is not a relationship cue, but likely due to being photographed by the paparazzi.  Getty Images  2015: When they got married.  The newlyweds of three months are pictured in a tight embrace, both leaning toward each other. Jen's got her head on Justin's shoulder, and their bodies are overlapping—often an indicator of nice sexual connection.  Wood says, here, Justin wants to be the strong man, so he's very relaxed and has a solemn expression. She points out that Jen almost has a look of sadness or relief.  ""She's got compressed lips in this photo. It's almost like, 'I can't believe it. I can't believe I have this,'"" Wood says, adding that her expression would make sense at the time, considering they were just married after having been together for four years.  2017: The year before their divorce.  The tension is real in this photo of Justin and Jen, taken seven months before they announced their split. Wood first points out Jen's downward, tight smile which shows ""a bit of wistfulness or sadness, and that she's compressing or withholding. There's something she's keeping inside.""  We can't know for sure if what's making her feel that way is couple-based or not—especially since Justin looks very comfortable and at ease in this photo. Wood says Justin's body orientation—slightly angled toward her, not away from her—shows that he is fine being seen as a couple. And Jen's making the extra effort here (again!) by placing her hand in his lap. So, there were no mutual signals that would point to divorce here.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  Conclusion  In summary: In Brad and Jen's relationship there was a balance of power and affection. Throughout their time together, they were often spotted with arms wrapped around each other in a mutual, comforting way.  Comparing Justin and Jen's relationship, we learned that they were a more sexualized couple. There were many instances of him kissing her forehead or looking into her eyes, which shows there was ""intimacy and heat.""  So, we're left with the ultimate question: Will Jen and Brad get back together? Wood thinks Brad could seek the kind of stability and balance that Jen offered him. Angelina gave him an astonishingly different kind of partnership because she was ""wild,"" and completely opposite of Jen.

There is one specific character meeting that we have been looking forward to, for quite a while now, and in today’s episode, the third episode of Season 7, titled “The Queen’s Justice“, we finally got it.

Now, as we know, Jon Snow is technically Daenerys Targaryen’s nephew, but neither of them know that yet. Jon Snow travels south to Dragonstone, to meet Daenerys, since she summons him, and because Dragonstone has a large supply of Dragonglass, which is something Jon needs to arm his people against the Army of the Dead.

The biggest trend to come out of Korea, these skincare saviours give an instant hit of hydration, with specially formulated serums that quickly penetrate skin for maximum effect. Korean beauty boutiques are lined with hundreds of packets of different masks and women pick and mix to create a library of sheet masks to match every skin type and concern.  Happily, the Award Winning* Charcoal & Willow Bark Tissue Face Mask from Boots Ingredients is somewhat closer to home – it’s in November’s GLOSSYBOX in fact! A no mess sheet mask that helps purify, cleanse and revitalise skin with seriously soothing ingredients – and works in just 15 minutes! If you aren’t already a subscriber order your box here and get your hands on this (as well as four more full-size goodies).  Taking our cue from our Korean counterparts, here’s how to use your masks like a pro…  1. Take the mask out of the packet, unfold it and place it over your face, positioning it so you can see through the holes for your eyes. You can apply it directly to cleansed skin or you can apply a moisturising serum first to boost hydration. Extra points if you dunk the packet into warm water for one minute to allow it to heat up beforehand.  2. Firmly press the mask over the skin to encourage the product to penetrate effectively and ensure that it sits against skin especially around that awkward nose area.  3. After 15 minutes remove the mask, taking time to massage any residue that remains into the skin. You can also sweep the sheet over your throat and decollate (much like you would a serum-saturated cotton wool ball) to get the most of any serum that remains.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,356

Why is he hanging out with all of these gorgeous girls?  Joe Jonas looks like he’s having a blast on the beach! The 28-year-old was spotted surrounded by a group of bikini-clad women on Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia on Feb. 22 — but none of which were Sophie Turner. Don’t worry, though! The girls were just fans of the DNCE frontman, who graciously posed for photos with them on the sunny shoreline. How sweet!  The “Cake By The Ocean” singer went Down Under to shoot the upcoming season of The Voice Australia, which he will be a celebrity coach on, alongside Delta Goodrem, Kelly Rowland, and Boy George. While his fiancée didn’t make the trip, the couple were able to spend some quality time together before Joe’s excursion to the Southern Hemisphere. Earlier this month, the pair enjoyed a romantic getaway to a private island in the Maldives, and then followed up the vacation with a huge celebration in New York City for Sophie’s 22nd birthday on Feb. 21. Joe’s brother Nick Jonas even commemorated the occasion by giving a sweet shout-out to the birthday girl. He shared a photo from Sophie and Joe’s engagement party in Nov. 2017, and captioned the pic that also included Kevin and Frankie Jonas, “Happy Birthday @sophiet You’re super cool! We all think so!” Aww, it’s like she’s already part of the family!  You can also bet that the Game Of Thrones star wouldn’t mind her fiancé posing for photos with a bunch of beauties on the beach. On her birthday, Sophie posted a video to her Instagram story jamming out to “22” by Taylor Swift (as any self-respecting 22-year-old would do on their birthday). As you may remember, Tay and Joe used to be a ~thing~ back in 2008. But clearly, that doesn’t phase the X-Men: Apocalypse star in the slightest — nor should it. Taylor has her own Joe (Alwyn) now, and the Josie star has made it clear there’s no bad blood between them. She even came to the singer’s defense when people on Twitter questioned her inclusion in TIME‘s Person of the Year issue in December. Basically Sophie is the best, and we’re sure Joe knows that!

3f3d06ff-d6cf-4d46-88c2-3d343025f3d5,"Former Dance Moms mentor Abby Lee Miller, who is currently serving her yearlong sentence at FCI Victorville, is reportedly celebrating this year’s holiday in a totally different way.  In an exclusive report by Radar Online, it has been alleged that the 51-year-old choreographer will not participate in the traditional Thanksgiving meal organized for the inmates.  According to the webloid, Abby Lee Miller is going to skip the holiday dinner because of a special visitor that will drop by to discuss something important to her. Apparently, the inmates will gather for the Thanksgiving dinner around 11:00 — the same time when the former Dance Moms star will be in visitation.  An insider revealed to the outlet that their Thanksgiving meal will consist of “dried up turkey, canned cranberry juice, canned corn, green beans, mashed potatoes, one roll with a small pad of butter, one slice of pumpkin pie, and one slice of pecan pie.”  Despite missing out on the meal, Abby Lee Miller will still be allowed to get her share of food once her visitor leaves, it has been claimed.  “Unfortunately, by the time Abby gets her meal, it will be cold,” a source told the gossip site.  Previously, it has been reported that the controversial choreographer has not received any visits at the FCI Victorville in California. According to reports, the ALDC founder has been lonely in the past months, especially with no visitors.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BX_lHnhF8vV/?hl=en&taken-by=therealabbylee  However, the webloid alleged that Abby Lee Miller has been “looking forward to her Thanksgiving visitor for weeks.” There were even claims that the former Dance Moms star has been “primping” herself just for the special visit.  “She had her hair cut and colored for the visitor using commissary-bought hair dye,” the source added. “She’s even paid an inmate to style her hair for her.”  So who is the special visitor? Radar Online claimed that Abby Lee Miller is meeting a book publisher who was approved by the BOP to visit her. Apparently, the Pittsburgh native may have landed a book deal despite being locked up in jail.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BbcrNF_lx8J/?hl=en&taken-by=therealabbylee  The outlet also noted that the celebrity dance instructor already has a ghostwriter that will help pen her book.  “It appears that Abby Lee has a book deal in place,” an insider told the webloid, “But she has not written anything since she’s been locked up and has a ghostwriter penning the book.”  Aside from a ghostwriter, the former Dance Moms star reportedly has someone who manages her social media accounts as evident in her regular posts and updates online. In fact, Abby Lee Miller’s presence is still very much felt on social media despite being in jail for four months now.

5aa7e679-a854-4901-918d-d180d43d6de6,"As Billy Bush sat across from Stephen Colbert on Monday’s Late Show, the audience’s reaction was muted; after a few seconds, their applause could barely be heard. It’s understandable: Bush has been a divisive figure at best since that infamous Access Hollywood tape, on which Donald Trump boasted about groping women while Bush laughed along.  On Sunday, Bush published a New York Times op-ed about the tape, emphasizing its veracity—and saying that he believes the women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, women the White House has broadly branded as liars. Since then, a debate has raged regarding whether Bush should have a second chance in the public eye.  His Late Show audience, at least, didn’t seem fully on board with Bush’s apology tour, remaining largely somber during his appearance—even as Bush once more affirmed the truth of the tape, despite Trump recently suggesting the opposite.  “I would also like to say that’s not me on the bus,” Bush joked to Colbert, before addressing Trump: “You don’t get to say that, because I was there, and the last 14 months of my life I have been dealing with it. You dealt with it for 14 minutes and went on to be the president.”  As powerful men across several industries continue to face allegations of sexual abuse, the idea of a Bush redemption tour might seem unnecessary and, perhaps, even counter-productive. No, Bush’s actions were not criminal; he did not sexually harass or mistreat any women himself. But his laughter on the tape represents, to some, the very culture of abuse that allowed Trump to ascend to the presidency. Why should he be welcomed back to the spotlight?  While Colbert was careful to avoid lobbing too many softballs, he also stopped short of frankly posing that question. He did play a recording of the tape for Bush, who said that it’s still a “gut punch” now to hear himself react the way he did to Trump’s words in 2005. Notably, neither man dared utter the words “locker-room talk” throughout the interview. Still, it was hard not to remember Trump’s dismissive label as Bush said, “I sort of equated what he was saying to some kind of crass stand-up act. Like, you know, an Andrew Dice Clay performance. You figure, well that’s not Dice when he’s home. He doesn’t actually do those things.”  “But the camera wasn’t on him,” Colbert pressed. “Why did it seem like a performance to you?”  “Because he was just regaling the seven guys on there and doing his bit,” Bush said, adding later, “If I had thought there was a man detailing a sexual assault strategy to me, I would have called the F.B.I., not just reported it to my executive producer.”  Bush added that in those days—the early Apprentice era—a lot of people at NBC hung around with Trump, because he was bringing in huge ratings and profits for the network. As Bush put it, “everybody had to sort of kiss the ring, a little bit, of the Donald.”  “And where was he wearing that ring?” Colbert joked.  After a long break for laughter, Bush said that these days, he feels “like I sacrificed a little bit of who I am in the moment,” adding that he hopes the sexual harassment reckoning across various industries continues to advance. Ideally, he said, it will expand to include questions like “how do you talk to boys in peewee hockey locker rooms and teach them that when the conversation gets degrading, how do you either exit the conversation, change the topic, or intervene in some way?”  “There’s a lot that needs to be done on that front,” Bush said. “I hope that we do get there, because I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about it.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,770

Meghan Markle at Christmas 2017 Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock  Meghan joined the royal family for their Christmas celebrations last year, despite it being unusual for non-married partners of senior members of the family to join the Queen for Christmas Day celebrations. Despite being engaged to William, in 2010 Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family. But, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have any family in the U.K. — and clearly Harry will have wanted his new fiancée by his side.  Despite reports that Prince William and Kate Middleton would likely be spending the holiday with Kate’s family in Bucklebury, the couple will be joining the rest of the royal family. They will stay at their nearby home of Anmer Hall with children Prince George, 5, Princess Charlotte, 3, and 8-month-old Prince Louis.

Instead, they brought Prince George and Princess Charlotte to church with Kate’s family in Englefield, England, near her childhood home.  The news comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Doria will not be moving in when Meghan and Harry leave Kensington Palace for their new home at Windsor Castle’s Frogmore Cottage next year.

e44ed247-afdb-4adc-9013-c2abde7b2f8d,"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,370
65eae356-202a-4463-b830-4f3578747758,"There are so many things to love about Halloween: the candy that ends up everywhere, the creepy but adorable decorations all over the place, and the fact that all of your favorite foods suddenly taste like pumpkin. One thing that most people really love about the holiday is the chance to dress up in a costume, to spend a few hours (or different days) as someone you aren't. A lot of Halloween fans love the chance to go all out with the makeup, the clothes, and even the attitude. Because of this, it's easy to forget that not everyone enjoys dressing up — in fact, some people love Halloween, they just don't love wearing costumes. So what are you supposed to do on Halloween if you're an adult who doesn't like dressing up?  Luckily, there are a lot of ways to celebrate Halloween without pretending to be your favorite TV character or movie star. You definitely don't need to be decked out in an expensive outfit you'll probably never wear again, or caking your face in costume makeup in order to be in the spooky spirit of things. After all, that's one of the great things about Halloween - there are so many different ways to celebrate it, and you should definitely embrace all of them.  So, if you're not a fan of Halloween costumes, try doing some of (or all of!) the below activities to have fun this October 31, and all of the days leading up to it.  1 Make Creepy Treats Half-Baked Harvest One fun way to show everyone how much you love Halloween without wearing a costume is to make some fun and spooky Halloween-themed treats. There are elaborate options, like these monster mash cookies from Half-Baked Harvest, or more simple things (like slice and bake cookie dough from the grocery store!). Either way, they'll be delicious, fun to make, and spooky in the best way.  2 Wear Halloween-Inspired Clothing ASOS ASOS Design Curve Halloween Resting Witch Face Shirt, $19, ASOS Even if you don't like wearing a costume, you can still wear Halloween-themed clothing so that you feel like you're still involved (or just for fun, because most things are really cute). There are tons of options out there, from skeleton shirts to scary movie tees to sassy sayings, like this one from ASOS.  3 Tell Ghost Stories Around A Bonfire Giphy Few things are better than sitting around a warm bonfire on a chilly autumn night.

It's a really cute way to celebrate Halloween.  4 Go To A Haunted House Giphy Creep yourself out by heading to a local haunted house. Sure, they can be pricey and you might have to wait on a long line to get in, but they're undeniably fun, and they're a great way to get into the spirit of things.  5 Wear All Black And Dramatic Makeup Giphy You definitely don't need to wear a costume, but if you want to try to wear something that feels appropriate for Oct. 31, then just wear all black (for some reason, that feels Halloweeny) and put on some dramatic makeup. Voila! You're ready to go out.  6 Do A Halloween Inspired Manicure Giphy Even if you don't like Halloween costumes, you might like the idea of Halloween accessories - like a cool manicure.

You can do them yourself if you're skill enough, or ask to get a design done at the nail salon.  7 Have A Scary Movie Marathon Giphy Want to celebrate Halloween without going out and being surrounded by people in costume? Invite some friends over, stay in, and have a scary movie marathon. Watch some corny classics and some new scary films as well.  8 Wear A Halloween Pin Etsy Goth Ghost Brooch, $11.99, Etsy Want to wear something that feels right for Halloween?

b0685b00-8cf3-4387-b06c-332e67dffeae,"After a months-long investigation into claims that he acted inappropriately toward models, including allegations by Kate Upton that he forcibly groped and kissed her, Guess cofounder Paul Marciano is resigning as executive chairman.  Marciano won’t be cutting all ties with the company, which is known for its sex-centric marketing and has helped launch many young models’ careers. He will remain chief creative officer through January 2019, when his contract expires, and then will stay on as a board member, Bloomberg reports.  In a regulatory filing, Guess announced that Marciano had entered into settlements with five people arising out of claims of inappropriate conduct, for a total of $500,000. The settlements, according to the filing, were to avoid litigation costs, and did not represent an admission of “liability or fault.”  The investigators, who according to the filing interviewed 40 people and reviewed some 1.5 million pages of documents, ultimately couldn’t corroborate many of the allegations. ”In some cases, no conclusion could be reached because the individuals either declined to be interviewed or provided insufficient information to the investigators,” the filing states. “And, in other cases, the investigation found that credible accounts were given by both sides.”  What the investigators did conclude was that Marciano “exercised poor judgment in his communications with models and photographers,” and that he had put himself in situations that could—and did—result in “plausible allegations of improper conduct.”  Upton first went public with her allegations in January, joining the #MeToo movement on social media and later giving a detailed account to Time magazine. “After the first day of shooting the Guess Lingerie campaign [on July 25, 2010], Paul Marciano said he wanted to meet with me,” she said. “As soon as I walked in with photographer Yu Tsai, Paul came straight up to me, forcibly grabbed my breasts and started feeling them—playing with them actually. After I pushed him away, he said, ‘I’m making sure they’re real.'”  She said that after she repeatedly rebuffed him, he became hostile toward her, calling her “disgusting” and a “pig” on set and spreading rumors that she was drunk during shoots. Marciano denied Upton’s claims, telling Time that he had never touched her inappropriately, and that he would never “refer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner.” He added that he supports the #MeToo movement, and wouldn’t allow others to defame him. Tsai, the photographer, corroborated Upton’s claims to Time.  When Guess opened its probe into Marciano, he ceased his day-to-day responsibilities at the company, and his pay was suspended. Now that the investigation is over, he will receive his salary again until January 30, according to the filing.  Meanwhile, Guess says that Marciano has begun transitioning his duties to Victor Herrero, who previously took over Marciano’s role as Guess CEO in 2015, while brother Maurice Marciano has been appointed by the board to serve as the company’s new executive chairman.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,583
1f71f495-062d-4988-bd2c-5e9557880545,"Robert Pattinson says he was just kidding around about being asked to perform bestiality in his new movie Good Time.  The actor made the joke Thursday night on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he said he refused his director’s request to act out a very NSFW scene involving a dog. Pattinson’s comments soon went viral, even eliciting praise from the animal rights group PETA, which thanked him for declining to participate.  Now, the actor, 31, is trying to set the record straight. “The story I told on Jimmy Kimmel last night seems to have spiraled out of control,” he said in a statement. “What didn’t come across is that this was supposed to be a joke. No one at all expected or assumed that anything like that would happen on the Good Time set.”  He continued, “We are all huge animal lovers and would obviously never do anything to harm an animal. Everyone involved in Good Time are amazing professionals and have come together to make a movie that I’m extremely proud of. I feel embarrassed that in the moment, I was trying to make Jimmy laugh, only to create confusion and a false impression.”  Pattinson, 31, plays the role of Connie, a New Yorker who will go to all sorts of measures to save his brother and resorts to robbing banks. The actor revealed that his character also happens to have an affinity for dogs, putting Pattinson in a tricky situation on set.  “Oh, God, I don’t know if I can say this. There’s a lot of things in this movie which really cross the line of reality. It’s not even on the line, it’s way beyond the line,” Pattinson said on the talk show. “There was initially this scene — I don’t think I should say this — but it’s like, my character, Connie, has this affinity with dogs. He thinks he is a dog in a previous life and he thinks he has control over animals and stuff.”  A drug dealer then busts into the room where Pattinson’s character is performing a sexual act on the dog.  Aurore Marechal/ABACA/INSTARimages.com  The Twilight star burst into laughter when recounting the scene to Jimmy Kimmel, saying that the “director was like, ‘Just do it for real, man! Don’t be a p–!’ And then the dog’s owner was like, ‘Well, he’s a breeder, I mean, you can.’ He’s like, ‘You just gotta massage the inside of his thighs.’”  In the end they went with a more staged approach.  “I didn’t agree to do the real one, so we made a fake red rocket,” he revealed. “It was fun. It’ll be on the DVD extras.”  “Wow, Hollywood is a great place folks. It really is. If you get a chance to send your kids to film school,” Kimmel teased.

Officers decided to conduct a field sobriety test. However, due to all the paparazzi at the location, officers decided to transfer Mr. Stevenson to Hollywood station,” the LAPD said. “He passed the field sobriety test and was released. He was cited for a minor traffic violation.”  Original story below  Tyga was detained by Los Angeles Police Department officers after leaving Hollywood’s Avenue nightclub in the early hours of Wednesday, April 12. Watch authorities take him into custody in the video above.  According to E! News, police pulled him over for running a stop sign and having no license plates. He spoke with several officers before voluntarily leaving his vehicle. The 27-year-old was then handcuffed and taken to the police station.  The “Rack City” rapper told paparazzi that he was being detained “because I have paper plates,” the website reports. He added that the Mercedes G Wagon he was driving was brand-new and that he “just bought it.” The hip-hop star had posted two Instagram photos flaunting the car earlier that day.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BStmiiODNns/  TMZ reports that he was taken into custody because he was suspected of a possible DUI. After Tyga spent about 90 minutes at the station, he was cleared and released with a traffic ticket.  As Us Weekly reported last week, the musician and his longtime girlfriend Kylie Jenner decided to take a break and give each other a space. After 10 months of living together at the reality star’s $6 million Hidden Hills, California, pad, Tyga moved out.  One issue for the on-off couple of three years: The “Still Got It” rapper was unhappy with his portrayal on Keeping Up With the Kardashians. “Tyga feels he’s been belittled on the show,” an insider told Us. However, “they’re not broken up,” another source added. “They’re just not spending as much time together.”  Meanwhile, the 19-year-old makeup mogul is getting her own spinoff show called Life of Kylie, E! announced on Monday, April 10. The eight-episode series will focus on her entrepreneurial ventures and friendship with BFF Jordyn Woods.

One of six children (and the only daughter), Nancy (Patricia D'Alesandro) Pelosi was born on March 26, 1940, and grew up in Baltimore's Little Italy.2. Pelosi's father, Tommy D'Alesandro, was a legendary Democratic congressman and Baltimore mayor. Her brother Thomas would also go on to become mayor of Baltimore.3. Seemingly, Pelosi was a Democrat from birth—as a young girl, she was offered a toy elephant by a Republican poll worker but recoiled, refusing the toy.4. A devout Catholic, Pelosi attended a Roman Catholic women's college, Trinity College, in Washington, D.C., where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, who was attending Georgetown. They eventually relocated to his hometown, San Francisco.5. Pelosi is mother to five—Nancy Corinne, Christine, Jacqueline, Paul, and Alexandra, all born within six years—and grandmother to five.6. Although active in politics her whole life—including stints as a leading Democratic fundraiser and chairwoman of the party in California—Pelosi didn't run for office until she was 47, preferring to wait until the youngest of her five children was a high school senior before running for Congress in 1987.7. Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman said that she was neither a ""new Democrat"" nor an ""old Democrat"" but a ""prehistoric Democrat."" Other Republicans call her a ""latte Democrat"" for her politically progressive views on the environment, women's reproductive rights, labor unions, and other issues.8. Pelosi has been a formidable force within the Democratic Party, raising more money than any other congressional Democrat–around $100 million since taking the reins of party leadership. And she has managed to keep the House Dems toeing the party line: According to Congressional Quarterly, House Democrats voted with the majority of their party 88 percent of the time in 2005, the highest total since CQ started keeping track in 1956.9. Pelosi learned the art of politics from her father, a practitioner of old-school politics. To practice her penmanship, ""Little Nancy"" was in charge of the book in which her New Deal father kept track of favors done and owed.10. A true San Franciscan, Pelosi makes sure that her office is stocked with Ghirardelli chocolates. Her diet typically consists of mostly chocolate and chocolate ice cream.

b0e74c5d-3d4a-40ea-9c99-6b39474fbfb9,"Diagnosis  There's no specific test for Bell's palsy. Your doctor will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.  Other conditions — such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease and tumors — can also cause facial muscle weakness, mimicking Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your doctor may recommend other tests, including:  Electromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.  This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture.  Treatment  Most people with Bell's palsy recover fully — with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy, but your doctor may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.  Medications  Commonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:  Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started.  such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids are possibly beneficial for some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. However, despite this, valacyclovir (Valtrex) is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.  Physical therapy  Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.  Surgery  In the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.  Rarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems.  Lifestyle and home remedies  Home treatment may include:  Protecting the eye you can't close. Using lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched.

Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles.  Alternative medicine  Although there's little scientific evidence to support the use of alternative medicine for people with Bell's palsy, some people with the condition may benefit from the following:  Acupuncture. Placing thin needles into a specific point in your skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief.

Write down questions you want to ask your doctor.  Preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time with your doctor. For Bell's palsy, some basic questions to ask your doctor include:  What's the most likely cause of my symptoms?  Are there any other possible causes for my symptoms?  What kinds of tests do I need?  Is this condition likely temporary or long lasting?  What treatments are available for Bell's palsy? Which do you recommend?  Are there alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting?

How severe are your symptoms?  What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms?  What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms?  Have any of your relatives ever had Bell's palsy or problems with facial paralysis?  Have you had any symptoms of a more generalized infection?

703dc829-3d95-4cc0-ad17-40dffc1fc741,"Edward Norton’s company is being sued by residents of a building destroyed in a fire last week which tragically killed a firefighter.  On Tuesday, as friends and family attended the funeral of the firefighter killed in the blaze, two residents filed a suit against the actor’s production company, Class 5 Films, and the owner of the apartment building, Vincent Sollazzo-Lampkin, after they claimed the production company knew about the fire that had broken out but did not warn residents.  The company and the building owner are being sued for $7 million, according to court documents obtained by The Blast.  In a statement provided to PEOPLE at the time, the film’s producers said their crew noticed smoke and immediately began alerting the residents of the building.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Our production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,” read the statement. “As soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.”  The production company had not been served with the lawsuit by the deadline, so was unable to comment.  Edward Norton Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  Erica and George Cruz filed the suit claiming the production company kept “highly flammable equipment” in the basement of their Harlem building while filming Motherless Brooklyn. The two also claimed that representatives of Class 5 Films were aware of the fire that broke out on March 22 but did not let residents of the building know.  “When representatives of Class 5, Inc. became aware of the fire, they did not warn the tenants in the building… in fact, they misled the tenants into believing there had been a fire that had been extinguished,” the complaint states.  Sollazzo-Lampkin’s attorney, Geovanny Fernandez, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Cruzes’ apartment building was completely destroyed, causing them to be displaced and lose multiple personal items such as clothes, important documents and the loss of their rent-controlled apartment, their lawsuit says.  The fire allegedly exacerbated Erica’s asthma and caused her severe emotional distress as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and nightmares.  The Cruzes also claim the fire was caused by “reckless, careless and negligent” maintenance of the building such as failing to have fire extinguishers or working smoke detectors.  In a statement provided to PEOPLE at the time, the film’s producers offered “deepest condolences” to the family of Michael R. Davidson, who lost his life.  “Our production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,” read the statement. “As soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

We watched firsthand with astonishment as they charged into the smoke to make sure all were safely out and then fought to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading, putting their lives on the line as they do every day. The FDNY are real-life super-heroes and have our boundless admiration and gratitude.”  New York City firefighters responded to the scene of the massive 5-alarm fire and Michael R. Davidson was killed as he helped to put out the fire.  The 37-year-old father of four was critically injured on the scene and “transported to Harlem Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,” FDNY officials wrote on Facebook early Friday morning.  The site where the fire broke out in Harlem, New York City PacificCoastNews  “It is with deep regret that FDNY announces the death of Firefighter Michael R. Davidson,” they added on Twitter — both social media posts coming with a photo of the late firefighter, who they say was “cited for bravery on four separate occasions.”  Davidson has “bravely served the Department for 15 years” and is “the 1,150th member to make the Supreme Sacrifice while serving our city,” the FDNY wrote.

dda55675-e98e-4b5d-aa7e-435dd04707ca,"Justin Bieber has had his fair share of accidents in public — most of them involving high-profile falls while on tour.  So when the 22-year-old pop star was seen walking down the streets of West Hollywood, Los Angeles on Thursday with a giant wet stain on the crotch of his designer sweatpants, the Internet obviously just assumed Bieber had peed himself. (Yes, #JustinPeeber was a thing.)  But the “Love Yourself” singer has a totally reasonable explanation.  Late in the evening on Thursday, Biebs set the record straight about the source of the stain. “Someone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d— area,” he tweeted.  While most celebrities might have been peed-off about the embarrassing photos, Bieber has a good sense of humor about it.  “Didn’t bother me if it made ya laugh nice!” he added.  Source: Justin Bieber Twitter  He also took to his newly reinstated Instagram to joke about the photos, posting a meme comparing his soaked sweatpants to the wet pants Adam Sandler rocked in Billy Madison.  “You ain’t cool unless you pee your pants,” Bieber wrote — quoting the scene from the 1995, in which Sandler pretends to pee his pants to so that school bullies will stop teasing another kid who actually did pee his pants.  RELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Says the Weeknd’s Music Is ‘Wack’ Following Selena Gomez Romance Rumors  Bieber is apparently a big fan of 1990s comedies. On Valentine’s Day, he quoted 1994’s Dumb and Dumber on his Instagram Story — admitting he didn’t have “Somebody to Love” for the romantic holiday.  “I got no food, I got no job, our pets heads are falling off and I got no Valentine!” he said, adding his own spin to highlight his single status.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,360

4c030279-33cd-481b-9a26-07217a673495,"Like those holographic snakes that periodically go viral on Twitter, eye shadow palettes are simultaneously beautiful and terrifying things. The myriad of matte and metallic shades look stunning, but the thought of getting a selection of them onto lids without looking like a child's art project gone wrong can scare people away from them entirely. Without the right blending, the shadows could end up looking muddy, splotchy, patchy, or harsh. Cringe. The word ""blending"" in and of itself freaks some people out. Trust and believe that there's nothing to be afraid of. Unlike those holographic snakes, eye shadow doesn't have fangs.  I asked a handful of professional makeup artists to demystify eye shadow blending, and I swear blending is easier than it looks with their tips. You don't have to be giving celebrities perfectly diffused smoky eyes all day and all night to master the technique.  Before you do anything, though, don't do anything at all. If you ask Patrick Ta, a professional makeup artist who's worked with Gigi Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski, your eye makeup should be applied before the rest of your makeup. ""I always say to do your eyes first to avoid fall-out from your eye shadows,"" Ta tells Allure. ""If you prefer to do your face first, you can use Shadow Shields to avoid this as well.""  OK, now that we have that out of the way, here are five steps to eye shadow blending.  1. Prime for success.  If you're going to take the time out of your busy day to blend your shadow to perfection, you might as well smooth some eye shadow primer onto your lids to keep everything in place. Amy Strozzi, who's worked with Rowan Blanchard and Aly & AJ, tells Allure, ""I keep it closer to the lash line and fade it as I go upward so I have more flexibility to blend in the crease area."" Then let it dry for at least 10 seconds before moving on to the main event.  Need a primer rec? Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion is always a good choice. Allure editors also love Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  Primer isn't required for pro blending, though. Many makeup artists, like Mario Dedivanovic, would rather skip it. Instead, he prefers to tap leftover foundation or concealer onto lids to give the shadows some grip.  2. Pick your tools.  Depending on which makeup artist you ask, you're going to get a different answer for what the best blending brush is. Regardless, ""flawless eye shadow blending is all about brushes,"" says Giselle Ali, who's worked with SZA and Cynthia Erivo. ""You have to have the right tools for the job. You can never have enough blending brushes, but two is good to start with."" The key is to keep both of these clean. Don't dip these into your eye shadow pans. Instead, use a denser brush like the Best of Beauty Award–winning E.L.F. Beautifully Precise Eyeshadow Brush No. 201 to lay down pigments before blending.  Ta swears by the Anastasia Beverly Hills A12 Small Contour Brush. Ali prefers the Sigma E40 Tapered Blending Brush.  Strozzi, on the other hand, has a completely different list of essentials. For blending powders all over the lid, the M.A.C. 224 Tapered Blending Brush is her ride-or-die. When focusing on the creases, she prefers the Smith Cosmetics 230 Quill Crease Brush. For cream shadows and powders that are on the denser side, she reaches for M.A.C.'s 234 Split Fibre Eye Blending Brush because ""one side is synthetic, which helps apply the product, and the other natural side is great for blending it out,"" she explains.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,713

If you haven’t made your reservations yet, you may be standing for hours at the door come Thursday evening. For us, knowing that Valentine’s Day is the busiest night of the year for restaurants, we have chosen to stay home this year for Valentine’s Day and keep the home-fire burning instead. Think you might want to do the same? If so, then maybe some of these at-home date night ideas may be an inspiration for you as well. After all, the cost is usually cheaper, the atmosphere is often quieter, and the intimacy has no limits…well, unless you still have kids awake. In that case, I’d just send them to bed early with a good book! 😉 Here is to a Happy Valentine’s Day!  Spend the night on the living room floor. Set up the air mattress. Roast marshmallows in the fireplace. Have a picnic dinner on the floor. Make dinner together. Choose the menu and get the ingredients ahead of time, then have fun cooking, taste-testing, and eating together. Have a board game night. Choose a favorite board game and feel free to play the traditional way or with an extra romantic twist. The choice is yours. Watch a romantic movie together. Need some movie ideas? Check out this Top 25 List of Romantic Favorites. Turn your living room into a ballroom. Move the furniture out of the way, turn on the music and dance like prom night all over again. Don’t know how to dance? Rent an instructional DVD from your local library and use the night to learn together! Read a book together. It could be something as romantic as a book on marriage or a silly as a favorite picture book from your childhood. Set the mood. Think candles. Think flowers. Think multiple-courses or fondue. What would you expect to see and taste at a fancy restaurant? Try to recreate that atmosphere around your own dining table. For extra gusto you may even want to dress up in your finest attire. Woowee! Revel in wedding day memories. This one will probably mean more to us girls than our hubbies but looking at old wedding albums or watching our wedding video is a great way to rekindle the fires. Enjoy hot chocolate/tea/coffee on the back porch together. There’s nothing like sitting together in the peace and enjoyment of God’s creation to build a deeper level of communication. Get your sport on. While it may not sound very romantic to start, playing soccer in the backyard or a round of H.O.R.S.E. in front of the basketball goal does wonders for relationships. Give each other a massage. Play a video game together. I remember when Goose and I used to do this when we were first married. We loved it. I think this may be one of our choices for Thursday, no doubt! Create a campfire in the backyard or light up the grill. Roast hot dogs, wrap up in a warm blanket and just enjoy watching the fire burn. Go star gazing. Put a blanket on the ground or wrap up in sleeping bags in your backyard and just enjoy gazing at the stars. Go back and read your journals, letters, and memos from when you were dating. Have a karaoke night. Get out your favorite romantic songs and have fun lip-syncing to each other. Have a Nerf gun war. I mean seriously, how fun would it be to sneak around the house in the dark (so as not to wake up the kids) and then shoot each other?! Ha! I may have to add this one too! Order in. Have pizza or Chinese delivered but be sure to use the chopsticks Have a spa night. Think bubble bath…foot massages…the works! Put a puzzle together, then glue and frame it.  Create sugar cookies. Bake them. Decorate them. And eat them. For an added Valentine’s Day flare you could even write your own little sweetheart messages on top and exchange them. Read Song of Solomon together. Write your lifelong bucket list together. Look through your old high school yearbooks or baby photo albums together. Get artistic. Try drawing or painting each other’s portraits and then framing them! Make a list of all the places you want to visit together were money no limit. Do Mad Libs together. Create a blueprint of your dream house. Have a staring contest. Sit on the couch, hold hands, and stare each other in the eye. The first one who looks away has to do whatever the other one asks of him or her! Have a dessert cook-off. Each of you find a new dessert recipe you’d like to try, bake them side-by-side in the kitchen, and then taste test them both to see which you like better! Write a gratitude list together. Make a list of everything you are thankful for as a couple and then tell God about it! Make a video for your kids telling them about how you met! Take your hubby on a love scavenger hunt. Play with your kid’s toys after they go to bed. Seriously, how long has it been since you’ve built a Lego castle? Have dinner on your roof. Talk about something you’d never forget. Make sure the roofline isn’t too steep though. Play 50 questions. Write out 25 questions each and then ask them to each other.

Katy Perry, 33, may have kissed a girl, but now she’s allegedly kissing Robert Pattinson, 31, and we think she likes it! Following their romantic dinner date at Taix French Restaurant on Jan. 26, Katy is ready to make things official. “Katy and Rob have been great friends for a long time and they have both considered at different times to become a couple, but timing was never on their sides. They both had their own dating lives to work with, which would never allow them to get together. And now they talk and flirt all the time and Katy would dive into a relationship with Rob in seconds, but she feels she is in Rob’s friend zone. And she is right because Rob is scared to pull the trigger because he doesn’t want to get into a full relationship with the possibility to make things complicated and maybe end up losing a life-long friend if they were to break up,” a source close to Katy tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY!  We totally understand Robert wanting to take things slow. After all, he just got out of a 3-year relationship with FKA Twigs, 30. Robert and FKA were engaged, but decided to call it off due to their busy careers and schedules. Despite this, we think Robert and Katy would make a great couple since there is already so much history! “All it takes is one night, one spark, one moment. Rob knows it is there, Katy knows it is there. They just have to be on the same page and just let it happen. But that is easier said then done. But to say that there is a chance for them to make something more out of their great friendship is more likely to happen then anything else. The year just started and there is always another chance tomorrow,” our source continued.  Katy has also had her fair share of serious relationships. Back in 2010, Katy married British comedian Russell Brand, 42. Their marriage seemed like it would be a forever thing, but they divorced in 2012. Katy has also been romantically linked to John Mayer, 40, Calvin Harris, 34, and recently Orlando Bloom, 41. After one year together, Katy and Orlando went their separate ways, but they’ve remained extremely friendly ever since. If Katy and Robert do become serious, we can only hope they’re in it for the long haul.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Robert Pattinson and Katy Perry should make their relationship official?

0ddf4c9b-20ba-49b4-846e-4a16bf9a0d38,"Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge welcomed the newest addition to the Royal Family on Monday. Now, Will and Kate Middleton have announced what the baby boy’s name is.  The royal baby name is Louis Arthur Charles, Kensington Palace announced on Twitter Friday. His royal title will be His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.  While the royal baby name odds on Louis were 33/1 could make it appear to be a surprising choice, the names Louis, Arthur and Charles have significance within the royal family. Louis was the name of Prince Phillip’s grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, as well as Prince Charles’ great-uncle Earl Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. Louis is also a middle name for both Prince William and Prince George.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son. Kirsty O'Connor - PA Images—PA Images via Getty Images  As for Prince Louis’ middle names, Arthur was a middle name of Queen Elizabeth’s late father King George VI and is a middle name to both William and Prince Charles. Arthur of course also brings to mind King Arthur (though experts say there’s no evidence of any actual historical king behind the famous Arthurian legends).  Prince Louis shares his third name, Charles, with his grandfather, Prince Charles.  Louis Arthur Charles is the third child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who welcomed a son, Prince George, in 2013 and a daughter, Princess Charlotte, in 2015.  Ahead of Louis Arthur Charles’s birth, the couple announced via the official Kensington Palace Twitter account that Middleton was expecting in September 2017, but opted not to reveal the baby’s gender (something they had done with their previous two children) ahead of the birth.

According to legal documents submitted on September 1 and obtained by RadarOnline, Doris Davidson — the mother of Evans’ ex Nathan Griffith — has filed for emergency temporary custody of Evans’ and Griffith’s 3-year-old son, Kaiser.  Celebrity Babies of 2017  The documents claim that Evans’ 9-month-old daughter, Ensley Eason, tested positive for marijuana at the time of her birth in January 2017. Davidson claims that DSS investigated and found that both Evans and her fiancé, David Eason — with whom she shares Ensley — had marijuana in their system.  Davidson also claimed that she has seen unusual bruises and marks on Kaiser on “several occasions” and alleged that Eason has used “inappropriate and excessive discipline” on her grandson, which included spanking the child with harsh force. In the documents, it was stated that Kaiser told his grandmother, “Nana, David punched me,” making motions of being hit in the face.  The documents also allege that Evans, 25, has harassed Davidson with nasty text messages and the reality TV star has “sporadic mood swings where she screams and curses.”  Evans — who has bitterly battled with her mom, Barbara, over custody of her oldest son, Jace — released a statement to E! News in which she stated, “Our lawyers are talking today. Doris made accusations but I can tell you that Barbara has a lot to do with them … Doris threw her own son under the bus by admitting that he has pending felonies and possibly on drugs. Her emergency filing was against me and Nathan Both … I can tell you that they are allegations, mostly driven by my mom. Our lawyers are working out a new agreement.”  Indeed, the documents indicate that Barbara expressed her concern over Kaiser’s well-being and she referenced an incident in May in which both Kaiser and Jace, 8 — whom Barbara has custody of — were locked out of the house on a particularly hot day.  Davidson has asked a judge to test Evans’ hair follicles for drugs and also force her to undergo a psychological evaluation.  The Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teen Mom author exclusively revealed to Us Weekly that her mother won’t be attending her September 23 wedding to Eason due to their ongoing battle over Jace. “I can’t forgive someone that’s just not going to give me back my son, so, and it’s still going on. It hasn’t been resolved,” she told Us in August. “And if I had custody of him now maybe I would have invited her, but I’m not at the moment.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

Then, Kristen landed the role of Snow White in Snow White and the Huntsman, directed by Rupert Sanders - And we all know how that turned out!  Lucky for Rob, his new gal pal also seems to shun the spotlight.  ""He's been taking her on dates for the last month or so, and has even flown her out to stay with him in New York. He also loves going to her gigs,"" a source told UK newspaper The Sun.  ""The main thing for Tahliah is that the relationship remains low key. She wants to be known for her music, not just as 'Robert Pattinson's girlfriend'.  Then, for reasons unknown to us, the source adds,""[FKA's] worried about being bogged down by constant comparisons to Kristen.""  Miss Twigs is an English singer-songwriter who loves bright colors, unique clothes, and crazy and innovative hair and makeup looks. She worked as a backup dancer for the likes of Kylie Minogue, Ed Sheeran, and Taio Cruz for years before she started seriously pursuing her singing career. She is supposedly dating Robert Pattison.  Kristen Stewart is an American who loves jeans, canvas sneakers, and a good clean fresh face. She has always been a very serious, and very good, actress, highly in demand since her breakthrough role in Panic Room alongside Jodie Foster almost 20 years ago. She is definitely not dating Robert Pattinson.  This clearly proves that even if someone wanted to make a comparison between these girls, they would be very hard-pressed to come up with something, save their fondness for Robby.  In addition, this also proves that everyone's favorite sparkly vampire most definitely does not have a ""type.""",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,552
43627ecb-634e-489f-b133-590fb3d7f2d5,"Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had quite the day. May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Harry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  In case you need a reminder of the striking Givenchy design Markle wore earlier in the day, here it is in all its royal-wedding glory:  Getty Images  Anyway, here's hoping the newlywed couple has a happy reception party at Frogmore House, the name of which I cannot stop saying in my head.

26e19a16-c416-49f1-a936-82cc7739000b,"A fortune in the bank, a beautiful wife and a booming film career are not enough to make Brad Pitt happy.  In an extraordinary interview which recalls a doleful rant by his wife Jennifer Aniston earlier this year, the 37-year- old actor says he feels oppressed by fame and has come close to a nervous breakdown.  The star of Fight Club and Seven tells the magazine Vanity Fair he is bored with movies and acting and looks forward to retiring from Hollywood in five to seven years.  Pitt says he spent 18 months in therapy after hitting a psychological barrier. 'I crashed and burned so I wanted to understand how I operate. I came from a place where you had to be crazy to go to a crazy doctor, and my background is very few words.'  In a reference to the singer who spent several weeks in hospital after a breakdown this summer, he adds: 'I've thought about pulling a Mariah Carey but I know too much now.'  Interviewed by Vanity Fair in April, Friends star Miss Aniston said the year in which she married Pitt had been the hardest year of her life and she was dogged by 'low self esteem' and a 'sense of shame'.  Her husband talks in a similar vein about the 'sickness' of his life.  He says: 'The thing with our marriage was that there was an opening in the Hollywood couple slot and unfortunately we've fallen into it, which I don't like very much.  'I don't like throwing us into this box. It doesn't leave us room to be human, to make our mistakes and have our struggles, because that will just be another story, a whole new other life for the rags.'  Like so many before him, Pitt complains he is public property and unable to conduct a normal life.  'We are treated as special. We get away with things that other people can't. And you start to believe the lie that you are special, that you're better than other people.  'You start demanding that kind of treatment. Most of the time I fight it because I know I'm going to get older and it's going to go away but at times I succumb to it.  'I'll tell you truthfully I am completely bored with myself in films. It's time for me to try either a new direction or new horizons.  'I have other interests I want to pursue that mean more to me.  'I find myself looking forward to a family.  'It's not that I'm self absorbed. Anything that's going to take the focus off myself, I welcome.'",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,501

00263c6d-4372-4759-8308-ec95338f17a6,"I had a panic attack the other day at work. When I felt the panic start, I grabbed my things and went straight to the toilet and sat hyperventilating on the floor. I didn’t leave that room for about 40 mins. It was horrible. It was brought on by a day that ended up being more stressful than I anticipated.  It was a day I had been looking forward to because I was attending a meeting related to Inclusion and Diversity at work, and in those meetings I often feel safer than I do in any other meeting. However, as the meeting went on, I realised that just because I am in a meeting related to inclusion, doesn’t mean that I will feel completely welcome or accepted. There was one person in particular that responded to me in a way that made me feel more unwelcome than the others.  I feel like I have to stand up for injustice and unfairness at work and in daily life. I feel like I have to be the one to say, this is not right and why should we put up with this unacceptable behaviour anymore? The problem is, I am just not resilient enough to cope with it all yet. I struggle to be one of the only voices in the room stating that something is unfair. I am struggling to be the one that is constantly challenging the norm and then being challenged for highlighting what is unfair.  What everyone needs to keep in mind when it comes to promoting Inclusion and Diversity, is that often those that volunteer their time to support initiatives supporting inclusion, are doing it because they have gone through something themselves. Those volunteers know what it is like to be treated differently and have lived through adversity.  Leaders within an organisation have to recognise that the volunteers who care about inclusion and diversity are often from a vulnerable minority group, despite what they can see on the surface. People may look at me and see a confident young white woman with her career before her (I hope I do, although I fear I may have stunted my career due to my involvement in Inclusion and Diversity) and they potentially think that I am simply an advocate for diversity as a young white woman I can’t possibly have had to deal with any issues? Could I?  What people do not see is that on a daily basis I am battling with mental health issues that I have had to manage for the past 10 years. According to some, I would be considered disabled. I admit that my issues have occasionally held me back and prevent me from living the way others do. I am probably still in denial that I am disabled, so I will discuss this another day when I can face it and share it with you. All you need to know for now is that I have an anxiety disorder that sometimes prevents me from living a completely free and relaxed life.  As a woman, I have to deal with daily micro aggressions, as people are now calling them, which are seemingly banal issues but if you pile them up over time have a huge impact on women. For example, at work I am constantly talked over, or what I am said is heard, but then repeated by a man, who then gets acknowledged for it, I have to put up with regular mansplaining, when men feel that they need to tell me what to do and tell me in an incredibly patronising way how I should do something. Outside of work, I have to put up with regular harassment in the streets, men heckling me with inappropriate comments, which causes me considerable amounts of anxiety, as said in another post.  Leaders and managers have an obligation to support those that speak up in the work place, whether they agree or not with the statement or whether or not they think someone is speaking from experience or not, as it takes great courage to say the unpopular thing. Often those that do speak up, have a traumatic history that they do not want others to experience. Also, leaders have to appreciate that it will come at a great cost for those volunteers to speak up, as often those who speak up will see their career progression suffer as a result or will experience mental health issues due to the stress of going against the grain. In my case, my mental health has worsened as a result of standing up.  I am going on about leaders because the other day, I was not supported by a leader when I rightly spoke up about something that was clearly wrong. I don’t want to go into the details, but I was really shaken by it. I felt let down by someone who I thought was supportive. I felt quite deflated by the situation and feel I have lost an ally.  I may have never had the ally to begin with. This person perhaps never saw the need to support me. Would they see the need if I gave them an explanation of what I have seen? I am not sure. I like to think they would. The fact is, I can’t and shouldn’t always explain that I am a member of a vulnerable group and therefore should be treated with more respect or treated more carefully than others. We should treat everyone with respect. We should treat everyone with kindness. We should be listening to everyone without judgement or bias.  I live in a world of shoulds and it is tiring me out. I need to stop thinking about the shoulds and just accept reality for what it is. If I can accept that I will probably always be the one speaking up, the one saying the unpopular thing, then I will learn to be more resilient. I will learn to be ready for adversity. I won’t be on the defensive, I will just be prepared to feel alone in a room full of people.  Prepared to be the target and prepared to be the fighter.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1132

35e302b9-21f9-4eeb-b0e6-190b51903217,"With House of Cards returning for its final season without its former star, Kevin Spacey, many fans are looking for closure. But they're unlikely to find it in Robin Wright's statement on Kevin Spacey. In a new interview with TODAY, the actor spoke at length on the subject of Spacey's firing, but added no new information. Wright claimed that she was ""surprised"" by the allegations against her former costar, insisting that even after five years of sharing the screen, she ""never knew the man.""  Wright broke her silence during a TODAY segment on Monday, in which Wright spoke with Savannah Guthrie about her perspective on Spacey's departure from the series. ""I think we were all surprised, of course, and ultimately saddened,"" she shared, adding, "" [but] we forged ahead, and we were so thankful that we were able to complete the series as planned."" She's referring, of course, to the allegations of sexual harassment and assault brought against Spacey late last year that led to his termination from the Netflix series, leaving the fate of House of Cards uncertain until the decision was made for Claire Underwood to helm the final season.  Spacey has faced multiple claims of sexual assault and harassment, most publicly by Anthony Rapp, who accused Spacey of assaulting him when the former was just a teenager. Spacey has denied those claims and others, saying in a statement that he had no memory of the incident, but ""if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.""  In her recent interview, Wright insisted that she never personally experienced any of this kind of behavior from her co-star, saying that the two were not friends outside of work. ""I didn't really — I didn't know the man. I knew the incredible craftsman that he is,"" she said. As for her own experience with the actor on set, Wright said it was always professional:  ""We were coworkers, really, we weren't — we never socialized outside of work. [It was a] respectful, professional relationship. He was so great with me, and was never disrespectful to me. So, that's my personal experience. That's the only thing I feel that I have the right to talk about.""  While it's refreshing that Wright doesn't wish to speak for someone else's experience, it's interesting to note that all her commentary about Spacey was positive. She distances herself from her former costar, but uses words like ""respectful,"" ""great,"" and ""professional"" to characterize him.  Even when prodded by Guthrie, Wright wouldn't go so far as to say that Netflix had made the right decision in cutting Spacey loose. ""I don't know how to comment on that,"" she said, continuing:  ""But I think at that time, the shock was so intense all over the nation, for many reasons, many stories, many people — I think that everybody felt that it was respectful to back off.""  Netflix on YouTube  Fans will likely never know what actually happened, or who knew — or suspected — what and when. But, as Wright points out, viewers can at least be happy that the remaining cast and crew continued on with the show to give audiences one last season.

5015d38e-5c21-4395-b585-a41a965059ea,"The MTV Movie & TV Awards has always been known for its star-studded attendees and hilariously shocking moments. With the 2018 awards show just around the corner, we’re looking back at some of the best.  From Sacha Baron Cohen arriving from the heavens like an angel, to that iconic Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling Notebook-esque kiss, to Emma Watson winning the first ever non-gendered acting award, here are some of our favourite moments from MTV Movie & TV Awards over the years.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams recreate their iconic kiss from The Notebook  In one of the most iconic moments in possibly all awards show history ever, nothing compares to Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams both on- and off-screen chemistry when they recreated their famous rain kiss from The Notebook while accepting Best Kiss during the 2005 show. Making our teenage hearts swoon, Ryan and Rachel 4eva.  That Scarlett Johansson and Sandra Bullock lip-lock  As it turns out, Britney Spears isn’t the only artist to show her love for a fellow star as award winner Sandra Bullock followed in her MTV stage footsteps, planting a smooch on presenter Scarlett Johansson back in 2010.  Emma Watson winning the first non-gendered acting award  At last year’s show, non-binary actor Asia Kate Dillon made history last year when she presented Emma Watson with the first-ever non-gendered acting award for her role as Belle in Disney’s live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast.  Sacha Baron Cohen flew across the audience as an angel and landed on an unimpressed Eminem  In true Bruno fashion, Sacha Baron Cohen might have taken things a little too far at the 2009 awards when he flew across the audience as an angel before descending on rapper Eminem butt-first. The rapper stormed off leaving a string of expletives in his wake only to later reveal that he was in on the joke (he could have fooled us).  Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson’s missed kisses  At the 2011 MTV Movie & TV Awards, Kristin Stewart and Robert Pattinson won their third consecutive Best Kiss award. Fondly remembering their missed kisses after winning the award in 2009 and 2010, viewers thought (and hoped) by 2011 the duo would finally seal the deal. Instead, Pattinson ran into the audience for a lip-lock with their Twilight third wheel Taylor Lautner.  Adam Devine parodies Beauty and the Beast with Hailee Steinfeld  MTV’s golden popcorn doesn’t have quite the same recognition as a golden statue, but those award ceremonies aren’t filled with nearly as many fun and memorable moments. Case in point, last year’s opening musical number which saw host Adam Devine parody Disney’s Beauty and the Beast with singer/actress Hailee Steinfeld.  Jennifer Lopez and Tom Cruise—dressed as Tropic Thunder’s Les Grossman—perform together  In one of the most unexpected moments, Tom Cruise made an appearance at the 2010 awards show as his obnoxious Tropic Thunder character Les Grossman. Cruise joined JLo on stage for her hit “Get Right” in a hilariously raunchy performance. Who knew Tommy Boy could dance like that.  When Lindsay Lohan hosted the 2005 award show  After all these years, we’ve always held out for Lindsay Lohan. Hot off the success of Mean Girls and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Lohan hosted the 2005 MTV Movie & TV Awards where she surprisingly broke out into a choreographed dance routine during the show—back in the day when musical numbers weren’t award show staples.  Rita Ora ripping off Zac Efron’s shirt  Boundaries aren’t a thing at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. This was most evident at the 2014 show when Rita Ora made like a Magic Mike extra and ripped off Zac Efron’s shirt. But, to be fair, you can’t really win an award for Best Shirtless Performance with a shirt on…  Seth Rogan and James Franco pulled out a joint while promoting Pineapple Express  In 2008, Seth Rogen and James Franco puff-puff-passed a blunt on the MTV Movie & TV Awards stage while promoting Pineapple Express.

cc532d76-2c91-4971-a666-eea408bb5c42,"The first televised Christmas Message, broadcast in 1957  The Queen's Christmas Message (also known as The King's Christmas Message in the reign of a male monarch, formally as Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech[1]) is a broadcast made by the sovereign of the Commonwealth realms to the Commonwealth of Nations each Christmas. The tradition began in 1932 with a radio broadcast by King George V on the British Broadcasting Corporation's Empire Service. Since 1952, the message has been read by Elizabeth II; today, it is broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet via various providers.  History [ edit ]  The idea for a Christmas message from the sovereign to the British Empire was first proposed by the ""founding father"" of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), John Reith, in 1922 when he approached King George V about making a short broadcast on the newly created radio service. The King declined, however, believing that radio was mainly an entertainment.[2] Reith approached the King again ten years later, in 1932,[3] as a way to inaugurate the Empire Service (now the World Service) and the King finally agreed after being encouraged to do so by Queen Mary[2] and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.[4] That year, George V read the first Royal Christmas Message; the King was originally hesitant about using the relatively untested medium of radio, but was reassured after a summertime visit to the BBC and agreed to carry out the concept and read the speech from a temporary studio set up at Sandringham House.[5] The broadcast was introduced from Ilmington Manor by 65-year-old Walton Handy, a local shepherd, with carols from the church choir and the bells ringing from the town church, and reached an estimated 20 million people in Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, South Africa, and the UK.[5]  While his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated just before his first Christmas as king, George VI continued his father's Christmas broadcasts; it was in his reading delivered in the opening stages of the Second World War that he uttered the famous lines: ""I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year.""[6]  For many years, the King's speech came at the end of an hour-long broadcast of greeting from various parts of the British Empire and Commonwealth which typically included interviews with ordinary people of many occupations such as an innkeeper in an English village, a minder in South Africa, and a lifeguard in Australia with the King's speech serving as a bond tying the Commonwealth together.[2]  George's daughter, Elizabeth II, gave her first Christmas message to the Commonwealth of Nations from her study at Sandringham House, at 3:07 PM on 25 December 1952, some 11 months after her father's death. By 1957, the broadcast became televised,[7] and, from then until 1996, was produced by the BBC; only in 1969 was no message given because a special documentary film – Royal Family – had been made during the summer in connection with the Investiture of the Prince of Wales. It was therefore decided not to do a broadcast at Christmas, but the Queen issued a written message instead.  The Queen ended this monopoly, however, announcing that the message would, from 1997, be produced and broadcast alternately by the BBC and its main rival, Independent Television News (ITN), with a biennial rotation.[8] It was reported by The Daily Telegraph that this decision was made after the BBC decided to screen an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, on its current affairs programme Panorama.[9] This was denied by Buckingham Palace which said the new arrangements ""reflect the composition of the television and radio industries today"".[10] Beginning in 2011, Sky News was added to the rotation.[10]  Sky News recorded the Queen's Christmas message for Christmas 2012, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, and for the first time it has been recorded in 3D.[11] Buckingham Palace are reported to have explained: ""We wanted to do something a bit different and special in this Jubilee year, so doing it for the first time in 3D seemed a good thing, technology wise, to do.""[11]  The themes and direction of the speech are decided by the Queen and the text is largely written by the Queen herself, sometimes with assistance by Prince Philip and her staff. In recent years, the speech has become more personal and religious in tone.[12]  Broadcast [ edit ]  The message typically combines a chronicle of that year's major events, with specific focus on the British Empire originally and later the Commonwealth of Nations, with the sovereign's own personal milestones and feelings on Christmas. It is one of the few instances when the sovereign speaks publicly without advice from any ministers of the Crown in any of the monarch's realms. Planning for each year's address begins months earlier, when the monarch establishes a theme and appropriate archival footage is collected and assembled; the actual speech is recorded a few days prior to Christmas.[5]  In the United Kingdom and on the Internet, broadcast of the Queen's Christmas message is embargoed until 15:00 GMT on 25 December. In other parts of the Commonwealth, the message is first broadcast in New Zealand at 18:06 local time by Radio New Zealand on RNZ National, then again at 18:50 by Television New Zealand on TVNZ1, in Australia by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation at 15:20 local time, and in Canada by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation at noon local time on television, 15:50 local time on CBC Radio One and 11:50 on CBC Radio Two.  Outside of the Commonwealth, C-SPAN in the United States also first airs the broadcast at around 10:00 AM EST, around the same time the broadcast is made available to the public.  Messages [ edit ]  1930s [ edit ]  1940s [ edit ]  1950s [ edit ]  1960s [ edit ]  1970s [ edit ]  1980s [ edit ]  1990s [ edit ]  2000s [ edit ]  2010s [ edit ]  Similar messages elsewhere [ edit ]  In 1931, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands delivered her first Christmas message on the airwaves, which was also broadcast to the Dutch East Indies, Suriname and the other Dutch West Indies via shortwave radio station PCJJ. During the reign of her daughter Juliana, the Royal Christmas Message was to become an annual tradition.[137]  The Pope delivers a Christmas message to the world and heads of state of other countries have adopted the tradition of a message at Christmas, including the King of Sweden, the King of the Belgians, the President of Germany, and the King of Spain.  Others have modified the practice by issuing a statement to coincide with the New Year; this is done by the Governors-General of Canada and New Zealand, the Queen of Denmark, the King of Norway, the King of Thailand, the Presidents of China, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, the Philippines, Poland, and the Russian Federation, as well as the Chancellor of Germany. The Archbishop of Canterbury, spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion, also gives a New Year's Day speech.  The Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia makes speeches on his birthday in June and on National Heroes Day in July, while the Prime Minister of Malaysia also makes speeches not only on New Year's Day but also on the night of Eid ul-Fitr and on the eve of Independence Day. The Prime Minister of Singapore gives his speech on this occasion and on the National Day of Singapore. In the past, the Governor of Hong Kong, as the representative of the British monarch, played this role; the tradition was carried on by the Chief Executive upon the territory's handover to China in 1997.  The President of the United States also give out Christmas messages as part of the President's Weekly Address. Some of these messages come out within a few days before Christmas or on Christmas Day. The opposition party may also give out their Christmas messages as part of their response to the President's weekly address. In addition, beginning in 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet Union President Mikhail Gorbachev exchanged televised New Year's Day addresses to the other's respective nations. This exchange continued between President George H. W. Bush and Gorbachev until the demise of the Soviet Union.

f62c9f80-b2e3-40a7-b240-69d80d09910b,"‘Smallville’ star Allison Mack has confessed that she sold children to the Rothschilds and Clintons during her time in the child sex cult.According to police, Allison Mack worked in a senior management position for the Hollywood pedophile cult NXIVM. As second-in-command, it was her job to lure children into the cult in order to sell them to elite Hollywood pedophiles and powerful politicians.Thefreethoughtproject.com reports: “As alleged in the indictment, Allison Mack recruited women to join what was purported to be a female mentorship group that was, in fact, created and led by Keith Raniere. The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue said in a statement.The cult was finally exposed when the daughter of former Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg became a member. Oxenberg told the New York Times that she became concerned after she saw that her 26-year-old daughter India was extremely emaciated from dieting, and was suffering from serious health problems.“Some people have said this is a voluntary sorority. The women I have spoken to tell a far different story,” Oxenberg said. “Coercion is not voluntary. Extortion is not voluntary. Blackmail is not voluntary.”When these accusations hit the news, other women, including actress Sarah Edmondson, came forward to all to tell the same story, of the blackmail, the branding, as well as the forced labor and forced sexual activity.Raniere is also accused of having a history of pedophilia, with accusations that stretch back over 20 years, involving girls as young as 12.In 2012, several women were interviewed by the Albany Times Union about the coercive sexual experiences that they had with Raniere when they were young girls. One of the women in the case was found dead of a gunshot wound before she was able to give the interview. Her death was ruled a suicide.The U.S. attorney’s office requested to have Raniere held without bail in a letter to the court stating that he was a known child predator.Although this extremely important detail is being left out of most mainstream reports, one of the main charges in the criminal indictment against Raniere and Mack is sex trafficking of children.A quick search for Allison Mack’s arrest report or charges—as reported by the mainstream media—will not yield any mention of children. Most mainstream reports only mention sex trafficking and ominously omit that the charges were for sex trafficking of children. Exactly why the media is refusing to report this remains a mystery.Another important aspect of this case that has been largely overlooked, is the connections that this organization has to high-level figures in politics and finance. The organization worked much like a pyramid scheme, collecting regular fees from its members. But the majority of the funding, over $150 million, came from the trust funds of Seagram heiresses, Sara and Clare Bronfman.Their involvement with Raniere began in 2002 and has been very public and controversial, with other members of the Bronfman family distancing themselves from the sisters in the press. The Bronfman family has very close ties to the Rothschild banking dynasty, with members of both families belonging to many of the same companies, including their joint financial firm, Bronfman & Rothschild.Additionally, at least three high-ranking members of the organization, including Nancy Salzman and the Bronfman sisters, are members of Bill Clinton’s foundation, the Clinton Global Initiative, which requires an annual $15,000 membership fee.Now that Raniere is in jail and Mack is on bail and ordered not to have any contact with other cult members, Clare Bronfman has taken on the role of leader within the organization.In response to the recent controversy surrounding NXIVM, Bronfman made a statement on her website denying the accusations against Raniere. She praised Raniere and the NXIVM programs, insisting that she is doing work that is truly helping people, and that no one has ever been coerced as a part of their workshops.Frank Parlato, a former NXIVM publicist-turned-whistleblower told the New York Post that Bronfman is among the harshest leaders in the organization.“She’s the enforcer—the brutal one. Clare’s running the [operation] now, and she’s the most ruthless of them. I’m issuing an absolute warning now. Clare Bronfman is a true fanatic, and if there’s a Jim Jones situation, everyone will commit suicide but her.” Parlato said.Of Allison Mack, Parlato said that she was a troubled woman, who was both a victim and an abuser.“Mack was both a victim and a victimizer. She was both a mastermind and Raniere’s useful idiot. She started as a slave and she became a slave master. Her nickname among defectors is ‘Pimp Mack,‘” Parlato said.It is highly possible that this is a position that Mack was groomed for since she was a child, as many childhood stars turn from victims to predators as a result of what they often experience behind the scenes in the industry. Oddly enough, one of Mack’s very first roles was in a softcore porn movie called “Night Eyes Three.” She was just 11 years old at the time.Below you can see the full charges against Mack and Raniere here.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,960

c872f96d-5f97-4677-9d8c-2dea8cdebf8b,"The newly wedded Duchess of Sussex Meghan has joined Her Royal Highness Queen Elizabeth II at a series of events as she launched into life as a full-time royal.  ROYAL aides are said to be concerned over the public outbursts of Meghan Markle’s dad, following a number of explosive TV interviews in recent months.  According to the Mirror in the UK, aides at the Palace have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop Thomas Markle upsetting his daughter.  It comes after the 74-year-old claimed the Duchess is “terrified” of her new royal role and, royal insiders say, “crossed the line” with his comments that Princess Diana would have “loathed” how he had been frozen out of the royal circle, reports The Sun.  The Mirror also claims that the matter has gotten so out of hand that royal sources say the only way to end the farce will be for the Queen to step in.  Sources suggest the talks have centred around three potential options to bring the situation to a close.  The first would be for Meghan to talk directly to her father via a phone call in a personal appeal for him to stop, and a second could be to arrange an intermediary meeting to appeal to him face-to-face.  A final scenario would be to cut him off, the Mirror has claimed.  Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims.  The Daily Mail reported an unnamed friend of Meghan’s saying that a reconciliation is completely off the table.  “There’s no chance right now - he’s been a complete embarrassment,” the source said.  MORE: Thomas Markle speaks about former drug use.  MORE: Meghan’s kids will have surprising surname  The Palace crisis talks come just days after the Duchess’ dad confessed to taking drugs while his daughter Meghan was growing up.  Meghan’s outspoken father made the startling admission as he angrily denied having a drinking problem.  He said: “I don’t do drugs, haven’t for more than 20 years” while claiming he only has wine with dinner.  Mr Markle insisted that he doesn’t even drink beer despite being photographed with a six pack.  He said: “I regularly buy a six-pack for the guys on the guard gate because they’re stuck in a hot shack for hours each day and could use a cold one.”  A source close to the family added that Mr Markle used drugs to cope with the pressures of Hollywood while working as a lighting director.  They said that drug use was “part and parcel” of working in television where the hours were long.  While Mr Markle did not specify which drugs he used to take, his daughter Samantha said that marijuana was popular among his peers at the time.

She went on to say she loves talking about the scene because it gives her an excuse to “keep bringing up the Speedo”.  “Then I get my memories,” she said.  While Edgerton has been a little less direct with his comments about his costar, he’s also gushed over JLaw in recent interviews:  Speaking with the Herald Sun, he said:  ""Jen's a machine. She's up for anything and (is) game to wrestle with whatever demons she needs to for the sake of the movie.""  Lawrence split with boyfriend Darren Aronofsky last November, but recently said she still loved him during a taping of Marc Maron's podcast:  ""I was in love with him for, like, two years... I still love him very much.""  The Red Sparrow star spoke about the break up with The Mirror, sharing that she’s now in “single mode”:  “I am in the single mode where I am like, ‘Cool, I can do whatever I want and I can be alone and watch terrible TV,’” she said.  She went on to share that she doesn’t expect things to change for her romantically anytime soon, suggesting that she will likely lose the positive attitude fast:  “And then, of course, in a few months I will be devastatingly lonely and feel like I'm on some long waiting list,” she said. “But I am not there yet.”  Unless, of course, she and Edgerton kick off a new, adorable relationship... then she'll hopefully skip that ""devastatingly lonely"" part altogether.

As a journalist covering films and entertainment, these are first few thoughts I chanced upon/overheard about the world's highest paid Girl Next Door, Jennifer Aniston. News of her divorce with (now-ex) husband Justin Theroux made headlines on 16 February, and it's all anyone can talk/opine about.  As is common with news of this nature (by which I mean one that dominates pop culture), what followed next were memes about Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston now being single (hey, have we forgotten Angie is single too?).

But humour notwithstanding, there are several issues with our response to Aniston's breakup.  First of all, it's a break up. Need I remind any of you what it feels like to end ties with someone who was your partner for over five years (married for 2, together for 7)? It feels like the pits. The last thing you want to do is scroll through twitter and find your face attached to way too many memes about getting back together with a man that left you for another woman. Pretty sure Jennifer, right now, is thinking ""thanks but no thanks"".  We are so obssessed with happy-endings and romance that practicality, self-happiness seem to matter very little.  Has it occurred to noone that maybe, just maybe, Jennifer Aniston wants to be alone? That after a whirlwind of two marriages and much heartbreak, maybe it would better for her to be by herself? Would that be too bad? Why is it so hard for us to imagine Jennifer Aniston being alone? Or single? Does being single automatically mean someone is not happy?  Remember, the statement that those two gave out with the news of their divorce was this: ""This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.""  Doesn't sound any bit the heartbreak to me. If anything, Jennifer Aniston is probably happier being by herself and away from the world's baggage involving her love life. Besides, I'd like to see people trying so hard to couple up the single male actors in Hollywood.  Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she's with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.  Besides, in my humble opinion, Aniston is way beyond Brad Pitt's league. If she *had* to get together with someone in the near future, I sincerely hope it is with someone new.

4fe4d8b3-79b7-401c-b672-48ce40c6d025,"In the history of Hollywood, certain co-stars stand out as the most dynamic duos whose chemistry jumps out from the screen. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, and the more recent partnership of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The last pair has starred together in three films, Crazy Stupid Love, Gangster Squad, and La La Land. Moviegoers can't get enough of the somewhat offbeat pair, and Emma Stone's recent comments on Ryan Gosling prove that the co-stars can't get enough of each other, either.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Stone spoke about Gosling at Colorado's Telluride Film Festival during a Q&A on Sept. 1. ""I can’t even imagine what my life would be without Ryan,"" Stone said. The Battle of the Sexes star went on, saying, ""He’s so special. It makes me emotional. He’s so talented but he’s such a great person to work with because he’s so collaborative and excited about the process. He’s taught me a lot about being really generous."" Stone continued to tell the audience about her ""dear, wonderful friend"" after an audience member asked about why the La La Land co-stars have so much chemistry. She said, ""The moment he walked into the audition of Crazy, Stupid, Love, we had an unspoken understanding of each other.""  It probably won't come as a surprise to hear that fans have long-been obsessing over the duo who first stole everyone's hearts in Crazy Stupid Love. That movie included the unforgettable scene where Emma Stone's character freaked out over Ryan Gosling's glistening six-pack, and the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. With Stone's lovable awkwardness and Gosling's humble charm, it's no wonder that everyone wants to see the duo star in a fourth — and fifth, and sixth — movie together ASAP.  Some fans even feel that the couple's lack of co-starring role from the year might ruin awards season. Twitter user @dailyemmastone wrote, ""Yeah heartbreak is horrible, but have you ever imagine an award season with emma stone and ryan gosling doing it separately... well it's about to happen."" At least you can take heart in the fact that Stone and Gosling likely will at least see each other on some red carpets, since Gosling's starring role in the upcoming movie First Man is already drumming up Oscar buzz as is Stone's role in the upcoming release, The Favourite.  Even though Stone and Gosling didn't star together in a new movie in time for the 2018 awards season, the duo very well could end up teaming up together in the future. After all, Gosling's admiration for Stone has long inspired fans to ship the onscreen pair. In 2011, Gosling told MTV, that Stone is ""everything, all the time,"" and then he revealed that Stone's casting in Crazy Stupid Love got him excited for his role. ""There's no one like her. As soon as she signed on for this movie, I knew it was going to be good,"" he added.  Not only did Stone and Gosling make an impression on viewers in their first movie together, but they also left their co-star Steve Carell wanting more. According to E! News, Carrell spoke about Stone and Gosling at the 2017 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Office star said, ""I hope the three of us get to work again together. They are, incidentally, two of the nicest people ever."" At least Carrell got to reunite with Stone in 2017 with Battle of the Sexes, but fans still want to see Gosling reunite with Stone on the big screen at least one more time.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,725

I have the largest implants they actually make, but it doesn’t look that big on my body because of just the way I’m built,” she shared. “But, I’m thinking about actually getting my boobs reduced.”  “I already called Dr. Hochstein, who did my boobs and tummy a few years ago — he did my hernia repair and my tummy tuck after that, you might as well! And I said, ‘You know, I feel like I should get my boobs reduced. They’re heavy, my posture’s terrible, I’m getting older.’ What do you guys think?”  “I was thinking of going from like a DD to like a C. So head on over to my Instagram please and vote: DD or C,” she said. “I’ve actually already had my surgery scheduled in a couple months, but I can always change that.”  “I had a lift and I have like the nicest boobs ever. I did breastfeed all of my kids, so ladies, let’s be honest, they were stretched out, loss of volume, pancake nipples,” she explained. “So [Dr. Hochstein] gave me back my 18-year-old chest, which was amazing. He’s the best for that you guys.”  “So anyways, let me know. I’m thinking like a C, a full C. I have to have all my clothes altered. I have to buy a size 6 in everything when I could wear a size 2 in tops because of my boobs and then have everything altered. So it’d be nice to just be able to wear something. They’re perky because I had a lift, so it’s not really that, it’s just the weight of them,” said Zolciak-Biermann  RELATED VIDEO: Kelly Dodd Opens Up About Cosmetic Procedures: “No Pain, No Gain!”  The Bravo star has been very open about her relationship with plastic surgery in the past, including documenting her breast augmentation on her Bravo reality show.  “I will always nip and tuck if I feel the need to do so” Zolciak-Biermann told E! News in 2016. “I’m open about it. I don’t care. You only go around one time, and I especially understand that.”  “I had a boob job and I’ve had a hernia fixed,” Zolciak-Biermann explained. “I had a pretty big hernia from the twins, so I said just do a tummy tuck, which is kinda the same thing, just make the skin really tight. But that doesn’t change my size. I’m the same size I was the day I walked into surgery, I’m just a little bit tighter looking.”  At the time, she also explained that her tiny frame runs in the family.  “A lot is genetics,” she said. “My mom’s very small, I’m tall, I’m 5-8, I do have height on me.

It was both with that group and as a solo artist that Petty had a string of hits across the decades, including ""Free Fallin',"" ""American Girl"" and ""I Won't Back Down.""  Their 1976 debut contained a minor hit, ""Breakdown,"" but it wasn't until Petty's third album, ""Damn the Torpedoes,"" that he and the band broke through to the mainstream.  That 1980 album won critical raves, went platinum and spawned the hits ""Don't Do Me Like That"" and ""Refugee.""  JUST WATCHED Tom Petty's most memorable songs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tom Petty's most memorable songs 01:24  Petty sang with Stevie Nicks that same year on her smash hit, ""Stop Draggin' My Heart Around."" The duet kicked off a long and fruitful period of collaboration between Petty and other artists.  He recorded ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" -- memorable for its trippy, Mad Hatter-themed music video -- with the Eurythmics' Dave Stewart in 1985. Petty joined Bob Dylan on tour the next year, which also included dates with the Grateful Dead.  He joined fellow music legends Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison in 1988 to form The Traveling Wilburys. They released two studio albums.  It was a rich career for Petty, who was born in Gainesville, Florida and became hooked on rock and roll when -- at the age of 11 -- he met superstar Elvis Presley on a movie set.  Petty joined his first band, The Sundowners, in high school at the age of 14.  After getting into an argument with the band's drummer, Petty quit and moved on to join a group called The Epics, which included Tom Leadon, a brother of Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon.  ""We realized Tom was the real musician of the band,"" their fellow band member Rick Rucker told the Orlando Sentinel in 2006.  The Epics later changed their name to Mudcrutch, and Petty traveled to Los Angeles in search of a record deal for the rock quintet.  Despite landing a deal, the group soon disbanded.  A new group that included Petty and two former Mudcrutch members formed in 1975, eventually becoming known as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  After pioneering the heartland rock sound, Petty went solo in 1989 before regrouping with the Heartbreakers three years later.  He also found fame as an actor. His flair for drama was on display in his music videos for songs like ""Mary Jane's Last Dance.""  Petty starred with Kevin Costner in the 1997 film, ""The Postman."" He also had a recurring role as the voice of Elroy ""Lucky"" Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series, ""King of the Hill.""  A 2015 biography on Petty documented a dark turn for the singer and his struggle with heroin addiction in 1997, following the collapse of his 20-year marriage and a failed album.  ""Tried to go cold turkey, and that wouldn't work,"" Petty said in the book. ""It's an ugly f***ing thing.""  Petty told CNN in a 2007 interview that he loved music as much as it loved him.  ""Music, as far as I have seen in the world so far, is the only real magic that I know,"" he said. ""There is something really honest and clean and pure and it touches you in your heart.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1450
0d1e1e5f-d798-41df-99db-81df07255b11,"Please enable Javascript to watch this video  ATLANTA — Singer R. Kelly woos audiences with soulful and often sexy lyrics. In real life some say the 51-year-old artist preys on young, sometimes underage, girls.  There are allegations he abuses them physically and mentally, and even holds them against their will. Recently, WREG spoke with a mother and father who described how their young daughter ended up in the arms of R. Kelly.  ""This is not modern day slavery and that's what he's treating them like, a slave, a sex slave, "" father Tim Savage told WREG.  Tim and Jonjelyn Savage say Robert Sylvester Kelly, known to fans as R. Kelly, met their daughter two and a half years ago. Joycelyn was 19, an aspiring singer, who was invited backstage after one of his concerts.  ""I think that the nephew of Mr. Kelly had wrote his name or number on a piece of paper and gave it to his nephew to give to Joycelyn, and that's how this all came about, "" her father explained.  The Savages moved from Memphis to Atlanta when Joycelyn was in middle school. They thought it would be easier for her and her younger sister to break into the entertainment industry. They never expected that same industry would break their family apart.  Joycelyn started college. The Savages saw changes in her behavior after she met Kelly. Out of concern, one day they picked her up from campus and did an ""intervention"".  They asked her to stay away from Kelly but allowed her to go back to her dorm. Joycelyn's friends say when her father left, someone sent a car to campus and picked her up. That was December of 2016. They haven't seen their daughter since.  Her mother said, ""We had Robert Sylvester Kelly`s number but he wouldn't answer the phone. So we gave it to the campus police. Of course, they got in touch with her. And after they got in touch with her, she called us and we were like, 'Joycelyn are you there? We need to know what was going on with you.' And she was like I'm with R.Kelly.'  Last summer, the Savages got word their daughter was living at one of Kelly's homes in an Atlanta suburb.  WREG obtained a police report they filed that says they believed their daughter was part of the R. Kelly cult, stuck and in trouble.  Police visited the home, but the house was clear and no one was there, according to the report. The Savages believe their daughter now lives in the singer's hometown of Chicago. They fear for her after talking to some of Kelly's ex-girlfriends.  Lisa Van Allen says she dated Kelly for 9 years.  ""So when I met him he was really nice, calm and cool. He asked me how old I was. I told him I was 17 and he asked me, 'Will your mother let you come to Chicago?""  Allen says she was 17 when she started having sex with R. Kelly. She met him during a video shoot. Van Allen says Kelly often seeks out young girls and routinely makes them address him a certain way.  ""He liked to be called Daddy. That was pretty much it. Nothing else. Daddy, "" said Van Allen.  After several years with Kelly, she ended up a witness against him after a videotape surfaced and he was charged with 14 counts of child pornography. She testified that Kelly coerced her to make sex tapes with him and other girls, some as young as 13-years-old.  She said, ""He recorded and he'd tell you what to do. You know it was really unnatural.""  Jurors aquitted him but the allegations kept coming, from former employees and the girls who left.  ""You know it was like he had to be in control of everything. You couldn't speak to people you know. If guys came in the room and you spoke to them, he would get upset,"" said Van Allen.  She added, ""He may cuss you out. He might smack you. Just depends on you know, how he's feeling.""  Allen says she doesn't know Joycelyn but met her parents after they took their story public last summer.  Jonjelyn Savage said, ""Tim and I did, have been doing, research over the last year and it's not really like a physical kidnapping where you are chained up and you can't walk out the front door. It's more mental.""  Despite the Savages concerns, TMZ photographers recently spotted Kelly and Joycelyn out shopping like a happy couple at a Chicago mall. A few days later cameras caught her hundreds of miles away vacationing in Los Angeles without Kelly.  Joycelyn told a photographer, 'It's rumors out there people are saying I'm being held captive, hostage. Well, that's obviously not true. I'm out here enjoying life doing my own thing, as you can see.""  The photographer asked her if she stands by her word R. Kelly is not holding any women hostage and doesn`t have a sex cult.  She said, ""No. None of that is true. None of that is true. All of that is false accusations.""  R. Kelly's management team has denied reports he's holding anyone against their will. He's not charged with a crime and there's no indication of a pending investigation. Still, the Savages believe their daughter is being coerced and told what to say. They're not giving up the fight to get her back.  Her mother said, ""At the beginning, I was very shocked that parents feel that when their daughter or son turns 17, 18, that parent doesn't care anymore because I care if she was 2 or she was 32. If I feel she is being manipulated by a predator and I think she's blinded at that point, I'm going to do whatever I can to save her.""  In recent weeks, advocacy campaigns like #metoo and #timesup targeted Kelly. They've put pressure on radio hosts like Tom Joyner. Joyner says he'll no longer play Kelly's music.  WREG also contacted RCA, the record company representing Kelly. They did not respond to questions but the Savages believe they bear some responsibility. The family's lawyers and some of those advocacy groups have now started to reach out to them.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1227
9c474f65-6189-42e7-8443-fc3c96db1c06,"According to a new promotional video, a feud is erupting on the set of the new season of The Voice between veteran judge Blake Shelton and newcomer Jennifer Hudson, and the competition to get the winning vocalist on their respective teams is getting fierce.  In a video titled The Real Coaches of The Voice, a fun spoof of the Real Housewives franchise, Shelton and Hudson are butting heads when they have both turned their chair and are trying to convince contestants to choose between the two. The promo features snide comments from Shelton when he talks about Hudson’s rookie win as a coach on The Voice U.K.  “I feel like Jennifer Hudson is coming from the minor leagues into the big-time boys here,” says Shelton. “She was on The Voice UK, and she won, but this is different.”  Which Coach will be the SHORE thing? #TheVoice returns September 25. A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice) on Aug 11, 2017 at 4:59pm PDT  The Dreamgirls star and former American Idol contestant is not intimidated by the country superstar’s remarks. She is confident that her time on the British version of the show has prepared for a win in the States.  The question is, though, is the feud just all in fun for a promo video, or are Hudson’s diva ways really causing problems on the set?  According to reports Hudson is not getting along with the other judges, the contestants, or the crew. A source claims she is being intolerable by screaming at people to get her way, being disruptive, and causing delays. Hudson is so hard to work with that the insider claims everyone is hoping this will be her only season on the show.  Girl looks like a dream. ? #TheVoice A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice) on Sep 9, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT  If there really are problems on the set, the show is keeping it on the down low, and instead presenting a fun and playful, yet competitive vibe for the upcoming season.  For example, Shelton reveals at the end of the promo that he and his former rival turned best friend, coach Adam Levine, have decided to try to get along this season. The video featured the two professing their love for one another in a sarcastic attempt to mend fences.  Shelton and Levine have battled for years on the reality competition, but everyone knows the relationship is more of a bromance than a feud.

7112dabb-5588-416f-a3f9-0917ec87a611,"Harrison Ford has never been an easy interview subject during his decades at the top of the Hollywood game, but he provided a Norwegian radio host with a massive scoop when he claimed live on air that “Carrie Fisher was a tranny.”  The Star Wars legend showed much-loved co-star Carrie Fisher was at the forefront of his thoughts during the interview on December 27, changing the topic several times in order to speak about “the beautiful, troubled soul” that he “shared a very special period of my life with” and lamenting her “tragic death” one year ago.  “She died before her time,” Harrison Ford said, explaining that “she had secrets that she wanted to share. They had been bottled up all her life and they made her suffer. I accepted her for what she was, and many of her closest friends did too, but she wanted to be honest with the world. Unfortunately death came too soon.”  Asked if he was comfortable sharing what her secret was, Harrison Ford paused and said “She had boy parts. She was… What is the politically correct term these days? I don’t even know. I can’t keep up. Let’s just say she was a tranny.”  Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher became romantically involved during filming in the early 80s, even though he was married. Describing the affair as “a mistake,” Ford explained that it was now “water under the bridge” and now, at the age of 75, he looks back at their time together with fondness.  “It was only really when she passed last year that I realized what she meant to me. She was unique. She was one of a kind. I guess I am still in love with her a little bit.”  Responding to the host’s claim that “generations of men around the world who grew up in the eighties will be devastated to find out that they ‘choked their chickens’ to a man in disguise as a princess in a metal bikini”, Harrison Ford said, “Come on, man. Let’s be adults here. Let’s not disrespect the dead.”  Fisher had largely completed scenes in the latest film before her death on December 27, 2016, aged 60. Her death came four days after she was admitted to hospital following a medical emergency on a flight from London to Los Angeles.  The actress was found to have died of sleep apnoea and “other factors”, according to the coroner’s report, and Harrison Ford claims her lifelong bipolar disorder was also a contributing factor.  Despite being born to Hollywood royalty, Carrie Fisher “had a difficult life due to her condition”, according to Ford. “There was enormous pressure from Lucasfilm and 20th Century Fox to keep her secret under wraps.”  “I was sworn to secrecy. I couldn’t even speak to my buddies about her. The only person I spoke to about her was Lou Reed. He had a transexual lover back then too. He understood the whole deal.”  “But Lou has passed now too,” Ford said. “It’s getting lonely out here.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,607

Cardi B and Offset just welcomed their first child together, Kulture Kiari Cephus. The couple was unable to keep up the secretive celebrity facade so many famous people stick to these days, oversharing with their fans as soon as possible.  The happy times might not last forever, unfortunately. Last week, Offset was arrested just outside of Atlanta. He was pulled over for allegedly changing lanes without signaling in his Porsche 911. The officer on the scene reported that the car smelled strongly of marijuana, prompting him to search it.  Clayton County Police told CBS News that they found three guns and less than an ounce of marijuana in the car. They took Offset into custody, as the rapper is a convicted felon which prevents him from owning a gun at all. He was also charged with possession of a weapon during a crime, because of the marijuana charge.  However, Offset and his lawyer are already fighting back on the arrest, claiming that he was unfairly targeted by law enforcement. They claimed that the guns were clearly in possession of Offset's bodyguard, who was in the passenger seat, and not the rapper himself.  ""It's a common theme. We're talking about a young, African-American man driving a shiny, beautiful luxury car and clad in designer clothes and watches and jewelry,"" said attorney Drew Findling, who has previously represented rapper Gucci Mane, Katt Williams, and others.

61c80517-accc-48a3-ac47-c80ada5a08cc,"As more women share their stories of sexual assault amid the staggering number of accusations against producer Harvey Weinstein, actress Laura Dern realized that she had been justifying experiences she had as a teenager as “the norm.”  Dern, 50, spoke with Ellen DeGeneres in an interview set to air Wednesday about being honored at ELLE magazine’s Women in Hollywood Awards Monday. At the event, women spoke about sexual abuse they’ve faced in their lives.  Dern’s “Big Little Lies” co-star Reese Witherspoon revealed she was sexually assaulted by a director when she was just 16; Jennifer Lawrence recalled being made to stand in a “degrading” nude lineup for an audition.  “It was an extraordinary experience, perhaps more than ever, to have this shared space and a tribe of women and artists talking about this industry, and ultimately therefore talking about sexual harassment in the workplace,” Dern said.  The actress told DeGeneres she had a revelation Tuesday morning, realizing she, too, had been “justifying behavior” that was not OK.  Stefanie Keenan via Getty Images  “ ... I talked about how I was one of the lucky ones because I was raised by actors who told me their stories and told me what to look out for, and I realized that I was I still justifying behavior,” she said. “And it was my mom who said, ‘No, no, no, Laura, that was sexual assault. That was harassment. That was assault. No, you were 14 then.’ And you realize how in our culture we have justified, and therefore even condoned, behavior as though it’s the norm. I felt very moved by people being honest and direct.”  Dern said that for her the “most exciting” part is moving forward through action, including the possible formation of a commission where woman can report ― even anonymously ― abuses of power.

e8c0055a-a0e0-489a-a91d-4d3ee6e6148d,"DEMI MOORE SAYS SHE SAVED her from some major business mistakes. Rosanna Arquette says she helped save her daughter’s life. Brad Pitt likes to drop by and play with her 5-year-old son Samson; wellness guru Deepak Chopra calls for advice. And Laura Day, the object of all this celebrity attention? “I’m not what you expect,” she insists. “I’m just your basic, straitlaced Jewish woman.”  Who believes—as do her fans—that she has a highly accurate sense of intuition. “Intuition allows us to predict events,” claims Day, 38. She maintains that everyone has such abilities,, waiting to be developed; her 1996 how-to book, Practical Intuition, sold 133,000 hardcover copies, and her 1997 follow-up, Practical Intuition for Success, is the first part of a two-book, $3 million deal. Before becoming an author, Day earned as much as $5,000 a session advising filmmakers (on script and casting problems) and business executives (about market trends). “I don’t see hallucinations, it’s just a flash of something in my head,” says Day, who’s wary of being thought of as some spacey psychic or guru. “I’m not magical or New Age or a spiritual leader. There’s nothing that sets me apart from anyone else.”  So how to explain all those A-list amigos? “She’s very open and loving,” says Arquette, who met Day through a mutual friend, rocker Peter Gabriel. In 1996, Arquette phoned Day to tell her that her daughter Zoe, then 2, had a fever and diarrhea, which a doctor had said was the flu. “I had a very clear feeling that Zoe was going to die,” recalls Day, who saw to it that the girl was taken to a hospital, where she was diagnosed with a rare form of blood poisoning. “Laura’s information saved Zoe’s life,” says Arquette. “It was intense.”  Day’s friendships with Hollywood heavyweights have helped her, too. When HarperCollins didn’t throw a bash for her second book last October, her friends, including close pal Brad Pitt, threw her a party instead. Demi Moore—or “Aunt Demi,” as she’s known to Samson—worked with Day on the set of 199l’s The Butcher’s Wife, in which Moore played a psychic. “Laura has given me a trust in my own intuition,” says the actress, who won’t reveal much about the business situation gone wrong but admits it would have been worse without Day’s intervention. “I took a greater position of responsibility,” says Moore. “Laura put me back in the driver’s seat.”  Day says she discovered her special way of seeing things at an early age. The oldest of four children born in New York City to David Globus, now 67 and an internist, and Vivian, a full-time mother, Day was 11 when her mother, who suffered from depression, slipped into a coma after a suicide attempt. “I wanted her to live,” says Day, “and I needed to know what to do.” She recalls having an instinct to channel her own warmth and energy into Vivian’s body. Her mother pulled through but, three years later, succeeded in taking her own life.  Day went on to study philosophy and religion at Syracuse University and, in 1979, at age 20, married Lee Day, now 39 and a Web site designer. Twelve years later they separated, and eight months after that, Day gave birth to their son Samson. Facing a mound of bills from a divorce that is still being litigated, Day, who had been teaching intuition workshops and taking a few consulting jobs, wondered how she could make ends meet and still be a full-time mother. “At the point when you’re most lost,” says Day, “that’s when intuition kicks in.”  Intuition said: Write a book. Her ensuing success—she writes two hours a day and is now working on Intuition and Love, a guide to finding a mate—allows her to “do bake sales and book sales and be a very involved parent.” A perfect evening is cooking for a gaggle of friends in her New York City loft, which she and Samson share with a cat, three lizards, a mouse and nine fish. “People are drawn to Laura,” says Adam Robinson, 42, an educator and Day’s boyfriend of three years. “She makes them feel at ease and accepted. She radiates empathy.”  And yet, Day only rarely gets intuitive about her own life, despite the success that trusting her gut has brought her. “I don’t want my environment perfect,” she says. “I work very hard to live in the moment. I’m interested in how I’m feeling right now.”  ALEX TRESNIOWSKI    DEBBIE SEAMAN in New York City",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,961

Elliot Stabler exited ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" at the end of season 12 with so little warning and basically zero closure that fans are still hoping for a return of some sort. In the show's season 15 premiere Wednesday, ""SVU"" seemed to hint at the possibility of his return.  As a battered and bruised Det. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay, who deserves an Emmy nod next year for this performance) stood over her unconscious captor played by Pablo Schreiber, she whispered of her desire to torture him as he'd done to her and so many others, but was unsure of what to do.  And then it came: ""My old partner, he'd know what to do,"" she spat. ""He wouldn't question himself after what you've done. He'd kick your teeth in, break your legs, break your arms, break your back, break your face. Maybe I should call him ...""  Longtime fans at that point were no doubt screaming ""Yes!"" and urging her to to dial the volatile El. And why not?  ""When people are in these situations, they think about the most important people in their life, so we had to go there!"" showrunner Warren Leight told TODAY about Liv bringing up Stabler. He also teased that as the implications of the ordeal weigh on her during the course of this new season, ""We're going to see her malfunction from time to time.""  After such a horrific experience, why not turn to the man who was clearly her rock to help her get through the aftermath — and give fans the closure they've been wanting? Though it may make sense to fans to bring Stabler back for Benson's story line, Leight says don't bet on it.  ""I don't know how it could work logistically, economically or given the network politics of it,"" he admitted, noting that Meloni is now working on FOX's upcoming midseason sitcom ""Surviving Jack."" ""I think we just have to accept the fact that the closure we got was somewhat half a--ed because these guys couldn't work out a way to arc (Meloni's story) out, and it's unfortunate.""  Benson won't have Stabler's shoulder to cry on, but she won't be going through the recovery alone, with Dean Winters back as her love interest, Det. Brian Cassidy.  ""The question for Cassidy and for her is: Can (their relationship) survive this kind of stress?"" Leight said. ""In situations like this, people either fail you completely or step up ... and even if people step up, you — the victim coping with surviving — may not be able to accept it.""  Things will be tough for her partner, Det. Nick Amaro, as well.  ""Amaro, he broke the law to find where she was, to get information, blatantly so,"" Danny Pino, who plays Amaro, told TODAY. ""So I think there's an intensity and there's a bond between the characters that happened very quickly. ... There's a healthy amount of beating himself up for what happened to her. I think he's going to deal with that throughout the season.""    But he won't just be the only other SVU detective who has to grapple with what Benson went through.  ""This kind of an event resonates throughout the whole squad room,"" Pino said.  ""(Benson) getting battered is doubly emotional for the fans, for the fellow actors and the writers,"" Richard Belzer, who plays Munch, told TODAY. ""It brings it to a whole new level because we deal with crimes that don't involve us! And now one of our own.

Renowned jeweler, Michael Greene, was the one in charge of designing the $2million sparkler. “Paris just called and told me how much she appreciates it.

He came to see me in New York and said he had been thinking about this and wanting to do it. He wanted the ring to be perfect, exactly what she wanted. He had been asking around the family for tips and ideas,” said Greene.  Zylka decided on a pear shape because it was similar to Hilton’s mother’s ring. Right after the engagement, Greene said “Paris at one point in time told Chris she really loved her mother’s pear-shaped diamond, and when Chris came to me that was his request. The pear-shaped really jumped out for him and ultimately for her. He did some fishing, but in the end, it was all him.

The only food-related duty Lisa has done for the past six months is retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton.”Mr. Trump’s favorite fast food choices are reportedly Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonalds, and he eats his fried chicken, burgers, and fries with a knife and fork according to a White House staffer who requested anonymity to avoid consequences from leaking about the President’s eating habits to the press.“It’s borderline creepy,” the staffer said. “The first thing Trump does with his fried chicken is pick off all the skin from every piece like he’s dissecting the chickens with a scalpel or something, and then he puts it all in a pile. Then he cuts off all the lean meat and throws it away, leaving just the pieces of fat which he then eats individually with pieces of the crispy skin he peeled off. It’s gotta be a warning sign of a serial killer or something.”Mr. Trump’s McDonalds habits are even weirder.“He orders the same thing every time,” said the staffer. “He orders two big macs, a large fry, a diet coke of course, and an M&M McFlurry that he has Lisa dig out and remove every brown M&M, and then he makes her dump out half of the ice cream and fill it back up with extra M&M’s. Then he cuts off pieces of his big macs and dips them in the McFlurry so every bite has ice cream and chocolate on it. He dips his fries, still with a fork, in the diet coke as if it were a condiment. The sight of this never gets normal. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe saw this routine he threw up.”No wonder Chef Lisa Mead quit.

Last night, the rapper-turned-designer debuted a new campaign for his Yeezy 500 Supermoon sneaker campaign on Twitter, and it turned heads to say the least.  The shots feature a diverse roster of models wearing West’s new footwear, along with other Yeezy pieces like sports bras, leggings, and sweatshirts. But a few models really wore nothing but the shoe. One of them included adult-film actress Lela Star (who has an uncanny resemblance to West's wife, Kim Kardashian).  The campaign was photographed by Eli Linnetz (who shot the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card). He shared another revealing angle from the shoot.  The Clermont twins also made an appearance, wearing only the Supermoon sneakers, socks, and biker shorts.  There was also this faceless model, who posed topless but sported grey shorts, Calabasas socks, and Yeezy kicks.  Not all models were nude. Some wore Yeezy's signature oversized sweaters and biker shorts (à la Kim Kardashian), others even sported jeans.  The roster also included younger-looking models, including a child.  This isn't the first time Kanye has launched a new campaign on social media. For his recent collections, Kim has worn his design in public and shared the paparazzi photos online to debut the clothes. He also enlisted other models including Paris Hilton, Amina Blue, and Sami Miro to pose as Kim lookalikes for the shots, resulting in a full-on social media swarm.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,294

e1fb44b0-7aca-4b8d-a2b3-79fe2b32ec2c,"If any of us brought a guy like Liam Hemsworth home, our parents would be planning a wedding within minutes (or at least, my parents would be). Which is exactly why we are so shocked by what Tish Cyrus has to say about him. Miley Cyrus’s mom doesn’t get the pressure to marry Liam Hemsworth.  Say what?!!  While the rest of the world drools over Miley and Liam’s beautiful relationship, Tish just doesn’t see the big deal. Guess visiting children’s hospitals together and raising a bunch of animals doesn’t warm her heart like it does for us! Regardless of what the rest of the world wants, Tish thinks Miley has plenty of time before she even has to start thinking of marriage.  But don’t get her wrong. Tish totally supports her daughter’s relationship.  She even gave us their relationship update!  Tish Cyrus spoke with Mario Lopez on his radio show on Wednesday, and revealed that Miley and Liam are stronger than ever. But, wedding bells are not in their immediate future.  ""She is not eloping. She is not getting married. They are so freaking happy and living in Malibu,""  Honestly, what else would we want for the power couple that is giving us ultimate #RelationshipGoals?  It seems like Miley and Tish are in agreement about not rushing into a legal binding marriage.  “She’s so happy, and she’s always like, ‘I don’t know why everybody wants us to get married. It’s so perfect.'” You know what they say — if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.  Regardless — we’re sure shippers will still freak out whenever they see Miley wearing white. Like that one time Miley’s dad Billy Ray Cyrus posted a photo of his daughter wearing white with the caption, “I’m so happy…you are happy @mileycyrus.” Everyone was convinced Billy Ray just witnessed his daughter get married, but that was soo not the case.  Miley’s dad later had to clarify that Miley was NOT getting married, and that he simply was just stating that he’s happy for her. Because, ya know, women can look happy in white dresses without having to get married. Miley is probably enjoying her successful career as a musician — and as she should, girl hustles and works hard.  As long as Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are happy together, how “official” their relationship is shouldn’t matter.

6e587533-c735-4f88-baa1-cd469c653016,"Celebrity relationships and friendships are a rare breed. These famous faces have their lives played out in front of the masses, whether it’s the good, the bad, or the straight-up shady. In Elite Daily’s new series, It’s Complicated, we’re highlighting the biggest celebrity “feuds” that took over Hollywood and dominated our Sunday brunches for weeks on end. We’ll take a deep dive into the lives and social media feeds of our favorite stars and dissect what happened in front of the camera, what went down behind the scenes, and everything you might have missed in between.  There's no denying it. Somehow, the Kardashian family drama just continues to grow with each and every new season Keeping Up With The Kardashians. So far in Season 15, oldest sister Kourtney's relationship with her younger sisters Kim and Khloé is at the center of the conflict. There's a very clear divide forming in the OG trio, and tension has been high since the premiere episode, when Kim called Kourtney ""the least exciting"" family member to look at. However, you better believe Kourtney Kardashian's relationship with Kim and Khloé on the show is very different than how it is in real life. Many KUWTK fans, including myself, are following the girls in real time on social media too, and they seem to be past the previously recorded drama IRL.  Fans are just now learning through current KUWTK episodes that while we were all busy scouring the earth for clues about Kylie Jenner and Khloé Kardashian's pregnancies, Kourtney was at a personal crossroads. Thanks to things like finding a new therapist and her then-growing relationship with Younes Bendjima, Kourtney described feeling disconnected and, for lack of better words, ""so over"" her family's dynamic. In the show, fans watched in wonder as she shouted over the phone to Khloé how ""disgusting"" she feels being a part of the famous clan. In the following episodes, Kourt even pondered taking her children and celebrating the holidays separately from everyone else.  Aye, aye, aye. Say it isn't so, Kourt!  Luckily, thanks to things like Instagram, fans know the sisters eventually buried the hatchet. Why? Because everything appears groovy now.  Consider this example: It was understandable that after the premiere episode and famous ""least exciting to look at"" comment that Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé all jumped on Twitter to rehash their argument. Obviously, re-watching an intense fight that happened months ago might cause anyone to get worked up all over again. However, just a week or so later, Kylie Jenner turned 21 and the sisters were already joking about their feud. Kourtney posted a smoldering photo of herself from her sister's party in which she jokingly thanked fans for all of the birthday wishes. Jenner played along, commenting, ""Happy birthday. you're so interesting to look at.""  Instagram / Kourtney Kardashian  Later, Khloé shared a photo of her and Kourtney goofing around from the same evening. She captioned it, ""Yes, we are completely aware of how obnoxious we are when we are together. NO, WE DON’T CARE!!! Malika took a really cool pic!!""  Seems like no hard feelings there, eh?  Plus, there's another big change that happened since they wrapped filming. Kourtney and Younes have reportedly broken up. During the time news of their split was swirling in the press, Kim jumped to her sister's side in support. At one point, photos surfaced of Bendjima hanging out and maybe flirting with another woman named Jordan Ozuna in Mexico. Bendjima took the negative attention hard, and posted a message on his Instagram account reading:  Once again you guys failed. I'm not attached to this 'life' so you can't touch me. I know who i am where i'm from and where i'm going and that bothers you. only one opinion matter. the one of my Lord.  In response, Kim, who is ride-or-die for her sisters in the end, commented, ""Nice pics from your 'boys trip'."" She also included a Pinocchio emoji, essentially calling Bendjima a liar.  Of course, we saw on KUWTK and on social media back in December that Kourtney did ultimately decide to stick to tradition and spend the holidays with her family. And, as recently as Aug. 28, she shared a serious throwback picture of herself and Kim from 1995.  You know what they say, all's well that ends with a major #TBT.  Of course, I'm sure the drama isn't over yet and there's plenty more bickering to come in Season 15. But, if there's one thing this family has proven over and over again, it's how adaptable they are to any situation and that Kardashian blood and hair extensions are thicker than water... or something.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,934

feb28067-390a-4a1c-b6a7-56ee35547b09,"It is an undeniable fact that Miranda Kerr has incredible skin. Not only is it always glowing and radiant, but her pores are virtually non-existent, she has an even skin tone and she doesn’t seem to have had a pimple in years.  So, it is understandable that when the model and founder of skin care brand KORA Organics shared her top skin care tips with Teen Vogue, including the product she uses to clear her blemishes overnight, we were all ears.  According to the model, facial oils are her go-to when confronted with a surprise pimple. “If I’m having a breakout, I like to balance the pH of my skin with my Noni Glow Oil. I find that really helps, even with treating it overnight. I put it on after cleansing, misting, exfoliating and moisturising,” she said.  While we’re not debating the effectiveness the oil has on Miranda’s skin, we wanted to check in with a skin care expert to find out if facial oils can work as an effective pimple treatment for the rest of us. And if the advice from Bryan Barron Director of Research and Content at Paula’s Choice, is anything to go by, it isn’t good news.  In fact, Barron says, “While some people report success using oils to banish breakouts, mounds of research has shown that gently removing excess oil and controlling acne-causing bacteria with benzoyl peroxide, and using a leave-on exfoliant with salicylic acid is a proven, reliable approach for acne at any age.”  Ultimately, while facial oils are a vital addition in any skin care routine as they work wonders to nourish, plump and hydrate the skin, using them as a pimple treatment may not deliver the same results as the proven acne treatment duo of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.  Want more information on facial oils? Then click here to find out why you need one, where it fits into your routine and why your standard olive oil just won’t do.

The couple have shared a picture of the card sitting on a Christmas tree in their home at Clarence House.  Printed on the front of the Christmas card is the Prince of Wales' feathers and the Duchess' cipher. The festive card, which is surrounded by a thin red border, reads on the inside: ""Wishing you a very Happy Christmas and New Year"". The regal picture was taken when Camilla was celebrating her 70th birthday with the Prince of Wales.  To mark her milestone birthday on 17 July, the couple were dressed for a private summer party at Charles' Highgrove home. Camilla wore an ivory embellished dress by Anna Valentine and accessorised her outfit with a detailed flower necklace. Meanwhile, Prince Charles styled himself in a tailored black dinner jacket – by Savile Row bespoke tailors Anderson & Sheppard – and a black tie. The couple smiled for the picture – taken by royal photographer Hugo Burnand – which was taken in the orchard room in Clarence House a few days before Camilla's birthday.

Clearly I’m not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it’s not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you…  Bethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn’t express any interest in going because she didn’t express any interest in having me go? I didn’t know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I’m saying how proud I am of her. Wow…at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It’s strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I’d asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.  On the other hand, I really don’t give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won’t bore you here recounting the endless places I’ve been to or the stories I’ve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people’s sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I’m not bragging — it wasn’t my prize — but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it’s something.  I am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large “get out the vote” campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know — I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn’t end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don’t understand why she’s fully committed this season to talking about me as though I’m a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.  Maybe we’ll find out next week.

Feb 23, 2017  AceShowbiz - It looks like Selena Gomez could not tolerate it if The Weeknd still keeps in touch with his ex Bella Hadid. According to a Life & Style report, the ""Hands to Myself"" singer has even threatened to dump her new beau upon catching him texting the Victoria's Secret model.  The tabloid claims that the former Disney darling and the ""Starboy"" singer, whose real name is Abel Tesfaye, have got into a huge fight because he still texts his model ex-girlfriend. A source reveals that ""Selena was so angry, she threatened to end the relationship unless Abel cuts off all contact with Bella.""  ""Abel and Bella only speak occasionally,"" explains the alleged source, before adding, ""But he's a very independent guy, and he won't be told what to do by Selena."" The source further claims, ""He finds her neediness a major turnoff.""

3039da88-6eae-422a-a67b-2bf9c9451f26,"Ben Affleck is keeping life with his three kids and his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus separate, if Jennifer Garner has anything to say about it.  “Jen doesn’t want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,” a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  Though the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck’s filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is “the fact that Ben had an affair with her.”  However, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, “Ben understands and has honored her request.”  “They’re good friends,” the source adds. “She wants him to be honest and he usually is. She tends to find out about things, and Ben is very open with her. They both want what’s best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.”  While the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck’s past struggles with alcohol abuse.  “The one thing she’s not flexible on is sobriety,” the source tells Us. “Jen is hesitant to sign off until she’s certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time. Finalizing the divorce has been a long process because of it.”  For more on Garner and Affleck’s post-divorce relationship, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

07d1caae-1426-4d59-8443-e9bf1d796a24,"When Taylor Swift transformed into a reigning pop princess on 2014's 1989, Jack Antonoff was there. He was there again to help co-write her bad girl turn on Reputation in 2017. As a producer, he’s worked with St. Vincent’s Annie Clark on the minimalist piano pop for her 2017 record Masseduction, with Lorde on her larger-than-life album Melodrama, and is partly responsible for Sara Bareilles’s commercial-perfect earworm “Brave.” He’s reportedly working with Carly Rae Jepsen (again), the Dixie Chicks, and now Lana Del Rey.    Antonoff rose to fame as a member of the largely forgotten band Fun., whose biggest hit was 2011's “We Are Young,” but now he’s often positioned as the reason why the music of many women artists is so great. He’s been dubbed your favorite pop star’s “secret weapon” by Pitchfork, and a “millennial pop svengali” by Vanity Fair. His rise is especially inspiring, GQ once suggested, because he doesn’t physically and sonically resemble typical pop producers. “The very nature of pop music has changed: people who look and think and sound like Jack Antonoff are allowed to participate in its making at the very highest levels,” a profile from earlier this year read, which seemed to imply that Antonoff’s geeky style and indie sincerity was in direct opposition to slicker pop makers who came up through the industry solely as writers and producers.  Despite his rising prominence, though, there’s something admittedly irritating about his ubiquity. It’s enough to warrant articles like this Noisey post: “JACK ANTONOFF YOU STAY AWAY FROM THE DIXIE CHICKS,” in which the entire body is “no no no no nope.” Because while Antonoff might be highly favored among artists we love, promoted (often via music critics) as a fresh new pop-maker and ally with a unique respect for women, he inevitably winds up consuming a lot of their spotlight. In late October, he appeared alongside Lana Del Rey for her performance of “How to Disappear” at an Apple event in Brooklyn. After GQ interviewed him, their profile included the line, “He’s still writing Jack Antonoff songs—they just happen to be sung by people like Lorde now.” Lorde took issue with the characterization: “Knew there was a way to describe the personal and skillful work that I do turns out it’s ‘singing jack antonoff songs’” she wrote in a now-deleted tweet.  The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure.  That’s traditionally how it’s worked. The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure. Women may be the stars of their music, their names alone listed on their songs, but the men who write, produce, or mix for them, even as a collaboration, are seen as the puppeteers who guide them (and, in the worst cases, svengalis); Phil Spector to The Ronettes, Max Martin to Britney Spears, Timbaland to Aaliyah, Dr. Luke to Kesha.  There’s the long baked-in assumption, particularly in pop, that women are not responsible for their hits and have a team of pop songwriters behind them. Women artists, from Taylor Swift to Björk to Missy Elliott, have had to fight for their role in their own music-making, as listeners and critics choose to attribute the bulk of the creative process to the men in the room. “How can one be a ‘vocal muse’ to their own melodies, story telling and words they wrote?” Solange wrote in response to a 2013 review of her album True, co-produced and co-written largely by Dev Hynes, which likened Solange to a muse for Hynes (Solange is credited as a writer and producer on every track). And while Antonoff is far from the most egregious offender, he is still a male producer working primarily with women artists, and it’s his touch as a producer that inevitably blankets the work of the women he works with.  Advertisement  Lorde “Green Light” music video  A fair share of Antonoff’s productions are great. Taylor Swift’s “I Wish You Would” is supremely underrated, Fifth Harmony’s “Dope” should have been on the album rather than a B-side, and I still get excited when I hear “Green Light” out in public. But I’d argue that the unchanged nature of his production style leaves a lot of his music stuck, dated, in the glittering ’80s nostalgia-wave of pop music several years ago. He tends, as well, to have a squeaky clean, piano-ballad approach, like he’s willingly applying motion-smoothing technology to artists who might not need it. When Melodrama was set to come out, I steeled myself for a record built in the shadow of 1989, an erasure of Lorde, and was pleasantly surprised to find I could still hear her.    I steeled myself for Lorde’s erasure not because I thought she could easily disappear, but because it’s happened so many times before with women artists. Antonoff has largely been pitched to the masses as a producer who cuts through that stereotype. He’s a pop music “Nice Guy” (someone your mother would love, New York Magazine once pointed out) in an industry just barely beginning to reckon publicly with how much misogyny is embedded into pop music-making. It’s hard not to connect the recent infatuation with Antonoff’s celebrity with Dr. Luke’s fall and see him as a shred of male decency in a dark industry. More than being a nice guy, he’s made it clear that he cares about women’s artistry. “I always want to hear women sing my songs. I just want to be around women,” Antonoff told Pitchfork. “It’s not a sex thing—I’m heterosexual, but it’s not coming from any place like that. It’s just a comfort thing.”  Last year, he told The Guardian, “In no way do I feel like a woman. I feel very male. But when I’m writing I don’t think about Lou Reed or Bowie. I think about Kate Bush, Björk, Fiona Apple. I’ve always been extremely drawn to female artists who are being brutally honest. That is so much more attractive to me than a lot of the weird paths certain male songwriters lead you down, that hide and mask emotions.”  In an interview with the New York Times promoting Melodrama, Lorde told the reporter that when she played “Green Light” to producer Max Martin, who has an almost Renaissance-flare for technical perfection, Martin told her it was “incorrect songwriting.” Not an insult exactly for Lorde, but one that only underscored how much she perceived Antonoff as a looser musical partner who wasn’t like the other guys.  Or is he really not like the others? As much as I feel constantly pitched on the idea that Antonoff isn’t a typical pop producer, the way music media treats him feels like just another fetishization of the old-school producer dynamic. You couldn’t confidently write off Melodrama as a collection of Antonoff songs, just as you can’t write off his collaborations with Lana Del Rey, St. Vincent, or other artists as women simply singing “his songs”—but it’s these kinds of assumptions that happen when a male producer chooses to be a celebrity. And when you consider the fact that successful women in this industry still struggle to establish their genius in the same ways men do (because, frankly, they’re quickly rewarded the distinction in spades), you wonder if Antonoff’s collaborators would benefit from him taking a bigger, less vocal step back.  Advertisement  No matter how nice he is, or respectful, or a good #ally—and as much as he may be unaware—Antonoff is assuming a historically authoritative position in pop music. Even if Antonoff is an unwitting participant, he exists in a system that will always inherently award him the position of being a pop mastermind when it comes to the collaborations he creates with women, who are ultimately the authors of their work but often treated as subjects. And the giddiness with which Antonoff speaks of his collaborations with Taylor Swift or Lorde or St. Vincent to a fawning press might come with the best of intentions, but his female collaborators ultimately have to work overtime to claim authorship.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1628

Fans believed he had taken the picture.  Cheryl - who is living at their £5.6million country home in Surrey - did not publicly respond to his message.  A source told MailOnline: 'Cheryl basically went into hibernation when she got pregnant and has made the decision to be a stay at home mother with no nanny and is looking after bear herself.

James also compliments the singer on his effortless style, with the pair switching outfits (Harry even ends up wearing a skintight, gold lamé shirt and string vest!).

a912d569-3d21-43e3-a611-05dd0ab536a2,"Not many people get to know celebrities beyond their public persona — but Sherry Lansing has worked with the best.  The former Paramount Studios CEO, and the first woman to ever be president of a major movie studio, is telling all in a new book about her life, Leading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker. Though she stepped away from Hollywood in 2005 after decades in the business, the former exec still fondly remembers her time there and opens up to PEOPLE about some of the movie superstars she worked with.  Read on for behind-the-scenes stories straight from the best source — the producer and exec who made the films.  Angelina Jolie’s life-changing moment  When Angelina Jolie was cast as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider, the studio felt she was a risky choice due to her wild-child reputation. But after the actress fought for the role, she immediately impressed the studio and the crew with her hard work and talent on camera.  “In the dailies, she was riveting,” Lansing recalls in the book. “She took what might have been a cardboard character and added a layer of mystery and emotion and humanity.”  BRENT STIRTON/GETTY  Jolie with Maddox in Cambodia in 2006  And Lansing says she was more than just impressive on film. The former executive got to witness Jolie begin her life as a philanthropist after working in Cambodia where the film was shot — and where she eventually ended up adopting her first son, Maddox, in 2002. The actress had already become involved with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at the time, for which she is now a Special Envoy, thanks to her trips to the Southeast Asian country.  “I saw it earlier on,” Lansing tells PEOPLE of Jolie’s passion for philanthropy. “Right after Tomb Raider, she was on my same flight out of London where she sat next to me. She had nothing with her but a backpack and she was going back to Cambodia to work with the refugees. She was always interested in causes bigger than herself and she always worked hard for those causes. She’s done amazing good to make the world a better place.”  Tom Cruise was like a “brother” to her  There were some people Lansing worked with whom she formed close relationships with — including Tom Cruise. She says she and Cruise were like “brother and sister” as they collaborated on movies like the Mission: Impossible franchise and War of the Worlds, while Cruise’s production company, Cruise/Wagner Productions, had an exclusive deal with Paramount.  “I knew Tom when he was a young boy when he was cast in Taps,” Lansing tells PEOPLE. “The Tom Cruise that I met all those years ago is the same person he is today — the hardest-working actor, brilliant, focused and kind. He’s nice to everyone and he treats everyone with respect.”  L. Cohen/WireImage  The two grew to trust each other, with, according to the book, Cruise coming to rescue in 2005 when Mission: Impossible II was delayed a year. When Lansing started panicking, since the sequel was supposed to be Paramount’s big summer blockbuster that year, Cruise repeatedly told her it was going to be okay. To her surprise, she got a call from Steven Spielberg about Paramount releasing War of the Worlds the very same weekend Mission: Impossible II was slated to open, therefore giving the studio exec the blockbuster she needed.  RELATED VIDEO: Mel Gibson’s Changing Looks!  After an early clash, Mel Gibson was ‘easy to work with’  The former exec worked closely with the then-novice director Mel Gibson on his breakout film Braveheart and got to experience a different side of the actor. After budget negotiations for the epic film got heated, Lansing says she admired the way Gibson was passionate about his work.  “We had this whole budget fight and at the end of the day I said to him, ‘I’m sure you have a dartboard where you have a picture of me,’ and he said, ‘No, you were doing your job and I was doing mine,’ ” Lansing tells PEOPLE. “He was so easy to work with and so passionate. He’s tireless in his hard work and he’s one of the most talented actors and one of the most brilliant directors in the business.”  Crown Archetype  Robert Redford sure can deliver a pickup line  Lansing has been on hand to witness filming on some of the greatest movies ever made, like Gibson’s epic war scenes in Braveheart and James Cameron‘s perfect recreation of the doomed Titanic ship. But the moments that stand out to her as the best are much smaller.  The former producer reveals one of the best moments on set for her was when Robert Redford perfectly delivered the pivotal question in Indecent Proposal. “I remember thinking that the movie would succeed or fail on whether or not he could pull that line off,” Lansing tells PEOPLE. “I was sitting in a corner near the camera, watching the first take, when Redford just threw the line away like he was asking someone for a cup of water. And I went, ‘Oh my God, that’s so brilliant, that’s genius.’ That moment when you see something come to life is so incredible.”  Leading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker, written by Stephen Galloway, is out now. Lansing will reveal more behind-the-scenes secrets on Friday, April 28 when she sits down with Galloway and Michael Douglas for a talk at the 92nd Street Y theater in New York City.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1069

Turns out Brad Pitt would have happily plunked down six figures for the honor.  Greg Doherty / Patrick McMullan / Getty Images / Kevin Mazur / Getty Images / .  On Saturday, Jan. 6, Brad joined celebs including Lena Dunham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Segel, Connie Britton, Patricia Arquette, Mark Burnett, Leonardo DiCaprio -- and ""GOT"" stars Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington -- at Milk Studios in Los Angeles for a gala to benefit Sean Penn's Haiti disaster recovery charity, the J/P HRO & Disaster Relief Organization.  According to the New York Post, the evening featured an auction where an Emilia-adjacent ""GOT"" viewing session was one of the prizes available to bidders.  Bidding reportedly started at $20,000 as the auctioneer teased the A-list crowd, hollering lines like , ""Is the King of the North here?!"" (The King of the North, it seems, had stepped out of the room to use the men's room.)  Brad, who is reportedly dating but still single since his split from Angelina Jolie, initially offered to pay $80,000 to watch the show with its dragon-mother star, then one-upped his own bid by offering to cough up $90,000. When Kit Harrington returned to the room, he threw an offer in the pot as well, according to the Post, a move that apparently inspired Brad to raise his bid to $120,000.  Ultimately, the actor lost out to another attendee who posted a $160,000 bid.  The annual event also used its platform to celebrate the environmental work Leonardo DiCaprio has been doing in the realm of climate change through his foundation.  ""The biggest challenge now is to make sure that everyone understands what's at stake. But how can we do this when we have a president who, just this week, proposed a massive increase in offshore drilling?"" Leo asked the crowd during his speech.  MediaPunch/REX/Shutterstock  He added: ""Their denial of so much of the scientific proof and evidence belongs in 'the Earth is flat' chapter of human history.""  Leo went on to praise Sean Penn for his aid and recovery work in Haiti.  ""These are obviously incredibly turbulent and scary times,"" Leo said. ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that has.""

cf5b3b4b-eab4-40ff-9dc5-47f97e3b99b9,"His sweet escape. Blake Shelton credits Gwen Stefani for getting him back on his feet following his divorce from Miranda Lambert. The country superstar opened up about his romance with the No Doubt frontwoman in a new interview with Billboard magazine.  As previously reported, Shelton told Stefani that he was splitting from Lambert during a meeting with their Voice coworkers. The “Misery” singer, who was new to the team at the time, got emotional.  “I won’t forget that day. I looked over at Gwen — who I didn’t really know — and she had these huge tears in her eyes. I thought, ‘Wow, she feels super bad for me!’” Shelton recalled. “She didn’t tell me much, because we didn’t know each other at the time, but she said, ‘I’m going through something very similar to what you’re going through. I understand. And I hate it.’”  Stefani was dealing with her own breakup at the time with Gavin Rossdale. (As Us Weekly exclusively revealed, the Bush rocker was cheating on her with their children’s nanny, Mindy Mann.) They announced they were ending their 13-year marriage in August 2015, one month after Shelton and Lambert announced they were divorcing after four years.  The “Came Here to Forget” singer and Stefani leaned on each other for support during the difficult time. The closer they got, the more Shelton saw Stefani in a new light.  “That’s kind of how our friendship and bond started, that day. It went from that, to checking in on each other once a week through email — ‘This s–t happened to me, what happened to you?’ — to maybe three times a week, then every day, to ‘Hey, here’s my phone number if you ever want to text,’” Shelton told Billboard. “Next thing I know, I wake up and she’s all I care about, and I’m ­wondering if she feels the same about me.”  “Gwen saved my life,” he added. “Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician? You can’t even imagine the similarities in our divorces.”  The two teamed up professionally too. Shelton included their collaborative track, “Go Ahead and Break My Heart,” on his 12th studio album, If I’m Honest.  “When we recorded the vocals for some of these songs, I was only six months removed from when all the crap went down,” Shelton said of his split from Lambert. “When you have a broken heart — at least, when I do — you got to get it out of your system. You want people to sympathize with you. I was at rock bottom, in the middle of hell.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

e86c86ea-5e8e-4f28-9529-bc0e082fa14f,"Immigration reform was a major component of President Barack Obama's campaign platform. He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.While watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. ""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.""We checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating.Obama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would ""strongly support"" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress.We searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the ""process moving this first year."" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.""Alas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a ""a very important step.""Finally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we""ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,"" said Obama.Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills.

The Wham! legend was filming a programme for Channel 4 in the UK when he died suddenly on Christmas Day 2016.  He finished compiling the documentary less than 36 hours before he died.  In the voiceover for the programme he said he felt “picked on my god” during his life.  Freedom, directed by George and his friend David Austin, chronicles the making of the 1990 album Listen Without Prejudice and the subsequent legal battle with his record label.  In a harrowing twist, the story of his life, now released posthumously, is narrated by George himself.  He recalls the death of his first love, Brazilian Anselmo Feleppa, who died of an AIDS related illness in 1993.  “It was the most frightening time of my life,” George says in the documentary.  “I was terrified of losing him. He was my saviour. Finding a companion at that time in my life changed me.”  He later says: “Then when my mum got cancer, I felt so bloody picked on by God.  “I took it very badly, very badly indeed. I’ve never felt that kind of depression.”  The pair met in a hotel lobby when they fell in love almost immediately.  The Mirror says of the programme: “George speaks very movingly about Anselmo being the first love of his life and how important he was in his life.  “It is very emotional and he clearly never forgot him and left a huge ­impression on George.”  RELATED: Woman gives birth to baby thanks to secret IVF donation by George Michael  The first trailer for the show, released last week, hears George describe how he was “terribly lonely” during the height of his stardom.

Stevie Wonder, Elton John, Ricky Gervais, Nile Rogers, Mark Ronson, Tracey Emin, Mary J. Blige, Jean Paul Gaultier, James Corden, Tony Bennett and Liam Gallagher also feature in the film.

There’s this line ‘picked the weeds but kept the flowers’ and I just live my life by that because you are who you surround yourself with,” she said.  “I was around some really negative people, and I got out of it because I had a lot of great people there too. It was a case of turning around, facing them and walking toward the light.”  Clarkson has since taken to social media to clarify her comments. “Just to clear something up. I wasn’t ever miserable because I had to be thin. I said I was miserable & as a result I became thin,” she tweeted.  “I’ve never contemplated suicide because of my weight.I said people had no idea I was unhappy oddly enough because I appeared healthy,” the singer added.

My life has been dedicated to dressing and addressing the needs of women, empowering them and promoting equal rights.”  “My statements were taken out of context and do not represent how I feel about the current situation concerning Harvey Weinstein. I believe that sexual harassment is NOT acceptable and this is an issue that MUST be addressed once and for all regardless of the individual.  “I am truly sorry to anyone that I offended and everyone that has ever been a victim.”  RELATED VIDEO: Harvey Weinstein Says Wife Georgina Chapman Is ‘Standing By’ Him as He Claims He ‘Never Laid a Glove’ on Ashley Judd  One of those who was offended by her comments was Rose McGowan, who reportedly reached a settlement with Weinstein after an alleged inappropriate incident.  McGowan — who previously branded Weinstein a “monster” – was shocked at Karan’s comments.  “Donna Karan you are a DEPLORABLE Aiding and abetting is a moral crime. You are scum in a fancy dress,” McGowan tweeted.  While celebrity chef and CNN star Anthony Bourdain also came out against Karan’s comments.  “To @dkny How many seventeen year olds have you dressed like they are, in your words, ‘asking for it’?” Bourdain also shared, along with a DKNY ad.

Following the allegations, the Oscar-winning film producer was removed from his powerhouse film studio The Weinstein Company.  “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go,” Weinstein said, adding that he was working with therapists and planned to take time off to “deal with this issue head-on.”  According to the NYT, Weinstein has reached at least eight settlements with women, including McGowan.

Things aren’t truthful. I feel like it’s taken [Caitlyn] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don’t expect her to be honest about my mom now. It’s so hurtful.” As a result, she’s not talking to Jenner right now.  Kim Kardashian taped the “Ellen DeGeneres Show” on Wednesday, and Gossip Cop has exclusive details from her first talk show interview since being robbed in Paris. We’re told she talked about that harrowing experience, how she no longer speaks to Caitlyn Jenner, and what she’s doing for Kanye West’s upcoming 40th birthday. Check out the videos below!  The audience member also leaks that Kardashian spoke to DeGeneres at length about the Paris robbery, saying that it “changed” her life. “I know this sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me. I feel like it was so meant to happen. I’m such a different person,” she shared. Kardashian continued, “My whole life as changed as far as how I travel and security. I never thought that I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry. If you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I’m traveling and I didn’t. Now, I have several, just for me to be able to sleep at night.” The reality star fully believed she was going to die, and now she no longer cares about possessions and materialistic items.  Kardashian also discussed life with her kids following the frightening ordeal in Paris, and said her 1-and-a-half year-old son Saint is her “10,” which the audience member understood to mean is a “perfect baby.” And, after DeGeneres asked about West and his well-being, Kardashian noted that the rapper’s 40th birthday is on June 8, and she’s still struggling with what she should do to mark his milestone. At that point, we’re told, the talk show host offered to host the entire Kardashian family for a one-hour birthday party. No word yet whether Kardashian will take DeGeneres up on the invitation.

Can we ever have peace in our time? Jennifer Aniston, 49 reportedly “extended an invitation” to sit down with Angelina Jolie, 42, over dinner, sources tell In Touch magazine. “Jen thought it was finally time to resolve the past,” an insider said, adding that since her marriage with Justin Theroux, 46, is over, Jen “wants a fresh start on all fronts.” However, Angelina supposedly turned the invite down! When Jen asked why Angie refused to meet her, the Girl, Interrupted star said “she didn’t owe her an apology,” per the source. “The whole idea to get together for dinner turned into a disaster.”  So, why did Angie go all Maleficent on Jen’s attempt to squash their beef? Well, Jen and Brad Pitt, 52, have reportedly rekindled their friendship following her spit from Justin. The two supposedly have these late night meetings, all set up by Brad’s bud George Clooney, 56, and it’s like old times again. Jen has reportedly found “closure” with Brad over leaving her for Angie in 2004, and an insider says, “there may even be a future for the two of them.”  The idea of Angie’s ex chilling with his other ex doesn’t sit well with her. “It’s gotten back to her that Brad and Jen are in each other’s lives again. She’s furious about it,” the insider tells In Touch. So much for these two burying whatever bad blood might be lingering between them. Angie once said that she would “welcome…a real sit-down-and-talk kind of meeting,” per Pop Sugar. That was back in 2006, and it seems that fans will have to wait a little bit longer before these two patch things up.  In the meantime, Jennifer may not linger too much on Angie’s alleged snub. She’s ready to move on past her split with Justin and into the next stage in her life. This, as it turns out, includes giving dating a whirl, and she’s looking for a younger man to put some excitement back into her life. Jen’s all about having fun “without falling in love,” a source close to Jennifer EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com.

It's the latest in impressive looks from the Duchess, who continues to impress even without a stylist, Vanity Fair reports. However, she does get style advice from Prince Harry, who occasionally weighs in on her looks.

As the Duke of Sussex addressed the crowd, he mentioned that his wife would be joining in on the work.  ""I, together with my wife Meghan, look forward to convening young people from around The Commonwealth to hear your ideas, work with you to build platforms for you to collaborate and form partnerships, as we travel around in our work, he said, per royal commentator Omid Scobie.

The news was first shared with the Queen the same day, just before Meghan boarded the train to Cheshire.  ‘It gave the Queen and Meghan a lot to talk about during their journey on the Royal Train together and there was lots of baby talk,’ reveals a source.  According to the insider, Harry has always been the Queen’s favourite and she’s taken a definite liking to Meghan – she sees a lot of herself in Meghan’s strength and tenacity.  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'actively trying' to start a family  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly 'having twins'  And to hear that they’re to be parents is exciting for Her Majesty.  ‘We haven’t seen the Queen that happy and that excited in a long time – it was wonderful to see,’ the insider revealed.  The source went on to say the mood has really continued throughout the palace since they returned. And no-one could be happier.  ‘Meghan’s still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.’  The royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.  ‘Harry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,’ revealed a source. ‘But the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.’  Meanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.  Last month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: ‘They’re desperate to have a family as soon as possible’.  So keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.  Getty  Given the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn’t want to wait to start a family.  ‘They actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  And Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young,’ he said back in 2012.  ‘I’m waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.’  In their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: ‘We will start a family in the near future,’ he said.  Thankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.  ‘Meghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,’ she said.

An onlooker confirms to PEOPLE that Kendall, 21, and Kylie, 20, spent Sunday evening at Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights in Hollywood, accompanied by Scott, 25, and Griffin, 28. The foursome was also joined by Jordyn Woods, 20, and Hailey Baldwin, 20.  “Kylie and Kendall were both extremely loving and cuddly with their boyfriends,” the onlooker says. “Both couples had their arms around each other, and the girls were really sweet with their guys. Travis and Kylie were especially cute and lovey-dovey. Kendall and Blake had a blast going through the mazes together.”  While there were certain rides pregnant Kylie couldn’t go on, she “made sure Travis went ahead and had fun,” says the onlooker, adding that the reality star kept her belly “under wraps in a big hoodie and leggings.”  Kendall and Griffin, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, have been hanging out since August.

As it turns out, there was quite a sentimental reason before the sartorial statement. Appearing on Ellen yesterday, Gosling confirmed that the beloved canine had recently passed away at the age of seventeen. ""He was a good friend to me,"" Gosling told Ellen Degeneres during the sit-down. ""There was something about George where he always—I think he felt being a dog was beneath him. He would not do tricks. if you wanted him to sit down you would have to convince him that it was in his best interest.""  Fans of the actor will be familiar with just how close the pair were—George even appeared alongside Gosling during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few years back. Gosling took Friday's stint on Ellen to share some of his other favorite memories of the canine. ""One time we were at an outdoor restaurant and he was sort of sitting on the pavement, looking forlorn down the street,” he shared. “Someone got up to go to the restroom, and I guess he’d had enough, and he got up on their seat and sat down at the table like a gentleman and looked around the table, like, ‘Yeah, that’s right.’”  In brighter Gosling news, his film Bladerunner 2049 , for which he's been on the promo circuit for over the past few weeks, opened in theaters on Friday after much anticipation to generally favorable reviews.

b2307703-a380-4ab7-a91f-7e44f7132f0f,"athy Griffin went off the rails again in another classless display that shows why her career as a comedian hasn’t been as successful as other well-known people much more successful than her.This time Griffin made repulsive comments that have people wondering if she has transitioned to the other gender while she’s been quietly hiding in the backend of the spotlight. In other words, she once again made remarks that would go viral, putting her back in the spotlight, but it’s in such a negative way that most people had to shake their heads and say “eeeeewwwwwww” right after what she said to the Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.Gidley and Griffin were at the same event and Gidley was passing by the table she was sitting at. Griffin snapped at him by asking how he sleeps at night. Gidley replied that he sleeps well and said thanks. Then it seems like she said something else, and he asked if they were going to go at it right there on the spot, and that’s when Griffin went into the full nasty mode and talked with a repulsive next few words that had people questioning her behavior and gender at the same time.Here’s what happened in full detail courtesy of the Washington Blade: “The event is a celebration of the First Amendment. As a longtime LGBT rights advocate, a comedian and provocateur, Griffin has made a long and successful career out of exercising her First Amendment right to free speech. The stunt last year in which she posed with a mock severed head of Donald Trump — which needlessly led CNN to fire her from a longstanding New Year’s Eve hosting gig with Anderson Cooper — was a textbook case of satire, which is constitutionally protected speech.Thus, the decision to invite Griffin proved an easy and obvious one. (We also invited Stormy Daniels, but her attorney, Michael Avenatti, told me without irony that it would be too much of a “sideshow” for her to attend.)Trending: Sarah Sanders Just Revealed What She Asked God For After Being Publicly Humiliated At WH DinnerGriffin didn’t disappoint, bringing her quick wit and fearless, LGBT-centric sense of humor to the dinner table. I met her and her boyfriend, Randy Bick, on the red carpet and held her purse as she posed for photographers and granted a series of TV interviews. Inside the heavy purse was a stapler; it turns out she suffered a last-minute wardrobe malfunction leaving the hotel, breaking a strap on her gown. After it was repaired, she feared a repeat and asked to borrow the stapler, just in case.She proved a good sport throughout the night, posing for an endless stream of selfies with (mostly gay) fans who congratulated her on surviving the Trump machine’s attacks in the aftermath of the photo scandal. When asked how her famous mom Maggie is at age 96, Griffin replied, “drunk.”The only awkward moment came when Deputy White House Press Secretary Hogan Gidley tried to squeeze past our table. Griffin stopped him and said, “How do you sleep at night?” Gidley replied, “Very well, thank you.” When Griffin expressed doubt about that, Gidley asked, “Are we really going to do this?”That’s when things got interesting. Griffin, in her trademark style, retorted, “Yes we are, suck my d-ck! No, really, suck my d-ck!”There was some back-and-forth, then Gidley, who was holding a Tecate, announced he was off to enjoy his Mexican beer “before we build the wall and you can’t get these anymore.” That prompted a farewell “f-ck you” from Griffin, triggering nervous laughter around our table.”It sure sounds like they had a fun time exchanging comments before Kathy Griffin took it to the levels of a unprofessionalism, acting exactly like the person who couldn’t hold a job with the Squatty Potty.Even though she claims to be a comedian, there’s still a level of professionalism that people should exude when they’re not on stage. Griffin has been unable to differentiate that and consistently confuses real life for her stage life (or lack thereof).Griffin might have some fans, but she’s constantly finding ways to lose them with her inability to act decently in public and her outrageous attempts to place herself in the spotlight.She’s in the spotlight again, but it’s not the type of spotlight a celebrity should want to be in since this doesn’t seem to be a way to gain new fans.After her generic low-brow comments, some people might jokingly question if Kathy Griffin is a man.

The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I’m not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful…all of that confusion has left me….I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how—when he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing…you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.

2ff461d9-b1d1-4462-9af6-38b1537a4683,"Justin Bieber Got Engaged.. Selena Gomez is upset  Selena Gomez was “surprised” to hear about Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin‘s engagement.  Over the weekend, the 24-year-old “Baby” singer proposed to the 21-year-old model while on vacation in the Bahamas. Shortly after news of her ex’s engagement broke on Sunday, Gomez was spotted smiling on a boat with her pals in New York City.  “Selena was surprised an engagement happened this quickly but not surprised Justin would do something like this knowing who he is. At the end of the day though she doesn’t really care,” one source tells us. “Selena is totally over him. She had tried again to make it work that last time and it didn’t work out.”  Now let’s talk about Justin Bieber and Selena-  Justin Bieber and Selena were a very good friend and were coming to hear that Justin Bieber would also engage with Selena but it did not happen.  “Selena is definitely on a different path right now and in a much better place since Justin is out of the picture. Mentally, she is done with him,” the insider continues. “She isn’t focused on dating as much as she’s just really focusing on herself. She’s happy right now just spending time with her girlfriends and going to church.”  When Bieber and Gomez parted ways in March 2018, a source told that Gomez was ready to move on, saying, “Selena realized even though he’s made some positive improvements, they just aren’t a perfect match right now.” However, this reportedly wasn’t the case for Bieber, with a source claiming to People, “He thinks and talks about Selena all the time — the chapter with her is definitely not finished… They weren’t getting along and decided to take a break.”  However, it seems as though Bieber is finally moving on from Gomez.  Justin Bieber Hot Engaged-  Justin Bieber is engaged and surprise, surprise — it’s not to his on-again/off-again love interest Selena Gomez.  The Stratford, Ont.-born pop star proposed on Saturday to his girlfriend of about one month, model Hailey Baldwin, according to several media sources. The singer confirmed the news on his Instagram feed Monday that they are, indeed, getting married.  read more…",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,443
01859fca-9270-4a17-ac5b-fc28b2469404,"Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle seem to be two of the biggest fashion icons of the moment. Though they have both worn some memorable ensembles, it looks like Markle may have had a bigger year than her royal sister-in-law when it comes to influencing the latest trends.  Both duchesses made it onto global fashion search platform Lyst's new ranking of the most powerful celebrity fashion influencers of the year, with Markle landing in a higher spot on the list than Middleton.  The list was generated by tracking more than 100 million searches and using sales data, page views, and social media mentions to determine each celebrity's influence. Kylie Jenner nabbed the top spot on the list, followed by her sister Kim Kardashian West.  Markle was found to be the third most popular celebrity fashion influencer of 2018  Boat neck dresses have become one of Markle's signature styles.

Markle caused a spike in searches for tuxedo dresses. WPA Pool/Getty Images  Middleton may have landed lower on the list than her new sister-in-law, but her influence is still going strong  The data showed that the bright pink Mulberry coat she wore in January inspired over 10,000 searches that month. The coat was actually first seen in 2014, proving that her penchant for outfit recycling still maintains its influence.  Read more:35 stunning looks Kate Middleton repeats again and again  Middleton's bright pink coat was a huge hit. Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images  A Brand Finance survey from back in October named Middleton as the most popular royal influencer of the year, so results seem to vary based on the data. It's also worth noting that Middleton was out on royal maternity leave for much of the year after giving birth to Prince Louis in April, so she debuted fewer new looks than Markle.

Bundy wore Hey Lady pumps featuring floral details on the heels and earrings and bracelet by Brooke Worthington Jewelry.

Ellen DeGeneres grilled Jenner when the reality star appeared on her talk show, asking her about her discreet tattoos. Turns out, she wasn’t exactly clearheaded while deciding to get inked on her inner lip back in July 2016.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Before carefully exposing the hidden tattoo (Jenner took pains not smudge her statement lipstick), the model told DeGeneres, “I was drunk! I was not thinking clearly.”  The host also inquired about the 22-year-old’s choice of phrase: the word “meow.”  “It was literally the first thing that came to my mind,” she explained. “I don’t know, just my drunk thoughts.”  Despite DeGeneres’ hesitation, Jenner noted that the location of her tattoo minimalized the pain. The body art done on her fingers where there’s bone, however, hurt a bit, Jenner said.  The talk show star examined the tattoos on Jenner’s fingers, a heart and a dot, done in white ink to be inconspicuous.  “I just wanted to know what it felt like,” Jenner explained when asked why she would elect to have barely visible artwork done. “All my friends have them. I was like, ‘I just want to know what it feels like.’ “  Kendall Jenner JonBoy Tattoo/Instagram  Unlike many who get tattoos with special significance, the model previously wrote on her website that her inner lip ink was just for fun — despite older sister Kim Kardashian West’s advice to never “put a bumper sticker on a Bentley.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kendall Jenner Opens Up About Her Golden Globes Acne: ‘Never Let That S— Stop You!’  “There’s no real meaning behind it, I just wanted to be able to say that I have a tattoo ‘on my face,’ ” she said. “I have two others also: a broken heart on one hand and a full heart on the other.”  Jenner continued, “I definitely want more and even though I used to say I’d only get one if it meant something to me, now I have even more possibilities!”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,428

Kailyn Lowry shared her relationship regrets and revealed that she was “hooking up” with ex-husband Javi Marroquin while they considered a reconciliation.  The Teen Mom 2 star opened up about her relationship with Marroquin in a series of tweets on Saturday, June 2. “Javi & I talked about getting back together at one point. Why? I don’t know because we both knew we didn’t want to & it would never work,” she revealed. “I regret even having those conversations. I regret filming about it. And hooking up w him as I know people from the reunion leaked that.”  2- Javi & i talked about getting back together at one point. Why?

And hooking up w him as i know people from the reunion leaked that. — Kailyn Lowry (@KailLowry) June 3, 2018  Marroquin, 25, recently announced that he is expecting a child with girlfriend Lauren Comeau, and Lowry wished them well, adding: “That being said, I am wishing him and his new family the best. I have no hard feelings about the baby whatsoever despite what people are saying.”  Lowry spoke to Us Weekly exclusively about the situation. “Being on the show for so long, I get the ability to look back (literally) at decisions I’ve made and really reflect on my life. There are a lot of things I’ve been regretting lately,” she told Us. “As for Javi, the timeline is so messy. I regret ever revisiting our past and even speaking about a reconciliation. We’ve always made better friends than romantic partners. And I do wish him and his family the best.”  The reality TV star also tweeted that she is now choosing to focus on herself and removing all “toxic people and situations” from her life. “For anyone, fans & supporters included, that I’ve hurt or offended, I apologize,” she added. “Sometimes I have to look at a situation & be honest with myself & I don’t think I’ve handled things the right way lately. Soooo I’m starting over.”  Alluding to her relationship with ex-girlfriend Dominique Potter, she added: “Also – don’t lead people on. I’ve been lead on & I’ve lead people on. Nobody benefits from it. Hooking up with someone else won’t get you over your ex.”  Marroquin reunited with Comeau this March after previously dating. He had been in a relationship with Teen Mom 2 star Briana DeJesus, but they split in January.

54f30227-7acb-40ac-961e-267866ddfd87,"Charlize Theron just might be entering the world of Wonder Woman after all.  After scheduling issues made the actress turn down a role in the DC Extended Universe film, it appears that she's very open to appearing in Wonder Woman 2. During a panel at last month's San Diego Comic-Con, Theron addressed the possibility of reuniting with Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins - who previously teamed up with the actress in Monster.  ""Look I would love to work with her again."" Theron revealed. ""I had such an incredible time. I trusted her from the first time I met her. That’s a big thing for an actor, to be able to trust your director that way and she just never disappointed. She’s incredible so to see her have this moment, I just feel incredibly happy for her."" Considering the success of 2003's Monster - which earned Theron a Best Actress Oscar - a reunion between the two in Wonder Woman 2 feels like a no-brainer. While nothing is currently confirmed, Jenkins appears to agree, judging by a letter Theron was given at the SDCC panel.  ""Getting to work with Charlize and what we did together will always be remembered as a great high point of my life."" Jenkins explained. ""She’s a tremendous person, talent, artist, and actor, but also a wonderful and incredibly unique spirit who brings that dynamism to every part she plays. She’s hard, yet soft, tough, yet yielding. It was a wonderful and rare gift and I can’t wait to work with my friend again one day."" Ultimately, time will tell if Theron is officially cast in Wonder Woman 2. But it's definitely worth noting that both she and Jenkins are on board with the idea.  Wonder Woman has an 86.52 ComicBook.com Composite Score and a 4.33 out of 5 ComicBook.com User Rating, making it the fourth-highest ranked comic book movie of all time among ComicBook.com readers.

After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction.

83aba305-16e5-4bc3-bee0-f349d7d9d5d2,"The magazine report that has shocked US fans today. Closer magazine (US)  The Hollywood couple are famously unmarried and have an “elasticity” to their relationship, but that doesn’t mean they don’t still argue and things have got bad enough for them to call their whole relationship off.  An insider told American Closer magazine: “Their open relationship got complicated. It led to a separation which was a real game changer in their relationship. The day she left Kurt was their greatest test.”  Goldie and Kurt met on the set of 1983 movie Swing Shift and they quickly established an unconventional set of boundaries for their relationship. They never married but they had a son, Wyatt, 31, in 1986, and both had children from previous relationships.  One of the hiccups in their relationship came in 2004 when Goldie flew to India where she met the dashing former Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan, making Kurt jealous.  The insider added: “Kurt was in a mood yelling at his co-stars. They were both acting out a little, and he was on a jealousy kick that hadn’t really shown itself. They called an adult time out to get some space so tempers would cool.”  Kurt told Goldie he didn’t want to see her for a while, and the source explained: “She was really worried and she headed to their house in Malibu while Kurt stayed at their home in the Pacific Palisades. It was rough.”  The insider told Closer that ultimately the couple made up again and decided their relationship was for the long haul, and their children were a big part of that decision.  The source added: “They move forward and don’t dwell on the past. They forgive themselves and each other for their failings and they preach to their kids to be forgiving too.”  Goldie and Kurt have yet to comment on Closer's allegations.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,358
af8d2e7d-e781-4f46-a14f-94a88ca0ae4f,"Michelle Williams said “yes”! The actress has been quietly dating New York financier Andrew Youmans, and though they’ve yet to make an official public appearance together, it’s the real deal. In fact, multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly that the pair are engaged!  “She wants a good guy and a stable family life,” says the insider.  The All the Money in the World star set off engagement speculation when she showed up at the Golden Globes on January 7 with a heart-shaped diamond ring on that finger. At the time, she brushed off the accessory as simply “beautiful jewelry.”  Williams, 37, also sported the ring while wearing a red one-piece and floppy straw hat at the beach in the Bahamas, where she spent New Year’s Day with Youmans and Matilda, her 12-year-old daughter with the late Heath Ledger.  Notoriously private about her personal life following Ledger’s tragic death from an accidental overdose nearly 10 years ago on January 22, 2008, the Montana-native has not commented publicly on her relationship with the Harvard Business School alum, 50. The pair were first spotted together in July in Rome, where she was filming the Golden Globe nominated Money. Williams beamed as they strolled down the street hand-in-hand, stopping occasionally to kiss and sample local food.  When Ledger died at age 28 a few weeks after he and Williams broke up, Matilda was just 2. Following the tragedy, friends say the Brooklyn-based actress was hesitant to date again. “Michelle was totally focused on giving Matilda the best upbringing possible,” says pal. Besides, says another, “It took her a long time to get over Heath.”  Over the years, Williams has had a few low-key relationships, including with director Spike Jonze, actor Jason Segel and, most recently, author Jonathan Safran Foer. But her most enduring relationship is with her best friend and frequent awards show date, actress Busy Philipps, who Williams has referred to as “the love of my life.”  For more on Williams’ journey back to love, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly on stands now.

In a bombshell world exclusive, a top Interpol source claimed they have connected the diamonds snatched from Kardashian’s Paris hotel suite during a brazen Oct. 3 robbery to shady moneymen with ties to radical Islamic terrorists.  French police have busted 17 suspects allegedly involved in the heist, and authorities have connected that gang to black-market dealers in Antwerp, Belgium.  Most of the world’s diamonds pass through the city, where underground brokers are notorious for mixing “dirty” stolen stones with “clean” gems for resale.  PHOTOS: Kim’s Hellhole EXPOSED! Inside The Paris Apartment Where Kardashian Was Attacked  Antwerp’s illicit marketplace is a hotbed for devious money-laundering schemes — with profits going to fund violent terrorists around the globe, according to the Financial Action Task Force, an elite band of bean counters that tracks terrorist funds.  “There’s reason to believe the jewelry stolen from Kim Kardashian is going directly into the coffers of terror groups,” said a European official involved in tracking terror groups’ funding.  What’s more, David Levine, a professor at the University of California-Berkeley who’s published works on terrorism, confirmed, “Violent groups are funded by black-market gems.”  PHOTOS: Kim On Lockdown! Kardashian’s Inner Circle Swarms NYC Pad  Kardashian’s nightmare unfolded last fall, when robbers forced their way into the private Paris residence where she was staying.  They tied her up, held her at gunpoint and then locked her in a bathroom before making off with $10 million worth of jewelry, including her 20-carat emerald-cut diamond engagement ring.  Mixing 36-year-old Kardashian’s stolen jewels with fair-trade diamonds makes them almost impossible to trace, and it’s unlikely she’ll ever get them back, our sources said.

People has the first photo from the wedding, which shows Dugal in a sleeveless, V-neck white gown by Morilee and carrying a white bouquet, with McCreery wearing a basic black tuxedo.

ce65db51-4284-4e7d-8460-26de9836c6c4,"Warner Bros. put a spell on Harry Potter fans Tuesday with the release of the first trailer for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.”  In the trailer, Eddie Redmayne returns as the charmingly clumsy Newt Scamander, while Jude Law makes his Wizarding World debut as a young Albus Dumbledore. It’s teased that Scamander is acting under orders from Dumbledore to head to Paris, but as the future-Hogwarts headmaster notes, Scamander isn’t one for taking orders well.  The David Yates film follows Dumbledore and Scamander, his former student, as they join forces to recapture an escaped Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is on a mission to dominate all non-magical people with the help of his pureblood wizard followers.  “I can’t move against Grindelwald,” Dumbledore tells Scamander in the clip. “It has to be you.”  The trailer debuted amid casting controversy surrounding Depp, who was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in court filings. J.K. Rowling, the Harry Potter author who wrote the screenplays for both “Fantastic Beasts” movies, has since defended the decision to cast Depp on Twitter, citing both Heard’s and Depp’s desires to move on.  “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” marks Yates’ fifth foray into the Wizarding World. He previously directed the last four movies in the original Harry Potter franchise, as well as the first “Fantastic Beasts” installment. His is set to direct the remaining three movies rounding out the “Fantastic Beasts” saga, with Rowling continuing on as a screenwriter. “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” hits theaters Nov. 16.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,315
25dab0e3-ad3b-4c3a-9556-b0bd25831668,"[This article contains spoilers from the April 16 series finale of HBO's Girls.]  So here's how I'm looking at the series finale of Girls and you may choose to disagree or view things however you like:  Last week's episode, fittingly titled ""Goodbye Tour,"" was the true series finale of Girls. Written by Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham and directed beautifully by Nisha Ganatra, it brought the friendship between Hannah (Dunham), Marnie (Allison Williams), Shosh (Zosia Mamet) and Jessa (Jemima Kirke) to a lovely resting spot at Shosh's engagement party. Hannah looking at her friends dancing each in their own distinctive ways — Jessa like nobody was watching, Marnie like everybody was watching and Shosh fixated on a groom-to-be introduced to audiences and Hannah just seconds earlier — before departing New York City for a job that every think piece posted on the Internet in the past seven days has already told you doesn't exist in our current academic climate and wouldn't have gone to Hannah anyway, was a perfect end for the series.  The previous couple of episodes had also given many of the show's characters their own effective places of repose. With Shosh as accidental matchmaker, Ray (Alex Karpovsky) found love, somebody whose idiosyncrasies matched his own. Elijah (Andrew Rannells) somehow got the lead in the musical of White Men Can't Jump and maybe he and Dill Harcourt are together. And I guess Adam ends up with Jessa, at least for a while, and even if you think that mercurial relationship isn't good for the long haul, Adam Driver's scenes with Dunham/Hannah in the antepenultimate episode were as well-acted as any in the show's entire run. (I'm glad this season has helped a lot of detractors recognize how good an actress Lena Dunham has become over the six seasons of Girls. This isn't a Jerry Seinfeld situation. I don't care if you like or hate Hannah, but Dunham slayed all 10 episodes.)  If you wanted to sum up the series with Hannah's half-apology to Jessa, ""Think about it. We were all just doing our best,"" and Jessa's reply, ""Our best was awful,"" that's a pretty amusing way to do it. Or you can sum the show up in Elijah's braying laughter between sentences of the declaration, ""Hannah, you've made so many wonderful friendships here. That's not a thing!""  All season long, Girls has been sending itself off in the peak of style, delivering one top-notch episode after another. I'm not ready yet to step back and say this was the show's best season or that any individual episode was the show's best episode, but in the balance, from Hannah and Paul-Louis in the Hamptons to the Desi nightmare in Poughkeepsie to the Elijah-centric musical audition episode to Hannah's and Adam's brief dream reconciliation to the brief and triumphant return of Patrick Wilson's doctor character, the highlights have been myriad. And that's without getting to ""American Bitch,"" the two-hander with Matthew Rhys that probably would get the most Best Episode Yet votes.  Let's take the nine episodes as a build-up to last week's finale and then we don't need to stress about what our expectations were or weren't for the last installment.  Because let's be honest: There wasn't anything that Girls owed me (or you) in Sunday's finale. Most of the characters got the send-offs they deserved. There were absolutely no mysteries to be solved or outstanding questions that needed answering or anything that so many Peak TV finales have needed to accomplish when they neared the end. There was no question as to whether Hannah was going to die, whether the CIA was ever going to catch Shosh or whether Adam was going to get that out-of-the-blue phone call from Ron Howard launching his acting career into the stratosphere. Anything you really wanted or deserved from a finale came last week when the four main characters crammed themselves into a bathroom and argued about why they haven't been good friends to each other for a while.  Sunday's episode, ""Latching,"" was an epilogue. It was a postscript. It was a ""Here's what life looks like for a little bit until we get around to checking back in on these characters.""  If you wanted fireworks or epic dramatic outbursts, I'm sure you were disappointed. If you wanted an exceptional and intimate three-hander with Hannah, Marnie and Hannah's mom Loreen (Becky Ann Baker), plus occasional outbursts by an adorable baby named Grover? Well, if you wanted specifically that exact thing, I'm sure you loved it. This is close enough to what I wanted, personally.  If last week's episode did most of the things a good series finale does, ""Latching"" did probably the one thing last week's episode didn't do, specifically tying us back into the pilot.  The series began, remember, with Hannah's parents setting Hannah adrift, telling her that she wouldn't get any more financial support and that she was on her own trying to make it in the big city. It was nothing if not a forcible unlatching from the paternal teat. Sunday's finale, which Konner directed from a script she co-wrote with Dunham and Judd Apatow.... Well, you don't need me to explain. Hannah's neurotic fears that Grover wouldn't suckle related to Hannah's ongoing fears about her difficulties being maternal and then, after a marvelous Loreen lecture, Hannah wandering the streets, coming upon a high school girl fleeing from her mother's protective care and going into maternal overdrive herself. Having ranted at the girl — ""She'll take care of you forever, even if it means endless, endless pain"" — Hannah returned home and Grover finally latched as the show eschewed a closing credits song for the sounds of an encouraging mom, a nursing baby and the mumbling singing of a woman with ""Fast Car"" stuck in her head.  ""Fast Car"" was stuck in Hannah's head because of Marnie's dogged insistence on singing it in the car and the finale was an unexpectedly big showcase for Marnie. This is good if you're a fan of Marnie and bad if you're a Marnie hater and if you're still a Marnie hater.... Good grief! What's wrong with you? Last year's ""The Panic in Central Park"" was designed to eliminate the last people not marveling at what a singular portrait of altruistically self-absorbed exceptionalism Williams and the writers have crafted.  It's hilarious that while thematically ""Unlatched"" was one big callback to the pilot, the specific callbacks almost all related to Marnie, introduced in the series just as she was in this episode: spooning in bed with Hannah. As in the pilot, when Marnie's idea of role-playing was to suggest to Charlie that he try being somebody entirely different from himself, we got to see more of Marnie's horridness at forced raunch as her isolation in rural New York left her having FaceTime sex with a personal trainer from Weehawken, which included flight attendant/captain dirty talk at its worst (""Do you think I should use the oxygen mask on his dick?"").  Marnie's abrupt announcement that she wanted to move in with Hannah and help her raise the baby was pretty much vintage Marnie, since we already knew that Marnie lost her apartment and was facing life with her mother. It was pure kindness and pure personal desperation. And her strategy for getting Hannah to give in was also vintage Marnie, starting with, ""You think you have a lot of friends, right?"" followed by proof that Hannah's other friends were all absent, at best.  ""I'm here. I win. I'm your best friend,"" Marie squealed with glee and all Marnie has ever wanted since the pilot is to have Hannah's undivided best friend attention when she wants/needs it.  Marnie living with Hannah, if only for a few months, was exactly right and then it was also exactly right for her to start wondering about herself again at the end and also to decide that law school might be a good idea because, ""I f—ing love rules.""  Yup. That's our Marnie.  This was a ideal finale for Girls because taken in the right frame of mind, it offered the heart and humor that marked the show at its best and gave all three actresses many moments to shine. But if you take it in the wrong frame of mind, if you demand that after last week's closure you get even more closure, it was probably an easy finale to hate and what could be more Girls than that?  So now let Dunham and Konner and Apatow take a few years to do other things. The Girls Think Piece Industrial Complex will either dry up or move on to The Handmaid's Tale or Kevin Can Wait or something.  Then it will be time to move this production to the big screen.

0117b99f-39cf-42bb-aba7-d3eebde67568,"Kate Hudson Net Worth: Kate Hudson is an American actress who has a net worth of $38 million dollars. Born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California, US, she came to prominence in 2001 with her incredible turn in Almost Famous. This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Being a daughter of American actress Goldie Hawn, Hudson bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother in both looks and onscreen vivacity. She got the chance to showcase her talent in 1996, when she made her TV debut on Fox's TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career in Hollywood. However, it was in 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. Onwards, her career experienced a significant advancement, especially after she managed to obtain a supporting role in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both came up in 2000. While her accolade-worthy performance in Cameron Crowe's Almost Famous indicated that she was set to follow her mother in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama The Four Feathers in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003). She continued to establish herself as a fully-fledged actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008) and Bride Wars (2009). As of most recent, she could be seen in the musical comedy-drama television series Glee as Cassandra July.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,414

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Celebrities have always raised eyebrows over their religion of choice – for Tom Cruise and John Travolta it's Scientology, while the likes of Madonna and Ashton Kutcher were proud followers of Kabbalah for a long time.  And now it's Justin Bieber's turn to spark controversy with his reported closeness to Hillsong Church, a global strand of Christianity that looks to recruit followers with music, dancing and community care projects.  But Hillsong has also faced accusations that it acts as a cult, as well as allegedly having attempted to cover up the child abuse allegations levelled against its founder's father.  It is also accused of pushing its congregations to donate cash and of using Bible verses selectively to set its own agenda.  So what is Hillsong Church? How is Bieber involved? And why do so many of its detractors believe it's a modern-day cult?  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  Hillsong and child abuse  Brian Houston, who founded the Pentecostal Christian movement in Australia, stood down his own father, William 'Frank' Houston, as a preacher in 1999 after hearing an allegation that Frank had sexually abused a seven-year-old boy.  In a letter sent to church leaders in 2001, Brian claimed that there was no reason for the information to be spread any further afield, prompting claims of an attempted cover-up when the letter was leaked.  ""Sadly there are always one or two people with their own agendas who will try and get mileage from other people's pain,"" Brian's missive told ministers.  Frank would go on to leave Hillsong and died of a stroke in 2004. Fresh allegations that he'd molested six other children in New Zealand in previous decades continued to dog the organisation.  An investigation by Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found none of the allegations against Frank Houston were ever reported to police.  The commission's report found Frank had sexually abused the seven-year-old boy, and had later admitted it to an assembly of church executives.  Hillsong 'using selective Bible verses' to encourage hefty donations  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  Those who have been to Hillsong services report that leaders are swift to imply followers must give as much money as they can to the church.  In Hillsong's own FAQs, there are six different ways to donate money listed - including using the church's own app to transfer money immediately. There are also calls on its website to set up a direct deposit or have an online account so cash can be sent electronically.  As with many other churches, Hillsong followers will find empty envelopes left on their chairs ahead of services to be filled with money or standing order forms, which are collected up by staff. Collection buckets are also sent around the church during a service, with the congregation urged to dig deep.  Hillsong also uses Bible verses, such as Proverbs, to encourage its followers to donate generously. ""The godly love to give,"" its own site quotes.  The movement is big on ""the Biblical principle of tithing"", which requests that believers donate the first ten per cent of their income to the church.  ""Tithes and Offerings received at Hillsong fund the vision and activities of our church,"" says Hillsong.  The 2016 Hillsong Church annual report found donations made up over half of its revenue - with another 19% stemming from the dozens of Christian rock albums it produces.  Hillsong and homosexuality  Hillsong does not believe in homosexuality, in line with the Old Testament, nor does it agree with equal marriage. When a director of one of its church's choir was found to be in a committed gay relationship, Hillsong's founder issued a statement clarifying that the news came as ""a complete surprise"".  In a blog post, Brian Houston told his followers: ""Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles.  ""Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.""  Justin Bieber was accused of homophobia in 2016 after reportedly turning down a role in Uber Girl, reportedly because his character would have a sex scene with another man, the film's co-writer Pete O'Neill claimed.  However, Bieber's rep said at the time there was ""no truth"" to his being offered the role in the first place.  Speaking in tongues  (Image: Splash News)  The act of speaking in tongues - or in a language that needs a special person to interpret - has long been associated with the Pentecostal churches.  ""We believe that in order to live the holy and fruitful lives that God intends for us, we need to be baptised in water and be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit,"" the church states on its site.  ""The Holy Spirit enables us to use spiritual gifts, including speaking in tongues.""  But many Christians believe it amounts to 'false worship' and 'showmanship', including members of a Facebook group who claim to be former followers of Hillsong.  One member, who said they had been involved in Hillsong for a few years in their early twenties, said church elders believed those who had been 'saved' would be given the gift of speaking in tongues.  (Image: carllentz/Instagram)  They also claimed to have been disturbed by one pastor's 'healing' service.  ""A visiting pastor performed a 'healing' show, calling out people wanting healing to the stage,"" they recalled.  ""Some people went up and were 'healed'. This didn't sit right with me because there was a wheelchair bound person in the room who was ignored. Was this beyond God's power? Could God only heal afflictions that have no visible sign of it actually being healed? How must that wheelchair bound person have felt? I imagine he'd be thinking 'my faith must not be good enough yet'.""

According to GQ, the troubled pop star moved into Carl's home after a period of car-crash media stories and reputational crisis. While he was there the two ""worked through some stuff"" and Bieber cried that he ""wanted to know Jesus"" before begging on his knees to be baptised.  He's since attended Hillsong services and conferences - and was even suspected of cancelling the rest of his Purpose world tour in July 2017 so he could found his own branch of the church.  Pandering to celebrities  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  It's not just Bieber who's known to follow Hillsong - his friends Kendall Jenner, Hailey Baldwin and ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez have also been linked to the religious movement.  While it attracts a cool, millennial-focused crowd, Hillsong believes all souls need to 'know Jesus' - but celebrities appear to have a special place in its pecking order.  ""People say we cater to celebrities and I say, yes, we do,"" Pastor Carl told GQ.  ""Celebrities deserve a relationship with God. Celebrities deserve a place to pray.""  Is Hillsong a cult?  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  The church elders have batted away accusations that the movement is a cult - certainly, its followers seem to have made up their own minds about it.  But many of the movement's detractors claim Hillsong's focus on charismatic preachers, music and song-based performances, and its push for funds and donations give the church a sinister spin.  However, Bobbie Houston, who helped husband Brian found Hillsong, has previously denied any cult claims, insisting followers simply wish to worship their god.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1547

03ba95ef-bf2e-4cd4-9c4a-fc477e39b2af,"Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.  Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  ""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said. ""How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.""  Holliday was to perform at the ""Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration"" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,594

af425d36-cd3e-4dca-8671-9b4c2b88dea0,"The Kardashian-Simpson feedback loop continues. According to Inside Edition, O.J. Simpson—who is up for parole this October after serving the first nine years of a 33-year prison sentence on 12 charges, including kidnapping and armed robbery—has received comparatively cushy treatment while incarcerated. He has even found a new favorite show. You may have heard of it: Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  A former prison guard told the newsmagazine that Simpson “likes Keeping Up with the Kardashians.” More specifically: “He likes to keep up with all the gossip with them.”  Last year, The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story illuminated the ties between the Simpson family and the Kardashian clan for casual fans who may not have been aware of their connection—largely helped by David Schwimmer’s “Juice!”-y performance as the late Kardashian patriarch, Robert. Robert, father of Kim, Kourtney, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian, was one of Simpson’s best friends; his first wife (and the mother of his children), Kris, was very close with the slain Nicole Brown Simpson. (Regrettably, Simpson has not seen American Crime Story, reports Inside Edition, “because the prison doesn’t get the FX network.”)  At the time A.C.S. was airing, Kim Kardashian West told GQ that she “loved” the FX drama. She also revealed that she had gone through the Louis Vuitton bag that was presented as evidence during Simpson’s murder trial—only to find it empty. Amusingly enough, Simpson was not quite as enthusiastic about the Kardashian-starring E! reality show—at least, not at first.  In O.J.: Made in America, memorabilia dealer Thomas Riccio—who was involved in the fiasco that landed Simpson in prison—said that K.U.W.T.K. was playing in the background as Simpson and company planned their ill-fated confrontation. Simpson, Riccio said, spotted the show and said, “That’s my goddaughter. Her name is Kim!” Then he added, “That show ain’t going to last two weeks.”  Get Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

66f95059-a9c8-420f-badb-a51af3c78722,"© 2016 Getty Images (Getty Images)  Selena Gomez did NOT break the “girl code” with Taylor Swift, despite a ridiculous report. Gossip Cop can expose the absurdity of this inane story.  HollywoodLife dramatically writes, “Did Selena Gomez just break girl code AGAIN? She and The Weeknd spent a romantic date night at John Mayer’s concert, but there’s a catch. The ‘Good For You’ singer’s BFF Taylor Swift used to date John… so shouldn’t she stay far away?” According to the webloid, “hanging out with your BFF’s ex-boyfriend seems off limits,” but Gomez “may have committed that cardinal sin” by attending John’s show.  “Selena is spending time with John — Taylor’s ex,” declares the site, noting, “Some fans think she’s breaking girl code for the second time now. Ouch!” And yet HollywoodLies actually has no evidence whatsoever that Gomez is “spending time” with Mayer or “hanging out” with him. In truth, the two just happened to be at the same star-studded night club, in separate groups, with the crooner giving an impromptu performance.  It’s amazing that the bad blog twisted that into Gomez having a “date night at John Mayer’s concert,” committing a “cardinal sin,” and “breaking girl code.” This is nothing more than a hit piece, one designed to rile up fans and score clicks. Gomez didn’t do anything to break her “girl code” with Swift, but HollywoodLies once again managed to break several codes of journalism, like accuracy, with this sensational story.  Of course, this isn’t surprising in the least. After all, we’re talking about the same disreputable outlet that spent most of 2014 falsely claiming Gomez and Swift were in a feud.

f3ab065f-65f0-4828-a68d-30931d31fe6a,"Fighting back. Renee Zellweger’s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.  The claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing “sexual favors” for Weinstien, 65.  “If Harvey said that, he’s full of shit,” a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.  Weinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: “Mr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It’s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It’s simply not true.”  As previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expośes published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy. The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October. The scandal has inspired more women to come forward with their own alleged accounts of sexual abuse in Hollywood.  Weinstein’s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him one week after NYT published its story. Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6.  “Georgina is doing very well. She’s an amazing mother. She’s an amazing woman,” the Charmed alum, 44, said. “I think her priority right now is focusing on how to raise those two children to the best of her capacity, given the situation. She goes through very dark times. She’s very sad. This is not easy for her, but I have no doubt that not only will she come out on the other side of this, but she deserves to. She’s a good woman.”  Chapman shares two children, India, 7, and Dashiell, 4, with Weinstein, who she wed in 2007.

18ded185-8456-4dbd-98b6-5db55f32644d,"8.9k SHARES SHARE THIS STORYPresident Trump made a barely veiled threat today on Twitter to Representative Maxine Waters (D-CA) after the congresswoman called for the continued public shaming of members of his administration to hold them accountable for the president’s heinous policies, particularly the immigration policy debacle that led to the separation of thousands of children from their refugee parents at the border.Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018Trump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the “harm” he claims. The “Be careful what you wish for Max!” quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps “the Second Amendment people” i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.While some people may consider Trump’s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president’s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news today about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.Anthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is expected to plead guilty today to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.According to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd “faces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.”Lloyd’s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters’ Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:“If you continue to make threats towards the president, you’re going to wind up dead, Maxine, ’cause we’ll kill you.“The voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a “spur of the moment” decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.Unfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump’s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.The contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.When those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump’s feet.Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes.

691b7ae9-de71-459f-bf77-3df5643534a6,"Three women filed a new class action lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein on Friday, including one who alleged that Weinstein raped her after she came to his office to pitch her internet startup.  The woman, Melissa Thompson, accuses Weinstein of luring her to his hotel room for a meeting in 2011 and then forcibly raping her.  “Thompson was fighting back, but could not out-muscle him,” the lawsuit states. “Thompson closed her eyes, traumatized, praying for the assault to end.”  Earlier that day, Thompson said that she went to Weinstein’s Tribeca office to pitch him on a marketing startup called Intercast Networks. According to the suit, she made a video recording of the encounter on her laptop. As she explained the company’s services, she alleges that Weinstein began to caress her legs. He promised to make a deal that afternoon if she would meet him for a drink at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, the suit alleges. Once there, he brought her to his hotel room, where the alleged rape occurred.  The complaint also alleges that Thompson sought help from the law firm of Benjamin Brafman last fall, and turned over her video evidence to the firm not realizing that Brafman was representing Weinstein.  Related Judge Refuses to Dismiss Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Case New York Attorneys Doubt That Weinstein Case Will Be Dismissed  A second woman, actress Caitlin Dulany, also alleged that Weinstein sexually assaulted her at the Hotel du Cap in Cannes in 1996. Dulany earlier told a version of her encounter in a first-person account for the Wrap, though she did not mention the alleged assault. In the suit, Dulany alleges that Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent and then masturbated.  The third plaintiff, actress Larissa Gomes, alleges that Weinstein cornered her in a hotel room in Toronto in 2000, tried to get her to give him a massage and asked to see her breast. She recoiled, and Weinstein became angry.  “You know Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd were exactly where you are at one point,” Gomes quotes him as saying. “Look at them now. Ashley Judd had no problem f—ing me.” (Judd and Paltrow have both alleged that Weinstein made unwanted advances toward them.)  According to Gomes, she tried to get away, saying “I think I should go now, my boyfriend is waiting for me, and he will be worried.”  Gomes alleges that Weinstein forcibly tried to kiss her, before she fled.  The women are represented by Hagens Berman and the Armenta Law Firm, which also filed an earlier class action suit against Weinstein on behalf of six other women. The suit names Miramax, the Walt Disney Co., and Weinstein as defendants, along with individual board members of the Weinstein Co.  Weinstein has consistently denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sexual acts in New York, and faces up to 25 years in prison on those charges.  His representative has yet to respond to the new allegations.

Lopez made this move because she was alarmed by a story that broke in the National Enquirer in June, in which his alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter claimed that the former New York Yankees third baseman isn’t faithful, the report said.  “I don’t think he’s sexually attracted to her,” Hunter told the Enquirer.  Hunter, 34, said her affair with Rodriguez began in 2011 when he was still seeing actress Cameron Diaz. Hunter said their affair continued even after she had a baby with former football star Marcus Allen in 2014.  Hunter added that Rodriguez contacted her as recently as May about having a rendezvous, and she has the text messages to prove it. Stories about Lopez, 47, and Rodriguez, 41, dating began in March and they went public with their relationship at the Met Gala in New York in May.  But Hunter contended that he was probably imagining her when he was with Lopez and described his very adventurous sexual tastes, including threesomes.

In response to these allegations, the singer and actress took a cue from one of her current jobs, playing an NYPD detective in the NBC crime drama “Shades of Blue.” She hired a private detective to tail Rodriguez, an “insider” told Us.  “She’s really into Alex and wants it to work,” the source added. “So she’s trying to control as much as she can.”  But her need to control angered Rodriguez when he found out about the detective.  “They had a huge fight,” the insider told Us.  Despite this apparent breakdown of trust in this fledging relationship, the two are determined to work “through it,” Us Weekly said.  More recently, they’ve acted like everything is wonderful between them, gushing over each other in interviews. Earlier this month, J. Lo told Extra that her beau is “a beautiful person” and a “loving father” to his daughters, Natasha, 12, and Ella, 9, whom he shares with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.  “He’s a generous human being with his family, with his friends, with me,” Lopez told the outlet. “He’s caring and sweet and capable and responsible and just all the beautiful things you would want a man to be. I feel really lucky right now, so I’m excited about life, but I’m more excited for people to get to see who he really is.”  Rodriguez has apparently spent time with Lopez’ 9-year-old twins Emma and Max with her ex-husband Marc Anthony. He had similarly adoring things to say about Lopez during a March appearance on “The View,” Us said.  “We’re having a great time,” he said. “She’s an amazing, amazing girl. One of the smartest human beings I’ve ever met and also an incredible mother.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,628

23f68cb5-8aa2-4fb2-a766-25044d2f3a9e,"Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom had a shotgun wedding, according to a shocking new report! The pair allegedly tied the knot in a super secret wedding in Prague! You’ve got to check out these unexpected details!  Katy Perry, 33, and Orlando Bloom, 41, reportedly had a quickie wedding in Prague! “Word in her inner circle is that her recent trip to Prague to visit him was actually an elopement,” a source tells OK! mag. “Katy has never had a connection with a man like the one she has with Orlando. Friends say neither of them wanted to waste more time apart.” While visiting Bloom in Prague — where he’s currently filming his upcoming Amazon series, Carnival Row — the mag’s source says Perry and the actor enjoyed a romantic lunch on February 28, where they cozied up together at Cafe Savoy.  As you may know, Perry and Bloom have both been married in the past. Perry wed actor Russell Brand, 42, in October 2010, and later divorced him in July 2012. Bloom wed model Miranda Kerr, 34, in July 2010. The two — who share a son, Flynn, 7, together — divorced in July 2013. However, all hope for lifelong love isn’t lost for Perry and Bloom, the insider says, adding that “Katy is a romanic at heart.” — “Her first wedding [to Brand], was a spectacle, then the marriage went down in flames… They’ve [Perry and Bloom] both always said if they did it again, they’d want it to be quiet and intimate.” And, according to the mag, they accomplished just that.  Rumors that Katy and Orlando had rekindled their romance began to spread in early January 2018, when they were together on holiday in the Maldives; A vacation that the mag claims the two “officially” rekindled their romance on. Before that, the two were spotted at an Ed Sheeran concert in LA back in August 2017. The on-again, off-again lovers have also been teasing a reconciliation by flirting on social media, liking one another’s photos and leaving comments throughout their split… or lack there of.  Katy and Orlando originally announced their split in late February, 2017, just days after they seemed happier than ever at numerous Oscars parties. At the time their reps gave a joint statement which read, “Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand we can confirm that Orlando [Bloom] and Katy [Perry] are taking respectful, loving space at this time.”  The two stars have yet to address or confirm the wedding report.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,504
49cec6a6-5306-4941-b586-bf877ca3a6bc,"This Is Us kicked off its second season last year with a bit of a stumble, courtesy of NBC: the network announced at its 2017 upfront that the show would move to Thursdays, only to backtrack two weeks later. But then the drama went on to do something that few recent breakout freshman series have accomplished: it became an even bigger hit in Season 2, where it was the highest-rated entertainment broadcast series in the adults 18-49 demographic last season, with a 5.4 rating.  After avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump, This Is Us returns tonight for Season 3, and NBC—which won’t have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics or Thursday Night Football to help inflate it this season—will be counting on the show to help keep it on top in the 18-49 demo for what would be the third straight season.  Robert Greenblatt, in an interview before he announced yesterday that he was stepping down as NBC Entertainment chairman after seven years, said that This Is Us shows the power of broadcast TV, which is “the only place where you can gather a huge group of people together for a shared experience,” he said. “When 12 to 14 million people watch America’s Got Talent in the summer, or more than that watch This Is Us in the fall or spring, that’s an extraordinary cultural achievement.”  While Greenblatt scuttled the show’s Thursday move last year after realizing the extent to which Thursday Night Football would disrupt the show’s narrative arc, he didn’t consider relocating the show to Thursday this season, after the network lost Thursday Night Football to Fox.  “We felt, by this point, that it’s a Tuesday staple, for I’m happy to say a large part of the country. We also got some nice traction on Thursday with Will & Grace, and The Good Place is really coming into its own,” said Greenblatt. “So we thought, rather than jumble the cards again, let’s keep a good thing going on Tuesday and let’s build more of a good thing on Thursday. We’re really excited about putting [Law & Order:] SVU on Thursday at 10, which is a great thing for that night also. There’s a lot to be said for stability on your schedule.”  As for how the show was able to avoid stumbling in Season 2, “we have extraordinary writers and [creator] Dan Fogelman is just the greatest sort of visionary,” said Greenblatt. “I haven’t seen a creator who’s as far advanced in plotting a series than he is. He’s weaving in elements from seasons four, five and six, which haven’t even been completely conceived yet. But he knows where all these stories are going.”  Fogelman “knew from the beginning of the first season what the second season was meant to be: the year of what happened to [Milo Ventimiglia’s character] Jack, and his death. We had the Super Bowl [last season] and we knew early on we were going to make that the ultimate episode in the middle of the season,” said Greenblatt. “So there were a couple of things that came together that made Season 2 as anticipated as that first season was.”  NBC thinks the show’s momentum will continue this season. “I feel very bullish about Season 3 for a lot of reasons, which will remain sort of mysterious because I don’t want to give anything away,” said Greenblatt. “But there’s some extraordinary things he’s going to do this year.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,694

Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.” he admits, visibly puzzled. “It is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,” he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region’s waters “is highly unlikely” as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,338

To organize it even more, they created zones for reading, games, art, crafts and science.  “We categorized books and stuffed animals by color so that everything is easy to find (not to mention pretty to look at),” they added.

Another source told People: “The entire family is over the moon.  “Given her health scares in the past, Kim felt the need to hire a surrogacy agency that helped serve as the liaison in finding a healthy woman who would be a great surrogate option for her and Kanye.”  But Kardashian was tight-lipped when asked to confirm the news.  “I think when we’re ready to talk about it we will, and I think it’s super invasive when people are just … So many details out there, and like I’ve never heard this, I’ve never heard this. Like whatever. We have not confirmed it, and that’s that. I’ll let you know when we’re ready.”  Kardashian and West are already parents to 4-year-old North and 1-year-old Saint.  Last week, it was reported by TMZ that the couple had enlisted an African-American woman in her twenties to act as surrogate.  According to the publication, the woman - who is reportedly carrying the couple’s third child - is a college graduate with two children of her own.  The website also reports that the surrogate is in ‘great physical shape’ and that her marriage is ‘solid’.

6c35fe29-e3a2-4f2d-9fe2-3b9b1db4b000,"Roseanne Barr is well aware that fellow sitcom legend Jerry Seinfeld has a soft spot for cursed comedians, and RadarOnline.com has learned exclusively the disgraced comedy queen is now begging him to help her out of her current mess.  “Jerry’s word carries a lot of weight in Hollywood,” an insider told Radar. “He’s respected for being generous, honest and kind.”  Seinfeld has famously stood by a few fellow funnymen who’ve found themselves on the blacklist, like co-star Michael Richards and Louis CK. Now a source tells Radar exclusively Barr is asking Seinfeld to consider having her as guest on his show Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.  “She wants to give her side of the story in a casual setting and reassure people she’s not the pariah she’s made out to be.”  As Radar readers are well aware, Barr faced a swift comeuppance after her racist Twitter rant in May. The hit revival of her show was immediately cancelled, and a reboot minus the controversial comedian will replace it.  In June, Seinfeld came to Barr’s defense, telling ET “I didn’t see why it was necessary to fire her.  “Why would you murder someone who’s committing suicide?” he asked, then added, “But I never saw someone ruin their entire career with one button push. That was fresh.”  The support from one of the country’s most beloved comedians has helped Barr as she tries to recover her reputation.  “She really appreciated the way Jerry stuck up for her and said she shouldn’t have been fired,” the source said. “That’s given her hope.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,319

Here’s what we know so far about how the wedding will be different.  On Tuesday, Kensington Palace announced that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen has approved the venue, and the royal family will pay for the wedding.

At least three services take place there every day, and all are open to the public. Windsor Castle, where the Queen lives for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. ""Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.  St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Getty Images  Though William and Kate were married in Westminster Abbey in 2011 and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1981, Harry's wedding won’t be the first time a recent royal has married at St. George’s. According to NBC News, Harry’s uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.  The space is much smaller than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbey's whopping 2,000, The Guardian reports. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony reflect their personalities and they're determining a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. Either way, the tone seems like it will be much different from William and Kate’s pomp and circumstance.  “It will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom,” their spokesman told journalists. “The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,550

d53c2df8-7f76-4273-af8c-463e93c57e62,"Meghan Markle is counting the days until her royal wedding to Prince Harry. But even as Meghan joyfully prepares for her walk down the aisle and marriage to royalty, Markle reportedly is finding herself haunted by ghosts from her past. Ranging from Meghan’s former best friend, Ninaki Priddy, who allegedly betrayed Markle in a shocking way to jealous relatives and a possibly hostile ex-husband, those “ghosts” are darkening Meghan’s wedding plans, according to E! News.  Meghan Markle Reportedly Is Faced With Individuals From Her Past Who Want To Wreck Her Wedding Plans  While most of the people in Markle’s life are thrilled about her marriage to Prince Harry, some of those “ghosts” from her past are tormenting her, according to the publication.  “A few [individuals] seem hell-bent on trying to ruin the big [wedding] day. The torment Meghan Markle must be going through, thanks to a best friend from hell, jealous family members and a former spouse, is unimaginable.”  With a mere six weeks until Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the public Markle is focused on tasks such as getting fitted for her wedding dress, taking royal etiquette classes, and figuring out the politically charged seating arrangements. But it’s the behind-the-scenes antics that are reportedly the most intriguing.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, May 19, in St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Featured image credit: Chris Jackson Getty Images  Meghan Markle’s Brand Gets Makeover: Two “Ghosts” Get Killed Off  As an actress, Meghan was viewed as a brand with a distinctive voice, including her popular social media accounts. But as Markle prepares to become a duchess and member of the royal family, she is having to reinvent that brand. Meghan was fond of her social media platforms, sources told E! News, but now she must follow in Prince William’s, Kate Middleton’s, and Prince Harry’s footsteps. The trio use the same @KensingtonRoyal handle, and Markle’s appearances with Harry now are reported on Twitter with that handle.  null  Initially, Meghan’s social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, were among the ghosts who haunted her. But those platforms, as well as her lifestyle website, the Tig, have been deleted.  In addition to social media, Markle’s style when she dated Prince Harry first reflected her old life. Short skirts, ripped jeans, and low necklines turned heads as she stepped out with a member of royalty. But just as she deleted her social media, Meghan has laid to rest her actress-era fashion.  “Gone [are Meghan Markle’s] short skirts and low necklines from her red-carpet days, replaced by more demure outfits of pants, skirts with longer hemlines, tailored coats and even a fashion-forward beret. Meghan 2.0 now looks every inch a style-conscious-yet-sensibly attired member of the regal elite.”  While Markle was able to deal with the end of her personal social media accounts, her website, and her former fashion in private, the people who form the “ghosts” in her life haven’t stopped haunting her.  Meghan Markle’s “Ghosts” Include People Who Betrayed Her  E! News pointed to Meghan’s half-sister, Samantha, as an example of one of the ghosts from Markle’s past who she can’t escape. Markle’s relative alleged that Markle had always wanted to be a princess, labeling her a social climber. Samantha even began penning a memoir titled The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister and announced plans for a reality show.  One of the most hurtful “ghosts” from Meghan’s past, and the most shocking, however, is her former best friend, Ninaki Priddy. For 30 years, the two were like sisters, from growing up together to Priddy’s role as the maid of honor at Markle’s wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engleson.  null  But as invitations to Meghan and Harry’s wedding are issued, Markle has been wounded by Ninaki spilling her secrets, pointed out E! News.  “When [Meghan Markle’s former best friend] Ninaki started to spill stories of their intimate conversations, it was a betrayal that must have felt like a stab in the heart to Meghan. Ninaki [claims] she is a calculating manipulator who was so obsessed with Princess Diana she made it her aim to marry Di’s son.”  Markle’s concerns about what might be revealed or alleged about her past don’t end with the betrayal from her best friend, however. Biographer Andrew Morton, known for infuriating the Palace with his book Diana: Her True Story, is set to publish his version of Meghan’s life. Morton reportedly will portray Markle as intensely ambitious, driven to become a member of the royal family.  There’s one person in Meghan’s life who supports her, and that’s her future husband, Prince Harry. Harry previously said that when he found the right woman, he would “ensure we get to the point where we are actually comfortable with each other before the massive invasion into her privacy.” With that “invasion” currently taking place, it’s thought that Prince Harry will stand by Meghan no matter what those ghosts claim about his beloved bride.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1027

The former One Direction star, 23, has enjoyed a string of dates with the London-based chef — after being introduced by mutual friends.  And pals close to the singer say that unlike his other flings, Styles is really taken with Ward, 27, known for her “Naked Diet” cookbook, and believe they’re set for a long-term relationship.  A source said: “As soon as Harry met Tess, there was an instant spark between them. They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food — and things turned romantic quickly. They’ve been on a number of dates while Harry has been in London and he’s already introduced Tess to some of his close friends including his personal stylist Lou Teasdale. This really seems different to Harry’s past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn’t want to risk messing this one up.”  Ward has been dubbed “cooking’s new golden girl” by fans. She released her first book, “The Naked Diet,” in 2015 after being trained by top chefs in The Ritz and River Cottage.  She is also a model and well known on the fashion circuit, having worked with former “Made in Chelsea” stars Millie Mackintosh and Rosie Fortescue, as well as Simon Le Bon’s model daughter Amber Le Bon.  Like her new boyfriend Styles, who released his debut solo single “Sign of the Times” last month, Tess is also a hit stateside and has been offered a host of TV and modeling opportunities in the US.

Then, a scantily clad onetime Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus, twerked up a storm at the MTV VMAs two years ago. Now, it’s former Disney star Selena Gomez, 23, who’s shed most of her clothing as part of an attempt to establish herself as a grown-up artist.  All eyes are on her new album, “Revival” (her first for Interscope), out Friday — or, more accurately, all eyes are on her album cover. It’s got Gomez practically in her birthday suit, topless and wearing only barely there shorts.  Like Disney alumni who have gone before, she’s looking to shake things up with a new look and sound that are a world away from her previous, wholesome persona. The lyrics from the opening title track explain it plainly, as Gomez sings, “No more hiding . . . it’s my time to butterfly.”  It hasn’t been the easiest journey from child star known for kid shows such as “Barney & Friends” and “Wizards of Waverly Place” to full-blown adult celebrity. After canceling an Australian tour to support her debut solo album, “Stars Dance,” at the end of 2013, Gomez voluntarily entered Dawn at the Meadows recovery and rehab center in Arizona at the start of 2014. Rumors of substance abuse and addiction swirled — maybe brought on by her consorting with Justin Bieber (another onetime child star with his own set of troubles). But Gomez set the record straight this week, telling Billboard it was actually so she could get chemotherapy for lupus.  She returned later in the year with the single “The Heart Wants What It Wants,” an obvious referral to her on-off relationship with Bieber, and her final release for Disney’s Hollywood Records.  But Gomez turned over a new leaf this summer with the sultry, R&B-flavored single “Good for You,” featuring A$AP Rocky.  “We definitely felt that the sexier sound of that song was a good progression for Selena,” says Sharon Dastur, senior vice president of programming integration at iHeartMedia. “As you grow up, you want to try different things. It’s not just a thing for ex-Disney artists — all young people feel that way.”  Another sign of a maturing Gomez: She fired her mother, Mandy Teefey, and stepfather, Brian, as her managers. That, notes veteran Nashville-based entertainment lawyer Stephen Weaver, is a positive career move.  Manager-parents can cause problems for record labels. Weaver recalls pitching an artist with a father-manager to a powerful producer. “[He’d] had so many bad experiences with parents as managers that he refused to listen to it. He was afraid he would like it!”  Although Gomez is following a tradition of other young stars transitioning to adulthood, her “Revival” cover photo is about more than hitting the world over the head with sexuality. Gomez recently explained that it was a kiss-off to the body-shamers who have savaged her bikini body in the past online. “I did start gaining weight, and I didn’t mind it,” she told the Los Angeles radio station Power 106 last month. “[The comments were] really hurtful . . . but I’m not gonna give a f – – k what people say. I’m not gonna let them get to me.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,672

533156fa-b2f8-4cee-a4fc-b65a5fac5c67,"In Hollywood, they now talk about ‘‘the Lena Dunham effect’’ and ‘‘the Jill Soloway effect’’: Studios are starting to search for female-driven shows and recruit women to create them. In their ‘‘Odd Couple’’ trailers — one O.C.D. neat, one tousled — on different coasts, Dunham and Soloway have been plotting insurrection and nurturing female directors.  Studio heads may have no choice but to listen. As Kathleen Kennedy told me: ‘‘I had an agent pitching directors to me recently, and when he got done, I waited, and then I said, ‘So, do you represent any women?’ He said, ‘Oh, mmmmm.’ I had to bring it up. I think you’ve got to put pressure on them.’’ Tom Rothman, chairman of Sony Pictures, recently told The Hollywood Reporter: ‘‘There’s a myth in the business that young males drive the box office. Maybe a decade ago or so that was true. I don’t find that true now at all. I actually think women drive the box office.’’ For the moment, it seems the bandwagon is rolling. ‘‘All of a sudden, we’re in this era of, ‘Oh, my God, girls,’ ’’ Pascal told me. ‘‘It’ll last about as long as it always does: about five more minutes.’’  Soloway has become a gleeful militant with a ‘‘messianic, feminist, patriarchy-toppling dream.’’ The mother of two sons, one a 7-year-old, she wants to put a nursery on her set and has been lobbying the D.G.A. to allow two directors per episode for more flex time.  The kids question is a significant one. Several top executives talk about the problem of female directors dropping out to have families. And there is still such an atmosphere of fear that many female directors told me they hide their pregnancies until the last possible minute. One director confessed that she actually hides her child, refusing to put a photo of her son on Facebook, fearing ‘‘it could end my career.’’  ‘‘I’ve even had women executives say to me, not realizing I was a mom, ‘We always want to work with women filmmakers, but then they have kids,’ ’’ says Marielle Heller, who also directed last summer’s critically acclaimed ‘‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl.’’ ‘‘It’s a real stigma, which I think is not fair. It’s crazy to me that that’s the excuse because nobody ever asks men who have kids whether they’ll be able to do it.’’  Over lemonade at Le Pain Quotidien on Melrose Avenue, Gina Prince-Bythewood, in gilt Wonder Woman kicks, said that when she was shooting ‘‘The Secret Life of Bees’’ in North Carolina, her husband back in L.A. told her that her younger son, now 11, was walking around the house with a toy phone having a pretend conversation with her. ‘‘I had a lot of guilt; it wrecked me,’’ said the 46-year-old, who also has a 14-year-old son. ‘‘But I’m a director, and I need to feed that part of me.’’  For nearly six months now, I’ve had the voices of Prince-Bythewood and many other talented women echoing in my head. I hear them puzzling about the disparity problem and dissecting it, trying to find a way around it or plotting to go head-on against it. Dunham talks about quotas. Others pin their hopes on web disruption with new studios at Netflix and Amazon.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But, as Prince-Bythewood says, the studios should open the door for women who are in love with film and with storytelling. ‘‘Just get us in the room,’’ she says.  Leigh Janiak is a 35-year-old with a laid-back manner, but you sense immediately that she knows where she’s going. Janiak pragmatically plotted her rise while she was a producer’s assistant for Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company. She refused an offer to direct an episode of a network TV show on the condition that she shadow a veteran director first. She was afraid it would stigmatize her.  ‘‘Why would anyone give me $40 million to get a movie off the ground if just last week I was doing this little training program?’’ she asked, over lunch at Little Dom’s in Los Feliz. She knew that guys who made horror and science-fiction movies could make the jump to blockbusters more easily than women who wrote rom-coms could. With her writing partner, she did a $1 million horror movie, ‘‘Honeymoon,’’ a goosebumps-inducing something-bad-happens-in-a-cabin-in-the-woods story (my favorite genre) starring the alluring redhead Rose Leslie, best known as Ygritte, the Wildling love interest of Kit Harington in ‘‘Game of Thrones.’’  That attracted the attention of the married producing team Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher, who tapped Janiak, raised Catholic and a former Ph.D. candidate in modern Jewish studies at the University of Chicago, to co-write and direct a remake of the cult horror movie ‘‘The Craft,’’ about witchcraft at a Catholic prep school.  She said she has no patience when she hears about female directors who melt into a puddle of tears after tangling with a grouchy cinematographer, saying: ‘‘I hear stories like that and think, If you are going to let people walk all over you, why do you even want to direct?’’  Fixing the gender problem in Hollywood is important for women like Janiak. But it’s also important for women and girls everywhere. ‘‘We are influencing culture, which is why it’s so dangerous, I think, not to have more women making movies,’’ she said. ‘‘Why can’t I direct ‘Superman’?’’",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1147
af299232-8f4e-4582-a74f-b3e459627473,"© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  One of this week’s new tabloids claims John Legend and Chrissy Teigen are “on the verge of splitting,” but there’s no truth to the breakup tale. The magazine says the couple have been in therapy to fix their alleged marriage problems, but Gossip Cop looked into the report and we can exclusively set the record straight.  Teigen opened up earlier this year about suffering postpartum depression after giving birth to daughter Luna last year, as well as her struggle with drinking too much. The model has since taken steps to work through both issues, but the latest issue of In Touch insists her marriage is falling apart over the situation.  “They are fighting nonstop,” a so-called “insider” tells the magazine. “They have been in marriage counseling for the last six months. They’re trying very hard to make their marriage work.”  The outlet’s questionable source further alleges there’s “a terrible atmosphere” in Teigen and Legend’s home because she’s “been acting paranoid and jealous” and “they end up fighting about it all the time.” The supposed insider continues, “John has tried to be patient because he realizes this is a difficult time for Chrissy, but he is getting wiped out… It seems like they are trying to get through the day.” The dubious source concludes, “John and Chrissy’s friends worry the marriage just won’t survive.”  But Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the couple about their alleged marital woes, and we’re exclusively assured the tabloid’s account of events is simply “not true.” We’re told Legend and Teigen’s relationship is going strong, and the claim otherwise is entirely inaccurate. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time we’ve had to debunk a phony article about the happy spouses being at odds.  Gossip Cop busted MediaTakeOut two years ago when it wrongly alleged Legend and Teigen were “headed for divorce” over constant arguments. Obviously, the couple is still very much together, and this latest story regarding their supposed marriage problems is equally bogus.

4ac91a81-762f-428b-9d5e-985c4bd6b85d,"Long before Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux tied the knot (and ultimately split), he was perfectly happy with the status of their relationship. In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn’t have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.  “He had reservations at the time because they still hadn’t figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen — and probably always will be — but marriage was never important to him,” the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. “Marriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn’t need it.”  But Aniston did. “Constant scrutiny of Jen’s personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,” the source tells Us. “It was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn’t want to lose her, so they got married.”  In the end, things didn’t work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The separation was caused in part by distance. “Jen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,” a source previously told Us. “New York City wasn’t ever going to be home for Jen.”  With reporting by Jen Heger.

Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon’s orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet’s ‘original’ moon.The ‘new’ moon is tilted at around 8° and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth’s smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.“Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,” said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “One other asteroid — 2003 YN107 — followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth’s companion for centuries to come.”SourceLike this: Like Loading...",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,463

They detailed everything from how Harry got down on one knee to why Meghan didn't let him finish the big question. USA TODAY  In this photo taken from video Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle talk about their engagement during an interview in London, Monday, Nov. 27, 2017. It was announced Monday that Prince Harry, fifth in line for the British throne, will marry American actress Meghan Markle in the spring, confirming months of rumors. (Photo: AP)  LONDON — People around the world — from celebrity Kim Kardashian to regular folks — rushed to congratulate Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle on their engagement Monday. But many here, where the royal family resides, reacted in British ho-hum fashion.  ""I'm happy for the geezer, but I don't care,"" John Hedge, 42, said on a street in Streatham, a mixed-income neighborhood in south London.  That low-key response, expressed by others in the British capital, matched the way Harry said he popped the big question: while they were cooking a roast chicken during a ""standard, typical night"" at their cottage on the grounds of Kensington Palace.  ""Not interested,"" said Tony Jones, a commuter rushing to a train at London's Victoria station Monday evening.  Other Britons took to social media to ask whether the engagement would mean an extra day off — it won't. ""Give us the bank holiday or else,"" wrote Owen Jones, a left-wing newspaper columnist who believes the monarchy should be abolished.  Prime Minister Theresa May's office said the wedding day — sometime in the spring — will not be a national holiday, in contrast to the 2011 nuptials of Harry's older brother and future king, Prince William and Duchess Kate.

""I love Harry,"" said carpenter Jerry Walsh, 61, outside a pub in south London. ""He's the most natural of them (the royal family). They can do their own thing — let them live their lives.

""She's very nice — she's a beautiful woman,"" she added about Markle, 36, a Los Angeles native who met Harry, 33, last year when he launched the Invictus Games in Toronto, where her TV show Suits is filmed.  ""I'm happy,"" said Kathleen Connell, 78, adding that Markle is ""different from everyone else.""  ""It's fantastic,"" she added.  CLOSE Tourists react to Prince Harry’s engagement Video provided by AFP Newslook  Reaction outside Buckingham Palace, a top draw for tourists worldwide, was also relatively low-key.  ""I think it's perfectly fine for her to marry into the royal family,"" said Kieran Verseim, a medical lab technician from Denver. ""Anybody should be able to chose who they want to marry regardless of background,"" she said.  Markle, who is biracial, will be the first non-white person to marry into the royal family in modern history, a fact that sparked debate about interracial marriages in the United Kingdom. About 1 in every 10 people are in racially mixed relationships in the U.K., according to the latest census data.  ""We don't know too much about the royal family in Turkey,"" said Tarik Dogan, 42, an engineer from Istanbul as he marveled at the queen's official residence.  ""The little ones, the children, they are sweet,"" he added, referring to Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  Unlike some locals, the tourism industry reacted with glee about the next royal wedding.

Tourism across the U.K. linked to the royal family generates more than $666 million a year and attracts more than 2.7 million visitors, according to Visit London.

We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how producers have their eyes on Selena Gomez to join the show.  It would be pretty awkward to see Taylor Swift‘s BFF Selena Gomez, 25, sitting next to arch-enemy Katy Perry, 32, week after week on American Idol, but the “Fetish” singer is at the top of the show producers’ wish-list for judges. “Producers think that Selena would be great to join the judging panel because she’d bring in a younger crowd for ratings, she’d be considered the nice judge and they would love her to join because the impact she has with social media,” an AI insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Sel is the most followed person on Instagram with a whopping 127 million followers, so of course the show would love to have a judge who can reach so many people.  “They are putting together a proposal for her and are hoping she will accept it and join the show, it’s a long shot but they are taking the chance to get her. They’d love to have her signed up and all judges by mid October,” our insider adds. So far the show has been striking out right and left when it comes to getting other stars to join Katy on the panel. ABC reportedly spent a whopping $25 million to land her back in May, which is over half of the show’s budget. As a result, they don’t have much money left over to get other top names. After all, who wants to do the same job as Katy for a fraction of the paycheck? Especially in Selena’s case, she is the bigger star these days! See pics of beautiful Selena, right here.  If by some chance Selena actually agrees to join the show, they definitely need a “nice” judge cause Katy said she won’t be holding back when it comes to the contestants’ talent. She called in to On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Aug. 23, to give her judging strategy. “I’m going to maybe be more the Simon Cowell. I really respect him. As much as people said, ‘Oh, he’s grumpy or he’s mean,’ he was just truthful, you know? He’s seen it. I don’t need to be there to win the popular race.” She added, “Honestly sob stories come second for me. Everyone has a situation and God bless them…but if you don’t have the goods, you don’t have the goods.” Brutal!

1df1cdb7-6ab8-4c69-b91d-415f7db242d4,"  Nicole Kidman attends the 74th Annual Golden Globe Awards on January 8. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  Nicole Kidman offered a message not often heard from the Hollywood elite: Americans need to support President-elect Donald Trump.  She was speaking with Victoria Derbyshire of BBC Two, promoting the based-on-a-true-story film “Lion,” which she described as a “love letter … to mothers and children.” In it, she portrays an Australian woman who, with her husband, adopts a lost Indian boy named Saroo.  During the interview, Derbyshire brought up Kidman’s dual Australian and American citizenship and noted the actress voted in the U.S. election.  “I’m always reticent to start sort of commenting politically,” Kidman began. “I’ve never done it in terms of America, or Australia. I’m issue-based.”  Then she continued, “I just say he’s now elected and we as a country need to support whoever’s the president because that’s what the country’s based on. However that happened, he’s there, and let’s go. ”  After these remarks, she quickly discussed two topics — same-sex marriage and women’s health care and equality.  She said the former should be legal in Australia. On the latter, she said, “I’m very, very committed to women’s issues in terms of I do a lot of fundraising for U.N. Women and I do a lot of traveling for them. I also do an enormous amount of fundraising for breast and ovarian cancer, because that’s something that’s affected my family deeply. So they’re my issues that I’m very attached to.”  Kidman quickly came under fire on social media.  “I think it’s time for Nicole Kidman to move to Russia,” tweeted one user. “Nicole Kidman married Tom Cruise who is a Scientologist. Her advice is the last thing America needs!” tweeted another. “Would you follow Hitler, just because he has a title?” asked one user.  Nicole Kidman: Americans need to support Trump  Americans: We just lost our healthcare!  Nicole Kidman: Me? Tonight I’m wearing Dior. — Pretty Lil’ Pinko (@KelseyFGold) January 13, 2017  https://twitter.com/BumbleBUnicorn/status/819820861913964544  Her comments are a sharp departure from the rhetoric most celebrities have used since Trump’s surprise victory over Hillary Clinton.  Most recently, Meryl Streep used her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes as a semi-political vehicle, espousing the virtues of a “principled press” and condemning the powerful who use bullying as a means of control. She never once mentioned Trump’s name while clearly speaking about him, bringing up “the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitat[ing] a disabled reporter.”  “And this instinct to humiliate, when it’s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody’s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,” Streep said.  For her efforts, Trump employed his favorite insult, tweeting that Streep — winner of three Oscars and nominated for 19 — was “overrated” and was a “Hillary flunky who lost big.”  [Meryl Streep called out Donald Trump at the Golden Globes. He responded by calling her ‘over-rated.’]  Bruce Springsteen, who in reference to Trump had previously told Rolling Stone “The republic is under siege by a moron,” recently gave a far-reaching interview on the popular podcast “WTF with Marc Maron.” In it, he wondered aloud if Trump “is simply competent enough to do this particular job.”  Speaking about Trump’s election, Springsteen warned, “When you let that genie out of the bottle — bigotry, racism, intolerance … they don’t go back in the bottle that easily if they go back in at all. Whether it’s a rise in hate crimes, people feeling they have license to speak and behave in ways that previously were considered un-American and are un-American. That’s what he’s appealing to. My fears are that those things find a place in ordinary, civil society.”  Some celebrities didn’t wait quite so long to attack the president-elect. “West Wing” and “Social Network” screenwriter Aaron Sorkin published a letter in Vanity Fair addressed to his ex-wife Julia and his 15-year-old daughter Roxy the day after the election.

Pitt is an honorary member of the Epidermolysis Bullosa Medical Research Foundation (EBMRF) that is dedicated to raising money and awareness for the rare skin disorder, epidermolysis bullosa.In January, Pitt introduced singer Chris Cornell during a Rock4EB annual charity to support EBMRF.Further, he revealed in a 2013 Esquire Magazine interview that he self-diagnosed himself with a rare disease – prosopagnosia — also known as face blindness. According to the article, ""Brad Pitt won't remember you. If you've met him, he'll have no idea who you are when he meets you again. Even if you've had what he calls ""a real conversation,"" your face will start fading from his memory as soon as you walk away.""It should be noted that being diagnosed with a condition and being self-diagnosed with a condition can be 2 very different diagnoses.Prosopagnosia refers to the inability to recognize familiar people from their face. They may also be unable to recognize other stimuli, such as objects, cars, or animals.People with prosopagnosia typically learn to use non-face cues including voice, walking style and hairstyle to recognize others. The underlying genetic cause of developmental prosopagnosia is not known but familial reports of this condition are consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance.Epidermolysis bullosa (aka 'the worst disease you've never heard of') is a group of devastating, life-threatening genetic skin disorders impacting children that is characterized by skin blisters and erosions all over the body.The most severe form, recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, is characterized by chronic skin blistering, open and painful wounds, joint contractures, esophageal strictures, pseudosyndactyly, corneal abrasions and a shortened life span. Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa lack functional type VII collagen (C7) owing to mutations in the gene COL7A1 that encodes for C7 and is the main component of anchoring fibrils that attach the dermis to the epidermis.Epidermolysis bullosa patients suffer through intense pain throughout their lives, with no effective treatments available to reduce the severity of their symptoms.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,432

b199d901-382f-4349-8792-eddacc3c0529,"Scientologist actor Danny Masterson has been accused of rape by four women — and the Church of Scientology claims it knew nothing of the allegations against its longtime member.  However, people deeply connected with the church say members did have knowledge of Masterson's alleged behavior way before the media reports.  Several sources told Fox News that the Church of Scientology systematically covers up misdeeds of its most prominent members — and Masterson, they say, is no exception.  Chris Shelton, a former member of the Church of Scientology and Sea Org from 1987-2012, said the church silences members who want to take complaints to law enforcement.  “The church works to protect the church first,” he told Fox News.  He said the next most important thing to Scientologists is to protect the members of the church and its public image.  “[The Church of Scientology] considers anyone outside the church to be a ‘wog,’ which is a defamatory word describing non-members... It creates an ‘us versus them’ mentality [and tells] members that ‘wogs’ at law enforcement won’t protect them.”  Tony Ortega, editor of “The Underground Bunker,” told Fox News Scientologists are “not allowed to file a lawsuit against another Scientologist or report another Scientologist to the authorities.”  Ortega said this has directly impacted the women accusing Masterson of rape.  “For example, one of Masterson’s accusers … went to the church in 2003 to report the incident,” Ortega claimed.  Citing inside knowledge of the church, he alleged Scientology leaders asked the accuser to undergo “intensive counseling from May to December 2003, going back into her past lives to find out what evil thing she did then to cause this now.  ""That is how Scientology handled sexual assault,” he added.  Ortega, a journalist who has dedicated his time to investigating the Church of Scientology, claimed members of the church are threatened with being ostracized from the tight-knit community if they go to authorities with sexual assault allegations.  Shelton said he saw similar practices during his time as a member of the church.  Shelton said Scientologists use an “internal justice system” that utilizes fear mongering to stop alleged sexual assault victims from going to the police. Shelton also said the interview sessions with alleged victims within the church are routinely filmed.  Ortega said one of Masterson’s accusers was “brutally interrogated” by a senior member of the organization.  “At the same time, Danny was being interrogated [by a senior member],” Ortega claimed. “… It would have been videotaped. They are manic about keeping records. To my knowledge, none of this was given to the LAPD.”  Ortega said when the alleged victim took her case to the LAPD to claim the “That ‘70s Show” star attacked her, the church stepped in once again.  “A little more than a year after the assault, the church bombarded the LAPD with affidavit after affidavit from church members defending Masterson. The church rallied around him.”  Shelton predicts the church will stand by Masterson, even as his public image begins to crumble. The actor denies any wrongdoing.  “They will keep lying, lying and lying,” Shelton said of the church. “They’ll cover up and double down.”  Masterson was fired by Netflix earlier this week, ending his run on the streaming service’s series “The Ranch.”  He has denied the claims against him, saying in part, ""Law enforcement investigated these claims more than 15 years ago and determined them to be without merit. I have never been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one.""  In a statement to the media, the Church of Scientology denied it was involved in stifling the claims of Masterson’s accusers.  “The church adamantly denies that it ever ignores any allegations of criminal behavior, especially at the expense of alleged victims. What is being stated is utterly untrue. This has nothing to do with religion. This story is being manipulated to push a bigoted agenda. The church follows all laws and cooperates with law enforcement. Any statement or implication to the contrary is false.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,788

bf1bb4b7-5881-4cc3-aa2a-5fb20adb8ca9,"Melissa Etheridge — a passionate advocate for medical marijuana — was busted for drug possession in August.  The 56-year-old singer was returning to the United States from Canada in North Dakota when her tour bus was reportedly stopped by Customs and Border Patrol. After drug-sniffing dogs detected the substance, agents discovered marijuana oil, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Etheridge told police that she uses the drug to manage pain from cancer. Although the drug is legal in California, however, it’s not allowed in North Dakota, said TMZ.  The “Come to My Window” crooner was reportedly booked for possession of a controlled substance and smiled from ear-to-ear in her mugshot, which was obtained by TMZ. According to the outlet, she pleaded not guilty. PEOPLE’s requests for comment were not immediately returned by CBP or a rep for Etheridge.  Etheridge first opened up about her weed use in the new Yahoo! project Cannabis & the American Family, and PEOPLE premiered the video clip earlier this year. The Grammy-winner explained that she began using medical marijuana as a holistic alternative to pharmaceuticals when she was undergoing chemotherapy after her 2004 breast cancer diagnosis.  During the initial interview, she added that she has smoked with her wife, Linda Wallem, and two older kids: Bailey, 20, and Beckett, 18. “It’s a very natural, end-of-the-day [thing],” she told Yahoo! “And it brings you much closer. I’d much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink — oh, God, no.”  Since her quotes made the rounds online, Etheridge said she’s received flak for her parenting style and would hope the attention would be directed to a more important issue.  RELATED VIDEO: Melissa Etheridge’s Music Room Is the Coolest  Etheridge later clarified her comments exclusively to PEOPLE.  “I’ve been a celebrity here for almost 30 years, and I’ve done my best to speak truthfully about who I am and my human experience as I go through life, from my work to my family,” the rocker said. “Sometimes I find that I can say something, thinking that the whole world will understand, and they kind of go in another direction. I think if I get a little more specific, it can help guide the conversation in general about cannabis.”  Etheridge discussed why she believes her use of cannabis with her children has been “demonized” — and opened up about how heartbroken she was over the backlash she received for smoking with her kids.  “My children are my priority,” said Etheridge, who is also mom to 10-year-old twin daughters Johnnie Rose and Miller Steven. “I love my children. They are four of the most amazing human beings on earth. I live a very blessed life. I would never want to harm any of them.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,552

Tyler Dooley grows cannabis in Oregon, US – which has been legal in the American state since 2015 – and previously announced that he would be developing a new potent hybrid named Markle’s Sparkle.  Now, days before Markle is due to marry Prince Harry, details of the drug’s price, flavour and effects have been released on Leaf Buyer – an online cannabis dispensary database.  In an online description of Markle Sparkle, the website says: “Noble families often inspire their country persons to craft and dedicate products to them.  “For a Royal baby, a royal cheddar. For a Royal wedding, a royal weed.  “Markle Sparkle is a cannabis strain dedicated to the soon-to-be British Royal Meghan Markle.”  The $150-an-ounce (£111) strain is tipped to be good for helping alleviate insomnia, pain and anxiety, and it has been specially engineered so that it doesn’t make users feel too hungry.  The website also says that Markle Sparkle has a “very sweet, silky taste” with “notes of fresh blueberry and a unique, fruity and smooth flavour.”  As for its effect, the drug is supposed to provide users with an “uplifting” experience and a “tingling body sensation.”  “There is a sense of relief and euphoria that comes with the high as well,” it says.  “These benefits make for a great all-around versatile strain for any medical patient or recreational consumer.”  The Markle Sparkle tests at 23 per cent THC - the active ingredient in marijuana – and is made by crossbreeding three varieties including NYC Diesel, Northern Lights with Blueberry and a secret strain which Dooley is not revealing.

0c7cbd94-2a59-4496-add5-b284ff5c4229,"Actress Allison Mack, best known for her decade on TV’s “Smallville,” and Keith Raniere, the leader of what authorities allege is a sex cult, were indicted Friday in New York on federal charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit forced labor, the Albany Times-Union reported.  Raniere and Mack are each charged with multiple counts, and could face a minimum of 15 years in prison. Mack was arrested in New York City on Friday and will be held pending a bail hearing Monday. Raniere has been in custody since he was arrested in Mexico in March.  Raniere is the founder of NXIVM, which bills itself as a self-help and empowerment organization, but is described by authorities as a cultlike group whose members recruited women to be sex slaves, and branded their pubic regions with Raniere’s initials.  The Rochester Democrat & Chronicle said Mack was indicted “for her role in DOS, a group … that purported to be a women’s empowerment sorority. Prosecutors, however, say DOS was actually a sex-slave ring led by Raniere, with women known as ‘slaves’ who reported to ‘masters’ who ultimately reported to Raniere himself. Mack is an alleged co-conspirator, reporting directly to Raniere.”  Mack, 35, is alleged by prosecutors to have recruited slaves for pay, forcing the women to have sex with Raniere, and using explicit photos and damaging information to ensure their compliance.  According to the Associated Press, prosecutors said Mack told recruits that they were joining a female mentorship group.  “Mack and other … masters recruited … slaves by telling them that they were joining a women-only organization that would empower them and eradicate purported weaknesses the NVIVM curriculum taught were common in women,” prosecutors said.  But “the victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor to the defendants’ benefit,” said U.S. Attorney Richard P. Donoghue of the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Moira Kim Penza also said in court that “under the guise of female empowerment,” Mack “starved women until they fit her co-defendant’s sexual ideal,” the AP wrote.  Mack starred in the CW Network series about Clark Kent’s youth in Smallville, Kan. before he became Superman, playing Clark Kent’s friend Chloe Sullivan from 2001 to 2011. She has also been in a handful of television series roles since, according to her IMDB page.  According to CBS News:  Former NXIVM publicist Frank Parlato told Inside Edition that Mack is “completely enamored with Raniere and completely under his thrall.” He also said that Mack and her “Smallville” co-star, Kristin Kreuk, were used as “poster girls for normalizing the group.” Kreuk says she left NXIVM years ago and commended the women who exposed DOS.  [Feds say self-help guru coerced followers into sex, had them branded with a cauterizing pen]  Raniere, 57, known to his followers as ‘the Vanguard’ — was living in a villa in Puerto Vallarta with several women, according to federal prosecutors, before he was apprehended in March. Mexican authorities took him into custody and delivered him to Texas; he’s now in federal custody in Brooklyn. As Raniere was taken from the villa, The Post’s Kyle Swenson wrote, citing prosecutors, the women chased after authorities in their own car at high speed.  “In my opinion, NXIVM is one of the most extreme groups I have ever dealt with in the sense of how tightly wound it is around the leader,” cult expert Rick Ross told the Times-Union in 2012.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn last week wrote in court documents that Rainere has “a decades-long history of abusing women and girls,” and accused him of having sex with minors.  In a statement attributed to Raniere on NXIVM’s website, he proclaimed his innocence and said he believed the justice system would prevail. He also denied affiliation with DOS, the sorority.  The Times-Union, however, wrote that “federal court records indicate emails seized from Raniere’s private messaging accounts support the conclusion that Raniere created the club, which was known as ‘Dominus Obsequious Sororium,’ which means ‘Master Over the Slave Women.’ ”  Read more:  He dressed as Spider-Man and washed windows at a hospital.

63c7ba97-909a-4724-b741-48cd05e9bc17,"Princess Eugenie’s engagement announcement caused a right royal stir on Monday — and so did her unusual ring.  The pink padparadsha sapphire, surrounded by diamonds, is similar in style to the ruby engagement ring her dad, Prince Andrew, gave to Sarah Ferguson when he proposed in 1986.  Eugenie, 27, announced she would wed James Brooksbank this autumn in the Windsor venue that will see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot in May.  But that doesn’t mean she’ll be overshadowed by the wedding of the year — and the price of her sparkler proves it.  The gem expert from British TV show “Posh Pawn” has estimated the value of Eugenie’s ring at $140,000 — double the estimated value of Markle’s.  The three-diamond ring that Prince Harry’s fiancee wears is estimated to be worth around $70,000.  Gemologist Deborah Papas, from Prestige Pawnbrokers, told the Sun Online: “Like her mother, the Duchess of York and indeed Princess Diana, Eugenie’s ring has a center oval precious gemstone and this one certainly has not disappointed.  “It is a padparadscha sapphire surrounded by 10 brilliant cut diamonds and two pear cut diamonds to give an edge to the standard classic cluster.  “Padparadscha is the name given to the corundum gem that bears a mixture of red and yellow, a sort of cross between a ruby and yellow sapphire.  “This beautiful gem is considered amongst the rarest and most valuable of all the corundum varieties.  “With its carefully faceted cut and the set off with the whitest of white diamonds, this ring could easily be worth over £100,000 [$140,000].  “Padparadscha sapphires are amongst the rarest and most valuable depending on quality and a little bit of difference in quality can mean a big difference in price.”  Papas admits that estimating such a valuable gem is difficult without full access but adds: “We estimate it to be in excess of £100,000 [$140,000].”  The princess has dated the 31-year-old party organizer for six years, and her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, said they were delighted with the news.  Royal insider Dickie Arbiter revealed that the princess’s marriage to the 31-year-old would be even more star-studded than Markle’s — and the role that Sarah Ferguson would play at the nuptials.

The sweet moment was captured by one of their guests, BP Major, who wrote, “Genders are revealed!!!! So excited.

2873665a-225d-4013-9029-ca3047b69580,"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate’s turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate’s parents’ hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate’s mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family’s home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons’ traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the “Fab Four,” will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a “mole hunt” to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don’t get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry’s relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

e8cd1e3f-5659-45f0-9416-6b69c2050e50,"Sandra Oh made history on Thursday, becoming the first Asian actor ever to receive an Emmy nomination in the best actress category.  The 46-year-old star, who leads BBC America’s Killing Eve, had previously been nominated for five supporting actress Emmys for her breakout role as Dr. Cristina Yang in ABC’s Grey’s Anatomy, which she starred on from 2005-14.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She previously opened up about how she was shocked to have gotten the titular role in Killing Eve, explaining that she was used to being offered only supporting characters.  “When I got the script for Killing Eve, I remember I was walking around in Brooklyn and I was on my phone with my agent, Nancy. I was quickly scrolling down the script, and I can’t really tell you what I was looking for. So I’m like, ‘So Nancy, I don’t understand, what’s the part?’ ” Oh recalled to Vulture in April. “And Nancy goes ‘Sweetheart, it’s Eve, it’s Eve.’ “  Sandra Oh Dominik Magdziak Photography/Getty  Her surprise was the result of a bigger problem: racism she claimed to have experienced for so long in Hollywood that left her “brainwashed.”  “In that moment, I did not assume the offer was for Eve,” she said. “I think about that moment a lot. Of just going, how deep have I internalized this? [So] many years of being seen [a certain way], it deeply, deeply, deeply affects us. It’s like, how does racism define your work? Oh my goodness, I didn’t even assume when being offered something that I would be one of the central storytellers. Why? And this is me talking, right?”  “Racism exists. Let’s start there. I felt it, and I have felt it deeply. And I’m extremely fortunate. So I’m not going to not say that it’s not there, because it is,” she added. “After being told to see things a certain way for decades, you realize, ‘Oh my god! They brainwashed me!’ I was brainwashed! So that was a revelation to me.”  Ssandra Oh in Grey's Anatomy Randy Holmes/ABC via Getty  Although she has experienced the effects of racism throughout her acting journey, Oh said she believes in the power of positive perspective for minority performers.  “It’s changing the mindset that being an actor of color, person of color, that you’re at a disadvantage in the creative life. That you don’t have opportunity. It’s all how you see the opportunity. And the clearer and deeper you get into what you really want, you just become a better artist. If that’s what you really want — becoming a better artist — does that include access? Does that include having 5 billion Instagram followers? I don’t know. That’s for you to decide,” she told Vulture.  She continued: “But if what you want is to connect, if what you want is to be a great artist, I think you can find your way. Even within this giant paradigm that a lot of times doesn’t include people who look like us.”  Oh will face off against Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid’s Tale), Claire Foy (The Crown), Keri Russell (The Americans), Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld) and Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) come Emmy night.

1bd77b0b-11f5-4151-b619-ab4787cb2f00,"The greatest love story of our time 2018 has ended, TMZ reports. Pop singer Ariana Grande and Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson called off their engagement over the weekend, leaving many, many people wondering who will get custody of their pet pig, what they will do about their matching tattoos, and, most pressingly, what will become of the $93,000 pear-shaped diamond ring that Davidson bought for Grande.  People on Twitter were fixated specifically on the question of whether Davidson would be able to get the ring back, since it cost so very much. They didn’t have to waste away in limbo for long: TMZ reported in the wee hours of Tuesday morning that Grande had already returned it. But, clearly, this situation was about a lot more than a diamond ring.  Who?  Famous people get together and break up all the time, so it’s important to know that this isn’t just any celebrity romance. Grande and Davidson’s relationship captivated onlookers because of its speed, intensity, and incredibly public nature. It was also surprising, since Grande is, well, much more famous than Davidson.  They got together in late May, shortly after breaking up with partners they dated for multiple years — the rapper Mac Miller and Cazzie David, Larry David’s daughter, respectively — and fanned the flames of the public’s interest by flirting via Instagram comments. They got numerous tattoos for one another. After roughly one month of dating, they were engaged.  The usual rites of courtship happened at warp speed, magnified by Grande and Davidson’s visibility and collective wealth. They adopted a pig and named it Piggy Smalls. They moved into a $16 million apartment in New York together. Grande titled the penultimate song on her album Sweetener “pete davidson” — not something most people do in a relationship, but notable nonetheless.  It all seemed so unwise! So soon! But also ... so fun, a spectacle played out on social media, where anyone with an Instagram account could follow their declarations of love. Davidson confirmed the engagement to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, saying, “It’s fucking lit, Jimmy.” At the time, it kind of was.  In September, Mac Miller, Grande’s ex, died at age 26. Grande, who expressed her grief in an Instagram note later that month, has since canceled appearances at a benefit gala and on the season premiere of SNL, which replaced her with Kanye West.  When Davidson and Grande broke up this weekend, it might not have been a huge surprise, but Twitter nonetheless went into overdrive. Of course it did: Fans were here for the romance, and they’re here for the breakup. But beyond the emotional difficulties at hand, the question people really wanted answered was, who gets to keep that ridiculously expensive ring?  So who gets to keep that ridiculously expensive ring?  On Monday, celebrity sites were already reporting that Grande planned to give the ring back to Davidson, and according to TMZ, that’s what she did. (But Piggy Smalls remains in Grande’s custody.) That seems like the reasonable thing to do, and New York courts would agree, since the state considers engagement rings to be contracts, not gifts.  But it is telling that we’re so obsessed with the question. For most of us, the $93,000 ring, crafted by Manhattan-based jeweler Greg Yuna, seems like a massive financial investment — an exorbitant purchase that echoes the all-in nature of Grande and Davidson’s early relationship. The fate of that ring is just one more piece of this unbelievable romance. (Yuna’s business has not responded to request for comment about whether it accepts returns on engagement rings.)  There’s something else happening here, though. A lot of people on Twitter have expressed joking concern over Davidson’s finances, saying that he’s going to want the ring back so that he can pay his bills again.

He probably makes a good salary on SNL, but that’s about as much as you can say! It seems like these comments have less to do with Davidson’s income and more with Davidson’s income in relation to Grande’s.  Grande is massively successful — her albums, much like her hair, are certified platinum — and she definitely makes more than Davidson does. Their income disparity flips on its head the societal norm that says men in heterosexual relationships should be the breadwinners. Suggesting that Davidson is broke stretches those stereotypes even further: If a man isn’t making as much as his female partner, he must be a complete failure. He must be financially reliant.  There was a real power imbalance in Davidson and Grande’s relationship, and that was one of the reasons people followed it so avidly. (The desire to understand what each party was bringing to the table is also related to the advent of the phrase “Big Dick Energy.”) Grande was a world-famous pop star; Davidson was a sketch comedian who hadn’t yet crossed over into mainstream Hollywood in the way that SNL alums like Will Ferrell or Amy Poehler have. In a way, Grande was Davidson’s big break, and on the late-night talk show circuit, he wasn’t shy about the differences in their career status.  “We got a pig. Yo, can I just say, this girl, she was like, ‘I want a pig!’ And then an hour later, it was just there,” Davidson said on Late Night With Seth Meyers in September. “You know what I mean? I’m still trying to get a Propecia refill ... this girl got a pig in an hour.”  And in a GQ interview published in August, Davidson expressed a certain hesitance to call their apartment his own:  Davidson and Grande recently moved into a Manhattan apartment that reportedly cost $16 million. She bought the place, Davidson says, and he stocks the fridge. “She’s really sweet. She’s like, ‘This is our house,’ and I’m like, ‘You’re very nice for saying that. Thank you for letting me stay here,’ “ he deadpans. “She’s like, ‘We’re getting married!’ And I’m like, ‘I know, thank you for letting me stay here.’ “  On Monday, someone started a GoFundMe to give Davidson money for housing, though the page was removed that day.  Of course, when people express faux concern over Davidson’s finances, they might also be assuming that since Grande and Davidson rushed into a romantic relationship, one or both of them might also make rash financial decisions that they can’t actually fund. Onlookers might be conflating Davidson’s mental health challenges, which he’s been open about, with an inability to manage money.  The fact is, we don’t really know what’s up.

It seems like a happy period of time for him right now.”  What’s more is the brothers got to see Jolie’s six kids, Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne in the flesh. Taylor revealed for the first time that they all seem to be in a “great” place.

4bcdd2cb-6169-4d44-bdfd-56e2cd258291,"Caitlyn Jenner thinks Ellen DeGeneres 'alienated' her from the LGBTQ community.  The 67-year-old American television personality, who was pictured out in Malibu on Thursday, appeared on the talk show host's popular show in 2015 after transitioning.  She admitted to Ellen that she had been hesitant to accept gay marriage in the past, prompting the blonde star to describe her guest's views as 'confusing' in a later interview with radio presenter Howard Stern.  In her memoir, The Secrets of My Life, which has been obtained by Radar Online, Caitlyn says Ellen, 59, asked in a 'friendly voice' to discuss how her views on marriage equality has 'progressed over the years.'  Scroll down for video  'Alienated': Caitlyn Jenner, pictured in Malibu on Thursday, has called out Ellen DeGeneres in her new memoir, The Secrets Of My Life  Blame: The 67-year-old accuses the talk show host of taking her stance on gay marriage out of context  Caitlyn wrote: 'I believed, as anyone would, that that was exactly what she wanted to talk about my progression in terms of changing attitude over the years.  'I am for it. I did not initially understand why marriage was so important, influenced no doubt by my own personal experience. Now I do, and it's a wonderful thing to see.'  'This discussion further alienated me from members of the LGBTQ community. Ellen's appearance on The Howard Stern Show, where in my mind she even more emphatically took what I said out of context, made it go viral.'  Start of it all: The 67-year-old reality star previously spoke on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in September of 2015 about gay marriage  The I Am Cait star - who has six children and has been married three times in the past - had admitted during her interview with Ellen that she was a 'traditionalist' who never used to approve of same-sex marriage, but her attitude had changed in recent years.  She said: 'I have to admit that I remember 15 years ago, 20 years ago, whenever it was that the whole gay marriage issue came up, I was not for it.  'I am a traditionalist. I mean, I'm older than most people in the audience. I like tradition and it's always been between a man and a woman and I'm thinking I don't' quite get it.  'But as time goes on, like a lot of people on this issue I've really changed thinking here, to I don't ever want to stand in front of anybody's happiness.'  She added: 'That's not my job. OK. If that word marriage is really, really that important to you I can go with it.'  When Ellen then accused her of being 'still a little not on board' with the idea, Caitlyn replied: 'No I'm on board. It's going to be pretty much the law of the land. So I still feel like yeah, I'm OK with it. I don't want to stand in front of somebody's happiness.'  DeGeneres later discussesd Caitlyn's comments in a radio interview.  'She still has a judgment about gay marriage,' DeGeneres told Howard Stern.  'I said, ""You're wanting people to understand and accept you, this is like really confusing to people. And you want us to understand, and that you still have a judgment about gay people and marriage.""",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,652
d093f89b-9d02-433a-8bfc-97eeb4e8554c,"Roy Halladay, a two-time Cy Young Award winner admired as much for his off-the-field persona as his Hall of Fame pitching ability, died Tuesday when the private plane he was piloting crashed off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico.  A fearsome competitor on the mound, Halladay, 40, earned universal appreciation within the sport, from teammates and opponents alike. He was one of 23 pitchers to throw a perfect game, and joined the Yankees’ Don Larsen as the only two to fire a no-hitter in the postseason.  Halladay did it for the Phillies in his playoff debut, on Oct. 6, 2010, and came within a fifth-inning walk to the Reds’ Jay Bruce of also being perfect that remarkable evening at Citizens Bank Park. The baseball world was in shock Tuesday after learning of Halladay’s fatal accident, which came only four years after his retirement from the Phillies, his 16-year career prematurely ended by his decision to avoid back surgery.  “We are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay’s untimely death,” the Phillies said in a statement. “There are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.”  Halladay recently purchased the A5 ICON, a two-seat, single-engine amphibious plane capable of landing on water, and his Twitter feed was filled with photographs of him flying the aircraft. According to the Pasco County (Fla.) Police Department, the plane went down in the water, about a quarter-mile offshore, and Halladay died in the crash. There was no one else traveling with him.  Halladay’s accident is the latest in a number of plane crashes that have claimed the lives of prominent baseball players. The Pirates’ Roberto Clemente perished while on a relief mission to Nicaragua on New Year’s Eve in 1972, the Yankees’ Thurman Munson crashed while piloting his own plane near his Ohio home, and another Yankee, Cory Lidle, died when his plane collided with a Manhattan apartment building in 2006.  “Our hearts are broken,” said Tony Clark, the union’s executive director and a former player. “Roy Halladay was not just one of the greatest competitors, but was also among the best men in our generation of players.  Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.  “Our paths crossed many times during our careers, and I can tell you he was among the toughest pitchers I ever faced. But while he never gave in on the mound, he was known in both leagues as an outstanding teammate, a guy who would go out of his way to help other players.”  Halladay, nicknamed “Doc,” was a throwback. As baseball gradually moved to de-emphasize the starting pitcher, he still took pride in going the distance, with 67 complete games, including 20 shutouts. An eight-time All-Star, Halladay also was a three-time 20-game winner, twice during his 12-year stint in Toronto. Halladay will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2019.  “The Blue Jays organization is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchise’s greatest and most respected players, but even better human being,” the team said in a statement. “It is impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.”  In addition to his impact on baseball, Halladay left a lasting imprint on his Florida community, with the Pasco County Police struggling both to investigate the crash and mourn a friend.  “He was one in a million,” Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco told The Associated Press. “It is a true loss for us.”  Nick Fanti, the former Hauppauge High School pitching standout, fondly remembered Halladay after having him as an instructor at the Phillies’ camp in spring training.  “I was fortunate enough to work with Roy Halladay and can honestly say I’m not only a better baseball player, but a better person off the field for it,” Fanti tweeted. “To be able to listen to him talk about his process and how he played the game was an honor. Truly a professional and a legend and will be missed.”  Halladay is survived by his wife, Brandy, and two sons, Ryan and Braden.  Former and current players flocked to Twitter to express their condolences, with Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy summing up a generation’s feelings.  “Roy Halladay was your favorite player’s favorite player,” McCarthy tweeted. “A true ace and a wonderful person. Heartbroken for those who knew him best.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,886

d6742590-9a8e-45c0-89b9-4026c0319b34,"Multiple women have accused Oscar-winning movie director Paul Haggis of sexual assault. Last month, publicist Haleigh Breest filed a civil suit alleging that the filmmaker, who picked up Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay Academy Awards for 2004’s Crash, of rape. On Friday, three other women came forward to The Associated Press with accusations of sexual misconduct.  Haggis denied the claims in Breest’s suit, which was filed in mid-December, and filed a countersuit, claiming the publicist and her lawyer had attempted to extort $9 million from him in exchange for withholding her suit. Breest claimed that Haggis assaulted her in 2013 after he offered her a ride home after an event, but instead took her to his Manhattan apartment; there, she said, he forced her to perform oral sex on him, fondled her, asked if she enjoyed anal sex and raped her. Haggis’ lawyer, Christine Lepera – who represented producer Dr. Luke in the wake of pop-star Kesha accusing him of sexual assault – said, “He didn’t rape anybody,” in a statement.  “Mr. Haggis denies these anonymous claims in whole. In a society where one of a person’s fundamental rights is the ability to confront an accuser, that right has now been eviscerated when it comes to anyone being charged in the press with any sort of sexual misconduct,” a rep for Haggis said in a statement to Rolling Stone. “Notably, no one has reached out to anyone on Mr. Haggis’ team other than the press to report this. He views the fact that these reports appear to be spearheaded from the law firm representing Ms. Breest, as a further tactic to try to harm him and continue their effort to obtain money … We reiterate our claim against Ms. Breest, and note again that we initiated the legal proceedings, not Ms. Breest.”  The new accusers said they felt empowered to come forward after learning of Breest’s story and seeing women report stories of powerful men engaging in sexual misconduct as part of the #MeToo movement. The women, who all chose to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution, claimed to have stories similar to Breest’s: they were all in their 20s or early 30s and they all said Haggis allegedly attempted to set up private meetings with them to discuss business but subsequently tried to kiss them. Two said that Haggis allegedly became more antagonistic when they resisted him.  A lawyer for Breest did not immediately reply to Rolling Stone‘s request for comment but told The AP that Haggis’ countersuit was “a preposterous and transparent PR stunt that will not succeed” and “a further act of aggression.”  One of the new accusers said she was 28 when the alleged attack took place in 1996. She claims she was working on a television show that Haggis produced when he asked her to review some photos from the show. When they met in a back office, she claimed he tried to kiss her. “He said, ‘Do you really want to continue working?'” she claimed. He then allegedly forced her to perform oral sex on him and pushed her onto the floor and raped her.  Another new accuser said she was in her 30s in the late 2000s when she set up a meeting with Haggis to pitch him on a TV show. She said that Haggis told her that he and his wife had an understanding about extramarital sex and came around a table attempting to kiss her. She ran to her car as Haggis allegedly pursued her, though she was able to drive away.  The last new accuser said she was in her late 20s in 2015 when Haggis allegedly held down her arms, kissed her and followed her into a taxi in Canada. When the cab took her to her apartment, she said Haggis allegedly tossed money at the driver, pursued her and kissed her again before she could get inside and close the door. She said that he then waved at her from outside her residence and claimed that he sent aggressive text messages over the next 24 hours until she blocked him. One of the women told the AP that he’d said, “I need to be inside of you,” before she was able to escape.  Outside of filmmaking, Haggis has gained fame for speaking out against Scientology. He broke from the church in 2009 and has since participated in articles, books and a documentary that disparaged the religion. “Mr. Haggis also questions whether Scientology has any role here, which he notes has been attacking him for years with false accusations,” his rep said in a statement. The women whom AP spoke with in their investigation said they had no connection to the Church of Scientology.  Last October, when news of Harvey Weinstein’s alleged misconduct surfaced, Haggis was outspoken in condemning the producer’s supposed behavior. “Although everyone thinks it is vile behavior, you have got to focus on those who may have colluded and protected him,” Haggis told The Guardian, as reported by The AP. “For me, they are as guilty as he is and in some cases more so, if I can say that. I mean, he was a predator and a predator is a predator. But what about those who would rather look the other way?”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1008

Blac Chyna took to Instagram on Sunday, April 23, to share a video of herself showing off her best dance moves while celebrating her BFF Treasure’s baby shower.  In the video, the Lashed Bar entrepreneur, 28, and Treasure — who fans met last year on season one of E!’s Rob & Chyna — bounce up and down as they shake their hips to French Montana and Swae Lee’s “Unforgettable.” While Chyna, dressed in a cream crop top with matching trousers, busts a move, Treasure cradles her baby bump during their mini dance break.

As previously reported, the Arthur George sock designer, 30, and the model, who share 5-month-old daughter Dream, went to TAO in L.A. for a romantic dinner date.  Chyna posted a video of Kardashian putting his hand on her thigh, while she rested her hand on top of his. While they may have appeared to be getting along better than ever, the makeup maven, who also shares son King Cairo, 4, with ex-fiancé Tyga, was not wearing the 7-carat engagement ring with which Kardashian proposed in April 2016.  However, Chyna recently told Cosmopolitan South Africa that she and the once-reclusive reality star have been attending therapy to work on their sometimes volatile relationship. “I’m in it for the long haul, so I feel like my advice [for anyone in a similar situation] is therapy, know each other’s family, calling each other’s moms,” she told the magazine in March. “I know we love each other and we’re fighting for each other, and the people we surround ourselves with are rooting for us.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

fc54363e-9ebb-4201-b0bc-c8857521fd65,"Like always, Coachella was the popular hangout spot for A-list celebs this weekend.  The star-studded grounds of Indio, California, were packed with famous musicians, models and actors listening to music and letting their guards down -- including Selena Gomez and The Weeknd.  REX/Shutterstock  Our fav couple was spotted cuddling on the festival grounds on Saturday, April 15, and they definitely weren't afraid to pack on the PDA.  I mean, look at them. The literally can't stop making out.  Take a breather, you two!  At this point, we aren't too surprised Selena Gomez and her famous bae DGAF about the cameras around them because they've already been spotted multiple times getting intimate in public places.  But, hey, they're still cute as hell and we still can't get enough of 'em. So let's look at more pics, shall we?  Over the weekend, Selena was wearing a springy, light blue dress covered in daisies while Abel rocked a blue plaid shirt. It was a shockingly low-key Coachella look for celebrities.  Either way, they looked adorable kissing in the crowd.  Oh, look! More kissing!  Look at these hotties.  My personal favorite picture of the couple from Coachella is a painfully adorable selfie Selena posted on Instagram yesterday.  In the photo, Abel has his arm wrapped around her as she peeks at the camera above her shades. She looks totally smitten.  C'MON, GUYS. QUIT BEING SO DAMN CUTE.  Well, it's safe to say these two had a romantic getaway in Coachella Valley, but it wasn't all kissing and relaxation for both of them.  On Saturday night, The Weeknd stepped away from Selena and hit the stage for a duet with Nav where he sang ""Party Monster,"" ""Starboy"" and ""Some Way.""  I wonder if they got separation anxiety from the few moments they weren't together.  While Selena and Abel were having the times of their lives at Coachella, Abel's ex Bella Hadid was nowhere in sight.  Instead of taking a trip to Cali, the model flew to Dubai for a weekend full of boat chillin' and skydiving with friends.  Maybe she was trying to avoid the massive PDA between Selena and her ex, or maybe she just isn't a festival-goer.  Either way, if I were her, I definitely wouldn't want to be stuck witnessing the blatant affection happening on Saturday.  But based off the fact both Selena and The Weeknd have made their love IG official, it's getting pretty impossible to ignore it.

Following the leak of Cardi's new song ""Money"" on Tuesday, the artist went on Instagram Live to address Nicki Minaj's fans. In Cardi's brief IG Live video, she explained that her newest song was leaked two days early, much to her dismay. Cardi then alludes to the Barbz being the reason why she and her team decided to go ahead with the release in advance of it's planned date. ""We tried to retract it, but you know the Barbz. They always posting me, they always post everything I do,"" she said. ""They claim they hate me, but they really love me, because they be on my page before my fans.""  The ""Bodak Yellow"" rapper continued, ""So clearly, that seems like love to me, seems like you love me, so it's like, 'F--k it.' I can't retract it, I might as well put it out.""  Her battle with Minaj has been brewing for quite some time and came to a head during New York Fashion Week this year, where Cardi and Nicki got into a fight at the Harper's Bazaar Icons event. Since then, Cardi said she has grown ""sick and tired"" of the Barbz. ""They seem like my biggest f--king fans, always on my f--king page. Always doing the most,"" Cardi said.

And in reference to her ongoing feud with Nicki, Cardi insisted, ""They my songs (sic).""  Cardi B Hands Out Free Winter Coats to Brooklyn Families in Need  The two rappers feud apparently started for many reasons, but when Cardi saw that Nicki liked a tweet questioning Cardi's parenting skills, she was heated. ""I love my daughter. I'm a good-ass f--king mom. So for somebody that don't have a child to like that comment? So many people want to say that party wasn't the time or the place, but I'm not going to catch another artist in the grocery store or down the block,"" she said in an interview with W.  And the internet is convinced Nicki is keeping the feud alive with a subtle diss aimed at Cardi in her song ""Transformer."" In the lyrics, Nicki raps, ""Some call me Nicki but some call me Megatron.

d3b5a159-257d-46b4-8ef2-09e35b4763ff,"Phillip Faraone / WireImage  Selena Gomez is used to living a crazy life. Since debuting at Wizards of Waverly Place in 2007, she has been one of the most famous people in the world. In fact, she was forced to experience all her ups and downs with millions of viewers. This year was no exception. In the last twelve months alone, she has undergone a major operation, released new music and films, gone through a breakup – and looked closely at the media. As Selena celebrates her 26th birthday today, we take some time to reflect on the highlights of her past year, with a timeline of her greatest moments. Through all this she has become stronger than ever. And yes, her fans never loved her again.  July 2017: During her month of birth, Selena released her latest single called ""Fetish"". Next to the song was a sexy video that focused on her lips. The official music video, directed by Petra Collins, was released later this month. The song reached # 27 climax on the Billboard Hot 100. On her 25th birthday, Selena had a solemn celebration with some of her closest friends and shared the event with her Instagram. Although the then friend The Weeknd was in Paris on their special day on tour, he allegedly flew in to celebrate with her. August 2017: August was a weak month for Selena. She was not often seen in public except for a delightful Disneyland date with her husband. The couple seemed to be very loved and was not afraid to show PDA in the amusement park.  September 2017: September comes with a great revelation: Selena reveals that she underwent a kidney transplant this summer because of her lupus. In a viral Instagram post, Selena wrote: ""I'm really looking forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these last months, as I always wanted to do with you."" She also thanked her kidney donor Francia Raisa, writing, ""She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me, and I'm incredibly blessed."" After a few months Selena jumped back into work and filmed the Woody Allen movie A Rainy Day in New York alongside Timothée Chalamet. The film later became controversial due to allegations of sexual misconduct against Allen. He denies her. In response, Selena later stated that she would donate her salary for the Time's Up initiative. In addition, Selena was a cover star for Time Magazine and celebrated her first-person achievement reaching 100 million followers on Instagram.October 2017: October drew attention to Selena's private life as she went through a public disconnect and make-up. At the end of October, it was reported that Justin Bieber was discovered when she brought Los Angeles home. Although we did not jump to conclusions about the nature of their rekindled relationship, speculation grew as Selena announced her breakup with The Weeknd. Soon after, Justin and Selena began spending more time together. In addition to her love life, her single was released with Marshmello ""Wolves"" and climbed into the charts. In addition, the fans were happy when she met at the InStyle Awards with her old friend Demi Lovato.  Vasquez-Max Lopes / BACKGRID  November 2017: Jelena started November with a bang. The couple was discovered on a bike ride through Los Angeles and did little to deny love rumors. The couple began spending more time together, confirming speculation with a kiss on Justin's hockey game. In addition to her new romance, Selena wore a new look and colored her famous dark curls Platinum Blonde for her performance at the AMA Awards. December 2017: End the year right! Selena became Billboard's Wife of the Year and gave an informative interview where she talked about her mental health struggles, her kidney transplant and her relationships. Selena crowned 2017 in Cabo San Lucas with friends, with Justin joining her to the New Year. January 2018: Selena started with a breather in 2018. She traveled to her home state of Texas and visited her parents' home. She thought about what might have been written, ""I visit this place on every occasion I get, in many ways it could have been better today than it does today, but I'm grateful for a voice that can make change today possible I do not know how to do it or really want it, I love you, Grand Prairie, thank you. ""In her month of reflection, she embarked on a two-week program of anxiety and depression. February 2018: A month of public love for Selena and Justin! The couple seemed to get strong as they traveled together, made out at a concert and attended his father's wedding in Jamaica.  March 2018: On the first day of the month, Selena released her first Instagram of Justin in over five years. She rang the bell on her 24th birthday with a photo of her and a Polaroid script, ""March 1, 1994, someone I know who happens to be super cool, was born."" Boom. "" Just a few days after her posting, it was reported that the couple was taking a break from their romance. Selena traveled to Australia for a Hillsong Conference Solo. In addition, her separation from ""The Weeknd"" with the release of his new album, which many speculated about, was recapitulated through Selena. April 2018: April was a month of activism for Selena. She shared her support for the March For Our Lives movement by posting on Instagram and attending a rally. She also attended her 6th WE Day in Los Angeles and made a speech to raise awareness of kidney disease.  Marion Curtis / StarPix / REX / Shutterstock  May 2018: Selena was in the limelight again in her most public month! She began the month participating in the MET Gala, where she later laughed at criticism of her appearance. Selena had professional prizes when the second season of 13 Reasons Why, the show she produced, was released on Netflix. Her song ""Back To You"" on the soundtrack of the show became a breakout hit. The singer surprised fans on the reputation tour with his close friend Taylor Swift. The friends performed ""Hands To Myself"" in front of 60,000 spectators in Los Angeles. June 2018: Selena collaborated again with Petra Collins to release the music video for ""Back To You"". The video showed a one-and-two pair, which led the fans to believe that it was possibly based on their relationship with Justin. The most rewarding part of her month came when Selena enchanted the promo for the Orange County Children's Hospital for pictures with fans.  July 2018: Selena celebrates July 4th holiday with David Henrie, co-star of Wizards of Waverly Place, who posted stunning photos on Instagram and wrote: ""Hope, everyone had a great 4th of July! Played with some of my favorite people . "" Release of Hotel Transylvania 3 was a great success as it exceeded the box office. Perhaps the most shocking thing this month was Justin's engagement with Hailey Baldwin. However, Selena did not seem to be affected by the news as she was happily spotted spending time with friends and making a new movie in New York State. It's not yet clear how the star will ring in her 26th birthday, but after this crazy year she definitely deserves a party.  Do not miss E!

But unfortunately for Kristen, life doesn’t have the ctrl+z option so she’s stuck with any mistakes she (might) have made – and embarrassing things she might have said.  Just one month before she was exposed as a cheat with Rupert Sanders, she revealed that she wants to have babies with her long-term boyfriend R-Pattz.  In an un-guarded moment, she told Vogue journalist Christa D’Souza: ""My God, I'm so in love with my boyfriend. I wish he were here now. I think I want to have his babies.""  Before adding: “I love the way he smells. And him me. Like, he loves to lick under my armpits.”  While it’s ultimately quite a gross thing to say, it proves that Rob found Kristen so amazing he was happy to lick her sweaty pits. But he’s not the only person to think his Twilight co-star is, er, flawless.  Rupert describes Kristen, 22, as ""amazing"" and ""flawless"" in the voiceover on the Snow White and the Huntsman DVD director's commentary.  It’s a fair assumption this was filmed before his fling with K-Stew became world (and wife Liberty Ross) knowledge.  (Image: Getty)  Before the affair, Rupert was asked whether Kristen and Liberty – who also featured in the movie – were friends.  He replied: ""She and Liberty didn't have very many scenes together, so they didn't get to know each other that well. But they definitely have similarities. There's a look they share.""  Yesterday, Kristen wore Rob's t-shirt which had the word IRIE printed on the front when she arrived in Toronto for the film festival.  And if you didn't know what that means, it stands for ‘the way you feel when you have no worries – to be at total peace with your current state of being’.  We feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes piecing together the hidden flirty messages.

b62c642b-fb2c-41d4-8041-811e09c664dc,"Before Luann D’Agostino announced that she and husband Tom D’Agostino were divorcing after only 7 months of marriage, the Real Housewives of New York City opened up to her cast mates and to host Andy Cohen about what, if anything, would cause her to leave him.  On the RHONY reunion part 1, which was filmed three weeks before the couple officially split, the 52-year-old former countess was once again faced with rumors of Tom’s infidelities from her fellow New York City Housewives — this time allegedly taking place after the couple had said their “I dos.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Of course, Luann has a lot of experience knocking down these sorts of claims, having spent two seasons on the hit Bravo show defending their whirlwind romance. But on the reunion, Luann showed a more vulnerable side — admitting that it alarms her to hear the constant rumors.  Asked what she would do if those claims ended up having validity, Luann gave a swift answer.  “I would definitely leave,” she said in a clip of the reunion released Wednesday morning. “I would. After I kill him. I’d kill him first and then I’d leave. You can push me so far but once you push me over the line…”  Luann D'Agostino Bravo  Said allegations appeared to be true only once, when Tom, 50, was caught by a friend of costar Bethenny Frankel’s kissing a mysterious blonde at The Regency Hotel the day before their engagement party. Luann forgave her then-finacé and has maintained he’s been faithful since their lavish New Years Eve ceremony in Palm Beach — despite his flirtatious personality and “hot mic” moments on the show (including a scene in which he referred to himself as a “dog with a collar” while chatting with an ex at a party).  “I admit his humor is a little off,” Luann said on the reunion, indicating that she understood how Tom — who was a lifelong bachelor before they wed — came off on the show.  Tom and Luann D'Agostino Robin Marchant/Getty  The reality star also revealed that she did not have an open relationship with Tom, telling Cohen, “I’m not interesting in an open relationship otherwise I wouldn’t be married.”  Her comments may not have convinced her RHONY costars. “You stayed with Alex all those years,” Sonja Morgan said of Luann’s first husband Count Alexandre de Lesseps, whom Luann had previously said cheated on her.  “Well, that was different,” said Luann. “You see we were separated and I didn’t really want anyone to know.”  FROM PEN: Highlights from Luann de Lesseps & Tom D’Agostino Jr.’s Wedding  Luann announced on Twitter Aug. 3 that she and Tom were divorcing. “It’s with great sadness that Tom & I agreed to divorce,” she wrote. “We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!”  Days later, she denied allegations that Tom had been unfaithful.  “I do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,” Luann told Page Six on Aug. 3 when asked the reasons for their divorce. “God knows he’s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don’t believe that continued [while we were married].”  ”It was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work,” she continued. “It was a tough decision and we are both very sad about it.

But (not unlike Harry's wife, Meghan Markle) Bonas also has an acting career. And while some royal fans felt a pang of empathy watching Bonas attend her former boyfriend's wedding to Meghan, they don't have to—Bonas has some good things going, too.  Cressida Bonas arrives at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding. Getty Images IAN WEST  She's reportedly just been cast in the leading role for ITV's The White House Farm Murders, a six-part series is based on a notorious 1985 quintuple murder at an Essex family home. Decades later, the tragic event receives regular press, as the accused murderer Jeremy Bamber continues to challenge his conviction from prison.  Bonas will play the family's ill-fated daughter. Two other familiar faces will star alongside her: Alfie Allen and Mark Addy, who portrayed Theon Greyjoy and King Robert Baratheon, respectively, in Game of Thrones.  Cressida Bonas (left) attends Princess Eugenie’s wedding. Getty Images Max Mumby/Indigo  Though the actress may never live down her association with Prince Harry, Bonas certainly seems to have moved on. She seemed perfectly at ease attending Harry and Meghan's wedding, and even blogged about the experience. ""Last weekend I attended the royal wedding,"" she wrote in a diary entry for the Spectator. ""The invitation clearly stated that guests must wear hats. Yikes. I opted for a minimal feathered number—and can only hope I got it right."" Not even a mention of her former beau!  Bonas also made an appearance at the year's second royal wedding, between Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank. Eugenie and Cressida are longtime friends; it was actually Eugenie and her sister Beatrice who introduced Bonas to Prince Harry in the first place. So while she may not marry a Prince, Bonas still gets to run in royal circles—and that's really the best part anyways.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,386

But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, “Uh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.”  By the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.  Jason? He knew a year later.  I have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I’m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.  First, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.  The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.  He is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him — or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes — know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.  If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food — man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening’s meal.

bdc9cebe-57fb-45c4-89e3-db839b732f3e,"2.4k SHARES Share TweetPhotos of arrested illegal immigrants from cage-like cells moved viral this weekend. Liberals were too quick to disperse this shocking picture, as proof of President Donald Trump’s cruelty. But their incredible blunder just backfired. Now, they’re screwed.The answer, naturally, is a resounding no. Democrats will do anything to undermine the president’s work. That includes being underhanded, manipulative, and cruel as possible.Within the course of Trump’s period in office, we have seen liberals do some shockingly dreadful things. They’ve insulted his wife by criticizing her intelligence, state of origin, as well as her accent, demonstrating who the real racists and sexists are.Liberals didn’t hesitate to question his children’s psychological health, even calling Barron handicapped. That is not even mentioning the numerous times that left handed outlets edited videos or photos to create Trump look like a poor guy.However, what they did that this weekend actually takes the cake. A photo went viral throughout Twitter. The dreadful picture depicted arrested illegal immigrants. These individuals — arrested by our government — were made to stay in cages resembling dog kennels.It is too bad that these liberals did not bother to check the date on the film.Ex-Obama staffer Jon Favreau, in a now-deleted conversation, linked to a AZCentral.com article titled,”First glance of immigrant kids at holding facility” and said”This is occurring right now, and the only argument that issue is the way we force our government to get these kids back to their families as quickly as possible”His obvious intent was to slam the Trump government for its treatment of unaccompanied minors taken into custody at the border. [Source: Twitchy]Jon Favreau was among many liberals who assaulted Trump within this injustice. The famous Hollywood actor and director once worked for Obama as his speechwriter. So I guess he understood how better things were under the last government, right? This liberal celebrity is likely horrified every day over what he sees coming from the White House. I mean, that could let something as bad as this:How dreadful! Certainly the guy responsible for this is a total racist, who hates brown people. Liberals have every right to spread this photograph to as many people as possible.But wait, let’s look at the initial post. It was from ACCentral.com. As stated by the date, this was composed in 2014.That’s right, liberals. This photograph you are so outraged more than was taken through Obama’s administration.Liberals were not storming Twitter with demands for change. They were not calling Obama racist for treating kids like this. Why weren’t the overlords inside the mainstream press requiring answers from his government?Appears like liberals didn’t care when Obama mistreated illegals. Yet they accuse Trump of racism, dependent on nothing. All Trump wants to do is protect our border from crime and terrorism.He is not treating illegals like creatures. However, while Trump calls vile MS-13 members”animals,” Obama was treating children like creatures. Really makes you think.Liberals, in their own feverish hatred for Trump, unwittingly outed among Obama’s numerous sins. And their own. They pretend to care, as a response to Trump’s stance on immigration.Before Trump suggested the wall, liberals did not think twice about illegals. We all know that for a fact since this article has been around for FOUR decades, and they have said nothing.Featured Image Source H/T: MadWorldNewsLike this: Like Loading...",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,659
adf2637d-c4a6-4830-9635-97dbb4a15b9f,"It looks like congratulations are in order for Hollywood couple Alicia Vikander and Michael Fassbender, as they're reportedly now husband and wife.  The pair, who began dating back in 2014 after meeting on the set of their film The Light Between Oceans, got married in a private ceremony at a resort in Ibiza over the weekend, according to People.  Both Alicia and Michael have also been pictured with rings on their wedding finger by the Daily Mail as they spent time with family and friends on the island, so all signs point to the notoriously private couple tying the knot.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Digital Spy has reached out to reps for the actors for comment.  Alicia and Michael have largely kept their relationship private in the years they've been together, keeping public appearances together to a minimum but acknowledging their relationship in moments like Alicia kissing Michael before accepting her Oscar for The Danish Girl in February 2016.  Speaking to EW last year about their relationship, both Alicia and Michael said that they value their privacy.  ""I think we've made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us,"" Alicia said. ""It was very easy to unite, but that's quite personal.""  Michael added: "" I'm not going to talk about my private life with a total stranger, unless I feel like I need to. Why would I? I don't.""  © Getty Images Karwai Tang  The couple will be entering into married life with a lot of big films on the horizon, with Michael Fassbender currently starring in the adaptation of Jo Nesbø's bestselling thriller The Snowman and also due to reprise his role as Magneto in next year's X-Men: Dark Phoenix.  Alicia, meanwhile, is gearing up for the release of the Tomb Raider reboot, in which she takes over the role of Lara Croft from Angelina Jolie.

3ae5762b-d896-4e25-bf59-baba745236e9,"Activists have often turned to fashion to heighten moments of protest. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s inauguration last January, women flooded Washington wearing pink pussycat hats to march on the Capitol. In September, celebrities made a political statement at the 2017 Emmys by wearing blue ACLU ribbons after Trump announced his plans to end DACA.  But perhaps this year’s Golden Globes could thread Hollywood’s largest display of solidarity as some of the biggest names in show business pledge to don black at the 75th annual event.  With the influx of sexual misconduct allegations in entertainment — and other industries — since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke in October, stars of the big and small screen are planning to wear all black to the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles this Sunday in support of those who have spoken out about sexual harassment and to protest gender inequality.  Along with the dark ensembles, participants will reportedly be accessorizing with pins created by Time’s Up — the coalition behind the statement.  CREDIT: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and 300 other prominent women in the entertainment industry are behind the Time’s Up initiative aimed at eradicating abuse, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation in the work place.  Related Natalie Portman Speaks Out on 'Pervasive' Abuse in Hollywood Kerry Washington, Time's Up Leaders Among Investors in The Wing, a Women's Workspace Startup  The alliance almost decided to boycott the Golden Globe Awards entirely, Kerry Washington told the LA Times. But the group eventually decided against it, suggesting that it was important to support their peers who were nominated.  Instead, an agreement was made to wear all black, with the hopes that this unified stand would prompt a larger discussion from the red carpet, leveraging the access to millions of viewers tuned in to watch the awards show, both on camera and online, with the hashtag #WhyWeWearBlack.  “Wearing black is an opportunity to talk about all the other things that we’re doing,” Washington explained to the Times. “We’re saying that we are three-dimensional, fully realized human beings as women. We are participants in this entertainment industry, and we have something to say.”  Despite the all-black attire creating a seemingly similar aesthetic, Cristina Ehrlich, whose clients include Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Greta Gerwig, Laura Dern, Alison Brie, Allison Williams, and Tina Fey, said her clients will still be telling a unique story through fashion.  “People aren’t using words anymore like, ‘I want to look sexy.’ It’s more about, ‘I want to look like I’m a woman of power. I want to look like a woman who is standing my ground,'” Ehrlich told Variety earlier this week.  Several women have even requested to wear female designers, she added.  “Because [the Globes] is international and it’s the Hollywood Foreign Press, you really want these women to have a moment that is going to strike as many different audiences as you can,” she said.  Stylist Ilaria Urbanati, who works with Dwayne Johnson, Tom Hiddleston, and Armie Hammer, posted about the protest on Instagram in December and confirmed her male clients will be wearing black in unity with women.  “Safe to say this may not be the right time to choose to be the odd man out here,” she wrote.  To the critics who argued that #WhyWeWearBlack wouldn’t be an effective demonstration, actress Rashida Jones says they’re missing the point entirely.  “This is not a silent protest,” the actress told InStyle. “We wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time’s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It’s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.” Online, fellow actors Ashley Judd and Tessa Thompson tweeted their support of Jones’ statements.  Viewers will get to see that online solidarity in action on the red carpet Sunday night.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,774
06fc7f80-1657-497f-959b-df7aea3f2075,"In the seven months since his abrupt separation from wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has kept a low profile. It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ.  Pitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied.  The GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, “tumbling through” three national parks, and a music video.  But according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the “self-inflicted” situation he’s in.  But instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly “ripped apart” the Internet has sided with him.  An article titled “Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword” published on E! said, “Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he’s gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he’s doing to right the ship.”  Vanity Fair said, “Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he’s doing a lot of work on himself.”  And Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: “People like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.”  The BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have “Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,” on the interview.  “But of course the timing is calculated,” Borkowski continues. “The language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.”  “A lot of people prefer to stay before the waterline and not do it. He’s taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn’t go this far.”  Follow @htshowbiz for more  First Published: May 05, 2017 10:06 IST",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,553

USA TODAY  Billboard named Ariana Grande the 2018 Woman of the Year. (Photo: Chris Pizzello, Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP)  Ariana Grande may have spoken too soon when she sang about having no tears left to cry.  On Wednesday night, Grande tweeted a joke about the lyrics of her single, suggesting that its wisdom may have been premature.  ""Remember when I was like hey I have no tears left to cry and the universe was like HAAAAAAAAA (expletive) u thought,"" she wrote on Twitter.  Grande originally released ""No Tears Left To Cry"" in April as a triumphant comeback single, her first new song since the tragic bombing at her Manchester concert in 2017. And while a rosy few months followed for the star in which she began dating and quickly became engaged to Pete Davidson, things came crashing down in September, when her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller died of an accidental drug overdose.  Following Miller's death, Grande and Davidson ended their engagement in October, with Grande canceling her appearance as the musical guest on the Sept. 29 season premiere of ""Saturday Night Live,"" for ""emotional reasons.""  More: Ariana Grande trips during 'Ellen' performance, drops 'Breathin' video  Related: Ariana Grande says her exes heard 'Thank U, Next' before its release  After suggesting that she would spend some time away from social media in the wake of Miller's death, Grande has been active on Twitter in recent days, tweeting plenty of jokes as well as sincere commentary.  ""Thank god,"" she sardonically quoted one tweet that read ""Ariana Grande is like one song away from making girls never talk to guys ever again.""  And yet, when one fan tweeted ""Who is Ariana's therapist and are they accepting new clients,"" Grande replied with an earnest argument for seeking out mental health resources.  ""This is funny as (expletive) but in all honesty therapy has saved my life so many times,"" she wrote. ""If you’re afraid to ask for help, don’t be. You don’t have to be in constant pain & u can process trauma. I’ve got a lot of work to do but it’s a start to even be aware that it’s possible.""  On Wednesday, Grande had a busy day, dropping a video for her song ""Breathin"" and performing her new tune ""Thank U Next"" for the first time on ""Ellen."" During the performance, Grande tripped on stage.  She also became visibly emotional at one point during the song.  The pop star celebrated her big day on social media by tweeting black-and-white clips from the performance and writing she was ""so ....... (expletive)...... grateful.""

94208dcb-67ad-4b8d-8a6e-2d27fdc11b7f,"Ariana Grande‘s manager Scooter Braun expressed his condolences after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday, October 1.  “I don’t really have words this morning. I am deeply saddened. And as horrifying as it is to say I can’t tell you I’m surprised. Our greatest challenges are ahead of us,” the businessman, 36, wrote in a lengthy Twitter statement on Monday, October 2. “What took place in Las Vegas last night should never happen. What took place in Manchester should never happen. What took place in Charlottesville should never happen. But they are all happening. And ALL of them are terrorist attacks. They strike fear in our ability to live our lives. They all make us question taking our children, our friends, our loved ones… to public events that are supposed to bring us joy… in fear of devastation. They are all attacks on our way of life and our way of love.”  As previously reported, at least 58 people were killed and 515 injured when a gunman opened fire on a crowd of country music festivalgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandala Bay Resort and Casino. The attack is now the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history and came just four months after a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured 250 others at Grande’s concert in Manchester, England.  “So first let me say my heart breaks for all those affected in Las Vegas,” Braun continued. “Nothing we do can bring back your loved ones and I am so sorry. For those in the hospital recovering we are with you. Keep fighting. And for all of us… who are we? What will we choose to do in response? Will we just instagram and move on? Will we think this is about a hashtag with the word #vegas in it? Or will we wait until the next one affects us? THIS ONE affects us. #LasVegas is ALL of us. This is an attack on your friends, your family, your kids, your way of life.”  The talent manager continued, “So as we think about those lost and those hurting this morning… what do you and I owe them? We owe them our courage. We owe them our faith. We owe them our strength and our spirit to rise up and come together and demand not only better now but better Tomorrow.”  Braun then reflected upon the One Love Manchester benefit concert that was held in June. “When I was in Manchester I witnessed something defiant,” he wrote. “At the end of the One Love Manchester show… only 2 weeks after the attack and less than 24 hours since the london attack…when the cameras were off… the crowd of 55,000 brave souls started to sing. [They] echoed the words ‘Manchester we’re strong, we’re strong, we’re strong. We’ll keep singing our songs, our songs, our songs!’ This repeated for 15 minutes as they exited. Defiance in the face of fear. Las Vegas we’re strong. We’re strong. We’re strong. We’ll keep singing our songs…Together. RIP to those lost.”  Grande, 24, also reacted to the Las Vegas shooting, tweeting, “My heart is breaking for Las Vegas. We need love, unity, peace, gun control & for people to look at this & call this what it is = terrorism.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

3f0d92d9-89ab-48e3-9d1f-7f0006443d8b,"Slow Hands is a song recorded by Irish singer and songwriter Niall Horan, released as a single on 4 May 2017 by Capitol Records.[2] The song was written by Horan, Alexander Izquierdo, John Ryan, Julian Bunetta, Ruth Anne Cunningham and Tobias Jesso Jr., while the production was handled by Bunetta.[3] It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 9 May 2017[4] as the second single from Horan's debut solo album Flicker (2017).  ""Slow Hands"" peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Horan's highest-charting single in those countries.  Background and composition [ edit ]  Prior to its release, Horan discussed the song in an interview with Mikey Piff on Sirius XM. The singer said that after listening to some of the material he had recorded for his debut album, he wanted to add ""a bit more grit, funk and heavier bass."" At the time he was listening to late 1970s and early 1980s music. ""When Don Henley went solo in the early eighties, he just kinda had this funky kind of feel to it – heavy bass, heavy guitar – so I just thought, 'Let's give this a crack,'"" Horan said of making the track. ""I wanted it to be a little bit cheeky with the lyric."" About the concept, he explained it is set in a bar and the song's theme changes up stereotypical roles. ""The first line is...'we should take this back to my place' – and usually that's what the guy would say, but we flipped it that the girl would say that, and that's what she said right to my face.""[5][6]  ""Slow Hands"" is a bass-heavy funk-pop song, with Horan singing in a lower register.[5][7] A Billboard writer described it as an ""R&B-inflected rock tune.""[8]  Critical reception [ edit ]  In Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted ""Slow Hands"" focuses on a ""funkier guitar vibe"", compared to Horan's previous single ""This Town."" She also opined ""the subtly-sexy song"" shows an ""edgier side of Niall.""[9] Colin Stutz from the publication, added, ""The combination of a thumping beat and Horan's raspy vocals makes the song hardly even sound like the same guy who sang [""This Town""]. But what ""Slow Hands"" shows is that Horan definitely won't just be sticking to the sweet singer-songwriter sound on his solo debut.""[6] Rolling Stone's Althea Legaspi also noted Horan ""goes for a more muted sound. Above a stomp-and-clap beat and muted guitar, Horan allows his lower register to showcase his more seductive side on the track.""[5]  In The Irish Times, Jennifer Gannon wrote that ""it’s no radical departure, Niall hasn’t decided to go Gaga but it’s a step in a more Sheeran-style, crowd-pleasing direction. A gentle, foot-stomper about a lady with a magic touch, a lady who knows what she wants, she wants to get her hands all over Niall's ""dirty laundry"" and not in a bringing your washing home on a Sunday way. This isn’t Timberlake’s Sexy Back, it’s Horan’s Sweaty Back.""[10]  Billboard's critics' list placed it second on ""Every One Direction Solo Single, Ranked"" in May 2017, stating that the ""secret"" highlight ""[is] the way Niall's vocal on the first verse is ever so discretely chopped on the recording to a clipped staccato, a mysterious move that forces the singer into a less-is-more delivery that ends up being much more indeed.""[11]  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Slow Hands"" charted within the top 10 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single became his second top 20 entry as a solo artist on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 11 and surpassing his preceding single ""This Town"", which reached number 20. On 15 September 2017, the single was certified Platinum for combined sales and streaming equivalent units of over a million units in the United States. On the chart dated 7 October 2017, the single reached number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[12] As of December 2017, it has sold one million copies in the US.[13]  Live performances [ edit ]  Horan has performed ""Slow Hands"" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[14][15] On 29 May 2017, the singer performed ""Slow Hands"", ""This Town"" and premiered the track ""On the Loose"" on The Today Show.[16] On 4 June 2017, Horan performed the song during the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.[17] On 5 June he performed on BBC One's The One Show.[18] The singer also performed ""Slow Hands"" at the Capital FM's Summertime Ball 2017.[19]  On 22 June 2018, Horan performed the song with American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, at the first London show of her Reputation Stadium Tour at Wembley Stadium, as a surprise guest.

ce16375c-ac6c-44b8-8f31-07e64096a145,"Person of the Year (called Man of the Year or Woman of the Year until 1999)[1] is an annual issue of the United States news magazine Time that features and profiles a person, a group, an idea, or an object that ""for better or for worse... has done the most to influence the events of the year"".[2]  Background [ edit ]  The tradition of selecting a ""Man of the Year"" began in 1927, with Time editors contemplating the news makers of the years. The idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year of not having aviator Charles Lindbergh on its cover following his historic trans-Atlantic flight. By the end of the year, it was decided that a cover story featuring Lindbergh as the Man of the Year would serve both purposes.[3]  Selection [ edit ]  U.S. Presidents [ edit ]  Since the list began, every serving President of the United States has been a Man or Person of the Year at least once with the exceptions of Calvin Coolidge, in office at time of the first issue, Herbert Hoover, the next U.S. president, and Gerald Ford. Most were named Man or Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office; the only one to be given the title before being elected is Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 1944 as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, eight years before his election. He subsequently received the title again in 1959, while in office. Franklin D. Roosevelt is the only person to have received the title three times, first as president-elect (1932) and later as the incumbent president (1934 and 1941).  Women [ edit ]  In 1999, the title was changed to Person of the Year.[4] Women who have been selected for recognition after the renaming include ""The Whistleblowers"" (Cynthia Cooper, Coleen Rowley, and Sherron Watkins in 2002), Melinda Gates (jointly with Bill Gates and Bono, in 2005), Angela Merkel in 2015 and ""The Silence Breakers"" (Isabel Pascual, Adama Iwu, Ashley Judd, Susan Fowler and Taylor Swift in 2017). Prior to 1999, four women were granted the title as individuals: three as ""Woman of the Year""—Wallis Simpson (1936), Queen Elizabeth II (1952), and Corazon Aquino (1986)–and one as half of the ""Man and Wife of the Year"", Soong Mei-ling (1937).[5] ""American Women"" were recognized as a group in 1975. Other classes of people recognized comprise both men and women, such as ""Hungarian Freedom Fighters"" (1956), ""U.S. Scientists"" (1960), ""The Inheritors"" (1966), ""The Middle Americans"" (1969), ""The American Soldier"" (2003), ""You"" (2006), ""The Protester"" (2011) represented on the cover by a woman, and ""Ebola fighters"" (2014). Although the title on the magazine remained ""Man of The Year"" for both the 1956 ""Hungarian Freedom Fighter"" and the 1966 ""Twenty-five and Under"" editions which both featured a woman standing behind a man, and ""Men of the Year"" on the 1960 ""U.S. Scientists"" edition which exclusively featured men on its cover. It wasn't until the 1969 edition on ""The Middle Americans"" did the title embrace ""Man and Woman of the Year"".  Groups and non-humans [ edit ]  Despite the name, the title is not just granted to individuals. Pairs of people such as married couples and political opponents, classes of people, and inanimate objects have all been selected for the special year-end issue.  Multiple named people  Classes of unnamed people  The American fighting-man (1950)  The Hungarian freedom fighter (1956)  U.S. Scientists (1960)  The Inheritor (1966)  Middle Americans (1969)  American women (1975)  The American soldier (2003)  You (2006)  The Protester (2011)  Ebola fighters (2014)  The Silence Breakers (2017)  Inanimate objects  The Computer (Machine of the Year, 1982)  The Endangered Earth (Planet of the Year, 1988)  Special awards [ edit ]  In 1949, Winston Churchill was named ""Man of the Half-Century"", and the last issue of 1989 named Mikhail Gorbachev as ""Man of the Decade"". The December 31, 1999 issue of Time named Albert Einstein the ""Person of the Century"". Franklin D. Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi were chosen as runners-up.[6]  Controversial choices [ edit ]  Despite the magazine's frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor, and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people.[7] However, Time magazine points out that controversial figures such as Adolf Hitler (1938), Joseph Stalin (1939 and 1942), Nikita Khrushchev (1957) and Ayatollah Khomeini (1979) have also been granted the title for their impacts.[8]  As a result of the public backlash it received from the United States for naming Khomeini as Man of the Year in 1979, Time has since shied away from using figures who are controversial in the United States for commercial reasons, fearing reductions in sales or advertising revenue.[9]  Time's Person of the Year 2001, immediately following the September 11, 2001 attacks, was New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The stated rules of selection, the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest effect on the year's news, made Osama bin Laden a more likely choice that year. The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned Time's earlier decision to select the Ayatollah Khomeini and the 1999 rejection of Hitler as ""Person of the Century"". The article seemed to imply that Osama bin Laden was a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as Adolf Hitler was a stronger candidate than Albert Einstein. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history and who represented either the year or the century the most. According to Time, Rudolph Giuliani was selected for symbolizing the American response to the September 11th attacks, and Albert Einstein selected for representing a century of scientific exploration and wonder.  Another controversial choice was the 2006 selection of ""You"", representing most if not all people for advancing the information age by using the Internet (via e.g. blogs, MySpace, YouTube, and Wikipedia).[10]  Withdrawn selections [ edit ]  In 1941, the fictional elephant Dumbo from the Disney movie of the same name was selected to be ""Mammal of the Year"", and a cover was created showing Dumbo in a formal portrait style. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7 pre-empted the cover. The U.S. president Franklin Delano Roosevelt was named Man of the Year for a record third time, although Dumbo's Mammal of the Year profile still appeared on the inside pages of the magazine.[11]  Film-maker Michael Moore claims that director Mel Gibson cost him the opportunity to be Person of the Year alongside Gibson in 2004. Moore's controversial political documentary Fahrenheit 9/11 became the highest-grossing documentary of all time the same year Gibson's The Passion of the Christ became a box-office success and also caused significant controversy. Moore said in an interview ""I got a call right after the '04 election from an editor from Time Magazine. He said,' Time Magazine has picked you and Mel Gibson to be Time's Person of the Year to put on the cover, Right and Left, Mel and Mike. The only thing you have to do is pose for a picture with each other. And do an interview together.' I said 'OK.' They call Mel up, he agrees. They set the date and time in LA. I'm to fly there. He's flying from Australia. Something happens when he gets home... Next thing, Mel calls up and says, 'I'm not doing it. I've thought it over and it is not the right thing to do.' So they put Bush on the cover.""[12]  On November 24, 2017, U.S. president Donald Trump posted on the social media network Twitter that Time editors had told him he would ""probably"" be named Person of the Year for a second time, conditional on an interview and photo shoot which he had refused. Time denied that they had made any such promises or conditions to Trump, who was named a runner-up.[13]  Online poll [ edit ]  Time magazine also holds an online poll for the readers to vote for who they believe to be the Person of the Year. While many mistakenly believe the winner of the poll to be the Person of the Year, the title, as mentioned above, is decided by the editors of Time. In the first online poll held in 1998, wrestler and activist Mick Foley won with over 50% of the votes.[14][15] Foley was removed from the poll, and the title was given to Bill Clinton and Ken Starr, which led to outrage from the fans of Foley who mistakenly believed the winner of the poll would be the winner of the title. In 2006, the poll winner by a wide margin was Hugo Chávez, with 35% of the votes. The president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, came in second. Time again ignored those results, not mentioning them in the announcement of the Person of the Year.[16] Time continues to annually run an online poll for the ""People's Choice"", but stresses the decision on whom the magazine recognizes is not made by the poll, but by the magazine's editors.[17]  Persons of the Year [ edit ]  See also [ edit ]  Notes [ edit ]  ^ Canada, Ceylon, New Zealand, Elizabeth also acceded to the thrones of Australia Pakistan and South Africa ^ [55] Trump claimed that he had been offered a photoshoot for Person of the Year and turned it down, which Time's editors disputed and denied.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1946

What’s more — the informant reveals both Aniston and Jane “are both pretty old school and write long letters to each other a couple of times a month.” Plus, they talk on the phone regularly and never miss a birthday or anniversary.  “Jane and the whole Missouri-based Pitt family haven’t been disrespectful about Jen and Justin’s marriage, but once it became apparent things wouldn’t work out they actively pushed Brad to get back in touch” dishes the snitch. “Now they’re determined to see them back together for a second chance.”  As fans know, Pitt famously left wife Aniston for Angelina Jolie. They later wed but also split up.  But Aniston reportedly leaned on her ex-husband Brad over the course of 15 months as her ­marriage to Justin Theroux crumbled.  Aniston and Theroux announced their breakup on Feb. 15, 2018 after only two-and-a-half years of marriage.  The announcement read, in part, “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.  “We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship….Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  Radar told you first that Aniston and Theroux were breaking up and detailed their many issues.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,336

94310cb2-250e-44cf-9a18-b021a7eef9bb,"One of the most contentious issues in the State of Missouri’s case against Gov. Eric Greitens has been the whereabouts of an incriminating photo that he is alleged to have taken and disseminated.A deposition of the woman (K.S.) in question, the woman who accused Greitens of taking a nude photo of her, reveals one new shocking bit of evidence. The woman may have dreamed up the incident at the heart of the criminal case.The defense team’s April 8 motion to compel immediate production of all exculpatory evidence reports the following exchange.When the defense counsel asked K.S., “Did you ever see [Greitens] in possession of a camera or phone?” she answered: “Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it.”The question was then asked, “And as you sit here now, you cannot state under oath that you ever saw him in possession of a camera – with a camera or a phone?”K.S. replied, “Correct.”The counsel then asked, “And you can’t say you saw it on his person, you can’t say you saw him put it down in the kitchen, take it from the kitchen, or put it down anywhere in the basement. Those are all correct statements, are they not?”K.S. answered, “Yes. I cannot say.”Trying to salvage the state’s case, the Assistant Circuit Attorney later asked K.S., “Did you see what you believed to be a phone?”Here comes the shocker. K.S. answered, “… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that.”K.S. remembered the photo incident “through a dream”? Memories recovered through dreams have led to some of the great injustices in recent jurisprudence. To her credit, K.S. struggled to give honest answers to the questions she was asked, but her honesty has undone the remaining threads of a quickly unraveling case.As the defense counsel observed in the motion, the state was aware that recovered memories may have accounted for K.S.’s recollection, but state prosecutors failed to turn that obviously exculpatory evidence over to the defense. K.S. also failed to so share this revelation with the House committee investigating Greitens.Defense counsel insists that there is additional exculpatory evidence the prosecution has yet to turn over to the defense and has asked the court to order Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner to produce it.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,508

Last night saw Bieber cancel his world ‘Purpose’ tour, months before it was due to end – citing claiming to be ‘burned out’ and exhausted from the months on the road.  Now, sources claim that Bieber may be turning his attention to ‘reconnecting with his faith’ and starting up his own church.  “I am led to believe that the real reason he has come off the road is because he wants to reconnect with his faith and he may be even planning to start his own church,” celebrity journalist Richard Wilkins told Today Extra – after speaking to sources close to him at the annual Hillsong Church Conference in Sydney.  “We know that he was in the country a few weeks ago having meetings and attending the big Hillsong convention that they had here.

Beyoncé took a strong stance on Kaepernick’s actions to protest police brutality at the 2017 Sportsperson of the Year Awards Show in New York. Kaepernick’s decision to remain seated while the national anthem played back in 2016 sparked similar protests by NFL players that continue to incite controversy in the present.  “Thank you Colin Kaepernick. Thank you for your selfless heart, and your conviction,” the “Lemonade” singer said in her presentation speech. “Thank you for your personal sacrifice. Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better. To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color.”  “We’re still waiting for the world to catch up. It’s been said that racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America. So, let’s be very clear. Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selfless serve and protect our country and our communities and our families. His message is solely focused on social injustice for historically disenfranchised people. Let’s not get that mistaken.”  Related Two Beyonce Albums Leak Onto Streaming Services — Then Disappear Beyonce Buys Out Ivy Park Co-Owner After Chairman Accused of Sexual and Racial Harassment  In his acceptance speech, Kaepernick said that his “platform is the people.”  “I say this as a person who receives credit for using my platform to protest systemic oppression, racialized injustice and the dire consequences of anti-blackness in America,” he said. “I accept this award not for myself, but on behalf of the people. Because if it were not for my love of the people, I would not have protested. And if it was not for the support from the people, I would not be on this stage today. With or without the NFL’s platform, I will continue to work for the people because my platform is the people.”  Kaepernick has been unable to find a new NFL position since he opted out of his contract with the 49ers at the end of the 2016 season, and sued the NFL and its owners in October for collusion against hiring him. Kaepernick also received the ACLU’s courageous advocate award Monday evening.

f0d4108c-b1b9-4b45-b835-b07723746c9c,"Nearly two years after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, the former power couple have reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for this summer, Us Weekly confirms.  According to court documents obtained by Us, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County determined that “not having a relationship with their father” would be “harmful” to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9. The court said that the kids “are safe with their father” and that it is “critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship” with both of their parents. However, Maddox is essentially free to go with either parent because of his age.  Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, were ordered to arrange a phone call between them, their children and two psychologists “to explain the summer schedule,” the documents state. The Fight Club actor will have physical custody of the minor children (all but Maddox) for four hours a day from June 8 to 17 in London, where the Maleficent actress rents a house. Pitt must spend time with each child at least twice during the 10-day period with one of the psychologists present. Jolie will not be present during her estranged husband’s custodial time.  The Moneyball actor will have custody of the minor children for 10 hours each day from June 27 to July 1 with the other psychologist present. He also has custody for four hours a day from July 8 to 14. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Pitt will have custody of the kids from July 21 to 29. He is responsible for returning them back to Jolie in London on July 29, in addition to paying for their transportation. He will have custody again from August 11 until the estranged couple’s next court hearing on August 13.  In addition, the Tomb Raider actress must provide Pitt with “each of the minor children’s personal cellphone numbers so that [he] may text them,” according to the documents obtained by Us. She cannot monitor the texts.  Jolie and Pitt separated in September 2016. In light of the latest arrangement, a source tells Us, “This [divorce] has been a longstanding back-and-forth, and hopefully now there will be greater collaboration for the benefit of the kids. The kids have always been a priority for both parents and hopefully everyone will comply with the court order going forward. Brad will be wherever he needs to be for the kids.”  A spokesperson for Jolie responded to the release of the custody agreement in a statement to Us on Wednesday, June 13: “This misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children. From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It’s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,614
8a3a1deb-12cb-4a94-bcd7-7ddaa0b3e473,"This article originially appearred on people.com.  New couple alert! Jesse Williams and Minka Kelly are dating, a source confirms to PEOPLE.  “They’re having a good time together,” adds the source of the pair, who are currently working on a video game together.  The news comes three months after Grey’s Anatomy star Williams officially split from wife Aryn Drake-Lee.  Williams filed for divorce on April 11, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE. The actor first met Drake-Lee, a real estate broker, while working as a schoolteacher in New York. The pair wed in September 2012 after more than five years of dating. Williams and Drake-Lee are currently in court regarding the custody agreement over their two young children: daughter Sadie, 3, and son Maceo, who was born in 2015.  Williams, 35, addressed the split — and rumors of infidelity — in JAY-Z‘s short film Footnotes for 4:44, a visual accompaniment to the rapper’s new album, which was released Monday, according to E! News.  Without mentioning his ex by name, the father of two subtly referenced the rumors and revealed how difficult the split was.  “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not 5 years, not 7 years — 13 years,” he said. “All of a sudden motherf—ers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.”  “Like, the most painful experience I’ve had in my life with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart — that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute,” he continued.  Most recently, Kelly, 37, sparked romance rumors last fall after being spotted in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with Wilmer Valderrama, to whom she was briefly linked in 2012.  Kelly, however, has maintained the two never actually dated in the past.  “He’s not my ex,” she told Power 106 last September. “We are good friends, and we always have been. It’s funny, this whole ‘back with my ex’ thing. We’re not exes!”  “It sucks when stories that aren’t true are made up, you know?” she added. “Look, if it’s true and it’s out, then it’s true and it’s out. When it’s not true and it’s out is when it’s really frustrating. You just have to find the comedy in all of it.”  Ultimately, the actress acknowledged media scrutiny of her personal life is par for the course.  “I think it comes with the territory,” she said. “It’s a small price to pay for the extraordinary life that I live.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,542

1f1bbffa-9ff9-4d0f-9ea6-c5cd79cf6815,"It’s complicated for Teen Mom 2’s Kailyn Lowry. The MTV personality revealed in a Wednesday, August 16, interview with Radar Online that she doesn’t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her yet-to-be named newborn son whom she gave birth to on August 5. (The child’s father is Chris Lopez.)  Celebrity Babies of 2017  The 25-year-old, who is also mom to son Isaac, 7, (whom she shares with ex Jo Rivera), and son Lincoln, 3, (whom she shares with Marroquin) acknowledged that while Marroquin, 24, has played a father figure role in Isaac’s life— she doesn’t feel it’s necessary for him to form a similar bond with the child she shares with Lopez.  “I don’t see a reason for him to be involved other than knowing and acknowledging that this is Lincoln’s half sibling. That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don’t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,” the mom shared with Radar.  And while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.  “I didn’t ask how he was handling it,” she explained to the outlet. “But he did say congratulations.”  Making things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn’t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.  Attorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry’s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: “Delaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.”  In order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to “discharge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.”  The pair divorced after nearly four years of marriage after Lowry revealed she did not want to have another child with Marroquin. He would go on to accuse the reality personality of cheating on him while he was deployed by the Air Force.  But the MTV star doesn’t seemed too concerned about the legal logistics of her complicated paternity situation. “Javi is not the father,” she explained to Radar. “Chris is the father so I think we’re all going to work together to make sure everything is taken care of and that that’s established.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

3727bb1a-e56f-425a-ac98-0efba9ea93a3,"President Donald Trump says he thinks CNN’s Chris Cuomo looks like a “chained lunatic” on television. CNN’s Don Lemon is “perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting” and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a “no-talent guy” who talks “filthy.”  Those were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.  “I’ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I’ve been able not to watch or read things that aren’t pleasant,” he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. “And it keeps you young.”  There was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.  “Washington Post, New York Times, they’re really, really dishonest,” he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. “You people are quite dishonest in all fairness.” He said he used to watch MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.  The one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.  Spokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president’s criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, “His comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.” Trump’s claims about CNN’s Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.  Here’s an extended excerpt of his conversation with TIME:  For instance I don’t watch CNN. I don’t watch MSNBC. Scarborough used to treat me great. But because I don’t do interviews and stuff and want to … He went the other way. Which is fine. He’s got some problems. But I don’t watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don’t watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I’m watching Fox. But they’re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don’t mean they – if I do something wrong. But it’s really, honestly it’s the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he’s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He’s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who’s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it’s like – sometimes they’ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they’ll start screaming, we’re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I’ve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he’s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They’re all doing well because of me. But it’s not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It’s just bad. It’s an ability I never thought I’d have. I never thought I’d have the ability to say, they’re doing a big story on me on CNN and I won’t watch it. And it’s amazing, it doesn’t matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They’re really dishonest. I mean they’re really dishonest.  Trump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert’s blistering and crude May 1 monologue, in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:  You see a no-talent guy like Colbert. There’s nothing funny about what he says. And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better. But his show was dying. I’ve done his show. … But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated. It was high—highest rating. The highest rating he’s ever had.

6dceb30a-286c-4d69-8b59-2c71543d29ae,"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have dated on and off since 2011. Christopher Polk/Getty Images  Justin Bieber recently announced his engagement to Hailey Baldwin.  This took many by surprise, especially considering Bieber's long history with Selena Gomez.  Much of the surprise, however, has crossed over into invasive speculation and unnecessary concern for Gomez's wellbeing.  Gomez is being inserted into a narrative she didn't ask to be a part of.  This is a trend with female celebrities whose exes move on — largely because our society has difficulty recognizing that a woman can be happy alone and, in particular, without a man.  Where were you when you found out Justin Bieber got engaged? Correction: Where were you when you found out Justin Bieber got engaged to someone who is not Selena Gomez? I was minding my own business on the subway while mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. Suddenly, my thumb stopped and hovered over Bieber's Instagram post where he referred to his 21-year-old fiancée Hailey Baldwin as the ""love of his life."" I immediately sent the post to a handful of friends writing, ""Truly speechless."" My best friend wrote back, ""Doesn't that make you sad for Selena?"" My response? ""10000000%.""  Bieb's early music served as the soundtrack to my teen years. Who didn't listen to ""One Time"" on repeat while wondering how we got so #blessed with this shaggy-haired heartthrob? (OK — maybe a lot of people, but I wasn't one of them.) I fully embraced the pop star who quickly became every teenage girl's dream guy, including a very famous one: Selena Gomez. So, yeah, when I found out Bieber was marrying Baldwin instead of Gomez, I couldn't help but feel bad for Sel. She clearly has a lot of love for her on-again, off-again ex. But isn't it a bit sexist to feel bad for a wildly successful woman just because her ex-boyfriend is marrying another woman? Why does she have to lose just because he wins?  Though I'm not the only person mourning the end of Jelena, nowhere in Bieber's lengthy Instagram post does he mention his ex's name — yet media headlines about Bieber and Baldwin are littered with mentions of Gomez. From a Vogue beauty article that conjectures that Gomez's new hairstyle is because of her ex's engagement to E! News' in-depth feature about why she wasn't the woman for Bieber (sigh), Gomez is being inserted into a narrative she didn't ask to be a part of. Plus, let's not forget these gems of headlines: ""Inside Selena Gomez's New Life Without Justin Bieber,"" ""Selena Gomez's Post-Justin Bieber Engagement Makeover Includes New Hair and a Pointed Statement T-Shirt"" and the lovely ""Fans on Selena Gomez Watch in Wake of Bieber Engagement.""  Gomez and Bieber in their heyday. Craig Barritt/Getty Images  Look, I used to work for a celebrity tabloid, so I know the drill. When a big star gets engaged, you immediately check up on their exes and their relationship history. This isn't a new narrative, but it's a tired one. Don't believe me? Just look at what's widely considered to be the most controversial celebrity breakup of all time: Brad and Jen. Flashback to 2005, when Brad Pitt left Jennifer Aniston for his ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" costar, Angelina Jolie: And the reign of Brangelina began.  Of course, a media frenzy ensued after Aniston and Pitt's dramatic split, and fans declared themselves #TeamAniston or #TeamJolie. Everyone felt bad for Aniston, but it was like a car crash — they just couldn't look away. Almost 13 years later, if we're being honest, we still can't look away from Aniston's love life. People say that they want to see the OG girl next door ""happy,"" but that's really code for ""coupled."" A guy can be single and revered ad infinitum (just look at George Clooney, pre-Amal), but a woman — even a wildly successful and world-famous one, such as Aniston or Gomez — needs a man to openly declare ""she's good enough! I'm marrying her!"" for the public to not think there's something wrong with her. It's the ugly truth.  That's why when Pitt and Jolie broke up in 2016 after nearly 12 years together, the world collectively gasped before turning to Aniston, waiting patiently for her next move. Was she happy that karma finally caught up to her ex? Did she want to get back together? Just like Gomez, Aniston had nothing to do with her ex's romantic news, yet she was mentioned in article after article. She was a major character in Pitt and Jolie's breakup, even though she was seemingly happily married to actor Justin Theroux.  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in 2004; Pitt and Angelina Jolie in 2006. Evan Agostini/Bryan Bedder/Getty Images  It didn't matter that Aniston split from Pitt more than a decade ago and had moved on with her life. She was once again the source of speculation due to her ex's love life. Perhaps the most overt sign of this was the New York Post cover that featured a laughing Aniston with the headline, ""BRANGELINA 2004-2016."" The coverage was so unfair that think pieces started popping up coming to Aniston's defense. Entertainment Tonight published: ""Leave Jennifer Aniston Out of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce!"" Her soon-to-be estranged husband, Theroux, also came to her defense in the press.  After Aniston eventual split from Theroux, in February 2018, the world once again mourned her impending divorce, because God forbid one of the most successful actresses of our time dare to be single and childless. The ""Poor Jen"" narrative has been so rampant that mainstream media outlets even started calling each other out. Life & Style published an article with the headline ""Sorry, Jennifer Aniston! Justin Theroux Is Moving in with Emma Stone"" while the Daily Mail wrote, ""Why can't Jennifer Aniston find a lasting love?"" This type of coverage spurred The Guardian's article, ""I'm sick of 'Poor Jen' sexism on repeat. This is The One Where Aniston Was Just Fine and USA Today's ""It's time to leave Jennifer Aniston alone.""  Honestly, the likelihood that Aniston cares about her exes' love lives is slim, as is the likelihood that Gomez shed tears over Bieber's engagement to Baldwin. These women haven't inserted themselves into their exes' love lives, so why do we insist on doing it? Jelena came into existence in December 2010 after the young lovebirds were spotted holding hands. In the eight years since, they've broken up multiple times, written songs about each other and dated other people. Their relationship statuses have changed, but one thing has remained the same: the media's obsession with their relationship — and their projection of Gomez's ""devastation"" every time Bieber starts dating someone else.  In 2016, Bieber had a brief romance with Sofia Richie (before her Scott Disick days) and just like now, the media was quick to paint Gomez as ""destroyed"" by her ex's new relationship. Hollywood Life published an article titled ""Selena Gomez Devastated Justin Bieber Is Finally Over Her & Into Sofia Richie,"" in which they called her ""hysterical"" and reported that she was ""constantly crying."" They wrote this even though Gomez had done absolutely nothing to back up these claims… except fall in love with Bieber when she was a teenager.  So I can't help but fear that Gomez is in danger of becoming the Aniston of our generation. She was part of a celebrity power couple. She and Bieber had not just one but several public splits. And now he's moving on while she's still single. But why do we always assume that's a bad thing? Is it so far-fetched to think that Pitt wasn't the one for Aniston, even though they were married? Maybe Gomez and Bieber were first loves, but not forever loves.  I, for one, am tired of the media and the public turning women into victims just because their exes are moving on. As much as we all loved Jelena, their time came and went. So instead of speculating about Gomez's feelings about Bieber's engagement to Baldwin, let's just blast ""It Ain't Me"" and move on with our lives. Gomez sure is.

The ""Westworld"" actress, 34, mentioned that she was attracted to both genders while talking about family dynamics during an interview with Net-A-Porter published Friday.  “I can take things for granted because of my family – it’s so free and you can be anything that you want to be,"" she said. ""I’m attracted to men and also to women.

6a15ddfd-359b-43b0-925b-fd1b61a4e0a2,"Black Mirror’s “USS Callister” won three Emmy awards Saturday and there could potentially be more in its future—if the episode becomes a series.  “Never say never,” creator and executive producer Charlie Brooker said about continuing the story of the episode’s characters, Variety reported Saturday. “The opposite of never,” executive producer Annabel Jones added. “Forever!”  The episode won Emmys for outstanding TV movie, picture editing and sound editing. Black Mirror also won the award for outstanding TV movie for “San Junipero” in 2017.  In “USS Callister,” Robert Daly (Jesse Plemons) is the chief technical officer of a gaming company who is the starship captain in a virtual reality world. Digital clones of his real-life coworkers make up the virtual crew of the ship. While he’s bossed around in real life, he’s the one in charge in his video game.  The episode also stars Cristin Milioti as a coworker who leads a rebellion against Daly in the virtual world and destroys the DNA samples he has of his coworkers in his apartment in the real world. Jimmi Simpson plays Daly’s real-life boss.  The potential of the story to continue was also addressed when Netflix first released the episode. “I was talking with Louise Sutton, who produced this and ‘Metalhead,’ and she cooked up the brilliant idea of spinning it off into a TV series,” director Toby Haynes told The Hollywood Reporter in January. “I’d love to do a TV series of ‘USS Callister’—it’s probably one of the best pilots for a space show ever. … I think Charlie [Brooker] might revisit it as a Black Mirror.”  While the episode ended with Daly defeated in and unable to leave the virtual reality, its director wouldn’t rule out seeing Plemons if there is a series or sequel. “That’s the fun of it, isn’t it? That’s what this idea is,” Haynes said to the publication. “There is this brilliant idea that he is still alive, and his attempted murder gets pinned on someone. Whose fingerprints do they find in the apartment? There’s so much you could do.”  Jonathan Prime / Netflix  Milioti would like to reprise her role and explore that point from Haynes. “If this were ever a spinoff, in the fake world she would be kicking ass and battling aliens,” she told THR in December. “And then there is the real world where her prints have been found inside Daly’s apartment. He’s dead in his apartment and she has to figure that out.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,509

de502c4d-b9d9-4ae6-8fa1-4f34b76ee4df,"© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  Beyonce and Jay Z are not currently planning to have a fourth baby via surrogate, despite an inaccurate tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We’re told it’s not true.  According to OK!, the superstar couple is looking to expand their family just seven months after the birth of their twins. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “With their marriage problems behind them, they don’t see a reason to wait.” This time around, however, the 36-year-old singer will supposedly hire a surrogate to carry her child.  “Surrogacy makes the most sense,” says the outlet’s supposed insider, who notes that Beyonce suffered a miscarriage prior to giving birth to 6-year-old daughter Blue Ivy in 2012. “They plan to cover every last expense to make the surrogate’s experience seamless,” adds the seemingly phony source.  But Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to Beyonce and Jay Z, who exclusively tells us that they’re not exploring surrogacy at this time. Should the couple’s plans change sometime in the future, we’ll certainly report it, but the two simply aren’t planning for a fourth child right now.  Also read: Don't troll AKA about Valentine's Day  It’s true that Beyonce experienced some minor complications when she gave birth to her twins last June, which is probably why the tabloid is speculating that she would use a surrogate if she had more kids. However, that’s not a discussion that’s being had in the couple’s household.  It should be noted, OK! has very little insight when it comes to Beyonce and Jay Z’s family plans. Gossip Cop busted the unreliable tabloid in October 2016 for wrongly reporting that the couple was adopting a baby. The singer announced that she was pregnant with twins just months later. We also recently called out the publication for making up a bogus story about Beyonce and Jay fighting over whether to raise their kids in New York or Los Angeles.  In addition to fabricating articles about the famous couple’s children, the untrustworthy outlet also frequently alleges that Beyonce and Jay Z are headed for a divorce. Of course, time has proven many of the tabloid’s stories about the spouses to be completely wrong. Gossip Cop can now confirm that there’s no surrogacy in the works either.

Yep, that's right: Demi wanted to turn up with your childhood science teacher, but because she couldn't, she recruited the other celeb cameos via text messages. ""I thought Paris would be, like, awesome to be the DJ,"" Lovato explained. ""Wiz is a friend of mine — we go to the same gym — and then Jamie Foxx, I had just been over to his house for a party.

44ea7d76-547e-4338-9109-b852c68614a8,"It's the movie that helped launch three major Hollywood careers.  And on Monday night, Kevin Dillon revealed that he and his Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen still keep in touch 31 years after the film hit theaters in 1986.  Dillon, 51, shared a photo of the three men hanging out at what is believed to be Depp's Hollywood Hills home.  Together again: Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen and Kevin Dillon are seen in a photo posted to Dillon's Instagram on Monday night in Hollywood  Depp, 54, can be seen smoking in the snap as he places his hand on Charlie's chest.  Sheen, 51, makes a tough face for the camera as Dillon smiles on next to him.  Dillon captioned the photo: 'Platoon 30 year #reunion last night at #johnnydepp house #goodtimes @charliesheen.'  Platoon, which was directed by Oliver Stone, won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987.  Hit: Sheen (L) and Dillon are seen in character in this photo from the classic 1986 movie  Here's Johnny: Most of Depp's role was cut from the film, where he played a translator  Sheen played the main character Private First Class Chris Taylor during the Vietnam war, while Dillon played a soldier named Bunny, and Depp a translator called Lerner.  Stone famously made his stars - including Sheen, Depp and Dillon - undergo intensive bootcamp training in the Philippines before the film was shot there.  A real life Vietnam vet himself, the director drafted Marine Corps officer and fellow vet Dale Dye - who would also play Captain Harris in the film - to put the actors through a 30-day military regimen.  Now and then: Sheen's career has been plagued by drug troubles and wild behavior over the years  They were made to dig fox-holes, go on forced marches, had limited food and water, were subjected to night time 'ambushes' using special effects equipment, weren't allowed to shower, had to sleep in the jungle, had rotated night watch, and were even kept awake by firing blank rounds.  The film was Depp's first trip outside the United States; Stone reportedly originally considered him for Sheen's role, but decided he was too young at the time.  In the end, despite all the intensive training, Depp was eventually cast in a much smaller role of a military translator Lerner, who saw most of his screen time cut from the final film.  From bad to worse: The Hollywood pin-up always had a wild streak, but shock claims of drinking and violent behavior have emerged in the wake of his split from Amber Heard  Nevertheless Stone predicted at the time Depp would go on to become a huge star; The Pirates Of The Caribbean also carried his experience on the film throughout the rest of his career, burying himself in intensely researched roles.  It's unclear how often that the three men have stayed in touch with each other since the movie, but they have all gone on to have major careers in film and television.  Depp and Sheen both developed reputations as bad boys alongside their successful acting careers.  Everybody loves Drama! Post-Platoon, Dillion is best known for his role as Johnny 'Drama' Chase on the HBO comedy series Entourage  Johnny was once handcuffed after a fight with then-girlfriend Kate Moss after causing nearly $10,000 dollars in damage to a hotel room in 1994.  He admitted to regularly 'poisoning' himself with alcohol and had a few reported scuffles, one with a security guard in 1989 and another with a paparazzi in 1999.  Depp appeared to have settled down after marrying his Rum Diary co-star Amber Heard in 2015, but when she filed for divorce the following year, shocking stories of drinking and abuse came to light.  In legal documents released earlier this year, it was revealed that Johnny's manager was informed that he kicked Heard during one particularly gruesome fight during their marriage.  Platoon: The Oliver Stone written-and-directed movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987  Charlie Sheen attended rehab for alcohol in 1990 and twice again 1998.  He married actress Denise Richards in 2002, and when they divorced in 2006, she alleged that he threatened to kill her after a complicated custody dispute over their two daughters.  More arrests and rehab stays followed for Sheen before his very public 2011 breakdown where he posted a series of erratic videos where he claimed to have 'tiger blood' and started his popular slogan 'winning!'.  Here comes trouble: Johnny became known as a bad boy but appeared to settle down after marrying Amber Heard in 2015, they divorced a year later with her claiming he was abusive  In 2015, Charlie announced he was HIV-positive after a blind item about him circulated on the internet.  Dillon worked consistently after Platoon and scored a major role in HBO's Entourage. Thought his troubles were not as high-profile as his co-stars, he did go through a nasty divorce from wife Jane Stuart this year and was involved in a 2015 altercation with a group of teenagers who were taunting him, but he was cleared of any wrongdoing.  Troubled: Sheen had been in-and-out of rehab for years before his public 2011 meltdown  In a 2012 interview with Mario Lopez for Extra, Sheen took credit for Depp's success.  When asked if there was a movie he regrets passing on, Charlie first mentioned that he should have done White Men Can't Jump, which starred Woody Harrelson.  Continuing his thought process about other films he was offered, he said, 'I should have done Nightmare On Elm Street, but if I had Johnny Depp wouldn't have a career.'",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1052
3ae5869e-09c4-4ab4-aca1-97e9d30c38b6,"President Trump has zero impulse control. That’s why he flip-flops on issues, sends a constant stream of ill-conceived tweets, can’t keep his hands off women, and never misses an opportunity to shoot himself in the foot. Recently, former George W. Bush adviser Steve Schmidt called Trump out for his childish behavior. “Clearly, we have a 71-year-old president of the United States who has the impulse control of a little child, who feels aggrieved, who’s resentful, who’s a constant victim,” he told MSNBC.  As someone who has lived on the surface of the Earth for over 70 years, Trump should know that one of the worst things you can do is stare directly at the sun. One prolonged gaze into our solar system’s center of energy can cause permanent eye damage. “The light from the sun is very intense and concentrated into a very small area, and then that light is converted into heat and that heat cooks the retina,” said Joel Schuman, chair of ophthalmology at New York University’s Langone Health. “So you have a permanent area that you don’t see, a permanent blind spot.”  On Monday, when Trump stood in front of reporters on the Truman Balcony at the White House with his wife, Melania, and his son, Barron, he had one job: resist the temptation to stare directly at the sun. Even after a White House aid yelled, “Don’t look at it!” our ever-defiant leader with self-described “very good brain” craned his neck, squinted his eyes, and stared directly into the sun.  Later Monday night, he’ll address the country on the ongoing war in Afghanistan.  Someone shouts ""don't look"" as Pres.

73ceead6-2112-44ee-9792-c49440f2d5b1,"There's yet another creepy element arrived in Ally's formerly quiet neighbourhood  As if American Horror Story: Cult wasn’t already creepy enough, yet another alarming element has been thrown into the mix. Not only do the residents of Brookfield Heights, Michigan have to contend with a gang of killer clowns and a power-hungry angry young man in Kai Anderson, but now their streets are also being sprayed with a mysterious chemical by people in black haz mat suits, riding around in a truck that glows a very eerie green.  Of course, the first of all the residents to notice the peculiar vehicle is Ally Mayfair-Richards. She’s so perturbed by its sudden appearance on her street that, the second time it appears, she races outside and stands in its path, only to have to jump out of its way at the last second when it becomes clear she’ll be mown down if she doesn’t.  Fans on Reddit are suggesting the gas being sprayed in her neighbourhood could be symbolic. So far, her wife Ivy has tried to convince her that every sighting of clowns she’s reported is in her head. Are these newcomers mocking the fact that she’s effectively being gaslighted by her partner?  The green glow of the truck is also notable. In a happier scene in this week’s episode, Ally, Ivy and son Oz are eating ice cream in the couple’s restaurant. Ivy comments that nobody’s tried the mint green tea flavour before feeding some to her wife. Is it coincidence that the ice cream is the exact same shade of bright green as the lights on the truck? Or is this yet another subtle signifier that Ivy has already been initiated into the cult and is now part of a plot against Ally?  Maybe whatever is being sprayed from the truck has already got to Ally’s head because, as frustrated fans have pointed out on Twitter, she doesn’t even think to use any of the modern technology at her disposal to try and help her figure out who the truck belongs to or where it’s come from. Instead of using the phone in her hand to film the vehicle as it drives past, she opts for the obviously much brighter idea of walking right up to one of the suited-up sprayers, screaming at them and pulling at their outfits until they remove their mask to reveal another mask with a smiley face just like the one the clowns have painted on their victims’ homes.

There are challenges - some are physical, some are emotional, and some are a little bit of everything.  Former The Hills star Whitney Port, currently in her 3rd trimester, knows all too well that there are tribulations to tackle when it comes to expecting.  For her, a lot of it’s do with her body image, and how “uncomfortable” she feels with her changing body, and how that’s left her feeling desperately unattractive to her husband of 2 years, Tim Rosenman.  ""So ready for this pregnancy to be over,” Whitney told the LadyGang podcast in a recent interview.  ""It is so not for me! It's not. I feel so uncomfortable with my body that I can't get into the mood. Like, I can't feel sexy.""  The 32-year-old also confessed that she and Tim stopped having sex ""once the belly really started happening"".  ""I think if I was one of those pregnant women that loved it and was confident, then he'd be into it. I think I've turned him off of it because I'm like, ‘Don't look!’  ""I'll even not say anything and he'll see me getting undressed and be like, ‘I'm not looking, I'm not looking!'""  😞  We have to say, we feel for Whitney and appreciate her honesty on this one.  Even though it goes without saying that she looks lovely, it's really all about how you feel inside.  We write a lot about embracing our pregnancy tums and post-baby bods (which we definitely endorse, btw), but even we have to admit it’s sometimes easier said than done, right?  Especially when you couple that feeling of missing your pre-pregnancy figure with a rough ride of nausea and other classic preg symptoms, something Whitney explained on Instagram made her feel even more ‘gross’.  But, though Whitney’s parked her sex life until after her baby's born, she did take to Instagram to open up about the journey she’s gone on with her new figure.  And how she's finally starting to come to terms with the way her burgeoning bump looks...  ""Boy, am I growing! In every direction! At first, I must be honest, I had a very hard time coming to terms with my changing body.  ""I had always prided myself on being healthy from the inside out and it was difficult not labelling my pregnant body ""fat”.  ""But as time has gone on, I have come to appreciate what my body is ACTUALLY doing. Don't get me wrong, I still look at myself in the mirror every day in disbelief about the fact that my boobs are now triple Ds or that when I look down, I can't see my feet, etc.  “But I remind myself I'm growing a gift and this gift needs room to grow.

Now, her incredible chemistry with Strahan’s replacement, Ryan Seacrest, is undeniable, but in the midst of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Ripa is feeling betrayed and torn about standing beside him. Could these skeletons in Seacrest’s closet force Ripa to leave the popular morning show?  According to Life & Style, in the era of the #MeToo and #Time’sUp movements every business is playing it safe, and that means things could change at Live, especially if ratings start to drop and big names start to avoid the show.  “[Kelly’s] waiting to see what happens with Ryan. But [either way] this is a dark period for her,” reveals an insider. “She’s pissed…Kelly feels blindsided. The last thing she needs is celebrities boycotting. Everyone is on pins and needles.”  At this point, Ripa and Seacrest are still interviewing A-listers on the show, but that wasn’t the case when he was on the Oscar red carpet earlier this month. While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims.  This resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.  Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos, did walk by and acknowledge Seacrest by telling him he looked amazing and was doing a great job, but that doesn’t mean she still isn’t conflicted about the allegations.  She does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out.  Ripa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accuser’s head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes.  But, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears.  Oscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations. He said that we should afford people the opportunity for truth and find out the facts before hanging someone out to dry.

8e2da287-7fa2-4bbd-84e2-c29c87dffd03,"In January, I taped a three-by-five card next to my workstation at home and wrote “Best Shows” at the top of it, like I do every January. Whenever I saw a show that I really liked, I’d add the title to the card. In 1997, the first year in which I wrote about TV full time, I had ten titles on the card by Thanksgiving. A decade later, I’d routinely find myself culling a list of 15 titles when list-making time arrived. By the end of 2016, there were 20 titles on the card. This year, there were 23 strong contenders with another dozen possibles. That’s a reflection not just of how many shows are in production, but also how diverse they are in terms of style, structure, subject matter, and worldview.  number 10  The Carmichael Show (NBC)  Jerrod Carmichael’s old-school, social-issues-driven, three-camera-plus-a-live-audience sitcom is one of many quirky outliers to get canceled this year just when it was really getting warmed up. Too bad: This latest batch of episodes could’ve gone toe-to-toe with the best installments of Norman Lear’s Good Times. Many of the episodes, including the one built around David Alan Grier’s character’s confrontation with his mother’s mortality, were ripped directly from the actors’ own lives.  number 9  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (The CW)  Rachel Bloom and Aline Brosh-McKenna’s musical-psychological comedy-drama continues to take risks. The back half of season two and the first half of season three were stunning.  number 8  Samurai Jack (Adult Swim)  Genndy Tartakovsky caps his series about a stoic samurai’s pursuit of a demon with his career-best work as an animator.  number 7  The Young Pope (HBO)  Of all the current TV series that owe an obvious debt to David Lynch, this quirky yet often visionary religious drama from Paolo Sorrentino is the most original. The deadpan humor sometimes obscured the fact that, when the show talked about spirituality, it wasn’t kidding. The season finale has a cosmic sense of wonder.  number 6  The Deuce (HBO)  From The Wire collaborators George Pelecanos and David Simon comes a worthy successor, a period piece about the sex trade in 1970s Times Square that doubles as a corrosive satire on capitalism.  number 5  BoJack Horseman (Netflix)  The fourth season of Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s animated comedy-drama was a series of perfectly executed tales of confrontation, denial, selfishness, and healing.  number 4  The Get Down (Netflix)  Baz Luhrmann and Stephen Adly Guirgis’s musical drama about the birth of hip-hop starts in 1977, set just a few years after another great New York drama, Mad Men, ended. Demographically, narratively, and stylistically, it’s a worthy companion piece, one of a handful of series that can be said to have devised its own language.  number 3  Better Things (FX)  Pamela Adlon’s series about single motherhood took more stylistic and tonal risks than last year, and they all paid off. Anyone who’s been a parent or a child will appreciate the truths this show contains.  number 2  The Leftovers (HBO)  Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta’s post-Rapture drama finished its three-year run with eight episodes of alternately wrenching, surreal, and bleakly funny storytelling about the psychological aftermath of loss and the quest to superimpose narrative on a seemingly chaotic world. I should admit this pick comes with an asterisk: Lindelof told me that certain themes and images, and the totality of episode five, were inspired by my personal writing about the death of my first wife. I loved the season before I knew that, so I’m leaving The Leftovers where I think it would’ve gone otherwise; however, if you consider the personal aspect disqualifying, go ahead and bump The Leftovers off the list and move everything up a notch. (In that case, AMC’s Better Call Saul would land at No. 10.)  number 1  Twin Peaks: The Return (Showtime)  A weekly mind-effing event the likes of which hasn’t been seen since the first year of Lost. This 18-hour series from Twin Peaks co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost wasn’t a straightforward continuation of the story, but something more like a series of variations or improvisations on familiar characters and situations. It took a while to grasp that it was a largely non-narrative experience, conceived in terms of light and shadow, rhythm and visual rhyme, color and music (most hours ended with a full-length musical performance). Episode eight, which reconceived the postwar history of the United States in mythological terms starting with the first atom bomb test, is a masterpiece; at least five other episodes are nearly as good.  *A version of this article appears in the December 11, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,925

She hinted that this is exactly the kind of thing that could end up before Congress:“This was a huge violation of the public trust, not to mention an incredibly bold theft from the US taxpayer.

8185bc4d-074c-41da-9168-0941c8ecf2bb,"Over the years, there have been dozens of sports movies pitting the lovable underdogs against the seemingly unbeatable elites — it’s a classic American story. But none were perhaps as big of a surprise hit as 2004’s Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, the film starred Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller as, respectively, the underdog owner of failing gym Average Joe’s and the elite fitness guru trying to push the facility out of business. Backed by a wide and deep cast that also featured Justin Long as a male cheerleader, Alan Tudyk as a 24-7 pirate cosplayer, Rip Torn as a weathered old dodgeball coach, Christine Taylor as an athletically gifted lawyer, and more, Dodgeball was a surprise hit that summer, earning $167 million worldwide on a reported $20 million budget.  And while a long-discussed sequel to the film has never materialized, Dodgeball fans scored the next best thing on Wednesday morning when Omaze launched a new charity campaign with a video that reunites the original cast. The clip, seen above, stars Stiller as Globo Gym chief White Goodman, who’s back to implore viewers to team up with him in Omaze’s new contest. But, lo and behold, Vaughn’s Peter LaFleur is on hand too, along with Long and Taylor, to represent the Average Joe’s. Hilarity ensues and so does a request: Fans are encouraged to pick a side by signing up via Omaze’s website (either omaze.com/globo or omaze.com/joes) for the chance to play dodgeball with Stiller himself. Proceeds will benefit the Stiller Foundation, which supports education initiatives for children around the world.  EW talked with Stiller about filming the new video and looking back on the “true underdog story,” 13 years later.  Omaze  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What did it feel like to step back into the White Goodman shoes?  BEN STILLER: It was really strange and fun. I didn’t know what it would be like, because I was away from it for so long and I never really thought there would be any reason to do the character again, but then when this opportunity came up, especially talking to Omaze and what good ideas for fundraising there would be, over the years we’ve been aware of people who are fans of the movie and their connection with it, which I’ve appreciated. It’s fun to connect with people on something like that — like at Halloween, I see people dressed up as the movie and things like that. To me, it was really important when we said we could do it, the first person I called was Rawson Thurber, who wrote and directed the movie, and said, “Hey would you get on board with this thing? If you would write and direct this thing, we could put the band back together.” That was the key to it, these things don’t exist in a vacuum in terms of the writing and situation. Once Rawson said yes, I called Vince up, and he immediately said, “I’m in, let’s do it, it’s for a good cause.” Then we got Justin Long and Christine Taylor and Missi Pyle and everybody; it was really exciting for us all to get back together. So we got our Halloween costumes, and luckily it’s Spandex so it all still kind of fit.  Are these new costumes?  We found the original costumes, literally the original mustache, and wig, this ratty old caterpillar of a mustache. Then it was one of those things where it came back, in terms of the dynamic. I think Rawson wrote a great little piece, it was really fun. We were in a gym and shooting, so it was a very similar situation to when we did the movie except all these years have gone by. So it was kind of bizarre yet fun, but also weird and eerie how everything came back, like Vince’s reactions and our whole dynamic. The dynamic is important when you’re doing a character like White because the whole thing is based on the dynamic of them playing off each other. That was really fun to jump back in.  Where did you come up with the character for White?  I honestly don’t know. It all kind of comes from the Tony Robbins impression that I tried to do on The Ben Stiller Show, and then it became Tony Perkis from Heavyweights [whom Stiller played] and then it morphed into White Goodman. I don’t have that many moves, really. It’s funny because once you do the makeup and get the wig on, then you’re suddenly like, “Oh yeah, I got this.” But I did watch a couple YouTube clips from the movie to reacquaint myself with what I was doing.  The original movie is so rich with one-liners and little absurdities. Are there things even you forget about and then get reminded of by fans?  Oh yeah. I don’t go back and rewatch the movie a lot unless I’m flipping across the channels and something comes up and I’ll watch for a second. So some of those lines from the movie I remember really well, and then other ones not as well, so it’s funny when people love a very specific thing. “Nobody makes me bleed my own blood” is one that has always kinda stuck with me. In terms of what people respond to, it’s always interesting. I’m always surprised and very happy when people have something they connect with like that, because I know I have those moments with movies that I loved watching growing up. Now that the movie’s been around so long, I hear a lot from kids in their 20s who loved it from when they were kids. That’s the thing I remember from that age: Movies affect you so much, and they stick with you. So that’s really kinda cool.  What do you remember most about making Dodgeball?  I remember having a lot of fun making the movie. It was so ridiculous when we were doing it, I remember doing scenes where I was feeling kind of embarrassed because I thought it’s so ridiculous, and the movie was not necessarily a guaranteed success. In terms of like moments that I remember, I remember Chuck Norris being there and that being very exciting. I remember he came in on a chopper – you’d probably expect nothing less. I remember doing the dodgeball scenes themselves, that being very involved.  Did you guys have to actually become good at the actual sport?  Well, we tried. We had some very choreographed shots and things, but when you’re playing dodgeball, it’s hard not to get into it. It’s that very visceral thing we all remember from eighth grade, so everyone was trying to do their best. I just remember laughing a lot, and feeling like gosh, this could just be the end of everything.  Omaze is giving fans the opportunity to choose between the Average Joe’s and Globo Gym’s Purple Cobras. What would you say to people to convince them to join the Purple Cobras?  It’s more like Omaze is giving people the chance to go with a Winner or a La-loser. And Purple Cobras have much cooler uniforms.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1418

5e4f6b26-57bd-44fe-b57f-c4111984f1c3,"Is there a chance that Queen Elizabeth understands the verb troll in its 21st-century iteration? Is there such a thing as the Royal Urban Dictionary?  QEII might not be able to define troll, but it seems the 92-year-old monarch may be well-versed in executing it. And her victim might have been one Donald J. Trump.  The president, of course, paid Queen Elizabeth a visit last week at Windsor Castle during his controversial visit to London, where hundreds of thousands of Brits took to the streets to protest his presence.  Trump, who was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, didn’t exactly endear himself to the queen when he broke protocol and walked ahead of her. Video of the breach of etiquette went viral.

Bloody hell!  But it seems Her Royal Highness might have gotten revenge preemptively. According to E!News, Queen Elizabeth wore different brooches during Trump’s three days in the United Kingdom, with each broach having special significance, as described on the blog From Her Majesty’s Jewel Vault.  A Twitter user who goes by the handle @SamuraiKnitter tweeted extensively about the “brooch warfare.”  Queen Elizabeth “does hundreds and hundreds of appearances, and maybe 95% or high, she wears a brooch. And the brooch is ALWAYS significant. Badges of military regiments – she inspects some troops, she wears the badge of them to do it,” @SamuraiKnitter wrote.

(@SamuraiKnitter) July 15, 2018  On Trump’s arrival in London on July 12, Queen Elizabeth’s choice of brooch was gifted to her by Barack and Michelle Obama during their last visit to London as president and first lady. The brooch was not a state gift, according to @SamuraiKnitter, as the Obamas paid for it themselves.  “The US has given QE jewelry before over the years and I bet her dresser could put hands on any and all of it given five minutes,” said @SamuraiTwitter. “But she chose the most SENTIMENTAL piece in the collection, the one that was given OUT OF FRIENDSHIP WITH THE OBAMAS AS PEOPLE.”  The US has given QE jewelry before over the years and I bet her dresser could put hands on any and all of it given five minutes.

19b42b50-8715-4fe5-9040-870c05cec605,"Expanding Opportunity — #KempForum16Let’s get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America. Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16.I just wanted to say a few words about why we’re here today. And one reason why I’m here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty.So I couldn’t think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century.We’ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I don’t think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.I’m not saying we haven’t made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty — that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem?It is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation — or not having enough money.We treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, we’ve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in people’s budgets: health care,child care, energy, education — with almost no coordination among them.Here’s the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you don’t make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits.And because we’ve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and you’ll lose a ton. So we think we’ve been filling holes. But we’ve actually been building a trap. And that’s because poverty is about more than deprivation; it’s about isolation.There are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They don’t have the support they need to grow, whether it’s a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss.What they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor.That’s why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Don’t just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty.Don’t measure success based on inputs. Measure the results.And this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington.It is the people in our communities — the people with credibility. They’re the ones who can break through. And I’m not saying just cut money for the safety net. I’d say spend the same amount of money we do now — because this isn’t about saving money; it’s about saving lives.What I’m saying is, don’t minimize; customize. Take the money we’re spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each person’s needs. And whatever you do,encourage work — because that’s how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow.They’ll not only have enough money; they’ll be able to make enough money to get off assistance.The way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities — they’re the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines.Now, I know a lot of people are wondering, “Why do you care about this? You’re Republicans.”I remind them, ‘Well, we’re Americans too.’ We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesn’t determine the outcome of your life.If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself.But a lot of people don’t think that’s true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are.And it’s not enough to pay your taxes and think, “Government is going to take care of this.” We all have to get involved.And I know it’s easy to get discouraged. But what I’ve learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; they’re already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not they’re right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America.So I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,1116

After announcing she was “moving on” from the MTV series last month, blasting the show as “hateful” and “horrible,” the reality star is taking legal action, suing parent company Viacom for $5 million.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Abraham claims she was fired because of her decision to work in the adult entertainment industry. The 26-year-old previously released sex tapes with Vivid Entertainment in 2013 and 2014 with porn star James Deen, and since then, she has done adult webcam shows and appearances at strip clubs. She has also endorsed sex toys.  “We respect Farrah’s decision to pursue other endeavors and we wish her the best,” a Viacom spokesperson tells PEOPLE. “Regarding her suit, the claims are without merit.”  In the complaint, Abraham, who is mom to 8-year-old daughter Sophia, alleges Viacom “wrongfully terminated her employment because she did not conform to gender stereotypes.”  Farrah Abraham Rodrigo Varela/Getty  According to Abraham, in October 2017 she was confronted by 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom executive producer Morgan J. Freeman at her Texas home, where she alleges she was “harassed, humiliated, discriminated against, disrespected, ridiculed, degraded and sex shamed” for her “recent decision to pursue opportunities in the adult entertainment industry.”  Abraham alleges Freeman and his production crew made threats about “ending her career with MTV, sabotaging future deals [she] had in place with MTV, and defaming her.” She claims she “feared for her life” during the confrontation due to Freeman’s “hostile tone, mannerisms, and body language.”  Abraham alleges that shortly after the confrontation, production informed her she was no longer needed for the show.  She claims the harassment from the producers based on their “gender stereotypes of how women should act and appear, unreasonably interfered” with her work performance and psychological well-being.  The reality star is suing for emotional pain, emotional suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and other damages. She also alleges gender discrimination and a hostile work environment and says she’s still owed money that was guaranteed in her contract.  Last month, the MTV personality made multiple accusations against the network in a scathing Instagram post alongside a Teen Mom OG clip of her speaking with Morgan, who said she was a “problem” to work with.  “Never apologize for being an ambitious, confident, and strong minded women,” she wrote. “As I become the best Farrah I can be, I won’t let a man or network be little me, try to break me, lie about who I am to my core, I’m bullied, surrounded & hurt by all the manipulation, I no longer will allow as a protective mother this vulgar behavior, these crews aren’t trust worthy this ‘MTV family’ is a disgusting gang of power tripping failed producers & executives who have failed.”  In early November, Abraham claimed she had been fired by Viacom for working as an adult entertainer. She later backtracked, clarifying that Viacom’s legal team had not terminated her contract.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,617

Kim Kardashian, 37, has already admitted that having a surrogate carry her and Kanye West‘s, 40, third child is “so much harder” than personally being pregnant. And it seems Kanye isn’t making things any easier for the reality star. In fact, a new report from InTouch Weekly claims the couple has been fighting constantly in the weeks leading up to their daughter’s arrival, and it’s driving Kim nuts. Their main source of tension? The mag claims Kim wants to film their child’s birth for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, while Kanye is totally against it. Click here to see adorable pics of the Kardashian kids.  “They’re at loggerheads about the birth being filmed for Keeping Up With The Kardashians,” an insider for the publication told the mag. “Kanye’s made it clear that cameras are banned from the delivery room.” On top of that, Kanye reportedly doesn’t even want Kris Jenner, 62, to be there either — apparently he wants to keep things super private and intimate! Kim, on the other hand, is not having any of it. “Kim’s insisting that Kris be by her side, and is trying to convince Kanye that filming it will increase their popularity and the show’s ratings,” the source added.  As of yet though, the two apparently have not come to an agreement. Instead they’ve “been arguing nonstop,” the source said. “It’s driving Kim crazy.” As a reminder, Kim and Kanye did NOT film the births of North West, 4, or Saint West, 2, for the show, so we can’t imagine this new baby’s grand entrance will be any different. Something that is different though, is the fact that the family had to use a surrogate this time around, as doctors advised Kim not to give birth for a third time. And while Kim’s said in the past that she and her surrogate get along, InTouch‘s report also claims the tide has shifted, and now the surrogate doesn’t even want Kim in the delivery room when she gives birth!  “There will be major tension between them in the delivery room,” a second source told the publication. “The surrogate doesn’t even want Kim to be there at this point, but she has no other choice.

fe321819-fc2d-4aef-9793-1e6cdd3d8bad,"Does Margot Robbie reciprocate co-star Brad Pitt’s rumored feelings for her? We’ll explain what’s really going on between these two!  Sorry, this won’t be a Mr. & Mrs. Smith situation. Margot Robbie, 28, has eyes for one man, and it’s not for her co-star Brad Pitt, 54! The two actors began filming for Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time In Hollywood earlier this summer, and rumors sprung that Brad had the hots for Margot. While that’s yet to be confirmed, we can confirm this: Margot is respecting her wedding vows! “Margot is madly in love with her husband Tom,” a friend of Margot’s shares EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife. Just a reminder — Margot wedded Tom Ackerley, 28, the producer for her film I, Tonya, on December 18, 2016! “Even if Brad tried, he would never be able to woo her away.”  Margot’s admiration for Brad — because really, you can’t help but admire the knockout — is purely professional! “Margot thinks Brad is amazing, hot, sexy, really talented and she has the utmost respect for him, but there’s absolutely no crush on her part,” the Suicide Squad‘s friend adds. “She’s only got eyes for Tom. Margot thinks her husband is the best looking guy on the planet, even Brad Pitt can’t compete with Tom, at least not for Margot.” Yup, you heard that right — not even Brad Pitt! Well, we hope Tom can relax after hearing those kind words. As we’ve told you, Margot’s husband has reportedly been wary of Brad, supposedly dropping by onset of Once Upon a Time In Hollywood and “keeping a close eye on Brad,” a source close to Margot and Tom claimed to Life & Style in its Aug. 29 issue.  How did this rumored love triangle mess even start? Well, Brad was reportedly “smitten” with Margot, another Life & Style source claimed, which we reported on July 26. The source went so far as to claim that the actors’ other co-star, Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, “has called [Brad] out for layering it on so thick [with Margot].” None of this has been confirmed, and Brad could just be a happy (almost legal) bachelor minding his own business! He does have an ongoing custody battle with his soon-to-be ex-wife Angelina Jolie, 43, to worry about.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,488

The album is due Feb. 2 — two days before his halftime performance on the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.  “This album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I’ve ever written, where I’m from — it’s personal,” he says in the video, which is filled with shots of Timberlake in outdoors settings. In other shots he is seen working with Pharrell Williams, who says “It feels so earthy, it’s just where you are in your life right now,” before adding emphatically, “That is a smash,” presumably about a song. Snippets of two or three new songs play in the background during the video.  While the wintery scenes contrast with Timberlake’s upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, he has been saying for some months that the album, on which he also worked with longtime collaborators Max Martin and Shellback (with whom he collaborated on his last single, the hit “Can’t Stop the Feeling” from the movie “Trolls”) and Timbaland, reflected his roots, calling it “Southern American music.”  Timberlake’s halftime performance during the Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 4 at Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium.

We have been that place in all the other cases, and we will be that place – as well as for the accused – on this hour.”  Shortly before making that announcement, she discussed with NBC’s Stephanie Gosk the difficulty of reporting on a case about someone that she interacted with on such a frequent basis.  “You don’t want to be getting that explicit about a colleague that you worked with 24 hours ago,” admitted Kelly. “But that’s how we’re going to report it here for you at NBC because that’s our commitment to you – to bring you the truth and to do a full and fair investigation of this story as it comes to us.”  Watch the full clip to listen to the entire conversation between Kelly and Gosk.

The disgraced NBC anchor released a statement on Thursday in response to the claims and his termination. “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” Lauer said in the statement, which was read by TODAY co-host Savannah Guthrie on the show’s Thursday broadcast. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  He added, “Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.  “Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I’m committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It’s been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love.

40e060a3-d5fe-47cd-811a-0e5bbec225a1,"In case you wanted proof of your waning youth, Thursday marks the 10th anniversary of Britney Spears and Kevin Federline’s wedding — a day when a promising young pop star and a dude nicknamed “Meat Pole” decided to throw caution to the wind and say “I do.”  “Ten years — it totally freaks me out,” says wedding planner Alyson Fox, reflecting on the September 18, 2004, nuptials. The day marked Fox’s first (and only) celebrity wedding. While it was originally planned as a big October wedding at the Bacara in Santa Barbara, things rapidly changed after the paparazzi figured out the date and location. Fox was left with about 10 days to organize a completely new, surprise wedding — and, not trusting any other venue to keep the secret, she held it at her own house.  Most Britney fans probably don’t celebrate her short-lived marriage’s anniversary; some even see it as a key moment in a downward spiral from which she has only recently recovered. Still, though Britney filed for divorce in 2006, Fox holds that marriage dear.  TIME spoke to Fox about the whirlwind wedding, young love and the groomsmens’ infamous white Juicy velour “pimp” tracksuits.  TIME: Britney and Kevin Federline’s engagement was huge. Did you think that this would be one of the biggest weddings-  Alyson Fox: —of my career? Yes, I mean, she is Britney Spears. I first interviewed with Felicia, her assistant for years, and I didn’t know who I was meeting with, just that it was a VIP… I met Britney and her mom the next day and they all couldn’t be nicer. The sweetest. I mean they’re from the South. Britney’s so polite, she kept calling me Miss Alyson, and I was like, ‘Oh my God don’t do that; that makes me feel old.’  And then you met Kevin.  They were like any young couple. Very much in love, very touchy feely.  What was the original wedding going to be like?  They came up with a list of 200 to 250 people, and we thought the Bacara would be great. We were designing the most beautiful but not over the top, elegant but shabby chic, gorgeous but fun event… It was a really fun experience. I have not one negative thing to say until we had to move the whole wedding.  So what happened?  A publication printed the location and date of the wedding. I got a call from a very unhappy Kevin. [Unhappy at the situation not her.] Even though I told them that we had the best security team and it could still go on without a hitch, they didn’t want 100 million people standing outside trying to take pictures, ruining the intimacy and privacy of that event. So we had to go to Plan B, and we had to do it fast.  You had a “Plan B”?  Well, we planned it in 10 days or less… Everything was already in the works, Monique Lhuillier was making all the gowns that were basically ready, all the vendors were in place for the big wedding — we just didn’t have a location. In that week we decided we can’t do it at a hotel, we can’t do a venue because people were going to know. We limited the guest list to the two families and the wedding party, and then we talked to Britney and Kevin about doing a surprise wedding. Nobody would know.  Not even Britney’s mom?  No. Nobody knew… We told everyone and our vendors we were having an engagement party. We tried to use every vendor we could who was going to help at the wedding.  And you would throw it at your house in Studio City?  Well, their place wasn’t ready yet… The vendors made the house look stunning. It was so beautiful. I only wish they could have had more people… Every person who walked in that night, we handed then an invitation, they opened it up and it said “surprise!” you are here for the wedding and not the engagement party. And we would direct them to the room where they would change into their gowns and tuxedos…  Tuxedos? I thought the men were wearing those white Juicy velour jumpsuits…  No! That’s what they left the house in. They were in tuxedos and gowns. Everybody made such a big deal about that, but that’s what Juicy did for every celebrity who got married. They’d send them the cute little tracksuits. I asked Britney and Kevin what they wanted printed on the back, and Britney said, “Maids! Maids will be cute!” And it was. It was cute! And he said “Pimps” which was adorable… People are closed-minded. It was a joke, it was for fun. It was Juicy tracksuits! 10 years ago people would have given anything for a Juicy tracksuit.  You must not have gotten a lot of sleep that week.  Oh I didn’t sleep that week. And I didn’t sleep the week after, because there were all these stories going on [at the time] that they weren’t really married, and all this B.S. People are going to think what they’re going to think, but I know the truth. They were wonderful people and I’ll say that until the day I die. To this day I don’t talk to a lot of people about it because I still feel protective over them. Unfortunately it didn’t work out — but what is it, 60% of marriages that don’t?

A source tells PEOPLE that the reality star, 37, is doing her best to protect husband Kanye West since the rapper, 40, made controversial remarks on Twitter and in new interviews over the past week.  “Kanye is the most amazing person when he’s not acting like this. But when he gets manic, it’s really hard for everyone around him,” the insider says. “Kim is absolutely worried about him right now, but she will defend him publicly to the end. She’s a very loyal wife, and her tweets and everything she’s been saying is definitely very calculated to help Kanye.”  Kardashian West defended her husband in a series of tweets of her own, arguing that reports labeling him “as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive” are “not fair.”  The mom of three — Chicago, 3 months, Saint, 2, and North, 4½ — also appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week, where she brushed off her husband’s surprise return to social media.  “I didn’t even know he got his Twitter again until I started seeing tweets coming in from other people retweeting them. And I was like, ‘Wait, is this real?’ And then at night he came in and said, ‘Did you see my tweets?’ I was like, ‘Yes, I did see your tweets,’ and I followed him back,” she explained on the talk show.

50959d05-0e1a-4ed8-9255-5b28f14d2142,"Don’t get us wrong: There’s no truth to those rumors that Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's relationship is rocky. The two, who are set to be sisters-in-law when Markle marries Prince Harry in May, are certainly amicable. But there’s a difference between being friendly and being inseparable.  “I think they are certainly friendly and they are spending more time with each other. You know they’re neighbors in Kensington Palace and I know that Meghan enjoys going over to see Kate and the children, and she does enjoy that. I’m told there’s always an open invitation for her to be with Kate ever when she wants,” royal expert and author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love told InStyle. “I think that any animosity is probably a fabrication in the press. I’ve never heard to suggest that they don’t get along.”  CHRIS JACKSON/AFP/Getty Images  You’re right if you could hear the “but” coming, though.  “I do hear plenty to suggest that they’re quite different people and that have quite different interests and that Meghan is quite independent and very confident and very keen to I think establish her own network of friends over here in London,” Nicholl added.  “So that’s certainly not to say she’s snubbed Kate in any way. I think they do spend time together.

d30aff22-7a27-4807-b1fd-2ff931737c96,"Instagram  Spending Thanksgiving with your boyfriend’s family for the first time can be nerve-wracking, especially if he’s got kids.  Adding his ex-wife and her new husband to the mix just sounds like a holiday comedy of errors waiting to happen.  But try telling that to Hollywood’s consciously uncoupled, who have turned splitting up, staying friends and welcoming new significant others into the fold into an art form.  Though both have admitted that divorcing amicably a few years ago was not always an amicable experience, Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martinhave since become the poster exes for an evolved post-split family life, the actress and the rock star spending time together regularly in service of their No. 1 objective, which is to co-parent their kids, Apple and Moses Martin, to the best of their ability.  It’s one thing, though, to grin, bear it and eventually get used to the new normal when it’s just the two exes, as Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have been doing so admirably since they first separated in 2015. For all their enduring love, respect and friendship, Jen and Ben have not yet reached the “why don’t you bring your girlfriend to Thanksgiving” stage of their partnership. Not many exes have, or ever do.  Gwyneth and Chris, however, are just one big, growing happy family.  Photos  Stars Celebrate Thanksgiving 2018  While they have spent Thanksgiving together in one form or another since their split, last year Paltrow’s then-rumored fiancé (and now husband) Brad Falchuk joined the party—and this year, Martin’s girlfriend, Dakota Johnson, made for another plate around the immaculately set table.  Instagram  “Gwyneth thinks she is lovely,” a source tells E! News. “She gets on very well with her and is happy for Chris…Especially on holidays, Gwyneth wants nothing more than to be one big happy family and for her kids to be able to celebrate with both of their parents.”  That’s a far cry from the old trope of backbiting exes who can’t be in the same room together, let alone warmly embrace and break bread with the current person in their former person’s life. But don’t worry, in case you’re wondering why you’d rather tell your ex he can stuff if than share stuffing with his new girlfriend, it’s not as if these families arrived at this happy place overnight.  It’s understandable that Paltrow—whose bread is buttered with gratitude and open-mindedness—might be more open to this scenario than some others, but going by her and other famous celebrity exes’ behavior when it comes to large gatherings, certain parameters do apply.  Photos  Friendly Celebrity Exes  For instance, most parents don’t just bring anyone around their kids—or their exes, for that matter.  Neither Garner nor Affleck, who will be spending at least part of the holidays together with their three kids in Montana, have been in a relationship that was serious enough to prompt a melding of the families. Affleck ex Lindsay Shookus, the only S.O. he dated for a significant amount of time, had a daughter of her own to spend time with, and Garner only recently started dating John Miller—whom she hopes to steal away with at some point next month. As yet, there’s been no talk of him participating in any Garner-Affleck Christmas traditions this year.  “She’s excited to have some down time over the holidays and to have someone new to spend time with,” a source said of Garner’s promising-sounding romance.  Photos  Celeb Exes Who Worked Together After Breakups  Jennifer Lawrence didn’t have a goop-approved Thanksgiving when she and Martin were dating, though Paltrow seemingly would have been open to it if it had come to that. The Coldplay singer is simply in a more serious place with Johnson, whom he’s been seeing for about a year now.  There was no evidence that Paltrow ever met Lawrence, while she and Johnson have “spent a good amount of time together and have a very nice friendship,” a source told us.  Mariah Carey‘s engagement to James Packer fizzled out, but back when she thought she’d be spending forever with him, obviously she wanted him to get along with her ex-husband Nick Cannon, the father of her twins, Monroe and Moroccan. Some months they all came together to celebrate one of Carey’s favorite holidays, Halloween, a source told E! News that Cannon felt that “as long as his kids are in good hands”, he would “support any decision Mariah makes” as far as future partners go.  Read  The Art of Living Near Your Ex: How Stars Navigate a Shared Neighborhood  It understandably took Kourtney Kardashian a good long while before she was comfortable hanging out with Sofia Richie, Scott Disick‘s girlfriend. She finally had dinner earlier this month with the two of them at Nobu, once she was ready. (Nobu—a safe haven for the whole fam—is also where Scott took Sofia for her first public outing with his kids.)  “Scott and Sofia are very serious and Scott felt it was important that Sofia and Kourtney interact and bond,” a source told E! News. “They have kept things separate for over a year now, and Kourtney is now more open and willing to have a surface level relationship with Sofia.”  That being said, though the Kardashian-Jenner Thanksgiving is always a sprawling affair, Sofia did not make a cameo in any of Kourtney’s photos featuring her, Scott, Mason, Penelope and Reign.  Baby steps, you know?  REUTERS/Fred Prouser  On the other hand, while the kids can be a reason why new significant others come into the picture at a glacial pace, they also tend to be the reason for all the cozy closeness once that level of comfort has been achieved.  Even the seeming originators of the divorced-BFFs standard—Bruce Willis and Demi Moore—needed some time before life started resembling the beach in Turks and Caicos where Willis remarried, with his ex and her third husband among the guests.  For starters, Moore and Willis (her second husband) split up in 2000, when their daughters were still quite young. Their eldest, Rumer Willis, was only 12. So it was imperative that they figured out the co-parenting thing, long before that term was in fashion (though it’s often used retroactively to describe what couples ranging from Bruce and Demi to Prince Charles and Princess Diana were already doing after their divorces).  Read  The Art of Avoiding—or Embracing—an Ex at the Met Gala  Willis attended Moore and Ashton Kutcher‘s wedding in 2005, and those two returned the favor in 2009, when Willis married Emma Heming. All very civil, which has seemingly helped Rumer, Scout and Tallulah maintain close relationships with both parents. Moore and Kutcher split up in 2011 and, while they didn’t have children together, they did start a foundation, which would bring them back into each other’s orbit from time to time. Being only 10 years older than her, Kutcher has also reportedly maintained a friendship with former stepdaughter Rumer, but he and Mila Kunisdon’t generally hang out as a familiy with the evidence of his past life.  But it’s Bruce and Demi who really set the bar for being able to expand the fam organically, the two of them and Heming showing up time and again in support of whatever the kids are up to, Rumer’s 30th birthday in August being yet another occasion for them to celebrate all together.  “I have to say our daughters are incredibly well adjusted considering two of them are half Bruce Willis,” Moore said in poking fun at her ex during the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis earlier this year.  It would seem as if Bruce and Demi entered their “like siblings” phase awhile ago then.  “He’s really like my brother,” Paltrow said of Martin, whom she was married to for 10 years, on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert earlier this year. “We’re very familial. It’s nice, it’s great.”  And when one’s brother wants to bring his girlfriend home for Thanksgiving, who is his sister to deny her a seat at the table?

The new issue of Entertainment Weekly offers our first look at Nicole Kidman's character in the film, Queen Atlanna, alongside Momoa and Amber Heard as Mera. Check out the cover below.  (Photo: Entertainment Weekly)  Atlanna debuted in 1959's Adventure Comics #260, which focused on the early years of Arthur Curry. The comic depicted Atlanna getting washed ashore by a hurricane, ultimately falling in love with lighthouse keeper Tom Curry, resulting in Arthur's birth.  It's unclear exactly how closely to her comics origins the film will stick, though Kidman has professed her enthusiasm over the experience.  ""I got to be [like] a mermaid!"" Kidman revealed to The Hollywood Reporter last year. ""I got to be a queen, I got to wear a crown...I have a particular way of looking.""  The upcoming film was directed by James Wan, who mastered the horror world with films like The Conjuring and Insidious before making the leap to big-budget actions films with Furious 7. Kidman teased that Aquaman will appeal to fans of a variety of demographics.  ""I got to lie on a rock with my hair strewn, and blood,"" Kidman pointed out. ""And I kind of liked it.""  Wan also teased that the world he's exploring in the film marks uncharted territory for the filmmaker.  “The water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it’s like I’m making my own sci-fi fantasy film,” Wan shared with Entertainment Weekly. “This is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.”  Fans of Aquaman enjoyed his appearance in Justice League, though the ways in which his underwater encounters were handled left much to be desired. According to former president of DC Entertainment Geoff Johns, the new film will appease devout fans.  “The underwater stuff has never been executed like this before,” Johns confessed. “The visual effects shots coming in are just beautiful. James can switch modes from horror to big bright colorful action to really emotional scenes. He’s so able to hit all these different genres.”  Footage from the film was recently screened at CineEurope, likely confirming audiences' first look at an Aquaman trailer debuting in the near future.  Aquaman lands in theaters on December 21.  How do you think Atlanna looks in the new image? Let us know in the comments below!

(Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool.Now, the polarizing Republican presidential front-runner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists.A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump ‘is ISIS’s greatest triumph’]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui — Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump’s language aids jihadists.“If you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,” Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. “ ‘No Muslims coming to the United States,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”Trump’s comments, Clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.”[Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video]Trump responded to Clinton’s assertion by calling her “a liar.”“It’s just another Hillary lie,” Trump said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” late last month. “She’s a liar, and everybody knows that.”David Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.MORE READING:Muhammad Ali on Donald Trump: ‘Muslims have to stand up’ to anti-Islamic speechWhy Donald Trump’s call for a Muslim ban may work for him, in two charts",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,1143

In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, 52, on the show Life Stories, Caitlyn said, “I don’t talk to the Kardashians anymore. The only ones I am concerned about are Kendall and Kylie. They are my biological kids. I spent 23 years carting them around.” Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Caitlyn just summarize her role as a parent as hauling around Kylie and Kendall for over two decades?

It’s still one of the most fun things I’ve ever done,” Radin wrote. “Happy anniversary @theellenshow and @portiaderossi.”  During an interview with Oprah Winfrey, de Rossi recalled about falling for DeGeneres. “We actually met socially and I just felt that immediate draw,” she said. “We did talk a little bit and then over those three years, we saw each other at parties or at various things, but the one time that was the most significant was during a photoshoot actually.”  She continued: “I just walked over to say hello to her, and I couldn’t believe it, but she turned around and it was like an arrow was shot through my heart.

71f14083-341b-4b6c-bc96-c26e50c9fe20,"But supporters of transgender rights said the Trump administration was acting recklessly and cruelly. “The consequences of this decision will no doubt be heartbreaking,” said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. “This isn’t a states’ rights issue; it’s a civil rights issue.”  Bathroom access emerged as a major and divisive issue last March when North Carolina passed a bill barring transgender people from using bathrooms that do not match the sex on their birth certificate. It was part of a broader bill eliminating anti-discrimination protections for gay and transgender people.  Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues became a point of attack for opponents of Ms. DeVos’s nomination last month, as Democrats questioned her about the extensive financial support that some of her relatives — part of her wealthy and politically active Michigan family — had provided to anti-gay causes. Ms. DeVos distanced herself from her relatives on the issue, saying their political activities did not represent her views.  Image Attorney General Jeff Sessions pushed the administration to rescind the Obama-era policy. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times  While Wednesday’s order significantly rolls back transgender protections, it does include language stating that schools must protect transgender students from bullying, a provision Ms. DeVos asked for, one person with direct knowledge of the process said.  “All schools must ensure that students, including L.G.B.T. students, are able to learn and thrive in a safe environment,” the letter said, echoing Ms. DeVos’s comments at her confirmation hearing but not expressly using the word transgender. Ms. DeVos, who has been quietly supportive of gay rights for years, was said to have voiced her concern about the high rates of suicide among transgender students. In one 2016 study by the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, for instance, 30 percent reported a history of at least one suicide attempt.  Mr. Trump appears to have been swayed by conservatives in his administration who reminded him that he had promised during the campaign to leave the question of bathroom use to the states.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,386

Good guy Tom Hanks shouts everyone burgers at local In-N-Out  The youngest of the Kardashian sisters is rumoured to be pregnant with boyfriend-of-five-months Travis’ baby.  And when Keeping Up With The Kardashians producer Ryan Seacrest decided to probe the momager live on TV during an episode of Live With Kelly And Ryan, he got shut down.  As Ryan and co-host Kelly Ripa were discussing the topic of Kylie’s alleged baby bump when he picked up his phone and sent Kris a text as he ‘had not spoken with the family over the weekend’.  Sorry, this video isn't available any more.  And moments later, he heard back from 61-year-old Kris, who was giving nothing away.  ‘Kris says Kylie’s not confirming anything,’ he told the audience. ‘That’s the news from the family this morning. Kylie is not confirming anything.’  Ryan Seacrest has given an update from the Kardashian household (Picture: YouTube)  The head of the Kardashian household had been quizzed on her daughter’s pregnancy rumours at the weekend during Milan fashion week.  Advertisement  Advertisement  She had said at the time that she was ‘surprised to wake up to the rumours’, adding: ‘It wouldn’t be the family if something didn’t happen every single day.’  A source close to Kris had also claimed that while Kris was surprise, she will support her youngest daughter ‘no matter what’.  Kris was at Milan Fashion Week when news broke that Kylie is apparently pregnant (Picture: Pixelformula/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock)  Ryan’s investigative work comes as the news emerges that Kylie is reportedly desperate for Travis to ‘put a ring on it’ as soon as she’s given birth.  While Kylie, 20, has kept tight lipped about it all so far – apart from a few teasing Instagram pictures and sources close to her family speaking out – it’s believed that she’s around five months pregnant and is due to pop in January.  And it looks like she’s getting her life in order quickly as, according to US reports, she’s already planning an ‘amazing’ wedding to take place as soon as she’s lost her baby weight.  ‘Kylie wants an amazing wedding and wants to be married as soon as she loses all of her baby weight,’ a source told Hollywood Life.  Kylie wore a very baggy tee to support boyfriend Travis Scott at the iHeartRadio gig (Picture: Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock)  It’s claimed she want her baby to have a settled family life and is keen to avoid her first born growing up in a ‘broken home’, hence why she’s so keen to walk up the aisle with her rapper beau.

So to be married is something she wants very soon and she will be very excited for Travis put a ring on it.’  However, other members of the Kardashians apparently think Kylie might be a bit too ‘naive’ to have a baby at just 20.  ‘Kylie is very naive,’ a source told People. ‘Spending time with other people’s kids is obviously completely different than being a mom 24/7. Kylie of course has no idea about all the hard work and sleepless nights.’  Travis Scott performs in April this year (Picture: Bob Levey/Getty Images)  Kylie’s dad Caitlyn was also apparently ‘shocked and disappointed’ at the news.  ‘Caitlyn was really shocked and disappointed to learn that Kylie is pregnant,’ source close to Caitlyn told Hollywood Life.  ‘She thinks Kylie is way too young to have a baby, and that she should have waited until she was in a long term committed relationship.’  Caitlyn Jenner was ‘shocked’ by Kylie’s news (Picture: Getty)  And while Kylie and Travis have not yet confirmed they are expecting, Caitlyn appeared to do it for them on Monday.  While representatives for Caitlyn denied that she found out on the internet, as had been reported, they told The Sun that all they could say is that she was told ‘some time ago’.  Advertisement  Kylie and Travis, 25. met in April, just weeks after she split from long-term partner Tyga, and later that night Tyga claimed that he was the baby’s father, in a now-deleted Snapchat which featured an image of Kylie and the headline ‘Kylie is pregnant’, but Tyga had written over the top of the image ‘Hell nah that’s my kid,’ with four purple devil emojis.

18d1af78-9696-4312-98b5-ad2441a7c919,"After being in limbo for three years after announcing their split in June 2015, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck‘s marriage has officially come to an end.  PEOPLE confirmed the two finalized their divorce on Thursday after they met at Garner’s house with lawyers and a private judge.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The finalization came one day after news broke the actress, 46, had requested a private judge to handle the final details of their divorce, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.  The estranged couple announced their separation after 10 years of marriage and three children together: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Affleck, 46, and Garner began dating in 2004 and married in June 2005 before simultaneously filing for divorce in April 2017.  In the time between their split announcement and the divorce filing, the former couple presented a largely united front as they went through challenges together — namely, Affleck’s recent rehab stay. Garner showed her support by driving him to the treatment facility.  Here’s an inside look into the former couple’s ups and downs.  “The Love of My Life”  Six months after the former couple announced their split, Affleck was living in the guesthouse of their family home — something that seemed to begin taking a toll.  “It’s obvious many times that they both find it annoying to deal with each other,” an insider told PEOPLE at the time. “Understandably so. It’s a strange situation to live together and yet be separated.”  Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck at the 2013 Academy Awards Jason Merritt/Getty  “They are doing what is working for the kids,” a Garner source noted of the living set-up.  For Affleck, keeping his mind on work apparently helped ease the pain of the separation. In September 2015, he was focusing on his directorial effort Live By Night and promoting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. “He is happier and a more fulfilled person when he’s busy all day and night working,” a film source told PEOPLE. A source close to the actor added, “He is as happy as he can be in this position. I don’t think it’s that easy, and definitely not that easy to do it in the public eye.”  In February 2016, Garner opened up about the ongoing divorce in an interview with Vanity Fair. While the actress called Affleck “the love of my life,” she also opened up about their marital struggles, telling the magazine, “I always say, ‘When his sun shines on you, you feel it. But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it’s cold.’ He can cast quite a shadow.”  Affleck later told The New York Times, “She’s allowed to talk about it,” adding, “She felt like she wanted to discuss it and get it out there and get it over with so she could say, ‘Look, I already talked about it – I don’t want to do it again.’ ”  After celebrating Easter as a family in Los Angeles that year, Affleck and Garner spent a month in Europe with their kids while he filmed Justice League, including time in London and a family getaway to Paris. “She did have the best time in Europe with Ben and the kids,” a friend of Garner’s told PEOPLE. “She seemed to enjoy spending time with Ben again.”  Co-Parenting After Their Split  Garner and Affleck stayed close as they continued to live and vacation together as well as co-parent their kids — while also stepping out for solo outings. Shortly after announcing the separation, the entire family jetted off to the Bahamas to spend time together.  Jennifer Garner with her three children, Seraphina, Violet and Samuel at her Walk of Fame Ceremony in August Vince Flores/Startraksphoto.com  The family reunited again the following month in Atlanta, Georgia, where Garner was filming Miracles from Heaven. Affleck traveled to the Southern state to celebrate his 43rd birthday with his ex and the kids. “He’s happiest when he’s with his family,” a close friend told PEOPLE at the time.  In September 2015, the pair were spotted leaving a family counseling center in L.A. This marked their first visit to the center since announcing their divorce. Before their decision to separate, they attended weekly counseling sessions at the center but stopped going in the months leading to their split.  A source said they chose to remain friendly for reasons beyond parenting. “It’s not just for the kids – it’s also for them,” said the source. “They care about each other.” As the family continued to step out as a unit, observers noticed that Affleck and Garner seem to be looking happier after a tumultuous summer. “His family is all [Ben] cares about. This is what makes him happy and it makes sense that he looks happier,” another source told PEOPLE. “He enjoys the time with his family and that includes Jen.”  Since then, the two have worked hard at maintaining a harmonious relationship for the sake of their children. They recently took the kids to see Hello, Dolly! on Broadway in mid-July, starring family friend Victor Garber, and spent Easter together in Hawaii where Affleck was filming.  On Sunday, the two stepped out at church together with their children after Affleck completed 30 days in rehab. Three days later, Affleck and Garner stepped out with the kids again for a school event on Wednesday.  “He went to church on Sunday with his family,” a source told PEOPLE. The source added Affleck was smiling during the outing because the 30-day milestone means “he has reason to celebrate.”  From Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous  Moving On  Affleck began dating Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus in 2017. The two made their relationship public when they were spotted grabbing dinner in July 2017.  The couple dated for more than a year, often taking trips together to Hawaii and Puerto Rico, where the actor was working. Affleck was even in attendance at the 2017 Emmy Awards in which Shookus, 38, took to the stage when SNL won for outstanding variety sketch series.  The two spent time together at Affleck’s home in Los Angeles and were often spotted grabbing dinner around the city.  In August 2018, a source told PEOPLE the two split because of the long distance between Affleck living in Los Angeles and Shookus being in New York. The two stopped being photographed together in July.  Upon his return to rehab, a source close to Shookus and Affleck told PEOPLE the producer “had been supporting Ben’s sobriety and going to meetings with him.”  “She had him in meditation and they were doing it together,” the source said. “His recovery was something that was very important to both of them.”  Ben Affleck and Shauna Sexton Lastarpix/BACKGRID  “It was very hard for her to break up with Ben, but she knew he wasn’t getting better and that it was time for her to step aside,” the source continued. “She was trying to stay as close to him as possible so that he would stay on the right path, but ultimately it just wasn’t possible. She knew she had to let him hit bottom.”  Not long after their split, the actor was spotted with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton having dinner at Nobu in Malibu. Shortly after that, the two were seen visiting a Jack in the Box drive-thru together over the weekend.  In September, a source close to Affleck said he and Sexton were “just getting to know each other.“  The model has been photographed leaving the actor’s home, driving his SUV and visiting him in rehab. They were photographed together this week leaving his home as he continued rehab treatment.  Entering Rehab  Multiple sources told PEOPLE in August the two were close to finalizing their divorce in the weeks leading up to Affleck’s return to rehab.  A source told PEOPLE the two were still “working on” their divorce: “They’ve spent quite some time figuring out what works best for them and their family.”  Another source said in the days before Affleck’s trip to rehab, Garner was mostly concerned about their three children.

This is more royal drama than an episode of The Crown! Meghan Markle, 36, is extremely despondent over her half-sister Samantha‘s plans to write a “tell-all” book about the soon-to-be princess, according to a source inside the palace who gave us the EXCLUSIVE deets. “Meghan and Harry will not be responding to Samantha’s comments, as they have no intention of adding fuel to the fire, or giving her anymore publicity,” our source said. “Meghan is really sad that her half-sister is trying to cash in on her relationship with Harry, but she realizes that it was fairly inevitable. Samantha has been telling people that her upcoming memoir is going to contain ‘explosive’ information about Meghan, that will ‘shock’ the royal family to the core — which is utter nonsense.”  Our palace insider went on to say that Samantha has no secrets about Meghan — because Meghan has absolutely nothing to hide. “There are no secrets about Meghan that can be revealed,” our source added. “She’s been completely transparent about her past and has no skeletons in the closet, so unless Samantha intends to make things up, her book is going to make for pretty dull reading.” Well, it would seem the bad blood between Meghan and her family goes both ways. We reported earlier how Meghan’s father Thomas Markle Sr., 73, was apparently “extremely hurt” by Prince Harry‘s remarks that the royals will become the family Meghan never had.  In addition to her plans to write a book about Meghan, Samantha recently slammed Harry for his remarks about her family.

eabfc104-c8d0-4bd1-9d3a-23f0296b402c,"If you're rooting for John Cena and Nikki Bella to get back together, then it sounds like a certain WWE Superstar is right there with you. When John Cena opened up about his and Nikki Bella's breakup on the Monday, May 14 episode of TODAY, he told Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford that he still loves his ex-fiancée.  The Blockers star said,  “It’s been incredibly reflective, which is amazing, but it’s very difficult. I had my heart broken out of nowhere — or, for me, it was out of nowhere — and anyone who's experienced that knows that it comes with a series of bad feelings. I’ve looked at myself every day, and I’ve tried to evaluate myself every day, and the woman I love. For anyone out there speculating on what I’m doing with my life now: I still love Nicole. I would still love to marry Nicole. I still would love to have a family with Nicole.”  That ""I still would love to have a family with Nicole"" line should throw Total Bellas and Total Divas fans for a loop. Cena has been adamant about not wanting kids for years, while Bella has made it pretty clear that she’d like to settle down and start a family. This point of contention came up over and over again on both E! reality shows, and the WWE power couple never seemed to get to the same page. Many speculate that this failure to see eye to eye might've fueled their breakup. But now they may finally be on the same page about kids but also broken up? Oof, how's that for crummy timing.  TODAY on YouTube  Cena and Bella began dating in 2012, and as Total Divas and Total Bellas fans know all too well, the topics of marriage and children were recurring issues in their relationship. Bella hoped to wed and have kids with Cena, whereas Cena wasn't on board with either. But then, Cena apparently changed his mind on the whole marriage thing and proposed to Bella at WrestleMania in 2017. Their wedding was scheduled for May 5, but the pair announced their breakup on April 15.  Cena told Kotb and Gifford that he is neither happy about being single nor interested in being in a relationship with anyone other than Bella. He said,  “I don’t want anybody else. I love Nicole. And I’m really trying to support her in her trying to find whatever it is that she wants that made this fall apart in the first place … I don’t have any other hopes, other than maybe one day, we can work it out.”  Meanwhile, Bella spent Monday morning at the NBCUniversal upfronts. She did not see Cena's latest TODAY appearance, but she heard all about it when Extra filled her in during the upfronts red carpet. After hearing that Cena said he wanted to be with her and start a family with her, Bella replied, ""Wow, I'm speechless."" But is it a good speechless, bad speechless, or a ""we're totally getting back together please don't spoil anything"" speechless?  E! Entertainment on YouTube  When E! News chatted with her at the upfronts, the WWE Superstar said that watching her and Cena's relationship unravel on the upcoming season of Total Bellas will “be definitely very hard to relive,” but she did not want to cut it from the show. She told E! News, ""I feel like I would be cheating [the viewers] if I was to take away all that footage because it's real life.""  Bella added,  “I’ve already seen some of the episodes and I’m watching myself and I’m like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’ I think a lot of people are going to be able to relate to it and it’s also going to give a lot of people courage and bravery to speak up. I think sometimes we go through things because we’re like, ‘OK, this is what we need to do. It’s too late.’ It’s never too late to make a decision, so. Yeah.”  But does this mean she's done with with Cena for good? Maybe not.  E! Live from the Red Carpet on YouTube  Like Cena, Bella seems relatively open to possibly getting back together at some point down the line. She told E! News,  “John is the love of my life. He’s absolutely an amazing man. I’m so lucky to have these amazing six years with him. There’s some of us that we hope that in the end it can work out. I just think the most important part is you want to make sure live the rest of your life happy. You don’t want people to force things or have to change themselves so much. And so those are the things we’re just stepping away and seeing what we both really want out of life, and when we come back together will it make us happy for the rest of our life? We both don’t want to live in regret. So we’re being very mature, which is great … So we’ll see.”  And the gossip magazines sure think a reunion may very well be in the tea leaves. Last Tuesday, Us Weekly reported that a source claimed Bella has been “spending nights” with Cena at his place. And last Monday, a source claimed to People that the WWE Superstars are “on a path to reconciliation.”  Keep those ""You can't see me"" fingers crossed for Cena and Bella to do whatever makes both of them happy for the rest of their lives.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1105
8409f25b-bfbd-4381-a606-1df854294e97,"Gotti is a 2018 American biographical crime drama film directed by Kevin Connolly, and written by Lem Dobbs and Leo Rossi. The film is about the life of New York City mobster John Gotti and his son, and stars John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Spencer Lofranco, Victor Gojcaj, and Stacy Keach.  The film languished in development hell for several years with numerous directors and actors, including Barry Levinson and Al Pacino, attached at various points. Principal photography finally began in July 2016 in Cincinnati, Ohio and concluded in Brooklyn, New York in February 2017.  The film was originally set to be released in the United States on December 15, 2017, but, just two weeks prior, Lionsgate, the slated distributor, sold the film back to its producers and studio, delaying its release.[6] On March 12, 2018,[7] its new release date was announced for June 15, 2018 by Vertical Entertainment and MoviePass Ventures, after premiering at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. Gotti was negatively reviewed by critics, who lamented the writing, aesthetics, and performances, although its use of makeup received some praise; Travolta's performance received mixed reviews.[8] It is one of the few films to hold an approval rating of 0% on the website Rotten Tomatoes.[9][10][11]  Plot [ edit ]  The film chronicles the three-decade reign of crime boss John Gotti, and his rise as the head of the Gambino Crime Family in New York City, along with his son, John Jr., and his loyal wife, Victoria.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Development history [ edit ]  In September 2010, Fiore Films announced that it had secured the rights from Gotti Jr. to produce a movie about his life.[12] The film, tentatively titled Gotti: In the Shadow of My Father, was to be directed by Barry Levinson, who eventually left the project. Nick Cassavetes and Joe Johnston were then also attached at different points to direct, as were Al Pacino, Lindsay Lohan and Ben Foster to star in various roles.[13] Joe Pesci was cast as Angelo Ruggiero early in development and gained 30 pounds in order to properly portray him. After having his salary cut and being recast as Lucchese underboss Anthony Casso, he sued Fiore Films for $3 million; the case was settled out of court.[14][15] Chazz Palminteri, who had played Paul Castellano in the TNT made-for-TV film Boss of Bosses, was also initially cast to reprise Gotti's predecessor.[16]  Casting [ edit ]  On September 8, 2015, it was announced that the project was moving forward with Kevin Connolly as director.[17] Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films, Fiore Films and Herrick Entertainment would be financing the film, with Lionsgate Premiere handling the domestic distribution rights.[17]  On July 27, 2016, the complete cast for the film was announced. It included Kelly Preston as Gotti's wife Victoria; Stacy Keach as Aniello Dellacroce, the underboss of the Gambino crime family who mentored Gotti; Pruitt Taylor Vince as Angelo Ruggiero, a deferential friend of Gotti; Spencer Lofranco as John Gotti Jr., Gotti's son; William DeMeo as Sammy Gravano, Gotti's right hand man who later became an FBI informant and helped them in bringing down Gotti; Leo Rossi as Bartholomew ""Bobby"" Boriello, Gotti's enforcer; Victor Gojcaj as Father Murphy, with Tyler Jon Olson and Megan Leonard.[18]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography on the film began in Cincinnati, Ohio, on July 25, 2016, with locations including Springfield Township. The locations were staged to resemble setting of the film, New York City.[19][20] Filming also took place on Jonfred Court in Finneytown, and Indian Hill.[20][21] Filming was also done at Butler County Jail.[22]  The film's shooting was previously scheduled to take place in New York City, because of its setting there, but it was relocated to Cincinnati. One reason to relocate was Ohio's revised Motion Picture Tax Credit to benefit films' creators.[23] Filming for some scenes took place in Brooklyn on February 21, 2017, concluding principal photography.[24]  Release [ edit ]  The film was originally set to be released in a limited release and through video on demand on December 15, 2017, through Lionsgate Premiere. Producers began seeking a new distributor in order for the film to receive a wide theatrical release, as opposed to the original release it was initially intended to have, with Lionsgate selling the film back to the producers and studio.[25][26] On March 12, 2018, Connolly announced that the film would be released on June 15, 2018.[27] On April 12, 2018, it was announced Vertical Entertainment was the film's new distributor.[2] On April 25, 2018, it was announced that MoviePass Ventures, a subsidiary of MoviePass, acquired an equity stake in the film and will participate in the revenue generated from the film.[28][29] The film premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival on May 15, 2018.[1]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  Gotti began its limited release in 503 theaters and was projected to make $1–2 million in its opening weekend. It made $105,000 from Thursday night previews at 350 theaters and a total of $1.7 million in its opening weekend, finishing 12th.[13] According to their own reports, MoviePass accounted for 40% of tickets sold, leading one independent studio head to tell Deadline Hollywood: ""It used to be in distribution, we’d all gossip whether a studio was buying tickets to their own movie to goose their opening. But in the case of MoviePass, there’s no secret: They’re literally buying the tickets to their own movie!""[30] In its second weekend the film dropped 53% and made $812,000, finishing 12th.[31]  Critical response [ edit ]  Gotti was not screened in advance for critics,[32] but the Cannes premiere was attended by reviewers from IndieWire and The Hollywood Reporter, who both gave the film negative reviews .[33] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 39 reviews, and an average rating of 2.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Fuhgeddaboudit.""[34] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 24 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".[35]  Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, writing: ""...it's not only that the film is pretty terrible: poorly written, devoid of tension, ridiculous in spots and just plain dull in others. But the fact that it mostly portrays John Gotti as a loving family man and altogether likable guy, and his son John Gotti Jr. as a victim of government persecution, may be a first in the history of the genre.""[4] The New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski called the film ""the worst mob movie of all-time"" and wrote, ""...the long-awaited biopic about the Gambino crime boss' rise from made man to top dog took four directors, 44 producers and eight years to make. It shows. The finished product belongs in a cement bucket at the bottom of the river.""[36] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film one out of four stars and said, ""Insane testimonials from Gotti supporters at the end are as close as this [film] will ever get to good reviews.""[37]  Rotten Tomatoes controversy [ edit ]  Observers were quick to note a large disparity on Rotten Tomatoes, between the audience approval score of 80% and the 0% critics' score during the film's opening weekend.[38][39][40][41][42] As of August 12, 2018 , the audience score was down 27% to a score of 53%.[34]  On June 19, Dan Murrell of Screen Junkies noted that the disparity ""made no sense"" and suspected vote manipulation on behalf of the studio.[39] Accusations against the production studio and marketing team increased after the release of a marketing push suspected to be trying to hit back at the critics. The campaign proclaimed to consumers to ignore the ""... trolls behind a keyboard"",[42] and ""Audiences loved Gotti but critics don't want you to see it... The question is why??? Trust the people and see it for yourself!""[38][41][39][40] Observers also noted the abnormally high number of reviews, 7,000, compared to other films that did better at the box office that weekend, such as Incredibles 2 which logged 7,600 reviews and grossed 105 times more than Gotti.[39][41]  Rotten Tomatoes staff issued a statement stating they didn't find any evidence of tampering and that ""All of the ratings and reviews were left by active accounts.""[42] As of June 19, 32 of the 54 written reviews were found to be from first-time reviewers on the site, who had also only left a review for Gotti itself, and 45 of the accounts were created the same month.[39] Many of the accounts also wrote a review for American Animals, which along with Gotti are the only films to be owned by MoviePass through its company MoviePass Ventures,[39][41] which was responsible for 40% of tickets sold.[30] Jim Vorel of Paste suggested this was done to try to prop up MoviePass's ""unlimited movies"" business model.[39]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1900

He just couldn’t give up his bachelor kind of lifestyle.”  The former couple, whose love story became a dramatic plot line on “The Real Housewives of New York City,” faced rampant rumors of infidelity on his part during their courtship but nonetheless tied the knot in a glamorous wedding.  “It was a beautiful wedding, it was his birthday, it was one hell of a party and it was New Year’s Eve, so I don’t regret it.”  The reality star also maintains that the cameras didn’t fully capture their romantic side during their short-lived marriage, which was her second and his first.  “People don’t get to see that part, there was love, there was as good times,” the mom of two said. “I want people to know that it wasn’t just all of this scandalous talk in the papers.”  When asked if she’ll be deleting the evidence of her time with D’Agastino on social media, the Countess says the proof isn’t going anywhere.  “I don’t take the pictures down, I’m not that kind of person,” she said.

316317ad-df6f-489e-b3fa-4ed9fba4835d,"Instead of bringing her oldest child, Maddox, to the Golden Globes, Angelina Jolie took son Pax. HL learned, Maddox is ‘the man of the house,’ so he was caring for Shiloh!  Angelina Jolie, 42, had her son Pax Jolie-Pitt, 14, accompany her to the 2018 Golden Globes on Jan. 7. But while some may have been surprised she didn’t bring her eldest, son Maddox Jolie-Pitt, 16, Maddox wouldn’t have wanted it any other way! In fact, the teen is now apparently “the man of the house” since Angie’s split from Brad Pitt, 54, and he was put in charge of taking care of his injured sister, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, 11. After all, Shiloh reportedly broke her collarbone this past week during a family vacation to Lake Tahoe. Click here to see pics of Maddox.  “Maddox has taken on the role of caretaker in the family, and just like his mom, he’s not a huge fan of awards shows and the red carpet, so he preferred to stay home and look after his little sister Shiloh rather than go to the Golden Globes with Angelina,” a source close to Angie told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Pax loves dressing up and hitting the carpet, and he’s much more naturally sociable and comfortable in the spotlight than his brother.” Pax looked super dapper in his black tux as he smiled and posed for the cameras alongside his famous mom. There’s no question the teen fit right in! Meanwhile, Maddox has never been a fan of the limelight.  “Maddox views life much more seriously than Pax, and already has a great passion for philanthropy and human rights,” our insider explained. “He finds the glamor and glitz of Hollywood a little distasteful, so he was more than happy to skip the Globes and allow his brother to bask in the spotlight.” On top of that, Maddox’s new role has given him responsibilities that he doesn’t take lightly. In fact, the 16-year-old enjoys helping his mom out by watching his younger siblings.  “Maddox has totally assumed the role of ‘man of the house’ since his mom and dad split. He’s really stepped up to the plate and loves to take some of the pressure of looking after the younger kids off of the shoulders of his mom,” our source revealed. How sweet is THAT? Clearly Angie has some very helpful children on her hands!

0e0b19ef-bab8-40ba-9489-d4491b06e0cf,"Kim Kardashian West, whose 17-hour transformation from brunette to platinum blond made headlines pretty much everywhere, has done it again. On Sunday she took to social media to announce her newest shade: a bright, bright, bright pink.  We had a hint something was coming on Saturday, when she basically sounded an alarm for a future color drop: ""I can't even tell you how over my blond hair I am!"" she tweet-raged. (As someone who is a very much dyed platinum blond too, I can attest that we all have those days.)  Kardashian West, however, did something about it. A big something. Although she hinted that she was a ""brunette at heart"" during a Create + Cultivate panel on Saturday, she definitely didn't go back to her roots with her recent dye job. Instead, she went bold—and it's pretty great.  Judging by the multiple reveal posts, she's excited about it too.  As for those of us wondering—quite rightly, given younger sis Kylie Jenner's former penchant for mixing up her look with wigs—if the look is indeed a wig, temporary, or permanent, Kim put down any confusion on Twitter before it could begin. ""I wonder if it’s just a wig or permanent color? because we know Kim doesn’t play with wigs,"" one user posited.  ""I don’t really do wigs,"" she replied. ""It’s real.""  Her stylist's Instagram backs it up: After news broke of the dye job on Sunday, her hair colorist, Chris Appleton, posted a photo of the dye in process on his 'gram (and that definitely looks like some Olaplex in the background). ""New look who dis?"" he captioned the pic.  Kim is pink, Kris is blond, Kylie has a $1.4 million push present—and we're all just still trying to keep up with those Kardashians.

ae480645-0cd0-42f3-95cf-7ca1a4b77b33,"ABC's Grey's Anatomy firefighter-focused spinoff finally has a title.  The Shondaland drama will be called Station 19, executive producer Paris Barclay announced Thursday as part of a social media campaign for the show. The title comes from the name of the firehouse at the center of the story.  The 10-episode spinoff, picked up straight to series, is set in Seattle and focuses on firefighters from the captain down the ranks to the newest recruit in their personal and professional lives. The castmembers are expected to be introduced in an episode of the flagship series this season. The firefighter series will be the second spinoff to come out of Grey's Anatomy following Kate Walsh starrer Private Practice. The latter ran for six seasons and wrapped its run in 2013.  From Shonda Rhimes and her Shondaland partner Betsy Beers, Station 19 is penned by Grey's Anatomy alum Stacy McKee, who serves as showrunner. She also exec produces the ABC Studios drama, alongside producing director Barclay. Grey's star Ellen Pompeo recently added a co-exec producer credit on the spinoff as well.  Jaina Lee Ortiz (Rosewood) leads a cast that includes Grey's Anatomy regular Jason George, who will segue to the spinoff this season; Grey Damon (Friday Night Lights); Miguel Sandoval (Bad Judge); Okieriete Onaodowan (Hamilton); Danielle Savre (Too Close to Home); Jay Hayden (The Catch); Barrett Doss (Iron Fist); and Alberto Frezza (Dead of Summer).  Delays in show titles are not uncommon; Grey's Anatomy did not have a title right away, while Scandal was not that show's original name, either.  As for what to expect from the spinoff, McKee said it exists in the same universe as Grey's — the joke is that Fire Station 19 is three blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. The showrunner called the spinoff ""Grey's adjacent"" and said there was ""a lot of potential for cross-pollination,"" noting that they would be excited to have crossover with the characters or places from the flagship in ""small ways or big ways.""  Station 19 premieres March 22 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,409

8a7e31da-7969-4915-a881-9275c96355e6,"Melanie “Mel B” Brown and husband Stephen Belafonte seem to have settled some of the issues in their contentious divorce ahead of their trial, set to begin Nov. 13.  The couple, who are ending their marriage after 10 years wed, reached an agreement in the domestic violence portion of their divorce, TMZ reports — with the former Spice Girl agreeing to drop the temporary restraining order she filed in April against Belafonte.  Brown, 42, had accused her ex of physically and emotionally abusing her, alleging in her TRO filing that she was “in fear” for her life and that Belafonte’s alleged abuse ramped up when her career was on an upswing.  Belafonte, 42, and Brown — who wed in Las Vegas in June 2007 — also settled a portion of their property division, TMZ reports.  A rep for Brown did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  Melanie ""Mel B"" Brown and Stephen Belafonte Phillip Faraone/Getty  The former couple’s divorce has been a nasty battle since Brown filed in March and asked for joint legal and physical custody of their 6-year-old daughter, Madison. Brown also requested to terminate the court’s ability to award spousal support in her filing. (PEOPLE confirmed in July Brown was ordered to pay Belafonte $40,000 per month in temporary spousal support and pay for $140,000 in attorney fees and forensic fees on Belafonte’s behalf.)  Amid her restraining order filings in April, Brown claimed that Belafonte hired a German exchange student, Lorraine Gilles, to be their nanny and pitted the two women against each other. Brown claimed the nanny’s relationship with Belafonte became sexual and that he impregnated her before demanding an abortion.  She was granted a restraining order against Gilles in April, but Gilles in turn sued Brown for defamation, claiming her pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand. Their battle remains unresolved.  RELATED VIDEO: Forced Threesomes and Injury Coverups: The Biggest Bombshell Allegations from Mel B’s Restraining Order Against Her Ex  Meanwhile in October, new details of Brown and Belafonte’s marriage emerged in a court proceeding in Los Angeles, with Brown claiming Belafonte drugged her throughout “much to most” of the relationship, according to his lawyer, Philip Cohen, as reported by multiple outlets.  “Miss Brown now takes the position she was drugged by Mr. Belafonte throughout the course of the marriage,” Cohen said in L.A. Superior Court. Belafonte and his legal team responded to Brown’s allegations, claiming they are “nothing more than a smear campaign.”  Also in court in October, Brown’s lawyers said Belafonte had at least 56 videos, a third of which were “of a sexual nature,” according to The Sun. Susan Wiesner, a member of Brown’s legal team, said “90 percent” of the videos were of the former Spice Girl and were made without Brown’s consent. Belafonte’s lawyers dismissed the claim, arguing that the videos were “consensual.”  Hearings between Brown and Belafonte’s legal teams remain ongoing.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,582

Simpson: American Crime Story brings top-shelf writing, directing, and acting to bear on a still-topical story while shedding further light on the facts—and provoking passionate responses along the way.""[30] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 90 out of 100, based on 45 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim.""[31]  Many critics singled out many cast members for the performances, particularly Paulson and Vance.[32][33][34] Dan Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter praised the performances of Paulson and Vance, writing: ""As Clark's discomfort grows, Paulson's collection of tics seem more and more human, [...] Vance's Cochran is sometimes hilarious, but he has a dynamic range such that he's occasionally introspective and always intelligent as well.""[33] Brian Lowry of Variety praised the casting of the smaller roles, particularly Connie Britton as Faye Resnick and Nathan Lane as F. Lee Bailey.[35]  Despite the praise for the rest of the cast, Travolta and Gooding's respective portrayals of Shapiro and Simpson have been met with mixed reviews by critics. Brian Lowry of Variety called Travolta ""awful"" in the role, adding: ""Yes, Shapiro spoke in stiff, measured tones, but the actor's overly mannered line readings turn the attorney into a buffoon, in sharp contrast to the more nuanced portrayals around him.""[35] Nicole Jones of Vanity Fair called his performance ""campy and calculated.""[36] Dan Feinberg of The Hollywood Reporter also criticized his performance, calling it ""a mesmerizingly bad performance from the eyebrows down."" He also wrote that ""His unnecessary accent varies by episode, and Travolta's laser intensity feels arch and almost kabuki at times, turning Shapiro into a terrifying character from the next American Horror Story installment, rather than a part of this ensemble.""[33]  Maureen Ryan of Vanity Fair, conversely, became more impressed with Travolta as the season progressed: ""I started in the realm of puzzled disbelief, arrived at amusement, and ultimately traveled to a place of sincere appreciation. You simply can't take your eyes off Travolta, and that is a form of enchantment.""[37] Elisabeth Garber-Paul of Rolling Stone also called it ""arguably [Travolta's] best performance since Tarantino brought him back from the dead.""[38] Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that Travolta's was the show's ""broadest performance.""[39]  Dave Schilling of The Guardian panned Gooding's performance, writing: ""his whiny, gravely voice sounds absolutely nothing like the real O. J. Simpson's deep, commanding tones.""[40] Michael Starr of New York Post also was highly critical of Gooding's performance, saying that he ""portrays Simpson as a hollow, sad-sack cipher who speaks in a high-pitched whine and sleepwalks in a fog he never shakes after being arrested for the brutal double murder of ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman. He's a forgettable, annoying presence in what should be a showcase role for Gooding—who, to be fair, is reciting lines written for him, so he can only do so much with the material.""[41]  On the other hand, Joe McGovern was more positive on Gooding's performance, writing that his casting ""takes a risk and pulls it off.""[42] Elisabeth Garber-Paul of Rolling Stone described his performance as ""an unnervingly believable take on a potential psychopath with teetering sanity.""[38] Nick Venable of Cinema Blend also opined that Gooding's turn as Simpson ""could indeed get him on a shortlist of Emmy nominees.""[43]  In spite of the mixed reviews on their performances, Gooding and Travolta received Emmy nominations. Additionally, Travolta was among the recipients for Outstanding Limited Series, being one of the show's producers. Gooding's Emmy nomination for his work on the series was criticized by some reviewers.[44]  Reaction from individuals involved [ edit ]  Mark Fuhrman, who is portrayed by Steven Pasquale, refused to watch the series and called his portrayal untruthful. In an interview with New York Post, he said, ""The last 20 years, I have watched the facts dismissed by the media, journalists and the public simply because it does not fit within the politically correct narrative. At this late date, FX is attempting to establish a historical artifact with this series without reaching out to any prosecution sources. In a time when Americans read less and less and investigative journalism is on vacation, it is sad that this movie will be the historical word on this infamous trial. After all, it was 'based on a true story.'""[45]  Marcia Clark praised the series and called Sarah Paulson's portrayal of her ""phenomenal.""[46] Clark went to the Emmys with Sarah Paulson, who won that night for her performance.[47]  The families of Brown and Goldman expressed anger at the show. Nicole Brown's sister, Tanya Brown, lashed out at the cast members for what she saw as a lack of consultation with the families.[48] Ron Goldman's father, Fred Goldman, had numerous criticisms of the series. He felt that there was not enough material about Ron, who is only depicted on the show as a corpse. He expressed concern that the generations of people who were too young to understand the events at the time would consider everything to be accurate. Goldman's family also criticized the series for not depicting the murders, as they believe that Goldman died trying to save Brown from her attacker and that he was the man who eyewitnesses heard shouting that night.[49] Goldman's sister, Kim, criticised the series for sympathetic portrayals of Simpson and Kardashian (despite the latter in real life having actual doubts about the former's innocence).

64f10708-f940-4115-a511-d95a6ed1d036,"Eliza Dushku has accused stunt coordinator Joel Kramer of molesting her when she was 12 years old. Kramer has denied the allegations.  Her account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time’s Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.  In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film “True Lies.” According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he “laid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.” Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he “methodically built my and my parents’ trust, for months grooming me,” and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel’s pool. Instead, her took her to his hotel room, where he “disappeared in the bathroom and emerged, naked, bearing nothing but a small hand towel held flimsy at his mid-section.”  Kramer told Variety Saturday morning that Dushku’s allegations were “absolutely not true.” According to Kramer, Dushku swam in the hotel pool with him and other members of the stunt crew, including Dushku’s stunt double. Afterwards, he took her to her first ever sushi meal, and then took her home.  Related Eliza Dushku Slams CBS, Michael Weatherly for Alleged Harassment and Retaliation on 'Bull' 'OITNB' Actress Yael Stone Accuses Geoffrey Rush of Sexual Harassment  After the alleged assault, Dushku wrote, he suggested they should “be careful,” referring to talking about the incident.  Dushku also wrote that while in a taxi back to her hotel, Kramer held her on his lap in the backseat. According to Kramer, he drove the car to take her home.  She also implies that Kramer may have intentionally harmed her while on the set of “True Lies,” referring to it as “no small coincidence” when she was injured on-set after a “tough adult female friend” faced him about the alleged assault.  “With broken ribs, I spent the evening in the hospital,” she wrote. “To be clear, over the course of those months rehearsing and filming ‘True Lies,’ it was Joel Kramer who was responsible for my safety on a film that at the time broke new ground for action films.”  She also wrote that Kramer would call her “Jailbait,” and that she doesn’t understand why no adults on the set grew suspicious of the “over-the-top special attention he gave me.”  “Over the years I’ve really struggled as I’ve wondered how my life might have been different if someone, any one grown-up who witnessed his sick ways, had spoken up before he lured me to that hotel room.”  Dushku explained that she had heard, years ago, that Kramer had been “found out” and forced to leave the business, but recently learned he was still working in the industry.  “And a few weeks ago, I found an internet photo of Joel Kramer hugging a young girl,” she wrote. “That image has haunted me near nonstop since. I can no longer hide what happened.”  She expressed gratitude for the support of her fans, and wrote that she hopes her speaking out will help other victims of sexual assault.  Kramer stated that he was “taken aback” and “floored” by the allegations, and that he “never molested her” and was “never nude in front of her.”  “This whole talk of luring her to my room, on top of her, getting off, holding her in the car and calling her jailbait is just outright hyperbole and lies,” he said.  Kramer, who has worked on numerous high-profile films such as “Blade Runner 2049” and “Furious 7,” said he had no explanation for the allegations, but stated that he thought she may have had a crush on him at the time. According to Kramer, another person working on the set had told him that Dushku was “always asking questions” about him, which caused him to feel he had to “handle her with kid gloves.”  “I did kiss her on the cheek once to say goodnight to her, gave her a hug,” he said. “We treated her like family, she was part of our crew.”  He referred to the allegations as “absurd,” asserting that it would have made no sense for him to act in the manner he accused her of. “Who in their right mind would do something like that, when you’re a high-profile coordinator on a shoot like that with months left of shooting?”  Dushku’s legal guardian on the set of “True Lies,” Sue Booth-Forbes, issued a statement supporting Dushku’s account to Deadline Hollywood.  “Eliza Dushku is telling the truth,” she told the outlet. “I was on the ‘True Lies’ set for three weeks and reported Joel Kramer’s inappropriate sexual behavior towards 12-year-old Eliza to a person in authority. I was met with blank stares and had the sense that I wasn’t telling that person anything they didn’t already know.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1009

Despite a 47-year age difference, Caitlyn Jenner, 68, and Sophia Hutchins, 21, have been spending quite a bit of time together lately, and now, there are rumors that they may even be getting married! “They consider each other soul mates and freely admit they couldn’t imagine a life with anyone else at this point,” an insider tells RadarOnline. The site also reports that Caitlyn and Sophia are making “secret plans to tie the knot” and that Caitlyn is actually in a rush to get married again after her fallout with the Kardashian sisters.  “Cait has a wedding planner to handle all the details,” Radar’s source claims.”This is a dream come true for Cait because her rejection by the Kardashians had left her feeling isolated. Sophia has changed all that.” The ladies are reportedly planning their nuptials for this summer in Malibu. However, an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY that reports of an engagement and upcoming wedding for Caitlyn and Sophia are “not true.”  It’s no secret that Caitlyn and Sophia have a very close relationship, though. Romance rumors first began in 2017, when the women were seen together in Mexico. Recently, they’ve been photographed out and about together quite a bit, although they’ve never confirmed any reports of a romance.  Like Caitlyn, Sophia is a transgender woman. She came out with her decision to transition in a 2016 article in her school newspaper at Pepperdine University. It is rumored that Sophia is living with Caitlyn in Malibu, with those reports fueled by several photos taken in Caitlyn’s home on Sophia’s Instagram page.

""I had good agents and stuff and I've had really good friends since the beginning.""

While the social media platform launched back in 2018, it wasn't until one fateful day in December 2017 that the Fresh Prince decided to post his first IG picture. It's been on ever since.  The charismatic super star let fans into his childhood when he shared a baby photo that required no filters. Approximately seven IG posts later, he had everyone hooked, especially when he showed just how proud he is to be a father by uploading a split image of Jaden and himself in similar poses at two different events.  Will then reminded his fans and binge watchers everywhere to keep watching Netflix (before the whole Mo’Nique boycott went down).  But it isn't just his wit and family pics that has everyone following Smith—it's his life advice. From inspirational posts laced with comedic timing, to his musings on what it takes to make a marriage last, Smith's insight never comes off as preachy, which people obviously relate to. Since joining in December, his followers have swelled to 8.9 million.  Bottom line? There are many reasons to love Will Smith's Instagram— nine major keys to be exact.

Somewhere along the way he transformed into an inebriated super hero, but not before experiencing life as one of the world's soul survivors. Now he's a full blown family man who's still doing backflips on a big screen while banking millions. He personifies the phrase, ""Black don't crack!""  He Always Remembers His Roots  Smith may be worth around $260 million, but he never forgets where he came from.  He Has the Best Friends  Understandably, Will Smith has a lot of high-ranking friends in a lot of high-ranking places. But sometimes, it’s not about the money or the fame. Sometimes it’s just having a lot of (high-ranking) celebrity friends who care just as much about the culture as you do.

eb34e1f7-3a9f-4051-a80b-969c47970c27,"Selena Gomez and The Weeknd are moving fast, and a shocking Jan. 31 report claims that the couple is not only ready for marriage, but that Selena is EXPECTING! So is she going to walk down the aisle as a pregnant pride?! Get all of the crazy details right here.  Selena Gomez, 24, is pregnant with The Weeknd‘s baby, sources claim to Life & Style magazine in their Feb. 13 issue. OMG! “Selena is crazy about The Weeknd, 24, and has told pals that he’s the one,” one insider tells the mag, adding that the “Heart Wants What It Wants” singer has been experiencing cravings. “She’s [dropped] several hints that she’s expecting, complaining to those close to her that she’s too tired to stay out and that she feels nauseous. When she’s not nauseous, though, she’s having weird cravings, and she can’t stop eating ice cream!” That certainly does seem a little fishy.  It sounds kind of nuts, but friends say that Selena “can’t wait to have a child of her own”, according to the report, and she’s constantly telling friends “how much she wants to be a mom”. Selena also isn’t concerned about having kids at a relatively young age, as insiders claim to the mag: “Her own mom [Mandy Teefey] had her at 16, and Selena thinks her mom did a great job, so being a young mom has never been an issue.”  This is a lot to take in, and of course we’re wondering if Selena is nervous about these dramatic changes in her life. Well, yes and no! “She is excited,” a source shares with Life & Style. “She has always talked about having a little girl.”  Finally, if Selena and The Weeknd do get married, one thing’s for sure: it’ll be spectacular. “As far as weddings go, Selena wants to do something dramatic and different,” an insider reveals to the mag. “She has talked to friends about everything from an African safari wedding to a tropical Mexican wedding.” Sounds amazing!

The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, raved about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story serves a greater purpose.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to change the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s push the envelope!! Let’s make the world a better place.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, so they can live long, happy, healthy lives,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man for a great cause.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a violin,” he quipped. “What an incredible love story.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,421
f5642537-7a44-4541-8d9b-42ba7495ecd4,"There’s a rumor going around that Eva Mendes has given Ryan Gosling “the” ultimatum.  Ryan Seacrest’s Radio Show reported that Mendes has told Gosling that she wants a ring.  Apparently Ryan Gosling, 32, is not ready to settle down, yet and that might be creating some tension with Eva.  The actress who is going to be 40 next year, wants to start a family soon, but her beau seems to be enjoying the status quo.  According to a report in ShobizSpy, things started getting a bit icy when Mendes pressured Ryan for a commitment, and he denied her.  Mendes has said that Ryan is too focused on his career right now and she may be right.  His name comes up whenever a new leading man role opens as is the case with the possible role as Batman.  Eva has made it clear on several occasions that she wants to get married to Gosling, but her pleas seem to be falling on deaf ears.  And it’s not that he doesn’t love her, because from all that we hear he does.  Eva Mendes has reportedly tried to bring mama Gosling in to back her ultimatum and make her son see reason. She supposedly loves Eva.  Ryan Gosling is obsessed with his career, or maybe he just wants to focus on it at the moment.  Up until now Eva hasn’t pressured Ryan much, but as she is not getting any younger, her desire to have a family is taking precedence.  According to the Ryan Seacrest show, Mendes told Gosling that if he’s not ready to give her that ring, she would find someone who was. Ouch.  So, will this ultimatum work for Eva Mendes or will it turn Ryan Gosling off? Only time will tell. Maybe he needs to be put against a rock and a hard place to finally decide.

The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England, with the star opting to wear a 'budget' dress.  The couple's big day celebration had an impressive guest list, with A-list celebs including the bride's The Theory of Everything co-star Eddie Redmayne, 36, and Tom Hanks, 61.  Finally hitched: Felicity Jones, 34, married her boyfriend of three years Charles Guard, 45, on Saturday in their native England in a secret ceremony (pictured in 2017)  According to The Sun, the bride wore an elegant full-sleeved white gown with sheer fabric above the bust and a frilled neck.  Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony.  Wearing an expression of utter delight, she slicked her wavy dark hair back beneath a classic mesh veil that fell to the floor.  Meanwhile, her groom, 45, cut a dapper figure in a three-piece suit with silver trousers, a black jacket and a pale yellow waistcoat.  A day in the Cotswolds: The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, a spectacular structure near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England  Rounding off the look with a sky blue tie over a white dress shirt, he popped a flower in his lapel for his special day.  The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII’s six wives.  It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding.  The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago.

He is best known for the 2009 horror film The Uninvited, which he co-directed with his brother, Thomas Guard.  Before the Hollywood actress dated Guard, Felicity, 34, was with a sculptor named Ed Fornieles.

The British beauty admitted that when she was invited to the British Academy Film & Television Awards for the first time shortly after winning a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her work in indie movie Like Crazy, she was totally unprepared for the glamorous event.

This summer she plans to tour North America, including a sold-out gig at Carnegie Hall in New York. (April 2) AP  Kathy Griffin performs during her Laugh Your Head Off Tour on July 19 in Hollywood. (Photo: Allen Berezovsky, Getty Images)  HOLLYWOOD – Kathy Griffin is back on U.S. soil, and she’s got a lot of material to get off her chest.  The comedian brought her Laugh Your Head Off World Tour to Hollywood Thursday night, serving up almost three hours of comedy in a high-octane set. In front of a packed house, Griffin gleefully spilled the tea on everything from the federal investigation surrounding her controversial fake and bloody Donald Trump photo shoot that went round the world to how she really feels about Ellen DeGeneres. (Spoiler: They are not friends).  At the sold-out Dolby Theater, Griffin, gearing up for the long haul in a pair of flats, ran out on stage jumping and dancing. “They said I would never work again, and you came!” she said to the packed crowd. Here's what to expect from Griffin’s latest act:  Kathy Griffin: 'Truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi’  More: Kathy Griffin on tour, that 'harmless' bloody Trump photo, her gripe with Kevin Hart  There’s plenty of President Trump – and his family  “I’ve known this fool off and on for 20 years,” said Griffin, harking back to the time she first met Trump on the set of ""Suddenly Susan."" ""He said, 'Call me The Donald,' to which I said, 'OK – call me The Kathy.' And then I walked away."" Griffin went on to give less-than-flattering nicknames for Trump's adult children and doubled down on the president's purported ties with Russia. ""You know that pee-pee tape exists!"" she exclaimed.  A feud with Ellen DeGeneres  Griffin described how she got into a fight with DeGeneres after her mentor and friend Joan Rivers died. “One of the things that always hurt (Rivers) is that Ellen shunned her and thought she was vulgar and not funny,” Griffin said. “After Joan died I just called (DeGeneres) and I said, ‘Woman to woman, comic to comic, let it go and do a tribute to her ...' We got into a screaming match,"" said Griffin, adding: ""She’s scarier than the government.”  Kim and Kanye are actually good neighbors  Only in Hollywood would it turn out that Griffin and Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West were honest-to-goodness neighbors. “We actually had a shared wall,” said Griffin, revealing she has changed her stance on the reality show family. She even once called Kim to ask if her kids could come over to cheer up her 98-year-old mother, Maggie. (They came!) “I am pro-Kardashian,"" Griffin said. ""They let me make fun of them to their face, which is all I ask.”  No one is spared  Griffin let loose on a Rolodex of frenemies. Targets included her former publicist Cindi Berger (“I can’t get a publicist at all, so I can burn the bridge”), former New Year's Eve BFF Anderson Cooper (whom she referred to as ""Anderson Vanderbilt""), former Bravo boss Andy Cohen, Jeff Zucker (“He’s not smart enough to run CNN. He’s the guy who gave Emeril a sitcom!”), her short-lived attorney Lisa Bloom, Matt Lauer and Megyn Kelly.  Her darkest moments  Griffin said she spiraled after her Trump photo shoot brouhaha. Within days, her career imploded: Griffin’s stand-up shows were canceled, CNN fired her, and advertisers fled. Griffin recalled even getting dumped by Squatty Potty: ""That one hurt,” she deadpanned.  But for two months, ""I almost didn't leave my house at all,"" she said. Griffin closed by describing her FBI interrogation (an experience that wove together a sword, a porn awards show and Martha Stewart). She also championed First Amendment rights, imploring the audience to continue supporting comics who dare to take on the administration. “Over my dead body will I let this happen to another woman again,” she pronounced.

42f4ac1f-527f-426c-aae0-1cf191095bfb,"Amy Schumer has parted ways with Sony’s live-action “Barbie” over a scheduling conflict, Variety has learned.  “Sadly, I’m no longer able to commit to Barbie due to scheduling conflicts,” the actress said in a statement to Variety. “The film has so much promise, and Sony and Mattel have been great partners. I’m bummed, but look forward to seeing Barbie on the big screen.”  The big screen adaptation of Mattel’s iconic toy line was expected to start production this summer on June 23, but Schumer’s busy schedule includes a lengthy promotional tour for her new Fox comedy “Snatched,” which opens in May, as well as an upcoming shoot for Rebecca Miller’s “She Came to Me” opposite Steve Carell.  Sony needed to stick to its June 29, 2018 release date since Mattel already has merchandise and product cycles in motion–shifting the production to accommodate Schumer would have put on a strain on other partners on the film, according to insiders.  “We respect and support Amy’s decision,” a spokesperson for Sony said in a statement. “We look forward to bringing Barbie to the world and sharing updates on casting and filmmakers soon.”  Sony is still trying to find a director for the comedy. The “Barbie” movie is said to be in the vein of “Splash”, “Enchanted” and “Big.” In it, the main character gets kicked out of Barbieland for not being perfect enough and lands in a real-world adventure.  Schumer recently did a polish of the script. It’s unknown whether the same tone will be kept with the comedian no longer attached.  Walter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald and Amy Pascal are producing the film. Parkes and MacDonald initiated the original deal with Mattel in 2014.  Schumer can be seen next in the action-comedy “Snatched,” which opens on May 12, 2017, and also has “Thank You for Your Service” opening in October.

6525929a-72fa-4b71-b76c-83e85ef99565,"Re-castings of iconic beloved roles made famous by other actors are normally met with some degree of fandom skepticism. Yet when Warner Bros. announced Jude Law was stepping into the role of “young” Albus Dumbledore for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, it felt like a perfectly shaped puzzle piece that clicked into place. Subsequent photos of Law as Dumbledore and a trailer showing the Sherlock Holmes and The Young Pope star giving some warm-yet-snappy line delivery as the charismatic future Hogwarts headmaster have subsequently reinforced the feeling that the 45-year-old actor was an unexpected yet ideal choice.  Below, Law takes our questions about how his Dumbledore differs from the Harry Potter-era character, details some of what author J.K. Rowling told him during their meeting, reveals (somewhat inadvertently) a couple intriguing plot details, and weighs in on the debate about how his character’s sexuality should be depicted.  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So before you took on this role, what research did you do, if any?  JUDE LAW: I knew the books and the Harry Potter films pretty well, my children grew up with them so I grew up as an accompanying adult. And I’d seen and enjoyed the first [Fantastic Beasts] film. Then I had the good fortune and opportunity to sit with [author and screenwriter] J.K. Rowling shortly after we started work on it. She gave me a very good sense of Albus’ life journey and who he was and what was happening in his head and his heart and his world for this particular story.  Did you look at the performances of previous Dumbledore actors Richard Harris and Michael Gambon?  I’m sure they were in the back of my mind, because I’d seen their work and admired both of them as actors, greatly. I talked with [director] David Yates about that and we both decided that it wasn’t necessary to do an impersonation of one of them as a younger man. This is a man with almost 100 years ahead of him before he became that character so we wanted to look at who he was in this moment and construct our own version. It makes me laugh when he’s called “Young Albus” because I’m 45, so I’m more in the middle of a midlife crisis, but I’m happy to hold onto that as long as I can!  I found it funny you went from playing the Young Pope to Young Albus in pop culture.  The word “Young” has to be in every part I play, it’s contractual.  What did Rowling say in terms of the performance or interior life of the character that you found helpful?  Well gosh, there was so much reference to interior life. The one thing that came out was the sense of play. He has a youthful mercurial approach to life, but that there’s something that hangs heavy in his heart, in his past, that underlies all of that. There’s a root of good humor and good heart and sense of self and a sense of past.  How much say, if any, did you have on how he looks in the film?  When you hire [famed costume designer] Colleen Atwood, you know you’re in the hands of someone rather great. There’s no one quite like her in the world of film. She has a very clear vision. It was open and collaborative, there were tweaks here and there, but I was happily corralled into the overall look which was clear from the get-go.  So what’s Dumbledore like at this age and how different is he than how we know him?  As I mentioned before, there’s a sense of humor and mischief, a dash of anarchy, a sense of what’s right and what he believes in, and a sense of mystery. There’s also how he comes around to get people onto his way of thinking — which is rather indirectly. He also has a certain heaviness about him that I don’t want to reveal too much about — and that’s something he has to overcome, or hopes to overcome. He’s also got a great passion for sharing his knowledge, he’s a powerful and inclusive teacher.  So he teaches Transfiguration, right?  He doesn’t teach Transfiguration, actually, not at this stage.  Oh! Because in Potter lore, it was said he used to be a Transfiguration teacher before becoming headmaster…  At this stage in his career, he’s not. I’m not sure I’m allowed to say what he teaches…[Editor’s note: We think we may have figured it out]  Ah, okay. Well, what was your favorite spell to cast?  Well … I ah … I only get to cast one. There’s a lot you don’t know about Albus in this film. And there are certain restrictions in storytelling — you’ll see, it all makes sense. You don’t see him in full flow yet.  Interesting! And if I remember right, Dumbledore doesn’t yet have the infamous Elder Wand, right? So what’s his current wand like?  Albus doesn’t have the Elder Wand yet, no. I have a wand. It’s very reflective of him, beautiful dark wood root with a stone on one end.  He calls on Newt to go after Grindelwald. What’s his relationship with his former student?  I think he admires in Newt this sense of moral code that he will always do the right thing because he can’t do anything but the right thing. I think he likes that Newt finds beauty in beasts because I think occasionally Dumbledore feels like a beast. And there’s a master and mentee kind of relationship. And Newt isn’t afraid to say when he thinks Dumbledore is wrong, it’s not servitude.  There was some uproar earlier this year when director David Yates told EW the character not “explicitly gay” in this film. What’s your take on how apparent Dumbledore’s sexuality should be?  Jo Rowling revealed some years back that Dumbledore was gay. That was a question I actually asked Jo and she said, yes, he’s gay. But as with humans, your sexuality doesn’t necessarily define you; he’s multifaceted. I suppose the question is: How is Dumbledore’s sexuality depicted in this film? What you got to remember this is only the second Fantastic Beasts film in a series and what’s brilliant about Jo’s writing is how she reveals her characters, peels them to the heart over time. You’re just getting to know Albus in this film, and there’s obviously a lot more to come. We learn a little about his past in the beginning of this film, and characters and their relationships will unfold naturally which I’m excited to reveal. But we’re not going to reveal everything all at once.  Obviously, Dumbledore had a relationship with Grindelwald. What’s that relationship like at this point in time? And what was it like working with Johnny Depp?  I don’t actually have any scenes with Johnny. As I said before, this is only Part 2 of a longer story. I’ve always admired him from afar, but we don’t know each other, and I’ve not yet met him on this. In many ways that suits the relationship as it’s been many years since they’ve seen each other. So there’s complexity in that that’s fun to mine. Again, the past will reveal itself.

3b10af5e-c18a-4ad5-91c4-1ff62902573b,"(CNN) In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem ""came to stomp"" Tuesday night, calling the President everything from ""Donald the b----"" to a ""racist grandpa"" in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap.  The Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to ""decide who you like more"" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle ""Campaign Speech"" and in Big Sean's ""No Favors.""  ""And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,"" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.  A request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.  The latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called ""The Storm,"" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President's own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.  ""I appreciate you @Eminem,"" Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.  The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in ""Campaign Speech.""  Here are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:  1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust'  Here's the full verse: ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.""  Here, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as ""little rocket man.""  2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am'  This line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.  3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange'  4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump'  Here's the full verse: ""That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand.""  Here, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.  5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm'  ""But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""  Here, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.  6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips'  Full verse: ""He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?""  Last month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.  7) 'Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more'  Full verse: ""Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.""  Here, Eminem is referring to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.  8) 'This racist 94-year old grandpa'  This line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America's racist past.  9) 'To him, you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured'  ""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b-------, Unless you're a POW who's tortured ... cause to him you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured. That's not disrespecting the military.""  Eminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military -- a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump's previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?""  10) 'F--- that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald the b----'  You can check out hip-hop's strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1123

I love you so much.”  Later, she attended Sports Illustrated’s first-ever open casting at W South Beach.

Later that year she won the PEOPLE Magazine Award for Sexiest Woman, telling her man, “you’re welcome!”  Verlander proposed to Upton with a custom-designed engagement ring created by jeweler Anita Ko right before the baseball season kicked off in 2016, but the couple didn’t reveal the news to the public until she accessorized her metallic Topshop gown with the one-of-a-kind sparkler at the 2016 Met Gala later that year.  “We’ve been keeping it on the down low for quite a while,” she told E!

They star in HGTV’s Flip or Flop, a television show that follows the pair as they buy homes that are in desperate need of some TLC. Together they renovate the homes and place them back on the market. While the public first met Tarek and Christina in 2013, they married in 2009. They soon welcomed their first child, Taylor, in 2010. Braden, the couple’s first son, was born in 2015.  While Tarek and Christina’s star was on the rise, the couple was quietly having personal problems. They split in 2016 after police were called to the couple’s home after an argument. Tarek officially filed for divorce in January of 2017. The couple’s divorce was finalized in May of 2018, and a custody agreement is currently in place for the couple’s two children.  Tarek now resides in a home in Costa Mesa, California, while Christina has since purchased a home in Newport Beach, California. Tarek and Christina quickly sold their marital home in Yorba Linda, California, before the final divorce decree.  What is the custody agreement between Christina and Tarek El Moussa ?  While Tarek and Christina originally separated in 2016 after 7 years of marriage, their divorce was not finalized until January of 2018. The couple asked that the financials of their settlement be kept private, but the custody agreement the pair hammered out is public record. According to their official divorce documents, Christina and Tarek will share joint physical and legal custody of their two children, Taylor and Braden.  According to the agreement, Tarek will care for the children from Wednesday from 3 pm until Saturday at 5 pm. Christina will have custody of the two from Saturday at 5 pm until Wednesday when they go to school. During the summer months, when school is not in session, Tarek will pick up the youngsters at noon on Wednesdays.  The co-parents have also agreed to work together to accommodate their work schedules. Because of the nature of their business, they’ve decided to swap custody when one parent or the other needs to travel for work. They have also agreed to work together to make up for missed parent time due to work-related commitments.  An odd addition to the custody agreement hints at problems between the former pair and family members  While the majority of the custody agreement between the pair seems pretty standard, an added stipulation hints at a potential problem between the co-parents. According to official documents, both Christina and Tarek have been banned from speaking negatively about each other.  The decree goes on to state that the co-parents must also remove the children from any person or situation where the other co-parent is being spoken of disparagingly. The decree highlights that the stipulation includes friends, family and current or future significant others.  This type of stipulation is not standard, but they are not completely unheard of. A “non-disparagement clause” is most commonly seen in bitter divorces were parents plan to share custody of the children. The goal of such a clause is to foster a relationship between the child and both parents, as it prevents the parents from talking disparagingly about each other, leading to the estrangement of the child-parent relationship.  Christina and Tarek’s working relationship  While Christina and Tarek have ended their romantic relationship, the pair still has a working relationship. During the split, the pair’s show on HGTV, Flip or Flop, went on hiatus but has since returned. Recently, HGTV announced that the pair would once again reprise their roles for 20 more episodes. Additionally, they share a construction business and still have shared real estate ventures. Christina has also signed on with HGTV for a new show that will feature her design business and her new home.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,744

db3fa73e-f727-44e7-85cc-c056cbe21c3c,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  By Associated Press  WASHINGTON — After a 35-year acting career and with two iconic television characters to her name — Elaine Benes of ""Seinfeld"" and foul-mouthed Vice-President Selina Meyer — Julia Louis-Dreyfus has been honored with the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy.  On Sunday night at Washington's Kennedy Center, the 57-year-old actress received a stream of testimonials from celebrities including Jerry Seinfeld, Stephen Colbert and 2010 Mark Twain recipient Tina Fey — touching on the multiple aspects of her career.  Fey paid tribute to Louis-Dreyfus at the award ceremony by tracking the similarities between their lives.  ""We both started comedy in Chicago. We both moved on to 'Saturday Night Live.' We both lost our virginity to Brad Hall,"" referring to Louis-Dreyfus' husband and former SNL castmate sitting next to the honoree. Fey praised the ""secret precision"" of Louis-Dreyfus' comedy and her willingness to make her Seinfeld character so flawed.  ""Julia let Elaine be selfish and petty and sarcastic and a terrible, terrible dancer,"" Fey said. ""Julia's never been afraid to be unlikable — not on screen and not in person.""  Louis-Dreyfus is the 21st Mark Twain recipient, joining a list that includes Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Carol Burnett. Bill Cosby, the winner in 2009, had his award rescinded earlier this year after he was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault.  During last year's ceremony to honor David Letterman, Cosby's name was never mentioned. But this year, two of the performers felt comfortable making Cosby jokes. Late night host Stephen Colbert displayed a sign proclaiming, ""167 days since the last Un-Twaining.""  With his fingers crossed, he told Louis-Dreyfus, ""I think you'll be OK.""  Later Keegan-Michael Key come onstage, dressed as Mark Twain himself and proceeded to roast many of the previous award recipients. When a picture of Cosby was briefly shown, Michael-Key quickly moved things along and said, ""It's OK, he's not watching,"" then added that he doubted PBS was a popular channel ""in the penitentiary.""  Seinfeld, while on the red carpet before the ceremony, recalled first meeting Louis-Dreyfus during an informal audition. His iconic sitcom, ""Seinfeld,"" was still in the planning stages and producer Larry David knew Louis-Dreyfus from their time together on ""Saturday Night Live.""  ""We had just two short pages of script, and we sat down to read the dialogue together,"" Seinfeld said. ""As soon as she opened her mouth, I knew she was the one.""  Seinfeld also credited Louis-Dreyfus for having the confidence and strength of personality to hold her own on what he called ""a very male show.""  That confidence was evident very early for Louis-Dreyfus, who said she knew as a young child that she had a gift for comedy.  ""The first time I really knew was when I stuffed raisins in my nose and my mother laughed. I ended up in the emergency room because they wouldn't come out!"" Louis-Dreyfus said before the ceremony.  Comedian Kumail Nanjiani grew up in Pakistan and never saw an episode of ""Seinfeld"" until he immigrated to the U.S as an adult.  ""But I became a huge fan as soon as I moved here,"" he said.  The co-writer of the movie ""The Big Sick"" particularly recalls her iconic, slightly convulsive ""Elaine Benes dance"" on the show, which he credits to Louis-Dreyfus' gift for physical comedy.  ""There are some comedians who think physical comedy is beneath them,"" he said. ""But she was just fearless and ego-less.""  At the end of the night, Louis-Dreyfus accepted her award with an extended comedic bit and a few shots at new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  The veteran comedic actress first drew laughs by repeatedly referencing her true life's ambition to be a respected dramatic actress — stopping in mid-speech to deliver a monologue from Shakespeare's ""Merchant of Venice.""  A native of the Washington suburbs in Maryland, Louis-Dreyfus is a graduate of the elite Holton-Arms school, alma mater of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of assaulting her at a high school party.  Louis-Dreyfus make a veiled but unmistakable reference to Ford's testimony — framing it around her performance a high school presentation of the play ""Serendipity.""  ""I can remember every single aspect of that play that night, so much so that I would testify under oath about it,"" she said, to a round of laughter and applause. ""But I can't remember who drove me there or who drove me home.""  Louis-Dreyfus emerged from Chicago's famed Second City comedy troupe before joining the cast of ""Saturday Night Live."" Her best-known role is her nine-year run as Elaine Benes on ""Seinfeld."" More recently, her work as Vice President Selina Meyer on ""Veep"" earned her six consecutive Emmy Awards.  Production on the upcoming seventh and final season of ""Veep"" was delayed as Louis-Dreyfus received treatment for breast cancer. That season is currently in production.  PBS will air the Twain event on Nov. 19.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,991

52621484-de8b-4a1f-982a-b9d5e7e0c691,"Courtney Love stars as a distressed and conflicted Kitty Menendez in the expertly melodramatic trailer for Lifetime’s upcoming original movie, Menendez: Blood Brothers. The film tells the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who notoriously murdered their parents in 1989. It premieres June 11th.  Along with Love, Menendez stars Nico Tortorella and Myko Olivier as brothers Lyle and Erik, and Benito Martinez as the family patriarch, Jose Menendez. The new trailer highlights the abuse Jose inflicted upon his sons, as well as Kitty’s inability to protect her sons or stop her husband. In quintessential Lifetime movie fashion, the trailer boasts a scene in which Kitty looks nervously into a mirror in a dark room while whispering in a voice over, “Just get through this day Kitty, tomorrow will be different.”  Elsewhere in the clip, the Menendez brothers plot and carry out their parents’ murder and enjoy a surprise respite of freedom before the swift hammer of justice comes down – which of course prompts some furious telephone smashing in a seedy motel room.  The Menendez brothers’ trial became became a national sensation as the brothers testified about their father’s history of abuse. After a deadlocked jury and mistrial, Erik and Lyle were retried and convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. In 1996, they were sentenced to life without parole, and are currently serving time in separate prisons.  Along with Lifetime’s Menendez: Blood Brothers, Law & Order creator Dick Wolf is working on a true crime spin-off of his hit series that will debut with an eight-episode first season about the Menendez brothers.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,301

Taylor Swift sent fans into a frenzy when opening up about the meaning of her new album, Reputation, and how she found love again.  “[I] think there was a bit of a bait-and-switch that happened with this album when we put out ‘Look What You Made Me Do’ and we’re like, ‘Guys, this album is gonna be one thing.’ And then the album came out,” Swift, 28, told fans at her intimate Taylor Swift NOW concert hosted by AT&T in Chicago on Wednesday, August 29, according to Entertainment Tonight. “It’s legitimately an album about finding love throughout all the noise.”  The Grammy winner elaborated on her remarks, seemingly referencing her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn. “I starts with the noise and how that makes all you feel and how it makes you feel when people are saying things about you that you feel, like, aren’t true and living your sort of life in defiance of that. And then, sort of, in the middle of the album you kind of realize, ‘How much do I really value that?’ she explained. “If you can find something real in spite of a bad reputation, then isn’t that what matters the most to you? And doesn’t it matter the most to you that you know who your real friends are now?”  Alwyn, 27, has supported Swift on many stops along her Reputation tour. The duo, whose relationship made headlines in May 2017, recently enjoyed a getaway in London earlier in August. Back in July, the pair jetted off to Turks and Caicos for a July 4 vacation in lieu of Swift’s annual bash.  “They seemed genuinely happy,” an onlooker told Us Weekly at the time of the twosome as they strolled beachside. “They were always smiling and close to each other, but kept to themselves.”  A source told Us later that month that Swift and Alwyn are the perfect pair. “Joe has really showed her a different lifestyle and the value of privacy,” noted the insider. “She’s the happiest she’s ever been.”  Taylor Swift NOW will be available on AT&T’s DirectTV channels (Ch. 1113) or DIRECTV NOW or U-Verse (Ch. 1501) on Thursday, August 30.

eeb1a611-5016-4872-bfd7-c80f060b0e87,"Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,467

They have been dating ever since 2015, but only revealed they were an item a whole year after rumours started to circulate that they were seeing each other.  However, despite the hush around their romance, all of this seems to have gone out of the window at Coachella, as the pair are spotted putting on a passionate display of PDA.  What happens at Coachella stays at Coachella, right?  The couple had been hanging out with friends all day, but it looks like they’d been able to sneak away from the crowds and grab a moment alone as they were pictured together perched under a tree.  The pair have been dating since 2015 and generally keep their relationship under wraps (Picture: MEGA)  While enjoying each other’s company, the pair shared a kiss before heading back off to the festival to enjoy the rest of Saturday’s evening.  Advertisement  Advertisement  This photo has emerged after Kristen was rumoured to be meeting up with her ex flame Robert Pattinson.  The 28-year-old and her former Twilight co-star were allegedly spotted by fans having a drink together at a bar in California.  Five years after their massively public split, onlookers took to Twitter to share the news that they had finally reconciled.  However, it has recently been rumoured that Kristen has been meeting up with her ex flame Robert Pattinson (Picture: Getty Images)  One fan tweeted: ‘Was just at bar enjoying my friends birthday and in comes Robert Pattinson which blew my twilight mind up, and then Kristen Stewart walked in and now I’m reliving my highschool twilight fantasies.’  While some questioned whether it was true, someone shared that the place was so tiny it would have been ‘rude’ to take a snap. But enough fans tweeted the sighting that it appears to have been legitimate.  Twihards don’t get your hopes up though on the pair reigniting their relationship, as Kristen officially came out last year during an episode of SNL, where she revealed she is ‘like, so gay’.

f76bdc52-ef7e-4c7e-a006-eb1b638dfa8e,"Cindy Crawford’s list of career highlights is miles long, but one of the supermodel’s top memories is filming her iconic 1992 Pepsi commercial.  “This time of year it always gets featured in the roundups of the Best Super Bowl Commercials ever, and every January I revisit my original Pepsi spot that I just love because the music was perfect and the little boys were perfect and it was just one of those commercials that everyone loved and it made people happy,” she tells PEOPLE.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  That sense of family and love is why Crawford is reuniting with the brand once again for the new “This Is The Pepsi” Super Bowl LII spot, which is part of the brand’s 2018 “Pepsi Generations” campaign celebrating all of its pop culture highlights through the decades (from Michael Jackson to Britney Spears!) while featuring its top drinks: Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi Zero Sugar.  Cindy Crawford stars in new Pepsi Super Bowl spot  “This spot is a reminder of how much fun Pepsi has created for every generation,” Crawford shares. “It’s a look back at getting people excited for Pepsi now and the future. They’ve spent a long time creating all of these memorable moments and that’s exciting for me to because I really do consider myself part of the Pepsi family.”  For Crawford, this commercial (catch a 6-second teaser above!) was extra meaningful because it also brought together the generations in her own family. Her 18-year-old son Presley Gerber stars alongside her in the spot.  “To include now my next generation, Presley, just makes it that much more familial feeling,” she says. “I hope it gives people that warm, fuzzy feeling.”  Crawford says to work with Presley at this point in his career was “exciting.”  “We drove to work together, we shared a trailer, and just as a mom watching him perform, I was the proud stage mom standing by the monitor,” she says.  Stephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty  And Crawford’s 16-year-old daughter Kaia Gerber had a little FOMO when she heard about the commercial.  “I was saying to Kaia, ‘Presley and I are doing this commercial’ and she was like, ‘Wait, Presley and you? What about me?,'” Crawford shared. “I said, ‘Your time will come, honey, don’t worry.’ I think it would be fun for her to get to really re-create my original spot.” (The supermodel-in-training has already shared a Versace catwalk with her mom, so we think there’s a good chance that’ll happen.)  Courtesy Pepsi  Speaking about her debut Pepsi commercial, Crawford reveals that she still has those iconic denim cut-offs.  “They were my jeans that I wore that day and when we were doing wardrobe the stylist asked to just cut my jeans off,” she says. “Because your own jeans always fit you better if you’ve worn them awhile, so we just cut off my jeans and I got to keep my own jeans.”  Crawford wore the same cutoffs for the spot 10 years later, which had a cameo from her very young children.  “My kids were little so this actually Presley’s second Pepsi commercial,” she says. “The car in that one is not a Lamborghini, it’s an SUV, and I’ve got my two little kids in the back so they have been part of the Pepsi family really since they were little.”  But this time her look was totally different: a denim shirt, white jeans and boots.  “I don’t know if the shorts would still fit but this time we didn’t want to bring them back because the commercial is about passing onto the next generation, it was a nod to the old commercial without wearing the exact same outfit,” Crawford says. “Time has gone on and I have an 18-year-old son now. I think Kaia will wear them one day.”  So what is Super Bowl Sunday like at the Gerber household?  “It involves chili and some wings and Pepsi of course, and probably at a certain point, margaritas,” Crawford shares. “It’s about the tradition of getting together. Some years I watch less of the football, but I always look forward to the commercials and the halftime show. I think we are all in our busy current lifestyles, and we appreciate those things that bring people together. If you think about it that’s why award shows are fun too because you have a group of people sitting around together doing a shared experience — it’s social. And for me I love the social moment of the Super Bowl.”  See the full reveal of Crawford’s new Pepsi spot during Super Bowl LII on February 4 on NBC.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,933
dee69fc8-494f-4f99-b02b-33520eb4e4d0,"The place is known as the Miraval Château, a castle and vineyard in the tiny town of Correns, near Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt bought it in 2008 for €45 million (about $67 million at the time), and it hosted their wedding six years later.  After three years of legal battle, the decision was originally delivered in April but wasn't revealed until French media broke the story last week. Meanwhile, the aggrieved designer, Odile Soudant, has filed another suit demanding to be legally recognized as the creator of the project.  The artist, who specializes in light installations, accused the Jolie-Pitt company of driving her business, Lumières Studio, into bankruptcy. She's also fighting Pitt for the intellectual property rights to the lighting she designed for the 17th century chateau and its outbuildings. Of the payout, €60,000 ($70,800) covers damage to her reputation, which she says has been severely affected by the failed project.  Pitt's lawyers had argued that the project was late and over budget—and that the design was Pitt's brainchild.  “When, in 2010, Brad Pitt came to ask her to bring to light four buildings of his domain at Miraval, the plastic artist Odile Soudant did not suspect that this Pharaonic building site was going to cause her ruin,” writes Le Point.  The Hollywood couple, according to the newspaper Liberation, which broke the story, launched a large remodeling plan intended to transform the property to their liking. Pitt hired Soudart in 2010 to run a €25 million project that would bring natural light into four of the buildings of the 40-bedroom domain where, in the late 1970s, the band Pink Floyd had recorded an album.  According to the newspaper, he wanted the visual artist to create ""an exceptional place with light at the center of everything.""  The collaboration went smoothly for three years until Pitt discovered that the company acting as the general contractor managing the network of businesses involved in the remodeling was inflating the costs. He then blocked all additional payments.  Until then, the artist and her 17 assistants and subcontractors had been working for the project in a Paris studio and partially completed the redesign at the property. Despite the fact that Pitt was no longer paying, according to her declaration, he asked her to continue working.  “Odile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,” Brad Pitt wrote in an email to Soudart, according the court documents published by Liberation.  “I don’t know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don’t attack friends,"" he wrote her in another email. ""I’ve been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let’s finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend,” he wrote to her in another.  In a third message, he wrote: “Don’t waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don’t worry about the rest.”  Her answers were desperate: ""My company and my bank accounts are well beyond the maximum. I can no longer use my credit card. I'm sinking. I do not ask you to pay everything, but at least a part...I do not know how to make you understand the urgency in which we are now. Without a quick solution, the consequences will be catastrophic.”  But the legal struggle has not yet ended. Soudart is now accusing Pitt of appropriating the creation of her work. The actor’s lawyers replied that the castle is ""purely private"" and not subject to copyright.  But Le Point concludes that “the estate is not as private as its owners claim: Recently it served as a backdrop for the latest Guerlain ad campaign by Terrence Malick. In one of the scenes, we see clearly—no pun intended—a luminous installation conceived by the plastic artist.”  The one minute clip called ""Notes of a Woman"" shows Angelina Jolie strolling through different spaces at Chateau Miraval, practicing her lines and wandering through the vineyard as a man creates a perfum.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,802

a0aa3acd-c883-4b2b-b6dd-8704f63a7007,"Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as ""Sevastopol"" but makes no mention of ""Ukrainian SSR,"" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.However, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations — the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,994

993e79b4-047b-4ae0-acd1-cd76754873f5,"Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban take PDA to a new level on Cannes red carpet  REGIS DUVIGNAU Cute or a bit too much? Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban weren't shy about showing affection on the red carpet at Cannes.  The Nic-aissance has officially hit Cannes, with Nicole Kidman promoting no fewer than four movies at the film festival this year.  The actress understands that the notorious press calls, complete with wall-to-wall photographers, on those red carpet steps, are the most important aspect of a movie's promotion.  Where else but in Cannes do we witness the perfect melange of decadence, frivolity and just a splash of tacky? Not even The Met Ball can guarantee this level of fashion extra-ness.  Andreas Rentz The couple starts with some hand-holding...  This goes some way to explaining the piece of performance art produced by Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, at the premiere of The Killing of a Scared Deer.  READ MORE:  * Naomie Harris barefoot in Cannes is all of us after a big night out  * Sofia Coppola and Nicole Kidman lead Cannes Film Festival 2017 lineup  * Best & worst dressed: 2016 Cannes Film Festival so far  JEAN-PAUL PELISSIER And some hand-kissing...  The nuzzles, the elongated looks, the soft nibbles on the neck, the fingers, entwined in climactic pleasure, all combine to create what might best be titled ""Le Public de Love Making"", which is probably the grossest sentence ever written, but if the oversized tutu fits ...  At one point, Urban took hold of his wife's long hair and gently pulled at it while gripping her bare back, in what might be described as a classic Mills and Boon cover move.  It isn't the first time the couple have put their PDA on display. It's actually something of a sensuous habit. At this year's Oscars, Kidman and Urban engaged in the sort of kissing normally reserved for couples bidding farewell at the airport… in a private room… on a military base.  ERIC GAILLARD There's also a bit of eye-gazing...  When Kidman is able to come up for air, she tends to look a little coy. This moment is usually alleviated by Urban through prolonged eye contact followed by a ""presentation"" of his wife to photographers.  If the move seems familiar, it's because it is.  In 1992, when Kidman made her debut at Cannes, she arrived with her then husband, Tom Cruise, a man who is not shy of presenting wives and belief-defying displays of public affection.  ERIC GAILLARD There's even a few tears.  All of which begs, was it Tom who influenced Nicole, or the other way around? Kidman, who has admitted to social introversion, has said several times that she finds the red carpet nerve-wracking, and to ease her butterflies, she goes into her own private world.  This admission makes sense – it's not performance PDA then, but an attempt to cope with the onslaught of cameras.  It also explains why she also held hands with, and leaned on Colin Farrell at the premiere, too. Although, considering Farrell has lost none of his own scrappy brand of Celtic sensuality, there's really no explanation required.  ERIC GAILLARD And we can't really blame her for cuddling up to Colin Farrell.  - dailylife.com.au",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,617

1bd4644c-745c-494f-b9ad-4df14127e92b,"Cam Newton’s sexist comment to a female reporter has cost the Carolina Panthers quarterback a side gig as a yogurt pitchman amid national backlash.  Dannon, the maker of Oikos yogurt, has dropped Newton from all advertising campaigns following what the company perceives as “sexist” remarks he made on Wednesday to Jourdan Rodrigue, a beat reporter with the Charlotte Observer.  Cam Newton disses female reporter with sexist remark at press conference Read more  Company spokesperson Michael Neuwirth released a statement Thursday saying it was “shocked and disheartened” at the former league MVP’s behavior.  Newton made light of a straightforward question from Rodrigue during his regular media availability on Wednesday, saying it was “funny to hear a female” ask about football.  The 28-year-old quarterback, who smirked derisively as the reporter asked about Carolina wide receiver Devin Funchess’s route-running, prefaced his response with a dig: “It’s funny to hear a female talk about routes. It’s funny.”  The Dannon statement noted the company perceives Newton’s comments as “sexist and disparaging to all women. It’s simply not OK to belittle anyone based on gender. We have shared our concerns with Cam and will no longer work with him.”  Carlin & Reese (@CarlinReeseWIP) Here's the video of Cam Newton saying ""it's funny to hear a female talk about routes"" pic.twitter.com/hd9Kg4CCeu  The company later clarified: “The agreement has not been terminated. However, we will no longer work with him and are removing advertising with him in it.”  Later Thursday, Newton apologized in a video posted to Twitter for what he described as an “extremely degrading and disrespectful” choice of words.  “After careful thought, I understand that my word choice was extremely degrading and disrespectful to women,” he said. “And to be honest, that was not my intention. If you are a person who took offense to what I said, I sincerely apologize to you.  “I’m a man who tries to be a positive role model to my community and tries to use my platform to inspire others. I take ownership to everything that comes with that. What I did was extremely unacceptable.”  Dannon inked Newton to sponsor its Oikos brand of Greek yogurt in January 2015, shortly after the quarterback’s maiden playoff victory.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Newton has sponsored Dannon’s Oikos yogurt since 2015.  By the end of that year, one that saw the quarterback capture MVP honors while leading the Panthers to Super Bowl 50, Newton had become one of the NFL’s most visible pitchmen with an endorsement portfolio including pacts with Gatorade, Under Armour, Beats By Dre, Nickelodeon, Carolina Health Systems and Belk worth an estimated $11m combined.  Gatorade also issued a statement Thursday, saying: “Cam’s comments were objectionable and disrespectful to all women and they do not reflect the values of our brand. Gatorade fully supports women who compete in, report on, coach for, or play any role in sport – on or off the field.”  The NFL added in another statement that Newton’s response to the question was “just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league.”  Cam Newton's joyful Panthers remind us that football can still be fun Read more  But it doesn’t appear there will be any punishment handed out to Newton.  “I think there are conversations going on at the club level with the appropriate people, with the Panthers,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart said in a conference call Thursday. “I don’t want to anticipate the league stepping in there.”  Mike Persinger, the executive sports editor of the Observer, said Wednesday evening that Newton’s comments were “unfortunate and out of line.”  The Associated Press Sports Editors announced that it “agrees wholeheartedly that Mr Newton’s response was out of line” and “we ask for a formal apology to Jourdan Rodrigue from Mr Newton and the Carolina Panthers organization.”    The Newton hubbub inadvertently prompted a separate controversy after three tweets Rodrigue posted years ago with racial overtones were discovered by Black Sports Online. The reporter used the word “nigga” in one of the tweets and referenced laughing at racist jokes in the others.  “I apologize for the offensive tweets from my Twitter account from 4/5 years ago,” Rodrigue said on Thursday. “There is no excuse for these tweets and the sentiment behind them. I am deeply sorry and apologize.”    Newton, who slumped badly last season after his spectacular MVP campaign in 2015, has passed for 882 yards with five touchdowns and five interceptions in four games this year, leading the Panthers to a 3-1 record and a tie for first place in the NFC South.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,901

643f6eef-0f2a-4b18-8012-b1f27f733411,"Meghan Markle is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19, 2018. Life as she knows it will forever change from that day forward. Although, since announcing their engagement, life has already changed plenty for the humanitarian and (former) actress. Between her first royal engagement with Harry and spending Christmas with the royal family,Meghan has had to make some significant adjustments to her life and the way she interacts with the public.  Below, in no particular order, a list of things Meghan probably won’t be doing once she officially becomes a Duchess.  1. Take selfies.  Meghan has already mastered this rule.During her first official event with Prince Harry in early December, Meghan reportedly told a couple who asked for a selfie, “We’re not allowed to do selfies.”  Meghan is learning the royal ropes already, telling one couple who asked for a selfie in Nottingham today: “We’re not allowed to do selfies.” — Victoria Murphy (@QueenVicMirror) December 1, 2017  Meghan also probably won’t be allowed to use any social media filters (like the puppy one from Snapchat, above) in public, and she can also say goodbye to posing with pretty drinks, unless it’s for an official royal appearance.  On top of all this, Queen Elizabeth allegedly isn’t a fan of the selfie. In 2014, U.S. ambassador Matthew Barzun told Tatler magazine that The Queen confided in him and revealed that selfies were “disconcerting” and “strange” to her. To put it another way, “She was essentially saying: ‘I miss eye contact,’” Barzun said. (via Hello!)  Related article: The Greatest Royal Family Moments To Relive From 2017  2. Go out in public totally alone.  Summer-summer-summertiiiiiime… ☀️ A post shared by Meghan Markle (@meghanmarkle) on May 28, 2016 at 11:11am PDT  Have you ever seen the Duchess of Cambridge all by herself? Like every member of the royal family, Meghan will likely have security with her everywhere she goes.  3. Give autographs.  Save for official signings at royal engagements, members of the royal family are not allowed to sign autographs for the public.The fear is that someone could forge the signature and use it against the family. In 2010, Prince Charles broke this protocol when he granted an autograph to one of the victims of the Cornwall floods. According to The Telegraph, he wrote, “Charles 2010” and apologized for his “shaky writing.”  4. Use social media.  Meghan will likely join Harry, Kate, and Will under @KensingtonRoyal on social media. The trio have been providing updates about the charities they support on the account, which has provided an intimate but controlled line of communication between the young royals and the public. @KensingtonRoyal is where Meghan and Harry released their official engagement photos in December and also where they announced their wedding date.  5. Show PDA.  There’s a reason photos of Kate and Will kissing are limited to their wedding day smooch on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. Does this mean that Meghan and Harry’s engagement photos will be the last time we see them get up close and personal? According to royal etiquette expert Myka Meier (via People), there is no official protocol against PDA, despite Meghan and Harry’s predecessors keeping things to a minimum. (Recall Kate and Will’s hug fest during the 2010 Olympics in London.) Says Meier, “Meghan and Prince Harry holding hands at a royal engagement is a refreshingly modern approach to their new role both as a couple and as representative of the royal family.” FYI, Kate and Will held hands during their Christmas morning walk to church in December 2017, while Meghan held onto Harry’s arm. But that’s probably all we’ll get moving forward.  Related article: How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Will Make A Living After The Wedding  6. Vote.  Meghan, who will seek British citizenship after her marriage to Harry, will likely not participate in future UK elections. As the official parliament website states: “Although not prohibited by law, it is considered unconstitutional for the Monarch to vote in an election,” referring to Queen Elizabeth II. Beyond The Queen, the law is blurry, but a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace told Newsweek in June 2017 that members of the royal family do not exercise their voting rights “by convention.”  7. Wear see-through outfits like the $75,000 Ralph & Russo mesh dress in Meghan’s engagement photos.  While there was no obvious cleavage or slip-up, the sheer look of the dress raised some eyebrows and will likely be the last see-through dress Meghan wears in public or in official photos. She also drew (unnecessary) attention when she stepped out without stockings the day she and Harry announced their engagement.  “You never see a royal without their nude stockings,” royal expert Victoria Arbiter tells Business Insider. “Meghan, from what I can see from the engagement photographs, it doesn’t look like she was wearing tights or stockings. I would say that’s really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires.”  8. Wear colorful or dark nail polish.  As per royal protocol, only nails bearing natural colors are allowed at official events.According to nail polish giant Essie, Queen Elizabeth has been a customer of “Ballet Slippers,” a very subtle light shade of pink, since 1989.  Related article: 6 Major Ways Meghan Markle Has Already Broken Royal Convention  9. Wear wedges.  This rule reportedly only applies when Queen Elizabeth is present. In 2015, a source told Vanity Fair, “The Queen isn’t a fan of wedged shoes. She really doesn’t like them and it’s well known among the women in the family.” Wedge away, Meghan, just as Kate has when the Queen’s not around.  10. Stick her tongue out.  There’s a reason tongue wagging has only been displayed by the youngest members of the family, and even those instances are rare. Though, to go with her recent string of breaking royal tradition, Meghan stuck her tongue out while walking to church on Christmas with the royal family.  11. Carry giant purses.  Yes, it’s very convenient when your giant bag can fit everything from a laptop to three days’ worth of snacks. But when you’re a royal, other people carry things for you, right?  While it’s unclear whether or not carrying clutches (instead of big purses) is an official royal rule, there’s a really good reason why Duchess Kate and The Queen are almost always seen with clutches or bags with small handles. As one royal expert explained to The Daily Mail, “The Duchess of Cambridge may well prefer not to shake hands with certain people – but there are other ways to achieve this, as used by The Queen and other members of the royal family, than opting for a clutch over a bag with a strap.” What’s more: “It is protocol that you do not extend your hand to any member of the royal family… unless their hand extends first.”  Princess Diana was also a fan of clutches in the ‘80s and ‘90s, but it had less to do with etiquette or protocol and more to do with practicality. She called them “cleavage bags,” according to designer Anya Hindmarch, whose bags were a favorite of Diana’s. In 2009, Hindmarch told The Telegraph: “We used to laugh when we designed what she called her ‘cleavage bags,’ little satin clutches which she would cover her cleavage with when she stepped out of cars.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1477
ffa46816-ed03-4b3d-82b9-bb2152927641,"Shailene Woodley at the premiere of ""Adrift."" Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images  ""Big Little Lies"" actress Shailene Woodley portrays real-life sailor Tami Oldham Ashcraft in the new movie ""Adrift."" Released on June 1, the film is inspired by true events experienced by Ashcraft and her husband when they were caught in a storm on their yacht. When Ashcraft's husband was left incapacitated by the struggles of life on the open sea, Ashcraft was forced to sail them both 700 miles across the ocean to get to the nearest land.  As you can imagine, that kind of struggle wears on you. Ashcraft said she survived only on non-perishables the couple had previously stored on the boat, and most of her meals throughout the journey consisted of sardines and Spam. Of course, when Woodley was cast in the role, she had to replicate the physical deterioration Tami actually experienced — and, contrary to her caption on this Instagram, it wasn't easy.  According to the 26-year-old actress, in order to shed pounds for the role, she skipped dinner every night and ate nothing but ""a can of salmon, some steamed broccoli and two egg yolks every day."" She also said she couldn't sleep when she was hungry, so she'd drink wine at night in order to ""pass the f--- out."" Um, who wouldn't?!  Although Woodley's preparation for the film made her ""miserable,"" she said it was all worth it in the end because she felt very close to Ashcraft's story. She remembered reading about it when the catastrophe first occurred and recalled sobbing as she learned what had happened. Another saving grace for the actress was her costar, Sam Claflin. ""I don't know that I could do it without Sam. We both really were there for one another in our moments of extreme exhaustion and hunger,"" she said.  Luckily, when filming was over, Woodley went right back to eating a healthy diet. She's now back in action, filming another season of ""Big Little Lies"" alongside stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Zoë Kravitz and Meryl Streep. We'll be watching Woodley in both roles (and drinking our own glasses of wine as we imagine what it must have been like for her to go on that extreme diet).

928a666e-eea8-41e5-ba11-2bfaa03253f6,"The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits.  The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm.  Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works.  Advertisement  ""The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,"" Lee said.  Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images  ""As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.""  Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.  ""By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,"" Lee said.  ""New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.""  Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.  ""But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,"" Lee said.  Acknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,463

Hyland is one of the stars of ABC's Modern Family and Sherwood is one of the stars of Freeform's Shadowhunters. Fans are wondering: Why did Sarah Hyland and Dominic Sherwood break up? Elite Daily reached out to both Hyland and Sherwood's teams for comment, but did not hear back by time of publication.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Hyland and Sherwood's relationship had just run its course. And hey, I get that. Things are good for a while, and then you just realize you're not right for each other. It doesn't mean it was a bad relationship, it's just one that's over. The pair first met when they co-starred in Vampire Academy back in 2014. (Hyland has also had a recurring role on Sherwood's Shadowhunters recently.)  Hyland and Sherwood went public with their relationship in March 2015 when they were seen kissing at a Lakers game in Los Angeles. They used to post pictures of each other on their respective Instagrams all the time, but Hyland hasn't posted anything about Sherwood since April 15, and Sherwood hasn't posted anything about Hyland since April 22.  Of course, Instagram posts realistically have nothing to do with the status of any given relationship. But that's just about the only indication we've had that these two were going to call it quits (albeit a very, very small indication). They celebrated their two-year anniversary in Feb. 2017. Hyland posted about the anniversary on Instagram with a caption that read, ""Happy 2 year to my #1 @domsherwood.""  Sherwood talked about his love for Hyland in an interview with ET in Feb. 2017. In the interview, he said,  Sarah makes me want to be a better version of myself. That's what I love most about her. She inspires me to be the best version of me.  When she joined the cast of Shadowhunters, Sherwood said,  Everyone fell in love with her on set. It was a real joy ... She's been coming in since season one, coming to visit me. Having her on set as an actress was just phenomenal.

It felt like the show could see into the future, because the reference was just so timely. And now, they’ve done it again — except that this time they’ve had to edit the reference out.  The episode set to air tonight, titled “The 20s,” revolves around a flashback to Halloween of years past. The official synopsis reads: Trick-or-treating with the 10 year olds goes awry for Jack and Rebecca; and Randall, Kevin and Kate have life-changing Halloweens. The episode — which was made available to press ahead of time, and yes, I have watched it — takes us back to a Halloween when the Big Three were 10, and also 18 years later in the year 2008, when they’re all 28.  It’s in this 2008 flashback where we see Kevin struggling as an actor in Los Angeles. During the episode, Kevin’s roommate at the time comes home from a day auditioning and excitedly shares that he’s just booked a role on an upcoming Kevin Spacey movie.  Out of all the actors This Is Us could have picked, they had to go with Kevin Spacey. Back in 2008, the actor had just wrapped a role as Lex Luthor in Superman Returns and was about to star in HBO’s Recount, which earned him an Emmy and Golden Globe nomination. So talking about Spacey being an actor everyone wanted to collaborate with isn’t such a far off idea — but 2008 seems like an eon ago.  And now, following allegations that Spacey made sexual advances toward Anthony Rapp when Rapp was a minor (Spacey was 26, Rapp was 14), his prestigious star power has started to fall. TV Line was the first to report this Spacey edit; only one mention was made of Spacey, and it wasn’t a big plot point of the episode. NBC and 20th Century Fox (the production companies behind the series) issued a statement to press who received the episode early, explaining:  ""In light of recent events, the producers have decided to remove the brief reference to Kevin Spacey.""  So once again, either This Is Us has some foresight they’re not sharing with us, or the NBC series is just really good at making references.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,461

I know what you're thinking: What is ""Scooby Doo Papa""? It's an infectious Latin dance track that's become viral thanks to two social media sensations.  New York-based artist DJ Kass released ""Scooby Doo Papa"" back in September, but it didn't catch fire until YouTubers Lele Pons and Inanna Sarkis featured the song in two Instagram videos, according to The Daily Mail. The two social media stars created a dance routine to go along with ""Scooby Doo Papa,"" which they showed off in their first video posted to Instagram back in December. It became an internet sensation in Latin America, and now has finally reached the United States, The Daily Mail reported.  Lele Pons, who has more than 22 million Instagram followers, posted the second video in January (Sarkis has more than seven million Instagram followers). Together, both videos have racked up more than 58 million views, according to E! News.  In both of the videos, the Instagram stars are dressed up as Daphne Blake and Velma Dinkley from the original Scooby Doo gang. Pons couldn't keep a straight face in the first video, which shows the duo having fun dancing around in a kitchen. The second video has a bit more production, with a crew of backup dancers supporting Sarkis, who took on the Velma persona.  And their fans are loving ""Scooby Doo Papa."" On the December video, one Instagram user commented on Sarkis' expression, saying ""your face, damn love you so much."" Another wrote, ""Goofy dancing... check.""  The video Pons posted to her Instagram account in January received an equal amount of love from her fans and other social media users alike. One Instagram user wrote, ""This is so funny I can't,"" in all caps. Another called the video ""the funniest."" And others commented on how much they love the song by DJ Kass, who was born in the Dominican Republic.  But Pons and Sarkis aren't the only ones dancing to ""Scooby Doo Papa."" Search YouTube, and you'll find a ton of videos of people moving to DJ Kass's hit song. Mexican television hosts, Peru's National Police Department, and students have all filmed themselves dancing the ""Scooby Doo Papa"" routine, according to The Daily Mail.  As a native New Yorker, it's awesome to see music from a New York-based DJ exploding online. DJ Kass is popular in clubs in the city, particularly in the Bronx, where is based, according to his website. The 26-year-old father comes from a line of DJs; his father was a popular local DJ, too.

""It’s how I celebrated my coming-out, actually,"" Rau told Playboy in an accompanying interview. ""I took that chance, and then I signed with an agency.""  And even for someone as strong and confident as Rau, living as her true self didn’t come easily. As she told Playboy, ""I lived a long time without saying I was transgender.

Our hearts are broken, but we will never forget the nine months she graced this pained planet with her radiance. #giamarieforever,” she continued, sharing the sad news alongside a series of photos of her sphynx cat.  In another emotional post, Dunham, 32, went on to reveal that after coming home to find Gia “limp and wheezing,” the cat died in her arms while being rushed to the vet.  “Yesterday I was due at work at 8am. Showed up, watched rehearsal, drank my Starbucks, chill times. But at 8:15 I started to feel sick. Chills, sore throat, rapid descent. So I told Jenni I had to go home. Now. It just felt urgent. I walked in the door and found Gia limp and wheezing. She died in my arms at 9:15 as we rushed to the vet. She called me home. I’m so glad I listened,” she explained.

The positive effect Gia Maria Carangi has had on my mental health cannot be overestimated,” she captioned a photo of the pair.  Earlier this year, the writer and actress also gave the cat a special “woman crush wednesday” shoutout, writing, “#WCW #2 is Gia Marie Carangi the cat in her new angora lewk (she cares not what you feel about her nude belly. Like mama like baby.)”  Last year, Dunham found herself embroiled in some doggy drama after sharing that she and then-boyfriend Jack Antonoff had decided to re-home their dog Lamby, following “four years of challenging behavior and aggression.”  The writer experienced a backlash on social media, some of which centered on her claim that her dog’s behavioral issues were caused by “terrible abuse” Lamby suffered in the past. Robert Vazquez, a spokesperson for the shelter that Dunham adopted Lamby from, went on to say that the dog “wasn’t crazy” when Dunham adopted him.  However, Dunham’s dog trainer Matt Beisner, came to her defense. “She was at her wit’s end,” he said.

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.

Rumors are flying that the two have been hanging out ‘as more than friends’ and you’ve got to see the details!  Nina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom caused the Internet to have a freakout when they were spotted leaving The Promise premiere in LA together on Thursday, Apr. 12. The 28 year-old Vampire Dairies stunner has reportedly been spending some time with the 40 year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star and not just as buddies! “They’ve known each other for a while,” a source told PEOPLE, “recently they’ve been hanging out as more than friends.”  Try not to get too excited just yet though because things are still reportedly in the early stages between them. “It’s super casual,” the insider added and pointed out Orlando attended a Coachella party on Friday night with a woman who was not Nina. The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!

fba232e6-c854-4e44-8167-7e96e9b3cb40,"Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace f t # e Washington, DC, August 1, 2013 | (202-225-3001) In a letter sent today to U.S. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius led by Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-21), the Florida Democratic delegation in the House of Representatives slammed Governor Rick Scott and the Florida legislature for stripping the state of the authority to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums and called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a more active role in reviewing rates in Florida. The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years.In the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are “not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high…. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.”Joining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below.August 1, 2013The Honorable Kathleen SebeliusSecretaryU.S. Department of Health and Human Services200 Independence Ave., SWWashington, DC 20201RE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium RatesDear Secretary Sebelius,It has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State.As you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now.As of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates.Unfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Florida’s Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMS’s determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers.Indeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.Over 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Florida’s new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.While other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.The Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. f t # eRelated News Deutch, FL Dems ask Gov.

Crews, who played for teams including the Los Angeles Rams, the San Diego Chargers and the Washington Redskins and appears in the sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, recounted the incident via a series of tweets.  The 49-year-old said he was prompted to share his story in the wake of the ongoing Harvey Weinstein scandal. “This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME,” he wrote.  Film producer Weinstein has been accused of sexual assault or harassment by multiple women, including Asia Argento, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie.

He said that he was tempted to retaliate, but was worried how the incident would be reported and feared he would go to jail. “‘240 lbs. Black Man stomps out Hollywood Honcho’ would be the headline the next day,” he wrote.  Crews said the executive later called to apologise, but did not give a reason for his actions. Crews chose not to publicise the incident for fear of being ostracised. “Par [for] the course when the predator has power [and] influence”, he wrote.  The actor said his experience had helped him “understand and empathize with those who have remained silent”. “But Harvey Weinstein is not the only perpetrator,” he added. Crews also expressed hope that, by making his experience public, he would “deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless”.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,463

She want’s everyone there to make sure they are on the same page. Part of the meeting will be to brainstorm ways to help Rob, but another part will definitely be so Kris can make sure everyone is on message.”  Rob’s recent behavior is definitely scaring the family, so they understand the urgency of Kris’ calls.  “Rob has become progressively more and more anti social.

55bd9eed-656d-4ab2-87a5-c9b7562641ed,"High-powered stars from pop (Miley Cyrus), R&B (Mary J. Blige), country (Miranda Lambert) and rock (the Killers) will take part in twin tribute albums for Elton John and Bernie Taupin. Revamp and Restoration are due out on April 6th.  “It’s always a huge compliment when an artist loves your song enough to take the time and effort to rework it,” Elton John said in a statement. “As songwriters, Bernie and myself are thrilled when singers we admire and respect as much as those on Revamp and Restoration choose to add their own unique twist in the process. It means that our music is still relevant and ultimately that our songs continue to reach new audiences.”  John and Taupin enlisted an impressively varied group of singers to interpret their work: The albums’ track lists also include Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Q-Tip, Dolly Parton, Chris Stapleton and Willie Nelson.  That eclecticism gives John and Taupin a chance to remind listeners of their musical range. “From day one we borrowed from everything that’s good about American music – whether it’s blues, country, gospel, pop, pure rock – everything got thrown in the mix,” Taupin noted. “… It would be tiring if you just got stuck in one niche your entire career, especially when it’s one as long as ours.”  That long career is now beginning to wind down: In January, John announced that he planned to retire from the road. Before he does so, he will embark on one massive final tour. He’ll start performing at arenas around North America in September.  Revamp Track List  1. “Bennie and the Jets” – Elton John, P!nk, Logic  2. “We All Fall in Love Sometimes” – Coldplay  3. “I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues” – Alessia Cara  4. “Candle in the Wind” – Ed Sheeran  5. “Tiny Dancer “- Florence And The Machine  6. “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” – Mumford and Sons  7. “Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word” – Mary J.

b8ba0935-e7c5-41a7-a725-53407bb4c6b6,"You know by now that Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are engaged to be married. What you probably don’t know is that this was a long time coming. And that may seem surprising given how intense Bieber’s love for Selena Gomez has been all these years. Bieber and Gomez dated on and off from 2011 to 2015, and they reunited briefly in the spring of 2018. So, Bieber’s engagement news is a shock to the system for many Jelena fans around the world. Despite their obvious draw to each other, there were plenty of signs that Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez weren't meant to last.  All the tell-tale signs have been there all along. It’s just that fans (and probably even Bieber and Gomez themselves) were totally blind to them. Naturally, fans want to root for young love, which Bieber and Gomez shared. And it’s very likely that the two pop stars were so struck by their puppy love that they couldn’t quite see the end coming.  But the end did come. And now Bieber is engaged and Gomez is out here living her best life.  Since all this has been moving so fast and there’s so much to keep up with, I’ve dug around a little to understand why Bieber and Gomez didn’t last.  Jason Merritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Here are all the signs that were staring Jelena fans in the face for years:  1. Bieber and Gomez’s Love Was Young & Impatient  Even Bieber said so himself. In a 2015 interview with Complex magazine, Bieber explained that his relationship with Gomez was “too much” to handle at such a young age:  I moved in with my girlfriend when I was 18. Started my own life with her. It was a marriage kind of thing. Living with a girl, it was just too much at that age. But we were so in love. Nothing else mattered. We were all about each other. But when it’s like that and you get your value from that, people will always disappoint you. Your girl or your dude, they’re always going to disappoint you.  He also told the magazine that he felt his identity was wrapped up in Gomez and that the relationship wasn’t as ideal as everyone might have thought it was:  Your full identity can't be in that person. My identity was in her. Her identity was in me. When stuff would happen, I would lose my freakin' mind, and she would lose her mind, and we would fight so hard because we were so invested in each other.  And on top of all that, he explained that for him, love was a conscious choice he had to make time and time again:  Love is a choice. Love is not a feeling. People have made it seem in movies that it's this fairy tale. That's not what love is. You're not gonna want to love your girl sometimes but you're gonna choose to love her. That's something in life that I had to figure out.  So, the Bieber-Gomez relationship was definitely not all it was cracked up to be, even back in 2012 when they were living together.  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  2. They Resorted To Dramatics During Their Breakups  It’s definitely no secret that Bieber and Gomez would break up only to make up. It happened countless times, and that’s definitely a sign that they weren’t sure about where the relationship was going. They just couldn’t make up their minds about whether they wanted to be together or not.  To add to that, they often resorted to dramatics during their breakups, which says it all, really.  For example, when Bieber was spotted out in Paris with Kendall Jenner back in 2014, Gomez took to Twitter to vent, as some fans took it.  On another occasion, in August 2016, Gomez decided to weigh in on Bieber’s then relationship with Sofia Richie.  Here’s how it went down: Bieber was posting photos of Richie on Instagram only to receive backlash from fans for moving on from his relationship with Gomez.  Then, Gomez reportedly commented on an Instagram photo with the following: “If you can't handle the hate then stop posting pictures of your girlfriend lol – it should be special between you two only. Don't be mad at your fans. They love you.”  So, there seems to have been some drama surrounding their breakups, which isn’t a good look at all. Nevermind the fact that this kind of behavior is unhealthy for everyone involved.  3. Baldwin Was Always In Justin's Life  Even though Bieber’s relationship with Baldwin seemed to come out of nowhere, it makes total sense that they would end up together. The two have known each other for years.  Back in 2014, Baldwin told E! News that she and Bieber have always been close.  “I've known him since I was so young — since I was 13 — and we've just been good friends over the years,"" she said.  That good friendship turned more romantic in 2016, but their fling died down pretty quickly. According to Bieber, it was because he didn’t want to ruin a good thing.  In February 2016, Bieber told GQ magazine that Baldwin was important enough for him to wait for the right time to be with her:  I know that in the past I've hurt people and said things that I didn't mean to make them happy in the moment. So now I'm just more so looking at the future, making sure I'm not damaging them. What if Hailey ends up being the girl I'm gonna marry, right? If I rush into anything, if I damage her, then it's always gonna be damaged. It's really hard to fix wounds like that. It's so hard … I just don't want to hurt her.  So, Bieber had ideas of marriage even back then, which puts his subsequent reconciliation with Gomez into a completely different perspective. Maybe it was never about trying to make his relationship with Gomez work. Maybe it was about figuring out his feelings and deciding whether Gomez was the one over Baldwin.  In any case, Bieber and Gomez didn't last, and now there's the Bieber-Baldwin wedding to look forward to. Exciting times!",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1234

7daff0d5-8245-43d2-a8e7-fc018c035bbe,"Some reports suggest Ben Affleck and girlfriend Lindsay Shookus' relationship may have been going on even while they were still married to their respective spouses.  A source tells ET that Affleck first saw Shookus while he was still married to Jennifer Garner, and Shookus was married to Kevin Miller -- a fellow Saturday Night Live producer. According to the source, Affleck and Shookus were seeing one another as far back as late 2014, months before news broke that he had an alleged fling with his children's nanny, Christine Ouzounian. Affleck's reported dalliance with the nanny happened in the summer of 2015, and was short-lived, our source says.  However, a source close to 44-year-old Affleck disputes that the actor and Shookus got together while both were married, although the two were friendly. The source says the two got romantic after his separation from Garner in 2015.  WATCH: 6 Things We Know About Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus  Let's take a look back at Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship timeline.    2013:    According to People, Affleck and Shookus started seeing one another in 2013, two years before Affleck and 45-year-old Garner announced their separation. Affleck last appeared on SNL in May 2013.  Interestingly enough, Garner made an appearance during Affleck's monologue at the time, to celebrate the actor hosting the show for the fifth time. The two joked about Affleck's Best Picture acceptance speech for Argo at the Oscars, in which he said that his and Garner's marriage took ""work."" Affleck publicly thanked Garner for all her support onstage, and the two sweetly shared a kiss.  One month later, eyewitnesses reportedly spotted Affleck and Shookus looking flirty at The Heat premiere after-party in NYC.  ""He definitely looked interested in her,"" a partygoer told People at the time. The two later left together with other friends and headed to the nearby Mandarin Oriental hotel bar.  Over the years, their relationship allegedly continued, though a source close to Affleck says the two did not get romantic until after his separation from Garner in 2015.  Affleck and Shookus ""full-on had an affair,"" claims a source cited by People. ""They would fly back and forth, but he would mostly visit her in New York. They didn't hide.""  ""Both of them were married at the time. They were having secret rendezvous every time he came in to New York City and other places, too,"" claims a second source the magazine quotes. ""Both of them were cheating on their spouses so they were very careful about it,"" the source alleges.  X17online.com  According to Us Weekly, the romance began just a few months after Shookus became a mom to her daughter with Miller. ""[Affleck and Shookus] were sleeping together, sending each other cute texts and meeting up whenever they could,"" an insider close to Garner and Affleck reportedly claims to the outlet.    2015:    According to Us Weekly, Garner and Miller found out about the Affleck and Shookus' alleged relationship at the same time in 2015.  ""They were devastated when they found out about the affair,"" a source claims according to the magazine.  However, a source close to Affleck tells Us Weekly, ""Lindsay was not what led to the end of their marriage. They had a ton of other problems.""    June 2015 -- Affleck and Garner separate    Affleck and Garner announced their split on June 30, 2015.  ""After much thought and careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to divorce,"" the two said in their joint statement to ET. ""We go forward with love and friendship for one another and a commitment to co-parenting our children whose privacy we ask to be respected during this difficult time. This will be our only comment on this private, family matter. Thank you for understanding.""    July 2015 -- The nanny scandal      Us Weekly broke the story on July 29, claiming that Affleck had secretly been dating Ouzounian, and that the two frequently texted and emailed after she was let go as his children's nanny.  Earlier that month, Ouzounian tipped off the paparazzi, telling them she'd be at the L.A.-area rental house that Affleck was staying in at the time, a source later told ET. The former nanny was seen smiling wide as she handed Affleck a bottle of champagne during their late-night meetup. She also arrived at Affleck's in his Lexus, which she had also been seen driving earlier in the day while running errands.  Affleck's rep slammed the reports, telling ET that ""all allegations of a romantic relationship are baseless and untrue"" and that they are considering legal options. ""The story is complete garbage and full of lies,"" his rep stated.    April 2017 -- Garner and Affleck officially file for divorce    Affleck and Garner legally filed for divorce in April 2017, after a two-year separation. Still, the pair have made it clear that their three children -- Violet, Seraphina and Samuel -- remain their priority.  Just one month earlier, Affleck thanked Garner for her support after announcing that he had just completed treatment for alcohol addiction.  ""I'm lucky to have the love of my family and friends, including my co-parent, Jen, who has supported me and cared for our kids as I've done the work I set out to do,"" he wrote in his statement on Facebook.    July 2017 -- Affleck steps out with Shookus    Affleck was photographed with Shookus for the first time on July 6, when the two had dinner at Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Los Angeles.  A source tells ET that Affleck's new relationship works ""really well,"" because Shookus ""has had experience with the Hollywood world.""  ""[She] knows what is expected of Ben, and how much of their relationship they can share publicly,"" the source explains. ""It puts Ben at ease knowing that Lindsay understands who he is. They have kept their relationship very low key and private.""  Another source also tells ET that much like Affleck and Garner, Shookus and her ex -- whom she married in 2010 -- are also ""extremely amicable.""    ""They live separately but are extremely amicable,"" the source says of Miller and Shookus, who met during Shookus' first day at SNL in 2002. ""They split a while ago. They realized that they were stronger as friends.""  ""It's not uncommon, even now, to see them together getting coffee in the building, talking in the hallways, grabbing lunch, visiting each other on different floors,"" the source claims, adding that the pair are such good friends that Miller -- now a supervising producer on Late Night With Seth Meyers -- knew Shookus was dating Affleck before news broke of the relationship.  WATCH: EXCLUSIVE -- Ben Affleck's New Girlfriend Lindsay Shookus Split From Husband 'A While Ago,' Source Says  Meanwhile, the source describes Shookus as ""an extremely nice, normal person.""

Jenner is already a mother six times over and a grandmother to eight beautiful infants, most recently welcoming Chicago and Stormi to the family.  But reports suggest that the famous Momager is looking to adopt a five-year-old boy with her boyfriend Corey Gamble.

Earlier this month, Jenner quipped that her “favourite child” changes every day but Khloé Kardashian – who is expecting her first child – was at the top of the list.

33b95ccb-3384-4b18-9916-95f384d49b14,"With Stephen Colbert at the helm, the 2017 Emmys was always going to be a cornucopia of comedy. And because so many social and political issues are being passionately fought, it wasn't surprising that many of the award winners spoke out about what was important to them once they took the stage. Here are the best, funniest, most controversial, and most important moments from TV's night of nights.  1. Sean Spicer showed up.  Look, he's still terrible. And there's no universe in which this was a totally great move. But my jaw legitimately dropped (just like Sarah Hyland's and Anna Chlumsky's) when the former White House press secretary wheeled that lectern out onto the stage. Trump's reign truly is a televisual one.  Giphy  2. Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård KISSED.  Skarsgård won Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for Big Little Lies, and his co-star Nicole Kidman gave him a congratulatory peck on the lips as he approached the stage. FYI, this is how I'll be greeting all handsome men from now on, too.  GIPHY  3. Kate McKinnon gave Hillary Clinton a shout-out.  While accepting her Outstanding Supporting Actress award, McKinnon made sure to thank her SNL muse, presidential candidate Clinton, for her ""grace and grit.""  4. Stephen Colbert glitched.  One of the most fun skits was Colbert's Westworld ""Host"" reveal. It was pitch perfect, political, and silly. But also...does he not have a butt???  5. Alec Baldwin said that doing Donald Trump impressions is pretty good birth control.  The Saturday Night Live actor thanked his wife when accepting his Outstanding Supporting Actor award, noting that they didn't have a child while he was portraying Trump on the sketch show. Was that because of the orange wig? Probs.  6. Ann Dowd gave an incredibly emotional speech from the heart.  Already teary when she reached the stage, the Handmaid's Tale actress, who scored Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, delivered one of the most moving speeches of the night. But when she thanked the show's streaming home—""They're very lovely, Hulu""—we all melted into a pool of tears along with her.  7. Can an Emmy award be nominated for an Emmy award?  Because that's what we think RuPaul deserves for her tutting, gossipy portrayal of the Emmy statuette itself. ""Honey, get out your China because I'm ready to spill the tea, okay?"" Any time, Mama Ru.  Giphy  8. We had no idea we wanted a 9 to 5 reunion SO badly.  But now we can't believe we ever lived without it. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda gave us a good dream to wish for every night when they came together on stage to present the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie award. Plus, they pointed out some pretty disappointing parallels between their iconic movie and the present day: ""We still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot!""  9. Laura Dern.  That's it. Just Laura Dern. Put her in the Met.  10. Lena Waithe became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing.  She and her Master of None co-writer Aziz Ansari received a standing ovation for their notable achievement, awarded for the episode ""Thanksgiving,"" which focuses on Waithe's character Denise as she comes out to her family. ""Oh, Jesus, let me reclaim my time, give me a second,"" Waithe said. ""My LGBTQIA family, I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers.""  11. Jackie Hoffman pretended to lose it when someone else won the award.  Jackie Hoffman, who gave a memorable turn as Mamacita in Feud, gave another great performance when Laura Dern won the award they were both up for. Good old-fashioned shenanigans—we'll never tire of them.  Best moment of the #Emmys so far: Jackie Hoffman yelling ""dammit!!"" when she lost to Laura Dern pic.twitter.com/euCWaRFsAy — Adam Feldman (@FeldmanAdam) September 18, 2017  12. Nicole Kidman won an award, and used the moment to speak out about domestic abuse.  As Big Little Lies' Celeste, a woman whose husband is physically and emotionally abusive, Kidman delivered one of her most memorable performances. So it was no surprise that she chose to talk about the cause when she accepted her Outstanding Lead Actress award: ""We shone a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know. It is filled with shame and secrecy, and by you acknowledging me with this award, it shines a light on it even more.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,925
b544bef6-936e-405e-82a9-8357e2117f2f,"It's been over a year since we first learned that Sofia Richie is dating Scott Disick.  It's one of those relationships that's tough to wrap your head around, and not just because of the massive age gap.  Sure, Scott is 15 years Sofia's senior, but that wouldn't be so strange if they were 40 and 55.  At 20 and 35, however, it's a little odd.  Here, we have a woman who can't even legally purchase a cocktail in a serious relationship with a man who has three kids by his baby mama -- who's been famous since Sofia was in grade school.  It's an unusual situation, to put it mildly.  And now that Kourtney Kardashian has dumped Younes Bendjima, the whole scenario might get even weirder.  You see, rumor has it that Sofia feels threatened by Kourtney.  Sources say she's constantly worried about Scott leaving her to try and make his family whole again.  And now that Kourtney is back on the market, her concerns might be justified.  “Sofia is furious that Scott and Kourtney are hanging out again,” one insider tells In Touch Weekly.  “She understands that they have to remain civil for the kids but has become convinced that Kourtney is trying to steal back her man.""  Sofia is reportedly so worried about the situation that she's taken steps to try and ensure that  ""She recently reached out to her and told her to back off,"" says the source.  As for the Lord himself, it seems Scott feels that he's stuck between a rock and a hard place.  “Scott’s caught in the middle,” the insider claims.  “He loves Sofia but will always have a soft spot for Kourtney.”  Those who know Scott best say that as much as he's enamored with Sofia, those feelings will eventually go stale, and he'll come running back to Kourtney.  In fact, Scott recently revealed that he's considered reconciling with Kourtney.  ""We always said we'd try to get back together when we're 40,"" he said on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  Considering Kourtney is currently 39, Sofia may have real cause for concern.  Hopefully, if the relationship fizzles, she'll quickly realize she dodged a bullet by not ending up with Scott.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,444
49516fdf-dc4a-43df-9f7c-a25b01709038,"Dave Chappelle stopped by The Late Show on Wednesday to discuss his August residency at Radio City Music Hall and revisit his famous Saturday Night Live monologue from last November. At the time, the comedian said he was willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.  “It’s not like I wanted to give him a chance that night,” Chappelle clarified to Colbert “[But] I feel like a lot of white Americans finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans every cycle.”  Chappelle believes Americans will not only weather Trump’s presidency, he suggested that his policies will create better voters. “In the last six months I think we’re all getting an education about the presidency,” Chappelle added. “I don’t know that I’ve ever heard in the popular discourse people discussing ethics this much. And I didn’t even realize how ethics were necessarily supposed to work at that level of government, and he’s putting all this stuff on the forefront.  “I think [Trump]’s gonna make a more informed and better voter,” Chappelle said. “He’s a polarizing dude. He’s like a bad DJ at a good party.”  Last November, just days after Trump’s election win, Chappelle delivered a remarkable opening monologue on Saturday Night Live. The comedian remembered attending a White House party – where the majority of the revelers were black – during the final weeks of President Obama’s tenure. “I saw how happy everybody was,” he recalled. “These people who had been historically disenfranchised. It made me feel hopeful and it made me feel proud to be an American and it made me very happy about the prospects of our country.”  “In that spirit,” he continued, “I’m wishing Donald Trump luck. And I’m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too.”  Chappelle is performing at Radio City Music Hall for much of August.

2db0041a-6ed0-43b2-ae4d-c687ef9e44ca,"Fans of Kylie Jenner are used to the makeup mogul sharing her every move on social media. Unfortunately, one of her newest stories probably should have come with a spoiler alert.  Fans of The Handmaid's Tale might be a little disappointed that Kylie may have unintentionally posted a major spoiler from the series on her Story. Quit reading now if you haven't yet made it through the second season.  Thanks to Kylie, some viewers caught a glimpse of a family photo from the series that featured Fred and Serena with a baby. The picture would obviously mean that Offred aka June (Elisabeth Moss) had her child, and that the baby ended up in the custody of the couple, not June.  The picture came just as Kylie attended the show's finale party , though it was oddly enough the only Handmaids -related content posted by the star. The decision to the post the picture has drawn mixed reactions, including ""What is Kylie Jenner trying to tell us by Instagramming this creepy portrait from the Handmaid’s Tale?"" and ""Wow If you're only a couple episodes into a Handmaid's Tale don't watch Kylie's story.""  One follower couldn't even believe that Kylie had been the one to spoil the show, tweeting , ""I haven’t finished s2 of Handmaid’s tale yet and Kylie Jenner just dropped a spoiler out of all places to see a spoiler ffs I’ve been avoiding everywhere."" Thankfully, this Twitter user found a way to laugh about the incident, writing, ""Big mood is Kylie Jenner posting the complete family portrait of The Waterford’s from The Handmaid’s Tale on her IG story.""  Although some viewers were rightfully a little upset, others definitely enjoyed the idea that they shared a binge-watch favorite with the celeb. ""TIL that Kylie Jenner also watches The Handmaid’s Tale so she won some cool points,"" one person shared. And one Twitter follower could even relate to the Kylie's love of the show, tweeting , ""Kylie fangirling over The Handmaid’s Tale is me af.""  Whether Kylie secretly meant anything by the photo or she was just excited to be at the premiere remains unclear, but as Noah Schnapp of Stranger Things recently demonstrated, sometimes, spoilers just happen.

During her speech, Janet spoke about how her parents encouraged and supported her hugely successful career.

8ab2c3f8-3c27-44ba-8a01-0a0400cf00ef,"Billy Bush‘s wife Sydney Davis has filed for divorce after months of separation.  Davis cited irreconcilable differences and asked for joint legal custody and primary physical custody of two of their children, according to TMZ.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She is also requesting spousal support, the outlet reported. The two have three children together: Josie, 19; Mary, 17; and Lillie, 13.  A rep for Bush did not immediately respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment.  The estranged couple married in April 1998 but announced their separation in September 2017 in a statement to PEOPLE: “After almost 20 years of marriage, they have separated for the moment to evaluate their life together. They love each other and their children deeply and are committed to a bright future.”  Billy Bush and Sydney Davis John M. Heller/Getty  Bush’s lawyer, Marshall Grossman, also confirmed their separation to PEOPLE at the time, saying the two were “on a short-term break.”  Their split came nearly a year after Bush was abruptly fired from the Today show after a videotape was leaked to The Washington Post, in which then-Apprentice host Donald Trump bragged to Bush about groping women.  RELATED: Billy Bush Opens Up About Rebuilding His Life After the Trump Scandal Destroyed His Career  In January, Bush spoke to PEOPLE about the impact the scandal had on his career and marriage.  “I was ashamed and embarrassed,” he said at the time. “And then I went through stages of grieving because I lost my career. For a man, that’s the ultimate degradation.”  Billy Bush with Sydney Davis and daughters Josie, Mary and Lillie Billy Bush/Instagram  The release of the tapes completely blindsided him.  “I was a happy-go-lucky guy,” Bush said. “Everything is going great and I was like, ‘Hey, this is awesome!’ And then, kaboom.”  RELATED: Billy Bush and Wife Sydney Davis Separating After Nearly 20 Years of Marriage  Despite Bush and Davis struggling at the time, he remained hopeful that their marriage could “find its next leg” even after they experienced “difficulties” even before he began working at Today.  “We got married young and had our first child right away,” he said at the time. “We’re taking a step back.

NBC has defeated its ABC rival “Good Morning America” every week since Mr. Lauer was removed, something it had not done for four consecutive weeks in more than five years.  The “Today” lead has narrowed — the program averaged around 4.4 million viewers the week before Christmas, about 54,000 viewers more than “G.M.A.” — and there is some uncertainty whether the lead is sustainable. Further, all three morning shows experienced rating drops last year.  A surprise boon from an emergency host isn’t new at NBC. When Brian Williams was suspended for six months in 2015 from his evening newscast after he was caught embellishing stories about a Middle East reporting assignment, Lester Holt replaced him and the show’s viewership figures were strong. Mr. Holt became the permanent replacement later that year.  Likewise, the departures of Charlie Rose from “CBS This Morning” and Mr. O’Reilly from Fox News after public allegations of sexual misconduct have done little to disrupt either network. Fox News is still No. 1 among cable news networks in prime time, and the ratings for “CBS This Morning” have held steady while Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell continue in Mr. Rose’s absence. (CBS has not yet hired a replacement.)  Ms. Kotb cut her teeth as a local reporter and anchor, including a six-year stint for the CBS affiliate in New Orleans.

5499782f-90eb-4735-ba8c-6e010d12a3e5,"Miranda Lambert still has a lot to get off her chest. On June 19 — two years after writing about her painful divorce from Blake Shelton on her double album, The Weight of These Wings — she again opened up about the split in an interview released on the website HITS Daily Double. She admitted that Blake — who blindsided her in 2015 when he ended their marriage and pushed her out of the town where they’d built a life — broke her heart. Going through a divorce so publicly made her ""feel so alone.... I feel like I’ve captured the seven stages of grief [on the album],"" she revealed. ""But it took me 24 songs to get there.""  Grief is an understatement. Miranda, 34, was devastated when Blake, 42, suddenly left her and took up with his fellow Voice coach Gwen Stefani, 48, just months later, sources tell In Touch. ""She wears her heartbreak like a badge. The cold-blooded way Blake broke her heart, cut her out of his life and shoved his romance with Gwen in her face is something that will scar her forever,"" says one source. ""Blake really put her through hell, and she’s letting people know it.""  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  When the ""Go Ahead and Break My Heart"" singer told Miranda it was over, he essentially booted her from their ranch and from Tishomingo, Okla., where Miranda was a thriving business owner. ""In a matter of days, she was sent packing. She didn’t know what hit her,"" says the source reveals to In Touch. ""She became more distraught when rumors spread that she’d cheated with a number of men and Blake did nothing to stop it. It was a nightmare for her.""  In reality, the marriage had soured as their careers skyrocketed and took them on the road separately for long stretches. ""They became strangers,"" says the source. ""She lost trust in him, and he became suspicious of her. She knew the marriage was in trouble but somehow she always thought they could come together and save it.""  Blake didn’t feel the same way. But he says he, too, was heartbroken when the marriage ended. ""I... hit rock bottom just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating,"" he said in a June 24 interview, just five days after Miranda’s candid interview came out. Miranda’s continued discussion of the split bothers Blake, says a friend: ""He feels like he’s being villainized. Blake is done with Miranda writing and talking about the divorce.""  But Miranda isn’t done singing about it. When she tours with Little Big Town this summer — beginning in Charlotte, N.C., on July 12 — the country megastar ""will be featuring the songs prominently,” reveals the source, adding that even though Miranda has happily moved on with Turnpike Troubadours frontman Evan Felker, ""Blake’s a big part of her confessional songs and is going to be for a long time to come."" Miranda will keep speaking out, says the source, ""and if Blake's reputation takes a beating along the way. he's getting what he's long deserved.""

The newlyweds tied the knot during a romantic beachside wedding in Curacao on Sunday, May 14, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.  The Atlanta Falcons linebacker, 32, and reality star exchanged vows at sunset before some 100 guests.  “I really wanted to pick a place that no one I knew had been before … so it would be an experience not just for me and Phil, but for everyone,” Roberts told Us of the location ahead of their big day. “The island is close to Aruba, but closer to Venezuela and South America and it’s only a two-hour flight from Miami. It was perfect.”  The bride wore two dresses for her big day: During the ceremony she opted for a Milady-designed mermaid gown, which featured bling everywhere, and for the reception, she changed into a Lena Bernisha-designed dress with a detachable train.  “I wanted to be able to dance the night away,” Roberts told Us.  Their beach-glam wedding also featured lots of candles and gold touches.  “Everything is very formal beach glamour, it’s a beach wedding, but still very glam,” Roberts told Us of her vision. “Lots of bling, candles everywhere and gold touches.”  The couple got engaged during a November 2016 episode of the hit E! show.

64e73452-d9ca-409e-a029-d6a36a6b8cac,"Dean McDermott Net Worth: Dean McDermott is a Canadian-American actor who has a net worth of $500 thousand. Dean McDermott earned his net worth through his many roles in movies and TV. He was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is the husband of Tori Spelling. McDermott reached the peak of his fame in the mid 1990's when he was considered to be the greatest screen heartthrob. Having appeared in more than 30 movies and 15 TV productions, he is best known for his portrayal of Constable Turnbull on the TV series Due South (CTV, 1995-96) and for his intriguing performance in Lives of Girls and Women (CBC Television, 1994). However, he first rose to fame for his whirlwind affair with actress Tori Spelling, which instantly hit the headlines since both of them were still married at the time. Once they split from their spouses, Dean and Tori tied the knot a month after they met in 2006. Next, the newlywed couple found fresh fame into the reality series Tori & Dean: Inn Love (Oxygen, 2007-08) and Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood (Oxygen, 2008- ). The success of these two shows led McDermott to became a household name and to gain a whole new legion of fans. As of recent, he was the winner of Team Guy on the second season of Food Network's Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off. He hosted the first two seasons of Chopped Canada on Food Network Canada. Spelling and McDermott are still together and have four children.  Financial Situation: In October 2013, Tori made the shocking announcement that she was broke and had squandered away every penny she had ever made to the point where she was borrowing money from her mother to pay rent and could not afford a simple medical procedure for her husband. Spelling claimed to have blown through every dollar she ever made acting or inherited from her late father (an estimated $15 – $20 million). In an interview, Spelling claimed to have blown through millions of dollars on failed real estate investments and lavish purchases for her family. When asked about her exact net worth Tori replied ""I don't have one million dollars. We had some income here and there, but no savings apart from our retirement accounts."" To be fair, Tori's husband Dean clarified her statements the next day by telling US Magazine that ""Right now things are going well. Tori and I are doing just fine financially"". In March 2017, City National Bank filed a lawsuit against Tori and Dean after they failed to pay off $200,000 out of a $400,000 loan. City National also claims that Tori overdrew $17,000 from her checking account. Meanwhile, while that lawsuit was going on Dean was also being sued by his ex for $100,000 in owed child support. A few months earlier the couple was sued by American Express for $87,000 in credit card debt and $260,000 in unpaid taxes.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,563

The Property Brothers star proposed to longtime girlfriend Linda Phan at the Toronto restaurant Piano Piano, and PEOPLE can exclusively announce the pair are engaged.  “I’ve never met another woman like her and once you do, you want to be with her forever,” Scott, 38, tells PEOPLE of Phan, 31.  Scott has been planning the elaborate surprise for weeks, and was determined to keep his new fiancé off his trail as he coordinated every over-the-top moment. “I’ve had to be as stealthy as a ninja to pull this off,” he says. Scott even admitted he’s been carrying the ring around with him for weeks and has kept all planning offline so Phan couldn’t possibly come across any details accidentally.  The HGTV star, who has released two country singles with brother Jonathan, recently snuck off to New York City to record his own version of the Train song “Marry Me.” During tonight’s dinner, he arranged for the restaurant to play the track while he and Phan were having dinner, which cued the staff to bring out a cake decorated with illustrations from one of Phan’s favorite books, Dr. Seuss’s Oh the Places You’ll Go, tweaked to read “Oh the Places We’ll Go,” as a nod to their continuing journey together.  The festivities continued after dinner with a surprise engagement party at a nearby venue that Phan had been led to believe was a company holiday party.

Kidman is wearing a light blue suit with a stunning head piece.  In March 2017, Kidman confirmed she was playing Aquaman’s mother in “Aquaman,” and there was a simple reason as to why she wanted to take on the role.

If there is one thing I have to do in my life, I have to be that. Because, you’ve got to have some fun.”  Her role in the DC film marks her return to the superhero franchise — the last time she starred in a movie like that was in 1995’s “Batman Forever,” when she played Bruce Wayne’s girlfriend, Dr. Chase Meridian.

f62bb703-3443-4db0-82cb-f08f9e26b9fb,"A body found Thursday night is that of missing Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison, police in Scotland confirmed Friday. The body was discovered about 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday (12:30 p.m. PT) in Port Edgar, Queensferry, just west of Edinburgh, the Scottish capital.  No official cause of death was given. A statement from Hutchison’s family, issued Friday afternoon by Police Scotland, said the singer had been struggling with mental health problems.  “As a family, we are utterly devastated with the tragic loss of our beloved Scott,” the statement said. “Despite his disappearance, and the recent concerns over his mental health, we had all remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself. Scott, like many artists, wore his heart on his sleeve and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts.”  The family said Hutchison had “battled bravely with his own issues” for many years. “Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you,” the statement said. “We are immensely proud of [Scott] for being so open with his struggles. His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.”  The 36-year-old singer and guitarist was reported missing early Wednesday, and was last seen near the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry. Hutchison had issued a tweet Tuesday night referring to his life in the past tense: “Be so good to everyone you love….I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me.” Twenty minutes later, his final, poignant tweet simply said: “I’m away now. Thanks.”  Be so good to everyone you love. It’s not a given. I’m so annoyed that it’s not. I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  I’m away now. Thanks. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  Hutchison’s family was informed of the discovery of the body, and formal identification took place Friday.  Hutchison formed Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit in 2003. The group’s first studio album, 2006’s “Sing the Greys,” featured just Hutchison and his brother Grant, who is the band’s drummer. Their most recent, fifth album, “Painting of a Panic Attack,” was released in 2016 on Atlantic Records.  The band also includes Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. On Wednesday, the group tweeted: “We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now.”  We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now. Please could Scott or anyone with any information on his whereabouts please contact Police Scotland (101). — Frightened Rabbit (@FRabbits) May 9, 2018  News of the body’s discovery prompted tributes from other Scottish musicians, including Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos and Belle and Sebastian singer Stuart Murdoch.  Kapranos tweeted that Hutchison’s death was “a terrible loss.” Murdoch said the Scottish music community had been praying for a different outcome and encouraged anyone “having dark thoughts” to talk to family, friends or a doctor.  Irish rock band Snow Patrol said they were devastated to hear the news about their friend.  Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was “heartbreaking news,” calling Hutchison “a remarkable and much loved talent.”  Awful news about Scott Hutchison.

REUTERS/Phil McCarten/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - A movie is to be made of “Downton Abbey”, the award-winning television period drama about a British household in the early 20th century, and the original stars will reunite for the project.  Julian Fellowes, who created the show, has written the screenplay and will also produce the movie, production and distribution company Focus Features said on Friday.  Brian Percival, who directed the first and several other episodes, will reprise the role for the film, and production will start later this summer.  “When the television series drew to a close it was our dream to bring the millions of global fans a movie and now, after getting many stars aligned, we are shortly to go into production,” producer Gareth Neame said in a statement.  “Julian’s script charms, thrills and entertains and in Brian Percival’s hands we aim to deliver everything that one would hope for as Downton comes to the big screen”.  The show, which first aired in 2011 and went on for six seasons gaining a huge following in Britain and the United States, followed the Crawley family in their huge country home as well as the lives of their servants.  It went on to win several Golden Globes and Primetime Emmy awards and there has long been speculation that it would be turned into a film.

66c0843b-53be-4c5e-ba8d-e2adf1615160,"The Thrill of It All is the second studio album by English singer and songwriter Sam Smith.[3] It was released on 3 November 2017 through Capitol Records.[4]  Background [ edit ]  On 6 October 2017, Smith announced via Twitter that his second album, titled ""The Thrill of It All"", was to be released on 3 November 2017.[5] It is Smith's second full album of material after his hugely successful debut album In the Lonely Hour (2014), which has sold 12 million copies worldwide.  Speaking to Billboard about the album, Smith said:  ""I went through, like, this vortex, came out, I feel like I've rebuilt myself as a stronger thing and I'm just gonna go into the vortex again,"" he says in a preview that features a montage of studio sessions. ""I wasn't trying to make a big pop record when I made this album. I was actually just trying to make something personal and like a diary.""[6]  Singles [ edit ]  ""Too Good at Goodbyes"" was released as the album's lead single on 8 September 2017. It topped the UK Singles Chart and peaked No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[3]  ""One Last Song"" was sent to radio in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2017, on the day of album release as its second single.[7][8]  On 27 March 2018, Smith announced that ""Pray"" would serve as the third single, and would feature newly recorded guest vocals from American rapper Logic. The song was released on 29 March 2018.[9]  ""Baby, You Make Me Crazy"" was released as the fourth single from the album on 29 June 2018.  Promotional singles [ edit ]  On 6 October 2017, Smith released ""Pray"", a gospel-tinged ballad in collaboration with Timbaland, prompted by time spent in Iraq with the charity War Child as a promotional single from the album.[3][10] Another promotional single, ""Burning"", was released on 27 October 2017.[11]  Tour [ edit ]  Within releasing ""Pray"" as the promotional single on 6 October 2017, The Thrill of It All Tour was announced firstly revealing shows in Europe and North America. It began on 20 March 2018 in Sheffield, England, and it is set to conclude on 20 November 2018 in Perth, Australia.  Critical reception [ edit ]  The Thrill of It All received generally positive reviews from music critics. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 72 based on 16 reviews.[14]  Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the album four stars, and was highly positive about it and Smith's vocals, calling them ""supernatural"" and saying: ""The Thrill of It All doesn't just wallow in love's misery, it practically drowns in the stuff. Its 10 songs are almost unrelentingly miserable, self-absorbed and self-pitying, verging on the lachrymose and sentimental (as lovers in the midst of a break-up often are). The instrumentation is understated piano and strings blended with just the occasional hint of contemporary hip-hop effects. At times, Smith's lyrics display a slightly clunking prosaicness. There's not much poetry in lines such as 'real love is never a waste of time' or 'there’' no insurance to pay for the damage'. Yet it all hits home, because Smith makes every note sound like a matter of life and death. 'Him' is the album’s centrepiece, a gospel drama addressed to a judgmental 'father', insisting on Smith's right to love whom he chooses. It is a kind of hymn to Him, and as the choir powers up it gains a righteous glory.""[16] Andy Gill from The Independent also gave a four-star review, and shared in the positivity about the album, remarking: ""Smith's voice remains a thing of wonder throughout"".[19]  Will Hermes for Rolling Stone also gave a positive four-star review, and said: ""Doubling down on his magnificent, gender-nonconforming voice while pushing his songcraft forward, Smith's second LP knights one of the mightiest, most expressive vocalists of his generation.""[23] In another positive review Nick Levine from NME compared Smith to Adele in his review of the album, stating: ""Both have become enormously successful by singing emotional ballads that connect with huge numbers of people, and both are understandably reluctant to raise the tempo as a result. But like Adele's 25, this is an undeniably accomplished album that will, deservedly, shift a helluva lot of copies.[20] AllMusic's Andy Kellman was positive too in his three and a half-star review, and opined: ""this album maintains a consistency and intensity that places it slightly above the debut.""[15]  Some reviews were more negative. Though making it his album of the week and giving it three stars, Alexis Petridis from The Guardian was more mixed in his review, writing: ""There’s a certain power to ""The Thrill of It All"" but it could have been a much more potent album if they’d laid off the polish just a little.""[18] Kitty Empire from The Observer was less enthusiastic in a more negative two-star review, claiming Smith was ""moping by numbers"" like Adele, and surmised: ""There is little drama here, just plenty of shorthand (sad pianos), a total absence of risk""[21]  Accolades [ edit ]  Publication Accolade Rank Ref.

In addition to being the G.O.A.T. in tennis, Williams is a happily married mom. We get to see that on her social media, and it’s so sweet.  She’s also a successful business mogul. (Watch out for the upcoming launch of her reported cosmetics line!) In addition, she bravely uses her voice and platform to speak out for important issues. After she experienced medical complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., by emergency C-section in 2017, she talked about the racism inherent in the American health care industry and the importance of doctors listening to women about their own bodies.  Basically, Serena Williams is an incredibly accomplished woman. Who wouldn’t look up to her? When she posts about her daughter on social media, she’s sharing her joy, and that’s beautiful. Baby Alexis Olympia has already graced magazine covers with her mom, proving she’s a fashion mogul in the making. So, it’s no wonder Williams was thrilled to dress in matching outfits with her daughter for Easter weekend. Williams shared their ensembles via her Instagram Story on Saturday, even detailing their accessories. (Because c’mon, no look is complete without the right accessories.)  Just look at this gorgeous mother-daughter duo!  Serena Williams / Instagram  Here’s how Serena Williams described their coordinating looks:  ""Olympia is wearing a beautiful tulle dress with gold, and it's white, and that's why I decided to wear white,"" Williams said. ""Now check out her gold shoes! Olympia decided that she wanted to wear gold shoes, so mommy decided to wear gold shoes to match her, and we decided we'd try to be twinsies.""

6daa73e1-ffd0-43f3-bead-b2ceff50592e,"A day after Fox cancelled Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the praised cop comedy series has been picked up by NBC for a 13-episode sixth season.  NBC, whose sister studio Universal TV produces the Andy Samberg-starring series, was one of the potential suitors for the comedy after its cancellation. NBC also was among the broadcast networks that bid for the Brooklyn Nine-Nine pitch from creators Mike Schur and Dan Goor when it hit the marketplace in 2012 before the project landed at Fox in a very competitive situation.  “Ever since we sold this show to Fox I’ve regretted letting it get away, and it’s high time it came back to its rightful home,” said Robert Greenblatt, Chairman, NBC Entertainment. “Mike Schur, Dan Goor, and Andy Samberg grew up on NBC and we’re all thrilled that one of the smartest, funniest, and best cast comedies in a long time will take its place in our comedy line-up. I speak for everyone at NBC, here’s to the Nine-Nine!”  NBC  NBC’s pickup of Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows 32 hours of groundswell of support for the show on social media the magnitude of which we have rarely seen, with regular fans — joined by celebrity ones like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Guillermo del Toro, Seth Meyers and Mark Hamill — rallying behind it. Acknowledging the big role fans’ social media campaign played in the show’s resurrection, Brooklyn Nine-Nine‘s creators and stars announced the NBC pickup directly to them on Twitter. (you can see some of their posts below).  Created by the Parks and Recreation duo of Dan Goor and Michael Schur, who are former college roommates, Brooklyn Nine-Nine centers on Peralta, played by Saturday Night Live alum Samberg, a screwball who happens to be a real good cop. His captain in the NYPD’s 99th Precinct is Raymond Holt, a seen-it-all and emotion-challenged captain played by Andre Braugher, who scored three consecutive Emmy noms for Supporting Actor from 2014-2016. Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Joe Lo Truglio, Stephanie Beatriz, Chelsea Peretti, Joel McKinnon Miller and Dirk Blocker also star.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which was Fox’s highest-rated live-action comedy series this season among adults 18-49, is produced by Universal Television, Fremulon, Dr. Goor Productions and 3 Arts. Goor and Schur executive produce alongside David Miner and Luke Del Tredici. The show won two Golden Globes in its freshman season — for best comedy series and best actor in a comedy series (Samberg).  NBC is not the first broadcast network that has come to the rescue of a series produced by its sister studio. In a similar way, ABC and CBS picked up ABC Studios-produced Scrubs and CBS Studios-produced Medium, respectively, after their cancellations by NBC. Like them, Brooklyn Nine-Nine has off-network/SVOD deals that make prolonging their run good business for the parent company. For Fox, which didn’t own Brooklyn Nine-Nine, it was expensive, with a license fee said to be around $1.9 an episode.  NBC’s pickup of Brooklyn Nine-Nine brings the number of Schur series on the network to three — he also has The Good Place, which was renewed for a third season and the newly picked up comedy Abby’s.

In October, though, the actor admitted to botching his proposal a bit during an appearance on the U.K.’s Jonathan Ross Show.  “I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,” he said before laughing at the sexual insinuation. “Sorry, that’s a really bad expression!”  The actors first stirred up relationship rumors in 2012, in sync with their fictional GoT counterparts, Jon Snow and Ygritte.  Rose Leslie and Kit Harington  After a brief split, the couple reconciled and continued to fuel romance speculation until they officially confirmed the relationship in April 2016. They made their red carpet debut as a couple at the Olivier Awards in London.  They became close while on set in Iceland shooting for season 2. Harington previously opened up about the early days of their romance, admitting that those weeks were his favorite of the series.  “Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,” he said in a cover story for L’Uomo Vogue. “If you’re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,712
76c83619-7eb0-4cee-82f4-5b8bedbd81b7,"Don’t cross Drew Barrymore!  The 43-year-old Santa Clarita Diet star opened up on Thursday’s Jimmy Kimmel Live about getting revenge on an ex-boyfriend in her teens.  “I spray painted an ex-boyfriend’s car,” she revealed. “It was really fun. We blasted Cypress Hill. It was mid-‘90s, late-‘90s. We felt so baller.”  In order to maintain her innocence, Barrymore spray painted things her ex wouldn’t have expected onto his car.  “A lot of really horrible things that would not seem like me. It wasn’t like, ‘You screwed me over, you d**k.’ It was like, ‘Anarchy’ and ‘Black Flag,’” she noted. “And then he called me crying like a little b**ch, and he said, ‘You wouldn’t have done this, would you have?’ And I was like, ‘Noooo.’”  Barrymore added that she never admitted her act of rebellion to her ex, saying, “It was really gratifying and now he knows it’s me…I went with my girlfriend Justine, and we were young and we felt so cool driving up the Canyon in my Ford Bronco, blasting Cypress Hill. It was such a moment. It was worth the phone call I might get sometime soon.”  Barrymore also reflected on her one-of-a-kind childhood, and talked about meeting the late Princess Diana as a kid around the time E.T. came out.  “I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the most exciting moment for me to meet a real-life princess, the real life princess, the People’s Princess,” she recalled. “Diana was and is and will always be the epitome of a woman that all little girls look up to. She was so kind and so nice and I have to say growing up with her as a princess was just such a good example.”  In the photo of the encounter, director Steven Spielberg is carefully watching Barrymore as she meets with royalty.  “You can see Steven [Spielberg]’s really looking, wanting to make sure I didn’t mess this up,” Barrymore said of her godfather. “He was very paternal to me, and he was like, ‘Well, your mom took you to Studio 54 last night so I want to make sure you don’t mess up’… -- and thank you, Mom, because it was so fun – ‘I want to make sure you don’t screw up this very royal, regal moment.’”  Barrymore hopes to instill a similar sense of responsibility in her own children – daughters Frankie, 4, and Olive, 5.  “I really do want them to summer intern when they start asking for money and doing their own laundry and learning how to be self-preserving,” she said. “I don’t want them to have a hard knock life the way, you know, I certainly grew up in an unorthodox way, but there were also so many cool things to it too. It was a balance that took a real art to navigate, and they’re not going to have any kind of life like that. So I’m always trying to figure out what will be their harsh realities that will really motivate them to be empathic and know that it’s important to take care of yourself and ours.”  Kimmel then brought up that Barrymore had Madonna at her 12th birthday party, and the actress added that Billy Idol, Grace Jones, and Stephen Pearcy from the band Ratt were also there.  “It was so cool,” she admitted. “My kids are going to miss out on fun things like that.”  For more from Barrymore, watch the clip below:­­­  RELATED CONTENT:  Sarah Paulson Talks Drew Barrymore Confronting Her About Her Impression  Karamo Brown Says Chrissy Teigen & Drew Barrymore Being 'Queer Eye' Fans Makes Him 'Weep' With Joy (Exclusive)  Drew Barrymore Talks Possibility of 'E.T.'

c3bcdea3-ccd7-409d-9a9f-0b286fa63b71,"It’s easy to get lost in the swell of superhero entertainment. Justice League and Thor: Ragnarok both come out next month. The new trailer for Black Panther just dropped last week. A slew of superhero television shows, including The Defenders, The Tick, Inhumans, Runaways, and The Punisher, have recently debuted or are set to debut later this year, joining the ranks of existing series like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Legion, Arrow, Supergirl, The Flash, and Marvel’s ever-growing stable of Netflix series.  The thought of adding another entry to such a crowded docket feels more like a taunt than a treat. But somehow, despite the ongoing deluge of capes and cowls, one new series this fall is poised to make you want more superhero shows just like it.  It’s The Gifted, which debuted earlier this month on Fox.  The show — a drama set in the X-Men’s mutant universe where the X-Men might not exist and anti-mutant sentiment is high— is an on-the-run thriller with a big, bad government that wants to hunt down these special humans. Each episode of the show’s young first season (three episodes have aired so far) has been equal parts mutant melodrama and family soap opera, with savvy and relatively impressive special effects. (Television superhero shows aren’t exactly well-known for their dazzle.)  But the best thing about the show is how well it translates and stays true to the heart of the X-Men.  The Gifted, like all the best X-Men stories, understands that the X-Men aren’t celebrity superheroes  The Gifted’s premise is divided into two main plots.  The first plot involves a ragtag group of mutants on the run from the government. John Proudstar, a.k.a. Thunderbird (Blair Redford), is a mutant with superhuman agility and strength with superhuman senses. He leads a group whose core members include teleporter Clarice Fong, a.k.a. Blink (Jamie Chung); mistress of magnetism Lorna Dane, a.k.a. Polaris (Emma Dumont); and photon-manipulating Marcos Diaz a.k.a. Eclipse (Sean Teale). The team’s main objective is to house and protect mutants who are on the run.  The second plot centers on the Strucker family, an initially normal-seeming bunch headed up by dad Reed (Stephen Moyer) and mom Caitlin (Kate) (Amy Acker). However, the Struckers’ lives become anything but ordinary when siblings Lauren (Natalie Alyn Lind) and Andy (Percy Hynes White) find out they’re mutants.  These two stories collide when Kate and Andy experience their mutant awakenings in the show’s first episode and seek help from Thunderbird’s mutant underground railroad. The twist is that their father, Reed, works a prosecutor who specializes in jailing mutants, making a living by detailing the threats that mutants present to society. And he had no idea his children were mutants.  In each episode, there’s tension not just between mutants and the various members of the Strucker family, but also with Reed’s conscience and whether he’ll turn on the people helping his family, in order to cut a deal with the government in hopes it’ll spare his family.  Since the X-Men aren’t present in this world, in the public’s eye, all mutants, even if they’re not displaying mutant powers, are dangerous. And this bleak view of humanity and its warts are what makes The Gifted’s premise such a strong addition to the X-Men universe.  Thunderbird’s team knows just how bad humans can be. The Strucker family is just learning. And the show becomes a push and pull between two ideologies, with the Struckers slowly realizing what it’s like to be outsiders.  Last year, I had the opportunity to speak to Chris Claremont, a comic book writer who, with artists John Byrne and Dave Cockrum, is considered to be part of the team that breathed new life into the X-Men in the ’70s and ’80s and turned them into the pop culture force they are today. Claremont told me that what was most crucial to the X-Men was the idea that they were outsiders.  “The one core difference that made the X-universe unique, compared to the Avengers and the Fantastic Four and all of the rest of the Marvel universe, is that they were totally clandestine. People were scared because they weren't a public team,” Claremont said. “They were a shadow team. There were only a few of them, comparatively speaking. If you take that away, then they are no different than any other team.”  This idea is key to The Gifted. The reason it feels so different from many other superhero shows stems from the role that fear plays in its story; no one is saving the day in one fell swoop. And even though there are acts of heroism — like Thunderbird and Eclipse rescuing the Struckers in the third episode — any small miracles that would otherwise inspire hope and optimism are swallowed up by the relentlessness and influence of a government that’s intent on rounding up and getting rid of mutants. It’s compelling because it’s not a superhero story, but rather a survival story about beings who happen to have superpowers.  But the show also smartly tweaks the classic X-Men story by changing its point of view  In addition to capturing the fear and loathing of the X-universe, The Gifted incorporates a lot of other classic X-Men elements: Family — both the one you’re born into and the one you choose — is a major theme. So is the question of who helps the helpless. Villains are omnipresent and constantly spying, as the government’s Sentinel program sees and hears almost everything.  When you look at major X-Men stories like God Loves, Man Kills or the crossover event known as The Mutant Massacre, they involve the deaths of innocent people who’ve been marginalized by society. In God Loves, Man Kills, two innocent mutant children are slaughtered by religious zealots. In The Mutant Massacre, a group of mutants shunned by society are living in sewers, where a group of villains named the Marauders kill them. It’s up to the X-Men, who themselves are hated by society, to help these marginalized groups.  Those stories are largely told through the X-Men’s point of view. The X-Men must help the helpless. They must protect the weak. They become symbols of hope and perseverance. And they rise above the ignorance they’re greeted with.  The Gifted flips this concept by eliminating the X-Men and operating from the perspective of those who would typically need the X-Men’s help.  Familiar X-Men — Cyclops, Storm, Jean Grey, Wolverine, and friends — don’t officially exist in this universe (though if The Gifted becomes a huge hit, we might see a cameo or two). That means there aren’t a bunch of well-known heroes standing by to save the day. Also gone are larger-than-life villains like Magneto or Mr. Sinister. Thunderbird’s team of mutants are more of the average variety; some of them are still figuring out their powers, and they aren’t anywhere near as powerful or savvy as the X-Men.  Basically, there’s no distinct “superhero” team element in the show.  As a result, The Gifted focuses on what it’s like to be on the run from the government, rather than what it’s like to save the day. The show doesn’t spend a lot of time debating the philosophical future of mutantkind or proselytizing about saving the world. Instead, it’s a more intimate, personal story.  This opens up several opportunities that allow viewers to see what discrimination looks like not from a superhero’s perspective — which extends above and beyond human ignorance — but from a more grounded, human one. In episode three, for example, the Struckers visited Kate’s brother Danny, only to find out — once he learns that his niece and nephew are mutants — that his anti-mutant sentiment is stronger than blood.  The Gifted is more about uncertainty and fright than action and flash, since it centers on characters who are just trying to live to see another day. In other words, it’s found a unique, television-friendly story in a universe that’s already told many. And that in itself has made the show worth watching.  The Gifted airs Mondays at 9 pm Eastern on Fox. Previous episodes are streaming on Fox’s website and Hulu.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1629

27361448-9178-4fe2-974d-4543d1e453a9,"Congrats are in order for Shanina Shaik and Gregory “DJ Ruckus” Andrews ! The couple—she's a model, he's an in-demand DJ—married this past Saturday on the island of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The pair first met in 2015, when Shanina found herself sans entourage during Coachella. ""Just before I was going to leave, Greg noticed that I was alone and came over to speak with me,"" she recalls. ""We had the most wonderful conversation."" From that moment on, the bride says, she was sure he was ""the one."" Greg was sure, too, and they dated for just eight months before he proposed. ""When you know, you know,"" Shanina adds. To propose, Greg planned a tropical Christmas vacation with Shanina and her mother at his family's place in the Bahamas. The day after the holiday, he organized an impromptu beach trip with Shanina and his cousin—or so she thought! Greg's cousin, of course, never showed up, and he instead popped the question in front of the crystal blue waters. And that's not all: Greg proposed with not one but two Lorraine Schwartz rings! ""He asked me to choose my favorite ring , and, unfortunately, I could only choose one,"" she says, with a laugh.  After an engagement like that, it's no surprise that Shanina and Greg decided to marry in the Bahamas as well. In fact, they decided to say ""I do"" on the exact stretch of sand where they were engaged. ""I've always dreamt of marrying on the beach,"" says the bride, who grew up in Australia. The stunning setting—the Other Side in Eleuthera—became their inspiration for the day, and the couple enlisted the help of Little Island Design to create a tropical-inspired wedding there. ""Our wedding reflected our personal style (simple and elegant) with the added touch of a bohemian vibe as well,"" explains the bride.

The groom wore a bright shirt that match the party's floral arrangements.

The bride later changed into a second heel—this time by Jimmy Choo—when she slipped into a second dress for dancing.

""I wanted it to be simple, bohemian, and elegant,"" she says. ""I love a boho style and I wanted to give it a little twist by incorporating lace."" The result? A gorgeous off-the-shoulder creation featuring delicate lace and an increasingly sheer fabric toward the hem.

The youngest guests did not adhere to the uniform, but they looked especially adorable in their wedding attire.  Pinterest Photo by Sara Lobla  The ceremony took place on the beach, where wooden benches were arranged around an altar covered in greenery. The bride walked down a plank-covered aisle lined with more greenery garlands.  Pinterest Photo by Sara Lobla  Joseph Simmons, commonly known as ""Rev Run,"" officiated the oceanfront vows.

Pinterest Photo by Sara Lobla  Following the ceremony, the wedding party recessed down the aisle. The bridesmaids wore custom dresses by Zimmermann, an Australian fashion label. Shanina worked with the brand's designers Nicky and Simone to select a specific silhouette and tone for each girl. Shanina's matron of honor, Nicole Williams of WAGS, wore a special gown by Michael Castello.  Pinterest Photo by Sara Lobla  The newlyweds selected ""Electric"" by Alina Baraz for their first dance, but created a mix that led into ""Remember the Time"" by Michael Jackson. ""After we met and started dating, I had to spend a lot of time in Australia for work and Greg sent me the most amazing flowers and a card that said, 'Do you remember the time we first fell in love? I miss you,' ” Shanina explains. ""Since then, 'Remember the Time' has been our song.""  Pinterest Photo by Sara Lobla  A dinner tent was pitched by the beach, where two long tables were also set for dinner.

fc6c698a-bd4b-4b6a-a7f2-adb3e276bee8,"Bono has said that US presidential nominee Donald Trump could potentially “destroy” America.  In an interview with Charlie Rose on US network CBS, the U2 front man said Trump is “potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America”.  Bono said America is different from other countries because it is “an idea”, one which Trump is “trying to hijack”.  “That idea is bound up in justice and equality for all. I think he’s hijacked the party.  “I think he’s trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it’s bigger than all of us. I think this is really dangerous.”  In a separate interview with ATTN, an online media company aimed at younger people, Bono has recalled the historic struggle of Irish immigrants to the United States in calling on the country’s political leaders to open its doors to Syrian refugees.  He said that to turn people away just because they are refugees was “a betrayal of the whole idea of America”.  “The promised land belongs to those who need it most. The Irish needed it. The Jews needed it. The Syrians now need it,” he said in an interview.  Asked about US political opposition to accepting refugees into the country, Bono said: “I’m Irish. It’s deeply offensive. We were economic refugees. This thing of a continent behaving like an island, this shrivel and pretend the world doesn’t exist, it’s not possible any more in a globalized world. It’s just not possible.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,305

0fcd14b0-f9d2-4c19-8eb8-6b841cb815a5,"One of the Internet’s favorite coupled might have called it quits again.  Chris Evans, 36, and Jenny Slate, 35, are not together anymore after rekindling their relationship late last year, according to a new profile of the Infinity War actor in the New York Times. As Evans recalls a book he read while they were still together, the article states that the two called it off recently. Evans says he learned to listen more while reading Rebecca Solnit’s The Mother of All Questions: “The hardest thing to reconcile is that just because you have good intentions, doesn’t mean it’s your time to have a voice,” the actor, now starring in Lobby Hero on Broadway, told the Times.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The on-again, off-again couple was spotted together again in October 2017 after first breaking up in February following nearly a year of dating. Flirty Twitter exchanges between the two soon followed, sending fans into a frenzy about the possibility of their reunion.  Emma McIntyre/Getty  The rumors gained more steam when Evans posted several videos of his beloved dog appearing to sing along to music while a woman who sounded suspiciously like Slate laughed in the background. PEOPLE later confirmed the rekindling in late November.  Slate spent Christmas with Evans and his family. She posed with his brother Scott for a selfie he posted to Instagram. “Christmas with my favorite Jew!” the look-alike Evans brother captioned the shot.  The former couple met on the set of their drama Gifted in 2016, where sources told PEOPLE their connection was undeniable. When they weren’t busy filming, Evans and Slate would spend much of their free time hanging out together.  Slate gushed about Evans on the The Secret Life of Pets‘ red carpet, telling Entertainment Tonight, “It’s kind of like I got my dream seventh grade boyfriend. We didn’t know each other growing up, but we grew up about a half hour away from each other. We’ve been friends for a while.”  She later opened up about her split from the superhero movie star, saying differences in their careers eventually led to their breakup.  “Chris is a very, very famous person,” she said in a interview with Vulture. “For him to go to a restaurant is totally different than for me to go. I sit in my window and I say ‘Hi’ to people on the street. I have more freedom because I’m not Captain America. I’m mostly a cartoon.”  Slate said the attention eventually became too much.  “This is what I needed to do to feel normal,” she explained. “To be alone.”  RELATED VIDEO: Jenny Slate On What Makes “Gifted” Costar Chris Evans Such A “Beautiful” Human Being  But in the months following their original split, Evans and Slate remained amicable and supportive, often praising each other in the press.  “We all love each other so much, and it’s a real, real love,” Slate told PEOPLE while promoting their film Gifted. “I mean, I have gone on and on about how beautiful Chris is. He is, inside and out.”  Evans echoed her comments, saying she was his “favorite human.”  “She’s the best. I’ve never ever ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does,” Evans told PEOPLE of Slate. “She’ll give you one sentence and there’s no fat to it. You’re like, ‘You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.’  “It’s like an art form talking with her, because the visuals associated with her expression are just so colorful,” he continued. “She’s so vulnerable, so honest, so interested in other people more than herself, she’s incredibly compassionate, there’s just nothing to not love about her.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,771

The love rat TV host, 61, and third wife Marjorie, 53, moved from Atlanta to Los Angeles last year to launch the former stand-up comic’s self-titled talk show.  But according to insiders, Steve’s cozying up to the Kardashian momager during closed-door business meetings, endless phone chats and nonstop text messages has sent Marjorie over the edge.  “There was a huge blowout fight and Marjorie walked out threatening divorce,” a source told Radar.  PHOTOS; Steve Harvey Has Lunch With Kris Jenner’s Beau Corey Gamble  “There’s no way she was going to put up with Steve hanging around a man-eater like Kris — especially since he’s proven time and again he can’t be trusted.”  Steve and 62-year-old Kris, a two-time divorcée, have been buddy-buddy for years .  They were pictured together during Paris Fashion Week in 2015. They’ve also been seen out in Hollywood on multiple occasions and Kris appeared on his talk show to help boost ratings.  To further cement their relationship, Kris brought her brood to Family Feud.  PHOTOS: You’re Fired! Kim Kardashian & Her Sister Want Momager Kris Jenner Out — 7 Reasons Why  Despite their apparent closeness, a TV insider insisted Kris has “no interest in Steve romantically.”  Instead, crafty Kris is stringing Steve along, hoping to manipulate him into sharing his TV smarts so she can use his advice to boost her own sagging empire.  “Kris is pursuing Steve — but it’s all about business,” the source snitched. “She admires his TV success and wants to learn all his secrets.”  Although Keeping Up with the Kardashians has been a monster hit, the show was created by Ryan Seacrest, and Kris desperately needs guidance to grow her own showbiz brand, according to sources.  PHOTOS: ‘KUWTK’ Fakery Exposed: Kris Jenner’s Evil Manipulations Backfire  “Kris has tried to produce a long list of shows, but they’ve all been disasters,” the source said.  “Meanwhile, Steve has the golden touch when it comes to TV. That’s why Kris is looking to him for professional help.”  Furious over the pair’s closeness, Marjorie got revenge by posting several videos of her working out with her hunky young personal trainer on Instagram.  A few days later, Steve made a spur-of-the-moment decision to treat Marjorie to a no-expense-spared vacation in Europe.  PHOTOS: Say What?! 18 Of Kris Jenner’s Most Outrageous Quotes  “Steve has a wandering eye and he loves women!” said a former employee on his talk show, who spoke with Radar on the condition of anonymity.  “He’s cheated during his previous marriages, and Marjorie knows he could do it again. She knows her man’s weakness — knows everything about him! That’s why she watches him so closely.”  Steve left his first wife, Marcia, in 1990 while she was pregnant to move in with Mary Shackelford, who became his second wife in 1996.  Before even filing for divorce, Steve ditched Mary in 2005 for Marjorie — and his bitter ex has never forgiven him.  Last year Mary socked Steve with a $60 million lawsuit, claiming he bullied her out of a fortune during their divorce and his cheating triggered a breakdown that landed her in a mental hospital.  Mary’s sister, Ruth Littrell, fumed: “Once a cheater, always a cheater. Steve’s up to his old tricks — it’s nothing new.

50448fd7-afcd-4d48-8057-c53ea8d0712c,"It’s been nearly four months since Tamar Braxton filed for divorce from her husband, Vincent Herbert and since the news broke, rumors of a secret love child and domestic abuse have bubbled over. There was even a social media meltdown. Though the singer is finally ready to clear the air.  Sitting down with the ladies of The View, the Grammy-nominated reality star shared the status of her relationship with Herbert and spilled the tea who fueled allegations that caused her Instagram hiatus.  “I have a regular marriage and in regular marriages just like everyone else, things happen, you know. In my marriage, it was just to a point where I felt like divorce was the only option I had left,” she said. Herbert sat in the audience listening attentively as his former partner continued. “Although we’re in extensive counseling and that is much needed and it always will be, I think the bigger picture of everything is that we have a responsibility to my amazing 4-year-old son, just to raise him in the most comfortable, amazing, loving and secure household that we can—that’s why we don’t live together,” she said.  Braxton filed for divorce in October just a month after she announced that her most recent album, Bluebird of Happiness, would be her last so that she could take time off to work on her marriage. The couple married in November of 2008 and welcomed their only child together, Logan, in June 2013.  Many believed that the timing of the divorce announcement was strictly for ratings to promote the fifth season of the couple’s WEtv reality series, Tamar & Vince but the 40-year-old insists that that is far from the truth.  “I wish I could say that a lot of times I could say it was made up just so I could hide behind the truth sometimes. But in this situation, I absolutely have no reason to lie about my marriage or the things that [are] happening in my marriage for ratings. I think that’s disgusting and I would never sell my soul to the devil like that. It’s not that serious. Marriage is a serious thing for me and for my family.”  Nasty allegations also ensued after news broke that Braxton filed for divorce and was only fueled more when the reality star took to Instagram to accuse Herbert of cheating and getting another woman pregnant.  After learning that it was merely a rumor shared with her by someone she believed was her friend, the Maryland native took a hiatus from the ‘Gram. Although she’s since returned to the social media site, she said the incident taught her a very valuable lesson.  “Here’s the thing about people being in your business. Keep people out your business,” she said before addressing her social media meltdown which prompted her to take a break from Instagram. “It was my fault where I put myself in a position where I opened up the floor for people to give their opinions on my marriage. I have to take responsibility for that. And you also have to take responsibility for telling too much of your business. Because people always feel like they can tell you this, they have a hand in this or ‘oh, girl, did you hear about what happened?’ but not everyone wants to see you happy…I do air my dirty laundry, however, I’ve never been that specific and I should’ve been specific enough to say, ‘well this is what my so-called friends were saying.’”  Herbert joined his estranged wife and business partner on stage to set the record straight about the allegations and made a public vow about his devotion to their family.  “Absolutely not,” he responded when asked if there was a bun in the oven of another woman. And all the other allegations are not true. I’m just not that kind of person. I love this lady with all my heart and I love my family with all my heart and I will never stop fighting for my family and trying to be great.”  As for the future, neither Braxton or Herbert know what it holds but they both make it clear that their main priority will always and forever be the wellbeing of their son.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,808

Selena Gomez has spoken at length about the personal significance of the new Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, which tells the story of the thirteen reasons why a bullied high school student commits suicide. Gomez, who, along with her mom, pushed for the series to be made, served as an executive producer on the show.  ""I would do anything to be able to have a good influence on this generation, but I definitely relate to everything that was going on,"" said the 24-year-old during a Netflix press event in February. ""I was there for the last episode, and I was a mess just seeing it all come to life, because I've experienced that.""  Now, the story is getting even more personal for Gomez. Along with two of the show's breakout stars, Tommy Dorfman (who plays Ryan Shaver) and Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis), the pop star got a semicolon tattoo over the weekend to represent Project Semicolon, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization. The symbolic punctuation represents the idea that when one thought ends, a new one begins — that ""this is not the end but a new beginning.""  The trio showed off the matching ink on Instagram. ""Project Semicolon is a movement dedicated to presenting hope for those suffering from depression, thoughts of suicide, addiction, and self-injury,"" captioned Boe on her Instagram.  Dorfman also describes his own personal struggles with mental health in his past. ""I struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college,"" he wrote alongside a photo of the gang's matching tattoos. ""I reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I'd never live past the age of 21. Today I'm grateful to be alive, in this new chapter of life in recovery, standing with my colleagues and friends, making art that helps other people.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,376

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Getty Images  Stone and Theroux were also photographed with the actress, Laura Harrier.  Theroux and Stone are co-stars in Netflix's forthcoming series, Maniac, and have been spending a lot of time together as a result. However, rumors that the pair might be more than friends started earlier this month when they were seen leaving a Met Gala after-party together.  E! also notes that Theroux shared a photo of Stone in one of his Instagram Stories earlier this month, as the pair posed with Jonathan Van Ness from Netflix's Queer Eye reboot. Theroux did his best to quell dating rumors, though, captioning the photo, ""Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs.""  To make matters more confusing, Theroux was also seen looking extremely close to Harrier, who is on vacation with Stone, and also attended the Louis Vuitton Cruise 2019 show.  MEGA  Theroux previously shared a photo of Harrier on his Instagram account, taken at a Met Gala after-party.

40b077c6-f648-4df6-a841-f71f78a4f897,"On the eve of the 15th season and 3,000th episode of my nightly talk show, I was as shocked as anyone else by PBS’ announcement today. Variety knew before I did.  I have the utmost respect for women and celebrate the courage of those who have come forth to tell their truth. To be clear, I have never groped, coerced, or exposed myself inappropriately to any workplace colleague in my entire broadcast career, covering 6 networks over 30 years.  Never. Ever. Never.  PBS launched a so-called investigation of me without ever informing me. I learned of the investigation when former staffers started contacting me to share the uncomfortable experience of receiving a phone call from a stranger asking whether, I had ever done anything to make them uncomfortable, and if they could provide other names of persons to call. After 14 seasons, that’s how I learned of this inquiry, from the streets.  Only after being threatened with a lawsuit, did PBS investigators reluctantly agree to interview me for three hours.  If having a consensual relationship with a colleague years ago is the stuff that leads to this kind of public humiliation and personal destruction, heaven help us. The PBS investigators refused to review any of my personal documentation, refused to provide me the names of any accusers, refused to speak to my current staff, and refused to provide me any semblance of due process to defend myself against allegations from unknown sources. Their mind was made up. Almost immediately following the meeting, this story broke in Varietyas an “exclusive.” Indeed, I learned more about these allegations reading the Variety story than the PBS investigator shared with me, the accused, in our 3 hour face to face meeting.  My attorneys were sent a formal letter invoking a contractual provision to not distribute my programming, and that was it.  Put simply, PBS overreacted and conducted a biased and sloppy investigation, which led to a rush to judgment, and trampling on a reputation that I have spent an entire lifetime trying to establish.  This has gone too far. And, I, for one, intend to fight back.  It’s time for a real conversation in America, so men and women know how to engage in the workplace. I look forward to actively participating in that conversation.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,435

This news comes after it was reported the Dance Moms coach has been granted early release  Abby, who began her sentence at Federal Correctional Complex in Victorville, California July, 12 2017, opened up about her experience behind bars in a lengthy caption accompanying a picture of her visit from several of her Dance Moms costars.  The dance instructor began on a reflective note: 'Sometimes in life you make mistakes I trusted the wrong people and didn’t pay any attention to things I should of. I’m more than sorry for the mistakes I have made.  'My world flipped upside down when I had to enter prison. I did so with grace, the stories you read about me been a princess are untrue.'  She continued: 'I have made friends with both inmates and staff, I’ve tried to better myself, participated in anything offered to me and I am a better person for this experience.'  Transformation: The star has trimmed down during her time behind bars  She was cautious about word of an early release, writing: 'All the press stories and speculation are not entirely correct however, I am feeling hopeful but no dates have been confirmed at this time.'  'I am feeling great and ready to turn over a new leaf thank you so much to everyone for your support especially my nearest and dearest I love you all ( and yes this is me in prison.)'  Abby Lee was sentenced to 366 day prison sentence after being charged for fraud.  But on Friday Deadline reported the Dance Moms star will be released early for good behavior.

""Game day feels,"" Simone wrote on social media ahead of her big debut. ""So excited to dance at the Houston Texans Game!""

This is hardly the first time Simone has solidified her chops as a dancer and a gymnast — or in this case, both at once. The 20-year-old famously appeared on this year's cycle of Dancing With the Stars and was eliminated in a way that left many fans outraged . After receiving two perfect scores from the judges, Simone was still sent home, which many considered to be a direct result of the response she dished to a host who told her to ""smile"" while receiving criticisms.

b010e4fd-4a3e-498e-87c8-03156575371a,"  Oprah Winfrey takes part in a town hall meeting with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Marietta, Georgia, Nov. 1. (Chris Aluka Berry/Reuters)  Contributing opinion writer  A political mentor had a saying when he looked at a good political commercial: “There’s votes in that spot.” That phrase came back to me yesterday when I saw Oprah Winfrey say, “This land was made for you and me.” The phrase makes a powerful rallying cry for a lot of Democrats in 2018 and beyond, and the reigning queen of all media rolled out this line while stumping for Stacey Abrams in the race for governor in Georgia.  While Winfrey has denied interest in running for office herself, the rumor that she will lingers. The rumor itself isn’t all that interesting. But listening to her yesterday, I thought her candidacy for president would be fascinating.  The Democrats have a number of high-profile candidates who have been mentioned to take on the Republicans’ reality-show star in 2020, many of whom rose outside of politics. In addition to Winfrey, there is Howard Schultz of Starbucks, actor Tom Hanks, former New York City mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg and Disney’s Bob Iger.  Trump, of course, knows Winfrey well, having appeared on her show. And he’s had nice things to say about her in the past. He undoubtedly still envies her mastery of branding and media as she built an empire after starting as a local newscaster in Nashville. Lately, he hasn’t been as kind, calling her “insecure” and saying he would love to run against her because (cue innuendo) he knows her “weakness.”  But Trump presumably knows her strengths, too. She has spent a lifetime interviewing people and understands how to give meaning to the struggles and aspirations of a wide cross section of Americans. If Trump is our national storyteller for fear and loathing, Winfrey is ours for hope and striving. Trump screams about an America under siege and beset by internal and external enemies; Winfrey has spent a lifetime in conversation with us about how we are all redeemable and that we can all have our piece of the pie.  It may be unlikely, but a presidential race which pits the slogan, “Make America Great Again: The Sequel” against “This land was made for you and me” would get huge ratings and present our country with a very clear choice. Time will tell how the show plays out.  Read more:  Carter Eskew: Are there any thoroughbreds in the Democratic presidential field?

The 49-year-old singer opened up about her trademark battle with Kylie Jenner over the name ""Kylie"" in a new interview with Rolling Stone, explaining that the dispute -- which she won in 2017 after Jenner attempted to trademark the name in 2014 -- was nothing personal.  ""I've never met Kylie Jenner. I've never met any member of the family -- actually, I've met Kendall just in passing at a fashion event -- but I honestly don't know them,"" Minogue says. ""It's awkward, because fans get so loyal and vocal, and we love that! But it was nothing personal at all, I'm at pains to say.""  ""Trademark is long, it's boring, it's expensive, and it's really important. I've been doing that for years and years. It was just causing confusion with customers. As long as it's clear, then we can all win,"" she continued.

Can you imagine me saying that?!"" Minogue adds. ""That was just unfortunate that that is how those lawyers speak. So I genuinely hope that it's understood: That certainly did not come from me.""  ""Good news is, that's all wrapped up, we didn't have to go to court. That's all done. And I'm sure I'll meet them one day,"" she shares.

The latest instance of mommy-shaming plaguing Kardashian was sparked by a throwback photo of her husband and daughter that she posted on Instagram on Tuesday. In the pic, North West cuddles up to Kanye West and gives her smiling dad a kiss on the cheek. ""I can still feel the love 💕,"" Kim K captioned the adorable snapshot, quoting Kanye's recently released song "" Feel the Love .""  Almost immediately, critics began pouncing on Kardashian over the fact that, in the picture, North is wearing her naturally curly hair straight. ""I can feel the heat damage from here! Leave your [kid's] hair alone let her have the choice to damage it when she's older,"" one person commented. ""Stop straightening her hair,"" someone else wrote, while another added, ""That poor baby's curl pattern is gonna be all jacked up from the heat damage she's putting on her hair at a young age.""  Others, however, defended Kardashian, citing both her right to parent her children however she wants and the well-documented fact that North is already a burgeoning style star at just five years old. ""Y'all are so annoying. Maybe NORTH wanted her hair that way!!!!!! She's very opinionated as we can all see. AND it's VERY easy to straighten hair without heat damage seeing as [how] her mom has a TEAM of PROFESSIONAL hairstylists,"" one of her defenders wrote.  Loading View on Instagram  Last month, after catching similar flack for letting North wear her hair straight on her birthday, Kardashian West explained the decision to The Hollywood Reporter . ""She wanted straight hair and I straightened her hair one time. It's funny, because online everyone thought that we pressed it and did this whole thing. It was just a flat iron. I even read that she had extensions on! She has curly hair, so when you straighten her hair, it's gonna look really long. I can't believe people didn't get that. Sometimes you just have to tune it out! It was her birthday and all she wanted was to try to have her hair straightened,"" she said.  The KKW Beauty founder noted that her own professional hairstylist, Chris Appleton , helped out with North's special style, and added, ""She liked it, so we did it when we went to New York too, and that's it. You know, I'm not gonna let her straighten her hair all the time, but if she wants it that way two or three days a year, then that's fine with me. She loved it, but she loves her curly hair, too.""

fdd4b444-756e-4f09-a7c5-53f2bee4ff1f,"Denzel’s recent comments about the “Orwellian Police State” is so very apparent, given the FBI, DNC, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama scandal inside the administration’s treasonous activity in having the Clinton Foundation pay for a fake dossier, made by Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, which they hoped would create false allegations which would concede Donald Trump’s Presidential victory. This fake dossier was then passed to James Comey at the FBI, who then issued FISA warrants to surveillance Donald Trump at the Trump Tower prior to the election, which later sparked Robert Mueller’s Special Counsel to investigate any Russian collusion in the 2016 Presidential Election. This, in a nutshell, exposes the spying and the treason that the DNC committed under the Obama administration to try to prevent Trump from succeeding, which is all stated in the Nunes Memo.Denzel affirmed, “If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents. We never would have known this. Think about it!”Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for Best Actor for the film ‘Roman J. Israel, Esq.’ (his 8th total Oscar nomination), didn’t pull any punches on the revelations of the released memo, stating: “They would have a tool they would use over and over again to circumvent the will of the people in future elections”.When a reporter then asked Denzel Washington if he felt the memo released by Congress on Friday was “reliable”, he responded, “Hell yeah, it’s reliable. We don’t need to know the nitty gritty to understand exactly what’s happened here”.“We know that a warrant to spy on the Trump team was issued based on media reports, and these media reports were based on information provided by an opposition research firm being paid by the DNC and Hillary Clinton.”“You guys can’t see what is wrong with this? You’re kidding me. Well I guess you are reporters. How many reporters was it that got caught colluding with the Clinton campaign?”Denzel Washington then later called out individual reporters and media outlets for never publishing anything negative about the Democrat Party, and subsequently hiding their scandals from any in-depth news output.Denzel continued, “I grew up a Democrat. I get it. I know a lot of people who hate Trump with a real passion. But you’ve got to understand that we dodged a bullet when Clinton lost. More than one bullet. We avoided the creation of an Orwellian Police State”.We couldn’t agree more, and we thank god for Donald Trump every day, which has been our sentiment all along here at Brainstain. We also wonder why the mainstream news media is now trying to downplay the severity of the memo, as if it didn’t constitute complete treason?The double standards are “oh so” apparent, and it’s good to see somebody high up in celebrity circles like Denzel Washington to be brave enough speak out on these pressing issues, and helping to expose the scandals of the Democrat Party.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,604

(The U.N. ultimately dropped that campaign two months later, after the initiative was met with criticism.)  “In some magical and mystical way, there lies within each of us Wonder Woman,” Carter said at the time. “She is real. She lives and she breathes. I know this because she lives in me, and she lives in the stories that these women tell me, day in and day out. I see it in the letters and in the stories. I read it on social media. I see it in the tears that fall from the eyes of the women who say it saved them from some awful thing that they endured — because they saw that they could do something great.”  Alberto E.

739a5bc7-c3fb-456d-8629-709629425018,"Mr. Weinstein, who is now a Hollywood pariah, has an array of legal problems that are separate from the bankruptcy case. Prosecutors in New York, Los Angeles and London are pursuing possible criminal cases against him. A lawsuit filed last month by Mr. Schneiderman will continue. Mr. Weinstein also faces additional civil suits, including one filed by the British actress Kadian Noble, who is suing him for sex trafficking.  But the bankruptcy filing does halt an array of lawsuits against the company, including those filed by women who contend that the studio facilitated misconduct by Mr. Weinstein. Those women will now have to line up behind the studio’s secured creditors — who themselves are likely to be paid pennies on the dollar, according to bankruptcy lawyers.  The upshot is that women alleging abuse may now have a harder time recovering damages.  The filing, which was expected, ended a chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat.  In the fall, after The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations of sexual harassment and rape, Mr. Weinstein’s younger brother and partner in the studio, Bob Weinstein, unsuccessfully scrambled to line up bridge loans to keep the company operating. He then sold “Paddington 2” rights to Warner Bros., which bought time but resulted in a lawsuit.  By early February, to the disbelief of many in the film industry, it seemed as if the Weinstein Company had found a way forward. A group of investors, including the billionaire Ron Burkle and Lantern Capital, had made an offer to buy most of the studio’s assets, which include the TV series “Project Runway” and the rights to “Lion,” “Django Unchained” and about 275 other films.  The investor group, managed by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, had offered to pay off what it believed was the Weinstein Company’s debt — about $225 million. In return, it would receive most of the studio’s assets, which Ms. Contreras-Sweet planned to use to start a new, female-led film company.  But then Mr. Schneiderman threw the brakes on a sale, filing a lawsuit alleging that the studio and the Weinstein brothers had violated various state and city laws. He also said the proposed sale to Ms. Contreras-Sweet’s group was unacceptable because it did not adequately compensate victims, protect employees and ensure that those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein’s conduct would not be rewarded.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,470

916ebeec-64cd-4108-88f5-5990e34cd5bb,"Not to be confused with Joe Maddon  Joel Rueben Madden (born Joel Ryan Combs; March 11, 1979) is the lead vocalist for the American pop punk band Good Charlotte, as well as a record producer, actor, DJ, and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. He is also part of the pop rock collaboration The Madden Brothers with his twin brother Benji Madden.  Early life [ edit ]  Madden was born Joel Ryan Combs in Waldorf, Maryland, the son of Robin Madden and Roger Combs.[1] He has an identical twin, Benji Madden, who plays guitar and sings backing vocals in their band, Good Charlotte. He also has an older brother named Josh Madden who also works in the music industry, and a younger sister named Sarah Madden.[1] Madden attended La Plata High School.  Career [ edit ]  Good Charlotte [ edit ]  In 1995, at the age of 16, Joel Madden, his brother Benji, and a friend started their own band. The band was short-lived and the Maddens eventually recruited fellow high schoolers Paul Thomas, Aaron Escolopio, and Billy Martin to form their current band Good Charlotte. They took the name Good Charlotte from the children's book, Good Charlotte: Girls of the Good Day Orphanage, by Carol Beach York.[2]  Other projects [ edit ]  In the 2001 film Not Another Teen Movie, Joel and the other Good Charlotte members made a cameo as the band at the school's prom. He later had a cameo role in the 2004 film Fat Albert and in the 2006 film Material Girls with his brother Benji. He also had a guest appearance in the hit Nickelodeon musical comedy series The Naked Brothers Band, in which he joined the band for a performance.  Madden started a clothing line called MADE Clothing along with his brothers Benji and Josh. The line is now defunct. In early 2006 MADE Clothing became DCMA Collective. The line is owned by Joel, his brothers Benji Madden, Josh Madden, and friend Tal Cooperman. The Madden brothers also front a production team called Dead Executives.  In November 2007, Nicole Richie and Madden created The Richie Madden Children's Foundation. The charity will create and promote an online registry to inspire the purchases of items for moms and their families in need.[3] He is also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In 2010, with his brother, Madden contributed to ""We Are the World 25 for Haiti,"" a remake of the song ""We Are the World"" by USA for Africa, written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie.  On November 23, 2011, Madden was confirmed as one of the four vocal coaches in the first season of the Australian version of the reality singing competition The Voice.[4] His brother, Benji Madden was later his mentor on the show. Joel continued on as a coach in seasons two and three with Benji joining Joel as a coach on season 4 in 2015. Because of his commitments to The Voice Australia, he relocated to Sydney.  Joel is featured in Blood on the Dance Floor's fifth studio album on the track ""Incomplete and All Alone"" released on June 19, 2012. The track was available for free download with pre-orders of the album.[5]  In 2012, he joined the 11th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers.[6]  In 2013, he also provided songwriting and production assistance to the Australian band 5 Seconds of Summer on their first album. He has also helped write songs with them again for their later album Sounds Good Feels Good.  Joel featured in Alex Kunnari & Heikki L's single ""City of Sin"", released on July 12, 2013.[7]  Joel is now in a pop rock duo with his brother Benji called The Madden Brothers. They released the record ""Greetings from California"" on September 16, 2014. The album title Greetings from California comes from a conversation that the brothers had over breakfast one morning where they were reminiscing over how far they had come since the days of making music in their bedrooms.[8]  In 2015, he appears as guest in the American TV series Empire.  The Voice Australia [ edit ]  From the beginning of the show in 2012 to the end of the fifth season in 2016, Joel was a coach on The Voice Australia. He was also a coach with his brother Benji for The Voice Kids. In 2013, Joel won the Logie Award for Most Popular New Male Talent for his role as coach on the program.  Personal life [ edit ]  In July 2004, a 25-year-old Madden began dating teen idol Hilary Duff when she was 16.[9] After a long period of tabloid speculation, Duff's mother Susan announced their relationship in a June 2005 interview for Seventeen magazine.[10] In November 2006, Madden and Duff broke up.[11]  Madden started dating Nicole Richie in December 2006.[12] They have two children: daughter Harlow Winter Kate Madden (born January 11, 2008)[13] and son Sparrow James Midnight Madden (born September 9, 2009).[14] The couple confirmed their engagement in February 2010,[15] and married on December 11, 2010. Joel's brother Benji is married to actress Cameron Diaz.[16] Madden has residences in both Los Angeles and Sydney.  Madden has a trademark habit of chewing toothpicks[17] to help reduce the number of cigarettes he smokes a day.[18]  Growing up in Maryland, Madden and his brother became big fans of the Baltimore Orioles and the Washington Redskins.[citation needed]  Discography [ edit ]  With Good Charlotte [ edit ]  With The Madden Brothers [ edit ]  Guest appearances [ edit ]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1099

d5c412b6-9864-4f15-a6ba-21213321253e,"Despite all the she-said, she-said in the Taylor Swift/Katy Perry feud, Ed Sheeran said in a recent interview that he thinks the back-and-forth is overblown.  “I don’t think she needs [to be defended] at all,” he told People magazine at the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame 48th Annual Induction and Awards Gala. “I don’t think feud songs are a hot thing – there’s always been beef songs.” Sheeran specifically cited Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” as an example of a classic “diss track”; Simon revealed in 2015 that she penned the 1972 hit with Warren Beatty in mind.  Earlier this year, Perry incurred the wrath of many Swift fans after the release of her hit “Swish Swish,” which many interpreted as a direct attack on the “Wildest Dreams” singer.  “Don’t you come for me / No, not today / You’re calculated / I got your number / ‘Cause you’re a joker / And I’m a courtside killer queen,” one verse partly reads.  (As though confirming that the song was indeed about Swift, Perry changed the lyrics to hold a more conciliatory tone during a live-streamed concert: “God bless you on your journey, baby girl.” Days earlier, Perry had delivered that same line when chatting with Arianna Huffington about Swift.)  “I am ready to let it go,” she said at the time. “I forgive her and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from here. I think it’s actually like, I think it’s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I’m saying? … There’s a lot of other things out there in the world that people need to be focused on, and I truly, like God bless her on her journey. God bless her. Honestly.”  Earlier this month, Swift seemed to make a not-so-subtle point when she announced the release of her entire back catalog on all streaming services – just as Perry dropped her fourth studio album, Witness.  Perry and Swift’s fallout dates back to 2014, when Swift suggested in a Rolling Stone interview that Perry had once stolen backup dancers out from under her, effectively throwing a wrench in their friendship.  Swift’s hit from that same year, “Bad Blood,” is widely assumed to be about Perry.  As for Swift and Sheeran, their platonic friendship is rock-solid. “We’ve gotten matching Scottish folds, made each other arts and crafts Christmas presents, vacationed with our families, and had each other’s backs,” Swift told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “He is the James Taylor to my Carole King and I can’t imagine a time when he wouldn’t be.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,560

4974690c-131f-4ad7-a080-ab8cd3644da8,"NORRISTOWN, Pa. -- The judge in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial declared a mistrial Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked after five days of deliberations.  The jury informed Judge Steven T. O'Neill it was ""deadlocked on all counts"" in a note Saturday morning. O'Neill asked jurors if they were ""hopeless[ly] deadlocked,"" and each stood and agreed they were, CBS News' Vidya Singh reports.  O'Neill called the jury's effort ""one of the more courageous acts, one of the more selfless acts that I've seen in the justice system.""  ""I feel bad for all of you. I really do,"" he said.  Cosby remains free on bail.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said he will immediately retry the case.  ""We will evaluate and review our case. We will take a hard look at everything involved, and then we will retry it,"" Steele said at a press conference Saturday morning. ""As I said in court, our plan is to move this case forward as soon as possible.""  A courtroom sketch shows Cosby in court on Saturday, June 17, 2017. Jane Rosenberg  Andrea Constand, who accused Cosby of sexual assault, smiled and hugged supporters in the courtroom. Constand embraced many of the alleged victims who sat through the trial.  Gloria Allred, an attorney for many Cosby's accusers, said she will continue to pursue legal action.  ""We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity,"" Allred said. ""But justice will come... It's too early to celebrate, Mr. Cosby.""  Cosby's defense team declared victory and went on the attack, with spokesman Andrew Wyatt saying that ""Cosby's power is back.""  Cosby's wife, Camille Cosby, slammed prosecutors for bringing the case to court. She issued a statement calling Steele ""heinously and exploitively ambitious."" She also attacked the judge, the accuser's lawyers and the media.  The fast-moving case went to the jury of seven men and five women Monday, on day six of the trial, after closing arguments painted different pictures of what happened between Cosby and Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate in 2004. But the sequestered jury failed to reach a verdict, pausing a half-dozen times to revisit key evidence, including Cosby's decade-old admissions that he fondled Constand after giving her pills.  Late Thursday morning, the panel announced they were deadlocked, but the judge sent them back to work.  Cosby was charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each one punishable by up to 10 years behind bars.  The black comedian once known as America's Dad for his portrayal of kindly Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show"" suggested recently that race could have played a role in the case against him. The jury included two black members.  Cosby used his power and fame to violate Constand, an employee of Temple University's basketball program, Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden said in her opening statement. Constand, 44, testified last week that Cosby gave her three blue pills and then penetrated her with his fingers against her will as she lay paralyzed and half-conscious. She denied they had a romantic relationship and said she had rebuffed previous advances from him.  Cosby accuser stands by her story  ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen,"" Constand, 44, testified June 6. ""I wasn't able to fight in any way.""  She added: ""I wanted it to stop.""  Defense lawyer Brian McMonagle, however, attacked what he said were inconsistencies in Constand's story, disputed that Constand was incapacitated, and made the case that she and Cosby, who was married, had a romantic relationship. McMonagle said Cosby gave her the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl only after she complained she couldn't sleep.  Constand sued Cosby after prosecutors in 2005 declined to press charges. Cosby testified over a decade ago as part of that lawsuit, eventually settling with her for an undisclosed sum. Cosby didn't testify at the six-day trial. But jurors still heard plenty from him as prosecutors read them excerpts from his 2005 police statement and civil deposition.  The sole witness for the defense was the detective who led the 2005 investigation, Richard Schaffer, who previously took the stand during the prosecution's case. He was questioned for six minutes.  In his hour-and-a half closing statement, McMonagle told the jury that Cosby is a brilliant comedian who ""taught us how to smile,"" reports CBS Philadelphia. He said Constand told a ""stone cold lie,"" reports CBS News' Jericka Duncan -- and that while Cosby cheated on his wife, he didn't commit a crime.  Cosby's wife of 53 years, Camille -- in the courtroom for the first time Monday in the 6-day trial -- was stoic during the defense argument.  McMonagle turned towards Cosby and said, ""When you dance outside your marriage ... and you danced.""  He then pointed at Camille Cosby and shouted, ""And you deserved better.""  McMonagle pointed out that Constand telephoned Cosby dozens of times after the alleged assault. Constand told the jury she was merely returning his calls about the women's basketball squad at Temple University, where she worked as director of team operations and he was a member of the board of trustees.  Andrea Constand arrives during Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., on Wed., June 7, 2017. Cosby is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Constand at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. AP  ""This isn't talking to a trustee. This is talking to a lover,"" McMonagle said of one call that lasted 49 minutes. ""Why are we running from the truth of this case -- this relationship? Why? I don't understand it.""  Camille Cosby sat in the front row, across the aisle from Constand, who didn't react to McMonagle's two-hour closing but smiled at the end of it. Camille Cosby left when it was the prosecution's turn.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said in his closing argument Monday that the 79-year-old comedian's decade-old statements corroborate Constand's allegations that he drugged and violated her.  ""Drugging somebody and putting them in a position where you can do what you want with them is not romantic. It's criminal,"" Steele said in his closing argument.  Steele also reminded jurors about a telephone conversation in which Cosby apologized to Constand's mother and described himself as a ""sick man.""  ""This is where all the fancy lawyering can't get you around your own words,"" Steele said.  Bill Cosby arrives for his sexual assault trial with his wife Camille Cosby at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., Monday, June 12, 2017. Matt Rourke / AP  In his 2005 deposition, Cosby said he obtained several prescriptions for quaaludes in the 1970s and offered the now-banned sedatives to women he wanted to have sex with.  He also said he gave Constand three half-tablets of the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl before the ""petting"" began. Prosecutors have suggested he drugged her with something stronger - perhaps quaaludes.  His deposition was sealed for years until a judge released parts in 2015 at the request of The Associated Press, prompting a new set of prosecutors to take a fresh look at the case and charge him.  Some 60 women have come forward to say Cosby sexually violated them, all but destroying his nice-guy image, but the statute of limitations for prosecution had run out in nearly every case. Constand's case is the only one in which Cosby has been charged.  The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are sexual assault victims unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

9b14088d-4930-44d9-8199-5dc2233d7265,"Georgina Chapman, co-founder of the Marchesa fashion line, saw her label soar to prominence and profits—thanks in some measure to Harvey Weinstein, the rich and powerful movie mogul she married in 2007.  Now that Weinstein has become a pariah, engulfed in allegations of sexual harassment from well over a dozen women including famous actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow, Rose McGowan, and Ashley Judd, it’s widely believed that Chapman’s Marchesa label will suffer a dramatic fall—at least in Hollywood circles.  “No star is ever going to want to wear the brand again,” one publicist told the Hollywood Reporter.  Harvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman attend a Broadway show in New York in late 2015. Walter McBride—WireImage  That publicist asked to remain anonymous, and indeed, few sources will speak on the record or make any comment at all about Weinstein, Chapman, or Marchesa. It seems that the Weinstein scandal is so toxic that retailers, Hollywood insiders, and pros in the fashion business don’t want to be linked to it in any way.  In statements, Weinstein has said that has “behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain.” He officially resigned from the production firm he co-founded, the Weinstein Company, this week, and is believed to be seeking treatment in Arizona. A Weinstein spokesperson also said that “any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,” and “there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.”  Here’s what we know about what Weinstein has meant for Chapman and her Marchesa label—and how Chapman’s business interests and net worth could be impacted by the revelations about her husband.  Georgina Chapman’s Net Worth Before Her Split from Harvey Weinstein  Right after the first sexual misconduct allegations surfaced earlier this month, Weinstein said his wife was “100 percent behind me.” But Chapman soon announced she was separating from her husband. “My heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,” Chapman said in a released statement. “I have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.”  Weinstein responded to news of the separation by saying that he supports his wife’s decision. “I am in counseling and perhaps, when I am better, we can rebuild,” he said in a statement. “There has been a lot of pain for my family that I take full responsibility for.”  Chapman, 41, was born in London and attended the Chelsea College of Art and Design, where she met her future business partner, Keren Craig. The two co-founded Marchesa together in 2004, the same year that Chapman started dating Weinstein, 24 years her senior. Chapman has periodically worked as a model and actress. Marchesa launched a bridal line in 2008, roughly six months after Weinstein and Chapman were married.  Georgina Chapman prepares a model before Marchesa Bridal Presentation during New York Fashion Week in April. Slaven Vlasic—Getty Images  Chapman has an estimated net worth of £15 million, or roughly $20 million, compared to $250 million to $300 million for her husband, Harvey Weinstein. The couple sold a home in Connecticut for $1.65 million in early October, and still own two other oceanfront homes in Connecticut, each assessed at over $7 million. The couple hosted a lavish $38,500-per-person Barack Obama fundraiser in 2012 at their compound in the state.  Another home owned by Weinstein and Chapman—a 9,000-square-foot waterfront mansion in the Hamptons—was put on the market in August with an asking price of $12.4 million. The couple’s main home is a townhouse in New York City’s West Village, which they purchased for $15 million in 2007.  How these properties might be divided is a mystery. According to E! News, Chapman and Weinstein signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married in late 2007. The terms of their separation and likely divorce are unknown. “You would anticipate at least the vast majority of the financial side of this to be handled behind closed doors with the business managers,” a family law specialist told E!  It also remains murky how Chapman’s separation from Weinstein might impact her business interests, including Marchesa. Marchesa has not responded to MONEY’s requests for comment.  Actresses Tied to Harvey Weinstein Have Worn Marchesa on the Red Carpet for Years  Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Felicity Huffman, Kerry Washington and Jennifer Lawrence all wearing Marchesa. Getty Images (6)  With red carpet season on the horizon, the choice of designers worn by actresses will demonstrate implicitly how Hollywood feels about Marchesa—and, by extension, Chapman and Weinstein.  Ten years ago, the New York Times observed that Marchesa’s designs had enjoyed a “Short Walk to the Red Carpet,” with actresses like Jennifer Lopez and Sienna Miller wearing the previously low-profile label to events like the Golden Globes.  There was an explanation for why Marchesa was suddenly favored by A-listers: The gossip indicated that Weinstein, who was dating Chapman at the time and had provided funding for the brand, was in the habit of strong-arming actresses tied to his productions into wearing Marchesa dresses.  Now, many signs suggest the gossip was true. Felicity Huffman confirmed that Weinstein said he would not put money behind her film, Transamerica, unless she wore Marchesa on the red carpet. Many other actresses involved in Weinstein-backed films, including Renee Zellweger, Mischa Barton, Cate Blanchett, and Sienna Miller, also appear to have been asked to wear Marchesa during awards season.  At Least One Marchesa Partnership Has Folded  On October 5—the same day the New York Times published the first of multiple reports about Weinstein’s alleged sexual misconduct—Helzberg Diamonds announced the launch of a partnership with Marchesa for a line new of diamond engagement rings, priced from $2,499 to $9,499. It was supposed to be called the Marchesa Radiant Star Collection.  Soon, though, around the time that another bombshell story about Weinstein’s alleged harassment was published by the New Yorker, mention of Marchesa disappeared from Helzberg’s website. The Kansas City-based firm, which is owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, soon released a short statement, without elaborating, that “the company is not launching the Marchesa brand at this time,” to the Hollywood Reporter.  One wedding stylist told the New York Post that, generally speaking, the brand’s sales are likely to flail in the wake of the Weinstein scandal, and a fashion publicist said that Marchesa employees are trying to find other jobs. An anonymous retailer also told the Post that some stores will probably stop selling Marchesa products.  However, Marchesa dresses and jewelry are still widely available for purchase from major retailers such as Macy’s, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdoff Goodman.  While most retailers have chosen not to comment on Marchesa, Chapman, or Weinstein, at least one upscale seller has voiced support for the brand. “Bergdoff Goodman and Marchesa have been longtime partners — we were the first store to pick up the brand when it launched in 2004. We have been avid supporters of Georgina and Keren’s work ever since and hope to continue supporting the brand in the future,” Linda Fargo, a senior vice president for Bergdoff Goodman said recently, according to Women’s Wear Daily.  More Backlash Against Marchesa and Chapman to Follow?  “We all knew celebrities were asked to wear Marchesa if they were in a Weinstein movie,” the co-owner of a fashion communications company who asked to remain anonymous recently said to the New York Times. “They were supposed to wear it at least once. We all knew that cycle.”  Now, however, with Weinstein powerless and out of the picture, that cycle is broken. It is unclear if Chapman knew about any of the alleged misconduct on the behalf of her husband, but entertainment industry experts say her brand will suffer from guilt by association.  Georgina Chapman (right) and Harvey Weinstein (center) at a 2016 New York Fashion Week event. Theo Wargo—Getty Images for New York Fashio  Weinstein is “very much a figure who has been a bridge between Hollywood and the fashion worlds. So I think it’s going to be hard to disentangle Marchesa from his image,” Booth Moore, the fashion news director for the Hollywood Reporter, who has covered the Weinstein scandal extensively, explained in an interview with NPR. “I think that people really are voting with their dollars or, you know, really are emotional about the way that they spend money nowadays so that this scandal could affect the fortunes of Marchesa.”  Kim Vernon, the president and CEO of the Vernon Co. brand consultancy, told Women’s Wear Daily (WWD) that she “would expect that most of those actresses would distant [sic] themselves from wearing those gowns at their awards and red-carpet events.”  However, Vernon still thinks that Marchesa won’t necessarily be dropped by mainstream retailers, and that the brand could still have a promising future even if its dresses are never again regularly worn by stars: “I think they can have a successful business without Hollywood. They do a real business with the Notte second line and a lot of licensed products.”  Marchesa sales might not be affected much in some stores. One retailer spokesperson, who chose to remain anonymous, told WWD that Marchesa sales have been “really fantastic,” and that “our customer really hasn’t connected the dots that he [Weinstein] and she [Chapman] are married.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1823

83bb4305-7930-422c-8aa9-d6a7b41aafb4,"If you don’t already know about multi masking, you’ve probably seen it on Instagram. Come across any strange looking facemasks that contain a range of colours? Yep, that’s the one. The concept behind multi masking is pretty simple, really, different areas of your face tend to have different skin concerns, so while you might suffer from the odd blemish on your forehead and chin, your cheeks might be dry and your nose may have a lot of visible pores.  So, instead of using a tonne of different masks at different times, doesn’t it make WAY more sense to use them all at the same time? Well, yeah, obviously. It’s basically a bespoke facial and one of the most efficient way to sort out your skin at home (cause we can’t all have our own personal facialist).  Chances are you’ve probably already got all the products you need sitting on your bathroom shelf. First things first, work out what masks you need for which areas; clay masks or ones containing zit zapping ingredients like tea tree oil are perfect for spotty areas.  If you want to get that deep down clean try a peel off mask, they get stuck into your pores and when you take them off they pull out all the gunk: the results are pores so small you couldn’t even see ’em with a magnifying glass.Plus, the peel off masks are super satisfying (we might be addicted?).  Finally, for the rest of your face, go for a brightening mask, generally speaking this will contain glycolic acid or some sort of resurfacing exfoliator. If your skin is on the drier side, or is sensitive, try a hydrating mask instead.  Watch our Beauty Writer Gabrielle show you how it’s done in this quick how to video and you’ll be mastering multi masking in no time.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,364

Now, in a revealing tell-all exclusive interview with RadarOnline.com, Reynolds confirms all those rumors that have long swirled around his sexuality, opens up about his past struggles with drugs and alcohol, and explains how he finally plans to move forward with his life. “Today,” he told Radar, “I accept myself as a bisexual man.”  Ever since I have been in the public eye, people have been speculating on my sexuality. And ‘speculating’ is a kind word for how it actually played out. With anger and disdain, people have been calling me out as gay, closeted, a sham and even nastier; much nastier.  PHOTOS: Bella Thorne Comes Out As Bisexual  I have come to a point in my life where I am ready to discuss my truth. I wasn’t ready to do this then — I wasn’t even ready to think about it, let alone process it. To understand my journey and how I got to this point, you need to understand a little about me.  I am the youngest of six children in a Southern Baptist family. We grew up in a three-bedroom mobile home in Horsepasture, Virginia. We were deeply religious; when we weren’t in church we were in school or an after-school activity. My life was filled with vacation bible school, missionary meetings, Sunday school, choir practice and youth ministry.  Life was not nuanced or frivolous, nor did it allow any time for introspection. It was clear and proscribed, black and white, angels or sinners. And people who were intimate with others of their own gender were the worst of all with no chance of redemption, or the glorious afterlife that I was taught awaited us all.  As a black man, that message and the hate and homophobia were multiplied to the nth degree. I saw no path out that would resolve my personal feelings with my deeply held and ingrained religious beliefs.  PHOTOS: Will Smith Responds To $2M ‘Gay’ Cover-Up Scandal  This internal dissonance was a powerful thing, like a cancer eating at one’s soul. This resulted in some tough times — homelessness, unemployment, dependence on drugs and alcohol, public assistance, and, at the center of it all, a deep, deep shame and a feeling of unworthiness of the love of God. I didn’t believe I deserved to live a good life, and I clearly didn’t.  My journey to the light was not a quick one nor an easy one. I threw myself into getting the best education I could, getting three degrees, and working harder than anyone else. I was a classic overachiever, suppressing the real issues of my life. I became a workaholic and have been on Wall Street, a banker, an academic and a consultant.  I was not only getting educated about business and the professional life, I was getting exposed to a far different life than I had known growing up. “I saw people from all walks of life, with multi-dimensional points of views and lifestyles I could only imagine.  Their ability to navigate the business world and have a fulfilling personal life was a revelation to me — you can have it all. So, I sought out my own happiness and the life that would fulfill me — not the life that I had been taught was my destiny.  PHOTOS: Hollywood’s Gay & Bisexual Community  Along the way there have been speed bumps and sinkholes. And at the same time, I have met presidents, kings, top athletes and great entertainers. I have hit the highest of high notes and had the lowest of moments. But I have learned gratitude for the lessons my merciful Savior has allowed me to experience and process. And I have become tougher, more empathetic, more open-minded and able to love greater, deeper and better, especially myself.  Today I accept myself as a bisexual man. I have learned that sexual orientation is not binary, at least for me. I am capable of loving both sexes, and I have done both. My relationships, all of them, have been honest and based on my attraction to the other person. When I am in love I don’t equivocate, nor do I waver.  I tell this story to both encourage my personal path, as well as give some small measure of hope to others that no matter your beginnings, no matter the obstacles, there is nothing so fulfilling and Godlike as living the life that was destined.  I will not live in fear or shame any longer. I will revel in the light of my truth and bask in the light of my Savior Jesus Christ who loves me and accepts me exactly as He created me.

fb649c22-6474-43f6-8ad3-e6827cc96e9a,"Scott Disick is arguably the greatest reality TV character to grace the screens of the E! network, so it's an outright tragedy that the man doesn't have his own Wikipedia entry. This isn't fan laziness, though; it's clear that at one point, Disick did have his own page, but it's since been deleted. Perhaps the man values his privacy or this is another example of Kris Jenner trying to control the family's branding. Whatever the reason, we did a little digging, some actual reporting, and a lot of gathering to bring you the Wikipedia entry LD deserves:  Scott Disick  [edit]  Scott ""Lord"" Disick (born May 26, 1983[1]) is an American television personality and entrepreneur. He is best known for being the boyfriend of Kourtney Kardashian and father to their three children: Mason Dash, Penelope Scotland and Reign Aston.[2]  Disick has played himself on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kourtney & Kim Take New York, Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord, Punk'd[3], Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, and Kourtney & Khloé Take the Hamptons.[4]  Early Life  Scott Disick grew up in Eastport, NY. He was an only child to parents Jeffrey and Bonnie Disick.[5] Disick was arrested twice by the time he was 18, once for speeding and once for driving under the influence.[6]  Disick attended The Ross School, a private school in East Hampton.[7] He did not, however, graduate from Ross. [Source: Kristen Hyland, Director of Public Relations].  There were plenty of rumors about Disick in high school, and he was supposedly a hard partier. His nickname at the time was STD.[8] As a teen, Disick modeled and appeared on the cover of young adult books.[9]  Parents  There are conflicting stories about Disick's parents and their wealth. According to one source, the family lost its fortune.[10] Other sources say they were wealthy real estate developers and that Disick inherited his money from them.[11] Disick's grandfather, David M. Disick, was an attorney who became a successful fractional real estate developer, and has developed multiple luxury properties.[12]  Disick's father was arrested in December 2001 for allegedly stealing $3,000 from a bank in the North Fork and was sentenced to 140 hours of community service.[13] At the time, Jeffrey and Bonnie Disick were reportedly in the hole more than $391,000 thanks to liens and judgements filed by a number of sources, including the federal government.[14]  At the age of 63, Disick's mother Bonnie died October 2013 after a ""long illness.""[15] Three months later, his father Jeffrey passed away.[16] Both causes of death are unclear; Scott has said that his father suffered from cancer. According to a source, he was living in a Los Angeles nursing home when he died.[17]  Career  Disick has tried his hand at many entrepreneurial ventures. He has released a tanning product for men called Monte Carlo (tag line: ""It's like liquid sunshine."")[18] and has also worked on a line of menopause supplements for men called Amidren by Scott Disick.[19][20] He has said that he has, ""done a lot of private label manufacturing in the nutrition biz"" and ""raised money for startup companies.""[21] He also opened a Japanese restaurant in New York, Ryu, but soon cut ties with it.[22] It has since closed.[23]  Though Disick has said he works for GNC[24][25], a company rep denies that claim, saying, ""Scott Disick does not work for GNC and the company has no business relationship with him.""

Kardashian family friend and Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis has said he introduced them at a party at his home.[31]  Keeping Up With the Kardashians debuted in 2007, and the drama of the couple's relationship became a popular subplot.

One year after welcoming twins Ella and Alexander, the couple reflected on how their son and daughter will react when they learn about how children were taken from their parents who are caught illegally crossing the border.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “At some point in the future our children will ask us: ‘Is it true, did our country really take babies from their parents and put them in detention centers?’ And when we answer yes, they’ll ask us what we did about it. What we said. Where we stood,” the Clooneys said in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE. “We can’t change this administration’s policy but we can help defend the victims of it.”  They added, “Today, the Clooney Foundation for Justice will donate $100,000 to the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights.”  The Clooney Foundation has also sponsored the resettlement of Syrian and Yazidi refugees in the U.S.  Amal and George Clooney Albert L. Ortega/Getty  RELATED: The Most Heartbreaking Photos of Children at the U.S.-Mexico Border — and How You Can Help  The Young Center’s Executive Director, Maria Woltjen, thanked the couple for their support during this “vital” time.  “This Administration’s policy disregards international law and basic principles of human decency. To treat children in such a cruel manner not only violates their legal rights but also their basic needs,” she said in a statement. “We are doing everything we can to advocate on behalf of the thousands of children who are separated and alone, and we are grateful for the generous support of George and Amal Clooney and the Clooney Foundation for Justice — it could not be more vital at this time.”  John Moore/Getty Images  The Clooneys join a number of other stars who have blasted the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, which prosecutes undocumented immigrants who cross the border between the U.S. and Mexico. Since implementing the policy, more than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents since April, according to the Associated Press.  After House Speaker Paul Ryan shared a Father’s Day post on Twitter talking about how his life changed when he became a dad, John Legend shot back, “Seriously, f— you. Reunite the families at the border and we can talk about father’s day.”  RELATED: Fundraiser to Reunite Migrant Parents with Their Children Raises Over $6 Million in 4 Days – After Initially Aiming at Raising $1,500  The tweet came days after Legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen, announced they were making a $288K donation to the ACLU on President Trump’s birthday to draw attention to the “immigrant families seeking asylum and refuge in America being ripped apart due to the inhumane policies of the Trump administration.”  Kathy Griffin, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Reese Witherspoon, Ellen DeGeneres and more celebrities also spoke out against the current conditions.  Hans-Maximo Musielik/AP/REX/Shutterstock  In her first public commentary about President Trump and his administration, former First Lady Laura Bush wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post that was published on Father’s Day and criticized the immigration policies.  “I live in a border state. I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,” Mrs. Bush wrote.  President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty  In another surprising move, current First Lady Melania Trump released a statement about her husband’s controversial immigration policy.  “Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families,” her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, told PEOPLE.  Grisham added that her boss is calling on Democrats and Republicans to fix the nation’s immigration crisis.  “[She] hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,” Grisham said, adding that Mrs. Trump “believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,785
898b6089-9c38-401f-8067-adf5de9120db,"Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that Hollywood elites killed his unborn child and destroyed the relationship he had with the child’s mother, Selena Gomez, as a way of punishing him.  Since finding God last year, Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Wednesday he shared what he called “the worst moment in my life” with the congregation and explained why he had to retire from the music industry.  Telling churchgoers that he will “never go back” to the “evil music industry” until the “pedophiles and monsters at the top of the game are run out of town” and everything is “disinfected with bleach and sunshine,” Bieber explained how Hollywood elites tried to corrupt him.  “They tried so hard to corrupt me,” Bieber said, “because I reached a level they couldn’t control anymore.”  “They tried to destroy me with alcohol and when that didn’t work they tried with drugs – all different kinds. Then when that didn’t work they tried to destroy me with ambition.”  “I was interested at first,” Bieber acknowledged, before saying “but when I realized what the price of admission is in that world, I had to quit.”  “Selena and I were expecting. It was early days and we hadn’t told anyone. At the same time I was being courted by some really powerful people, the most powerful people in Hollywood.”  Describing a top-secret party attended by record industry executives, Bieber said he was shown into a back room where a group of men wearing masks were sitting around the edge of the room, drinking from cups. In the center of the room a dead child was sitting cross-legged, propped up against the back of a chair. It looked like a late-stage fetus and was completely drained of blood.  “The baby’s entire scalp wasn’t there. Its skull had been stripped down to the surface of the bone. Portions of the right side of its undeveloped little face had been torn away. You could see bite marks and bruises all over its tiny body.”  “They were wearing animal masks, sitting around drinking what they called ‘red wine.’ They offered me some. It was obvious that it was really important for them that I got involved.  “I literally gagged at this point. One of them boasted the baby had been alive for eight hours after they started cutting it and draining its blood.”  “When he described the pain the baby went through, he seemed pleased with himself.”  The horrific death described by Bieber to his congregation is called “exsanguination”, otherwise known as completely draining a person of blood. The practice is popular among drinkers of baby blood who consume what they call “red wine” in order to get high on the adrenaline, young hormones, and negative energy they believe is found in the blood of children.  They believe the more a child suffers before its death, the more “enriched” its blood will be upon harvest. Often the child is physically and sexually abused before it is killed in order to create the necessary trauma.  Bieber refused to drink the blood and that is when “everything started going wrong.”  “They threatened me. They said they knew Selena was pregnant. They asked if I wanted my baby to end up like the one in the center of the room.”  “This completely flipped me out and I lost my way for a long time. I went off the rails,” said Bieber, fighting back tears. “They murdered my unborn child. Me and Selena… we were driven apart by these people and the trauma.”  But years have passed since the traumatic episode and Bieber has vowed to protect her and become a family man. Acknowledging rumors that the pair are back together, Bieber even hinted he is set to become a family man.  “They won’t lay a hand on my family so help me God,” he said.  “There are truly evil forces at work in the world. God is real. Satan is real,” Bieber said, before exiting the stand.  These latest allegations from Justin Bieber add to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.  According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy “people with parasitic interests” who “see you as their prey.” In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.”  If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‘fake news.’ But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood system.  In recent months Nicole Kidman, Mel Gibson and Lindsay Lohan have spoken out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry – and it cost them their lives.  Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. As more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1061

46da1d5c-7a86-4052-b98a-4b3461d09ea0,"Usher performs at the Openair Frauenfeld Music Festival in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, July 6, 2017. (Photo: Nick Soland, EPA)  Usher has responded for the first time to accusations he exposed sex partners to genital herpes, filing a legal document containing a broad denial without actually specifying whether he has or had the sexually transmitted disease.  Usher's lawyers on Tuesday filed an answer to a lawsuit brought last month in Los Angeles Superior Court by Quantasia Sharpton and an unnamed man and unnamed woman who claim to have been Usher's sexual partners.  Usher is seeking to have their lawsuit dismissed, citing a ""general denial"" of its allegations and 13 more specific reasons why he claims the suit has no merit.  His reasons include legal technicalities, such as the statute of limitations, lack of standing by plaintiffs, the improper joining of plaintiffs in one suit, insufficient facts, and failure to meet legal standards.  But the singer also argues that any of his alleged conduct was ""unintentional,"" and that the plaintiffs themselves have ""unclean hands."" That's a legal doctrine meaning a plaintiff is not entitled to a remedy because the plaintiff has acted unethically or in bad faith in some way.  ""Plaintiffs are barred from recovery for alleged willful conduct by Defendant because any alleged conduct by Defendant, which is expressly denied, was unintentional,"" the singer's response says.  Usher asserted that he ""was not the cause of any alleged harm"" suffered by the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs ""assumed the risk"" of any alleged harm.  The lawsuit should be dismissed, Usher argues, ""because any harm that any plaintiff alleges to have suffered was caused in whole or in part by that plaintiff's own negligence."" He does not specify the nature of the alleged negligence.  Usher's four-page response to the Sharpton lawsuit is his first official statement about the case since Sharpton and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, announced their pursuit of the singer (full name Usher Raymond IV) for allegedly not disclosing an STD diagnosis prior to sexual contact.  California law says that individuals who know they have an STD are guilty of a misdemeanor if they do not disclose their status to partners before engaging in sexual acts.  At a press conference last month, Sharpton said she does not have herpes. But she claimed there are ""others"" who do but are too embarrassed to say so publicly.  ""I am doing this so that he does not do this to anyone else,"" she said, urging the singer to reveal his status. ""Usher, if you are negative, please say so. If you are positive, you need to warn your sex partners, so that they can make their own informed decisions.”  The Sharpton lawsuit, which does not specify how much the plaintifs are seeking in damages, asserts that Usher contracted herpes before his encounters with the plaintiffs. Bloom said those happened after 2012.  Bloom called Usher's response to the lawsuit ""a standard legal answer. We look forward to taking Usher's deposition soon and to proving our case in court,"" she told USA TODAY.  Usher's publicist has not yet responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.  CLOSE Attorney Lisa Bloom says 3 of her clients had sex with pop icon Usher. According to Bloom, her clients said Usher did not disclose he had genital herpes before having sex.

He also served as one of the show's co-head writers from 2012 to 2015, and came back as one of the show's head writers in December 2017.[3][4][5][6]  Early life [ edit ]  Colin Jost was born and raised on Staten Island, New York.[7][8][9] He has one brother, Casey Jost, who had a role in Staten Island Summer and is a writer for Impractical Jokers.[10] His mother, Kerry J.

5fea24ea-5371-469f-bd22-5f2b2109f1b5,"The Kardashian-Jenner baby boom has been taking the world over by storm. From fans and followers popping up with theories and speculations on three sisters of the clan being pregnant at the same time, more spice has been added with this latest input from an insider.  According to sources, a new report claims that all these pregnancies were planned and coordinated by Kris Jenner as a ploy to secure better Keeping Up with the Kardashians ratings. All for a prospective $25 million that's supposed to come their way from this news!  Also read: Did Kris Jenner's bff just confirm Kylie's pregnancy?  The 61-year-old Kris Jenner's 'momager' skills have always been top notch and it's no secret. She claimed it herself when the shocking videos of Kim K's sex tape's had been revealed. But this news – if true – clearly takes away the crown as the biggest planned ploy ever.  Not to mention, the most bizarre, wildest one too! Both Khloe Kardashian, 34 and Kylie Jenner, 20 are expecting their first babies with their beaus, Tristan Thompson, 26 and Travis Scott, 25 respectively.  Kim, on the other hand, is expecting her third baby via surrogate. And get this – they all are due around the same time next year! Could this really be just a really smart, orchestrated move? Or are the claims just baseless rumours?  ""Kris knew having three daughters simultaneously expecting would bring drama, tears, attention, competition — everything she's trying to sustain for the sake of bigger paydays,"" an insider reported Star magazine. As reported by Star, the ratings of KUWTK were down last season. Is this Kris Jenner's extremely well-crafted revival strategy?  ""All three sisters have been promised endorsement deals, TV specials and even books. They're looking forward to majorly cashing in and breathing new life into their careers,"" the source said. Clearly, as Kris seemed to have been convinced, the triple baby boom news is doing its bit, if the source's claims are authentic.  ""She can't wait for all the attention,"" the source continues to explain. ""But, more importantly, for the cash to start rolling in."" This clearly refers to the alleged $25 million that the Kardashian-Jenner women are reportedly making off the baby news announcement and deals that have been offered to them.  Guess it's safe to conclude that this tweet stands proven right!  Like they say...the devil works hard but Kris Jenner works harder. https://t.co/CsSApFoErx pic.twitter.com/aNYyH3qny9 — Yashar Ali ? (@yashar) September 30, 2017  ""These sisters have everything to lose, so it's worth doing anything they can to keep ratings up and storylines fresh,"" revealed the insider. ""And that includes triple pregnancies."" Well, while neither of them confirmed their pregnancy rumours except for Kim, the sisters were spotted in baggy attire recently.  And they might have dropped some passive hints on their social media accounts too! While sources have confirmed to multiple entertainment magazines that the rumours are true and the pregnant couples are absolutely thrilled, could this be just another stunt they pulled for money? Will they actually do that?  We all know that Kim's first choice for her surrogate was Khloe, and it was then revealed that the latter has fertility issues. Kylie, on the other hand, is the youngest and at the peak of her make-up mogul career. Would they consciously, strategically ""plan"" and make it happen?  Knowing Kris Jenner, anything is possible, but given Khloe's history and Kylie's relationship term with Travis Scott, it sounds a little strange that all of them would just agree on a whim and control the entire process.  Like, this has to be considered..  Their mama is not the fertile queen regardless all three can take care of them babies financially A baby is a blessing all day — Sollatina (@sollatina) September 27, 2017  And no matter how much the younger sisters seem to have ""timed their pregnancies to coincide with Kim's,"" this just seems way too biologically advanced.

a7b629e2-1d5e-4067-94ec-e8cca3b4bbad,"Ronald Lyle Goldman (July 2, 1968 – June 12, 1994) was an American restaurant waiter and a friend of Nicole Brown Simpson; they were killed in 1994 at her Brentwood, Los Angeles home. Nicole's ex-husband, O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of their murders in 1995, but found liable for both deaths in a 1997 civil suit.  Early life [ edit ]  Goldman was born on July 2, 1968. He grew up in the community of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, near Chicago. His parents divorced in 1974 when he was six and, after spending a brief time in the custody of his mother, Sharon (Fohrman) Rufo, he was raised by his father, Fred Goldman, and lived with him and his younger sister, Kim Goldman.[2][3]  Goldman grew up Jewish.[4][5] He attended high school at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. He was a student at Illinois State University for one semester (where he planned to major in psychology) and a pledge to Sigma Nu fraternity before he followed his family to southern California at age 18.[6]  When younger, Goldman had worked as a camp counselor and had volunteered to help disabled children.[7][8]  In California [ edit ]  While living in Los Angeles, Goldman took some classes at Pierce College.[7] He learned to surf and enjoyed playing beach volleyball, rollerblading, nightclubbing,[9] and working out.  Upon arriving in California, he lived independently from his family and supported himself by working as an employment headhunter and tennis instructor. He then worked a string of waiter jobs.[7] He also occasionally did work as a model for Barry Zeldes, owner of Z90049 (the store next to the California Pizza Kitchen in Brentwood Gardens, where he had worked before Mezzaluna).[6] Not long before his death, he had earned an Emergency Medical Technician's license but decided not to pursue that career.[7]  Instead, Goldman told friends that he wanted to open a bar or restaurant in the Brentwood area.[7] He had shared with friends his vision of opening a future restaurant or bar characterized not by a name, but by the ankh, an Egyptian religious symbol of life that matched the tattoo on his shoulder.[6] According to his friend, Jeff Keller, he wanted to learn all facets of the restaurant-bar business, and occasionally worked as a promoter[6] at a Century City dance club called Tripps.[7] For Memorial Day, he participated with a group of event promoters in organizing a party at Renaissance, a club and restaurant on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.[6]  Goldman had also expressed aspirations to act and to be on a show, and he appeared as a contestant on the short-lived game show Studs in 1992.[10]  Friendship with Nicole Brown [ edit ]  According to a June 15, 1994 Los Angeles Times article published three days after his death, Goldman probably met Brown six weeks before they were killed, when he borrowed her Ferrari. They grew increasingly close, accompanying each other to dance clubs, and meeting for coffee and dinner during the month-and-a-half before they died. According to police and friends, their relationship was platonic. According to the article, he had borrowed her car when he met his friend, Craig Clark, for lunch. According to Clark, he told him it was her car, but that he did not say she was his girlfriend. ""He said they were friends.""[11]  Death [ edit ]  On the evening of Sunday, June 12, 1994, Goldman was a waiter at Mezzaluna Trattoria, a restaurant located at 11750 San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood. Brown had called there to report that her mother, Juditha Brown, had accidentally left her sunglasses on the table.[11] After a quick search, they were discovered in the gutter outside the restaurant. Although he had not served her table, he agreed to take them to her home after work.  Before returning the sun glasses, Goldman stopped at his apartment, located at 11663 Gorham Avenue in Brentwood. He had after-work plans with his friend, Stewart Tanner, Mezzaluna's bartender, who said: ""He was going to go home and change and then we were going to go out."" The Los Angeles Times reports, ""Goldman punched out at 9:33 pm and stayed another 15 minutes to have a bottled water at the bar. Then he left, still in his uniform, black pants and white shirt, his tie shed. He carried the glasses that Brown wanted to be returned to her. 'I'll see you later,' he called to Tanner as he walked out.""[6]  When Goldman arrived at Brown's residence, at 875 South Bundy Drive, he was stabbed to death along with her, on the walkway leading to the condominium. He was just a few weeks shy of his 26th birthday.[6] During a reconstruction of the events, the police came to believe he had arrived during or shortly after Nicole's death.[citation needed]  His body, along with Brown's, was found shortly after midnight, when police arrived at the crime scene.  Goldman is buried at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.[12]  Trials and aftermath [ edit ]  Simpson was tried for the murders of both Brown and Goldman. In October 1995, after a public trial that lasted nearly nine months, he was acquitted. In a 1997 civil trial, a jury found him liable for the wrongful death of Goldman and awarded $19.5 million in damages to his family. Simpson was subsequently jailed for an unrelated armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2008.[13][14]  The rights to Simpson's book, If I Did It, a first-person account of how he would have committed the murders had he committed them, were awarded to the Goldman family in August 2007. They were granted the proceeds from the book in 2007 as part of the $33.5 million civil jury award against him they had been trying to collect for over a decade. They own the copyright, media rights, and movie rights.[15]  They also acquired Simpson's name, likeness, life story, and right of publicity in connection with the book, according to court documents, ensuring he would not be able to profit from the book. After renaming the book If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer, the Goldman family published it in September 2007 through Beaufort Books.[16]  Foundation [ edit ]  The Goldman family contributed a portion of proceeds from the If I Did It book sales to the newly founded Ron Goldman Foundation for Justice.[17] It provides grants for multiple organizations and programs that provide resources to victims and survivors of violent crimes.[18] One of the largest donors to the foundation is Las Vegas executive Mark Goldman, Fred's first cousin.  Portrayals [ edit ]  Goldman was portrayed by Paul Witten in the TV movie The O. J. Simpson Story. He was portrayed by Russ Russo in Reenactment of the Century. He will be portrayed by Oliver Walker in Joshua Newton’s upcoming 2019 film Nicole & O.J..  See also [ edit ]",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1411
f6be10be-0535-4e66-b62b-ca7325194b3c,"“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access. As Noah said, “Don’t talk about guns.”  Colbert closed out The Late Show ’s introductory monologue with a firm address directly to Trump: “Doing nothing is cowardice.” he said. “You want to make America great again? Do something the past two presidents haven’t been able to do: Pass any kind of common-sense gun control legislation.”  Former 'Daily Show' correspondents Samantha Bee and Jason Jones on falling in love:",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,887

3e6b24c1-c2a0-486a-97f5-3c6ec3f4030d,"Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall rang in her 70th birthday on July 17, so what better time to look at one of the most important relationships in her life? The connection that she has with her two high-profile stepsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, is one that has evolved from some very dark times into something that those around them likely doubted they would ever see. By the time William and Harry were born, their father, Prince Charles, had not only long ago ended his relationship with Camilla, but he didn't see her socially as a friend, either. Charles and Camilla had been romantically involved in their early 20s, but Charles's naval career took him away to sea, and he ended the relationship. Camilla married her ex-boyfriend Andrew Parker-Bowles, and Charles wrote to his godfather, ""I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually.""  The pair initially remained friends and lived near each other. The Parker-Bowles were regular visitors to Charles's country home Highgrove, and Charles was made godfather to their son Tom. When Charles and Diana got engaged, he stopped seeing Camilla socially, and so William and Harry never met her as young boys — but they certainly heard about her. When Charles and Diana's marriage broke down and they both sought affection elsewhere, Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger toward the woman Diana called ""Charles's lady.""  Charles and Diana separated in 1992, and after five years, he made moves to introduce his sons to the woman he hoped would one day be his wife. In the Summer of 1997, Charles sat down with William and Harry, explained a little about their relationship, and broached the subject of them all meeting — but William especially was resistant, and Charles knew it would be best to leave it for the time being.  ""Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger towards the woman Diana called 'Charles's lady.'  Diana died two months later, which naturally meant for Charles that it was all about supporting his sons. Over the next year, Charles and Camilla kept their relationship low-key; it was easier to work on building the relationship between Camilla and the queen.  Over time, the princes could see that Camilla made their father happy. At the age of 16, William took charge of the inevitable and finally instigated a meeting in June 1998 at the London residence he and Harry lived at with their father, York House at St James's Palace. They spoke on their own for half an hour, and it was reported that it went well, but that afterward, Camilla came out and said ""I need a drink."" They went on to meet for lunch and afternoon tea soon after and continued getting to know each other. Harry's first meeting with Camilla was more straightforward and came a couple of weeks later, over tea at Highgrove along with her children, Tom and Laura.  Over the next seven years, the relationship between Camilla, William, and Harry was built very slowly. When the boys organized a 50th birthday party for Charles in November 1998, they invited Camilla to sit with Charles, although their relationship at that point was still very tentative. Camilla started to stay over at York House when William and Harry were in town, but when they were all at Highgrove together, she would drive back to her own house nearby after dinner, out of respect for the fact that it used to be Diana's house, too.  By the time Charles and Camilla married in 2005, things were significantly better between the two boys and Camilla. Shortly afterward, Harry said in an interview, ""She's a wonderful woman, and she's made our father very, very happy, which is the most important thing. William and I love her to bits."" A further 12 years on from the wedding, and the brothers have now developed a warm, respectful, and loving relationship with their stepmother. It's telling that Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at William and Kate's wedding, and Harry even brought along a toy for her to play with. Camilla and Kate are also close. When Kate got married, Camilla gave her a special bracelet inscribed with both of their initials and has been best-placed to guide her through the ups and downs of marrying into one of the most famous families in the world.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,856

ca8dc17d-b238-412f-84bb-798c59ef912a,"The obsession with “the base” is equally misleading. By definition, the “base” of a president’s support is the part of the electorate that is so passionate about the victor on election day that it takes immense problems and a long time to shake their support. Most presidents, including Richard Nixon, don’t lose their base. In a look at Watergate, Iran-Contra, and the Monica Lewinsky scandals, Julia Azari, Perry Bacon Jr., and Harry Enten found that the party base remained loyal to the president until the very end. Using the “base is still with him” standard is a little like saying that in a bad season the 30-year NFL season-ticket holder who never misses a game, who hosts a massive tailgate party every Sunday, who owns every piece of team paraphernalia sold at the team store, and who spends most of the non-working day checking his or her smartphone to see the latest injury report, still loves his or her team.  There are much better ways through which to evaluate the president that offer us a better understanding of how Trump has performed thus far.  What are some ways in which Trump can claim that the critics have been wrong? In terms of using executive power to pursue his policy agenda, the president has a pretty stellar record. This is one area in office where he has boldly used presidential power to fulfill the promises that he has made on the campaign trail. His number one target has been regulations to curb climate change and high-risk financial investments. Starting from his first days in office, he has issued a series of executive orders that roll back actions taken under President Obama. Scott Pruitt at the EPA has moved aggressively against environmental protections and courted business interests who want more development. While his plan to build a wall along the southern border has stalled in Congress, Trump has relied on executive power to ramp up the detention and deportation of illegal immigrants. When the repeal and replace of ACA floundered, the Department of Health and Human Services has used all of its administrative power to render the Affordable Care Act ineffective. President Trump also ended vital subsidies for health-insurance providers that kept state-insurance markets stable. He declared an end to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program through executive fiat, eliminating the protections that Obama had granted to undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. To be sure, some of his efforts have been turned back by the courts, such as his early attempts to implement a ban on travelers from several mostly Muslim nations. Overall, however, the president receives high marks from his success at deploying this power.  The economy is also doing well. Though the president has not crafted any policies that diminish the middle- and working-class insecurity that motivated so many of his core supporters in states like Wisconsin, the stock market is booming; unemployment remains low.

On an episode of the WTF With Marc Maron podcast, she said they aren't really friends anymore.  “[We’re] probably not as friendly as we could be, no,” she said. “There are too many aspects of it that just prevented us from ever moving forward [from the] past. We dated from when I was, like, 18, 19 until 25ish.”  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Last week, during an episode of Dax Shepherd's podcast, she implied that her breakup with Macaulay was mostly her fault.  Getty Images Ethan Miller  “And it’s f*cked up what I did,"" she said. ""It’s f*cked up what I did and it’s f*cked up how I did it. When I got to be single I said, ‘I just need to figure myself out.’ I genuinely need to know why I did what I did, and, like, regroup myself as a human being.”  She didn't say exactly what happened, but she did say that she was a ""d*ck"" during their breakup, which could explain why they're no longer friends. Although, she also said their friends have forgiven her for what happened (whatever that is).  “You know, it’s been so long like I feel like enough time has gone by,” Mila said. “I think enough mutual friends have been like, everybody kind of forgave everybody for what went down.”    Since their split, they've both started seeing (and marrying) other people.

ffd0ae20-4f7c-4fb5-88a3-96977d87505d,"Media playback is not supported on this device Biles hopes sharing abuse story will encourage others to speak out  Simone Biles says it was a ""relief"" and ""empowering"" to speak out about being the victim of sexual abuse by jailed US Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.  In January 2018 Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years after nearly 160 women accused him of sexual abuse.  Biles, 21, then told her own story of how she was one of those victims.  ""It was very hard but I figured out that if I can tell my story then it might encourage other people to tell theirs,"" she said.  Biles, who won four gold medals and a bronze at the Rio Olympics in 2016, said she wanted to speak out about the reaction to her revelation and her responsibility as a role model.  She came back from a two-year career break to win her fifth US national title in August while wearing a teal leotard - the designated colour to represent survivors of sexual abuse.  And she returns to international competition at the World Championships in Qatar this month.  ""I think it was very important to support the fellow gymnasts it had happened to and to speak up for what you believe in and say 'I don't think this is right' and I hope I gave them courage to come out and tell their stories one day if they want to,"" she said.  ""People do look up to me so if they can see Simone can be strong enough then hopefully I can too - and that's the message I wanted to give.  ""It kind of felt empowering even though I know that is an overused word right now.""  Ohio-born Biles says she was ""relieved"" after speaking out, after feeling ""a lot of pressure"" to keep the truth to herself for so long.  Biles praised Judge Rosemarie Aquilina who sentenced Nasser, and she says he ""got what he deserved"".  ""The judge was absolutely amazing on her part, so we were very proud of her, and it is kind of a relief because [Nassar] got what he deserved and he almost got as many years [in prison] as [he abused] girls.  ""It's kind of crazy because I can't be the one to save everything, but as long as I do my job and everyone is pleased maybe I'll save something.""  Simone Biles wears a teal leotard to show her solidarity for sexual abuse victims  Looking beyond the World Championships in Doha, which run from 24 October to 3 November, Biles is focused on preparing for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 and says that not being a ""rookie"" anymore means she is a mentor to the younger members of the squad - and has learnt to manage expectations.  ""I pushed a lot of things away because expectations are scary and I don't want to be the one to hold all of them, but as I get older I just become used to it,"" she said.  ""For my first Olympics Games to walk away with five medals is unbeatable even for myself, so we'll just go in there [Tokyo] with an open mind and see what happens.""  Analysis  BBC sports news correspondent Natalie Pirks  I've been lucky enough to see Simone Biles compete before, particularly in Rio when she cemented her name in gymnastics legend. But I had never seen her perform this close up. There is no fuss with Biles. No ego, no entourage - unless you count her mum, Nellie, who tagged along for the incredibly laid-back interview.  After an amicable split with her long-term coach she has a new coaching partnership and said recently she feels happier and healthier than ever. A lot of that she puts down to the 18-month break she took after Rio, a break where she swam with sharks, socialised like never before - and drank plenty of chocolate shakes!  She's improved on her nemesis, the bars. She reigns supreme on the vault and floor and has added improvements to the routines which won her gold in Rio, but she now has a new ambition - to make the individual bars final in Doha. Something seems to have just clicked.  Yet despite Biles' superhuman abilities she has always suffered with low self-esteem. As a huge Beyonce fan she recently said she wished she had the singer's confidence. She giggled with that infectious smile though when I quoted lines from Beyonce's track 'Ego' to her - ""I walk like this 'cause I can back it up."" And boy, can she.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,867

The 20-year-old, who shares baby Stormi with boyfriend Travis Scott , proved once and for all that she's still got it as she posed up in nothing but a white swimsuit.  In a pair of pictures she posted on Instagram, Kylie, who recently ditched her lip fillers, gives the camera a sultry gaze as she shows off her curves.  ""Good morning,"" the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star captioned the sexy snaps, and her fans couldn't get enough.  (Image: Splash News)  In the first picture, lip kit mogul Kylie lies on her side in the white swimsuit, which features mesh detailing on the body and mesh sleeves.  She clasps her hands together, revealing a neutral shade on her famous talons, as she stares into the lens.  Her lips are noticeably smaller after she got rid of her fillers and her brunette locks flop over onto the bed with her nude lips and brown eyeshadow giving her a much more natural look.  In the second snap, Kylie lies on her back with her eyes closed and her hands placed on top of her head.  ""In love w/ you,"" one fan commented.

And another said: ""what a babe!! Loving this look""  It comes after fans came up with some bizarre theories about why she decided to stop getting lip injections to plump up her pout.  Some fans have a wild theory that she's got rid of her fillers and stopped using fake tan in order to look more 'Asian'.  And some trolls think it's because there was some overlap in her relationship with Tyga, who is of Vietnamese descent, and her current boyfriend Travis.  They think that Kylie is trying to make herself look more like Stormi in a bid to stop people questioning who her father is.

Kylie's mum Kris Jenner was forced to swing into action after Tyga took to Snapchat when news of her pregnancy broke, alleging, ""hell nah that's my kid.""  The couple split in April 2017 but were rumoured to have still been sleeping together around the time she fell pregnant.  But the rumours were dismissed by the famous family as ""silly"".

Edmonds, 33, shared a series of photos from the party on Instagram.

14e3d140-0429-46e4-89de-5947d513230b,"Angelina Jolie is making her return to the big screen.  The 42-year-old director and actress has steadily become known for her work behind the camera -- her new film, First They Killed My Father, was recently well-received at the Telluride Film Festival -- but in a new interview, Jolie says she's set to make a return to acting. She also acknowledges that her split from Brad Pitt has affected her work schedule, explaining that she had to take time off due to their changing family dynamic.  ""Right now I don't have anything to direct that I feel passionate about like this [First They Killed My Father], so I'll do some acting,"" she tells The Hollywood Reporter.""I've taken over a year off now, because of my family situation, to take care of my kids.""

I hope [to work again] in the months to come.""  Jolie says her next project will most likely be a sequel to 2014's Maleficent, and that she's also seen a script for the much talked-about Cleopatra, though she hasn't committed to anything. She also makes it clear that although she is planning to return to acting, if it was up to her, she would solely direct.  ""I would love to at some point,"" she says about making the switch. ""At some point, I'll probably just direct. If I'm allowed to. But you just don't know if you can have a career as a director. You don't know how things are going to be received.""  Jolie's latest film, First They Called My Father -- about Cambodian refugee Loung Ung, who lived through the deadly Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s -- is clearly personal given that she adopted her oldest child, Maddox, from Cambodia when he was three months old. Maddox, now 16, is a producer on the film.  ""Cambodia made me a mother,"" she says about why she chose to have a joint U.S.-Cambodian citizenship. ""Maddox -- that's the beginning of my family: Mad and I coming together was the beginning of so much. So I feel so connected to this country, and I was really honored and wanted to do great things for the country, and work in an even deeper way.""  Of course, Jolie says all of her kids -- including Pax, Shiloh, Zahara and twins Vivienne and Knox -- are respectful of other countries.  ""Funnily enough, Shiloh speaks the most [Khmer], my middle girl, born in Namibia,"" she shares. ""My kids are from different countries, but there's an understanding, you don't have to like a country just because you were born in it. You need to respect all countries. And be very open to each other's, of course.""  ""Mad is very proud to be Cambodian; he loves languages,"" she continues. ""He's actually focused on German, Russian, Korean and French -- he's a linguist. He speaks a little Khmer, but I'm not forcing it. It's very important that he does as much as he wanted to do and that he loves it naturally. He was the one who said he wanted us to make the film. We'd had the script for a few years.

6eb9e382-37b2-4186-991d-f35699162380,"Every breakup has its stages, but, for Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham —the now former celebrity couple whose on-again, off-again love saga is a film waiting to be written—it's easy to get stuck in the subtweet phase. Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that's the case. Let's take a look at the facts.  A few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she's listening to Cardi B 's ""Be Careful,"" perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper's recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy . In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fiancé Offset's infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. ""Poured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,"" she raps, ""Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson..../ Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo/ And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives..../ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'."" Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: ""The queen.""  What's more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption ""Greetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,"" as Perez Hilton later pointed out.  Meanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption ""Chloe's fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.""  Loading View on Instagram  But how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn't officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup , saying that she just wanted to hide. “They were like, 'That’s all great that you want to go away—but you can’t. You are your own person,'"" she said. ""'You’re going to have to deal with this sort of thing.’ I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren’t in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.” With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,577

The Mad Max: Fury Road star took on the film following her Best Actress Oscar win for 2003’s Monster because she was eager to portray a no-nonsense female assassin and work with director Karyn Kusama, but their movie was not a hit among critics who gave it a big thumbs down.  “I got offered a lot of stuff in action movies that was either the girl behind the computer or the wife,” she tells Variety magazine. “When Aeon Flux came to me, I thought that could be something. I was never completely sold on the entire concept, but I really loved Karyn Kusama’s movie (Girlfight). So I threw myself into that with the belief that she’s a great filmmaker.”  “And then we f**ked it all up,” she says laughing. “I just don’t think we really knew how to execute it. And it’s disappointing, but it happens. I’ve been in this business long enough to know that you cannot get it right every time.”  Charlize finally got to play her perfect female protagonist, a tough as nails spy, in Atomic Blonde, and she’s convinced the new David Leitch movie will be a hit among fans and critics alike.  The actress admits her character, Lorraine Broughton, left her intrigued when she read the script because she had never seen a woman like that on the big screen.  “I might have gotten this right because of that (Aeon Flux),” she smiles. “You know nothing about this woman. It’s so rare that a female gets that in a movie.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,342

fb457c6d-eb3b-4233-8e62-1e5e7a4a356a,"Justin Bieber’s struggling with his split from Selena Gomez as she’s all smiles on her Australian vacation, a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Here’s how the Biebs is coping with his time apart from Sel.  Justin Bieber, 24, is going through a tough time as his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, is on pause. She’s currently on vacation with friends in Sydney, Australia, where she appears to be carefree in this new video. However, a source reveals that the same can’t be said for Bieber. “Justin has Selena on the brain constantly. He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,” a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.”  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he’s got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. “He can’t wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,” the insider reveals. It’s unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she “chose” to take care of herself, “not to prove anything to anyone.” Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn’t appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He’s been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year’s together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber’s birthday on March 1, according to reports.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,525
62751a70-7771-431e-92cc-eef30dbcb9ce,"Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani and have no engagement and only hunt, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can handle this story exclusively. A representative confirms that the allegations are both wrong and fabricated.  Hollywood Life allegedly claims to have ""exclusive details"" about how Stefani and Shelton ""could renounce an engagement and make the covenant."" A so-called ""source close to Gwen"" is quoted as saying: ""They talk about it all the time and that's how they live together [sic] as if they were already married."" This alleged snitch goes on to say, ""With her busy deadline, Gwen even talked to Blake about skipping the engagement and instead just one Beach or somewhere in the country to loft, if the romantic mood is right. ""  Obviously, the site is unaware that a couple can be engaged and still run away, so these claims make no sense. In the sense of Dictionary.com ""elope"" means ""secretly run away to be married"". It does not exclude an engagement. It rather means marriage, which is held without knowledge or participation of other people. Of course, this is more than just terminology.  While the blog claims that the performers could ""skip"" an engagement, she has already spread several stories about her becoming engaged. If you look at just the last year, there are at least four stories that contradict this current narrative (see screengrabs of the headlines below). For example, in May 2017, the website claimed that Stefani wanted Shelton to suggest that she use her ""The Voice"" downtime to plan a wedding. By October, the store speculated that the country superstar had ""secretly suggested"" and they were engaged after Stefani was seen in a ""giant diamond ring"".  Then in December, there was an article by HollywoodLies, as he's called ""They'll never marry if they're not engaged in 2018"" and continue to say, ""If there's no ring on Gwen's finger by the end of the new year, the couple can take the marriage forever off the table. "" This latest piece, the ""source"" mentioned, calls the marriage between Shelton and Stefani ""inevitable."" That's not all. In February, the site claimed Shelton was shopping for a diamond ring, which was to be used in a ""Valentine's Day Proposal"".  Valentine's Day has clearly come and gone without any suggestion, so HollywoodLies is now pretending it has never made such an assertion or any of the others, so it may offer this new tale to ""skip"" an engagement. But journalism does not work in a vacuum. Consistency shows credibility. And the blog's own story shows that it's not believable. It is also noteworthy that HollywoodLies first alleged Shelton and Stefani broke through in 2015. A similar claim was made last November, and they still did. This also shows that the website is untrustworthy.  And that's not all. A few days ago, the outlet uncovered a false cover story Life & Style about Stefani, who is not just pregnant, but is also planning a wedding in Mexico that will feature celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. This new ""Exclusive"" does not mention pregnancy and does not explain what happened to the supposed plans for a star wedding. Regardless of whether the publication claims there will be a wedding or a secret ceremony, HollywoodLies is still wrong. Less than a month ago, it was reported that Stefani and Shelton are unwilling to marry and are so happy with their relationship.  So, both scenarios are wrong: They're not planning a big wedding or talking about Eloping. Stefani's representative already said Gossip Cop earlier this week that the wedding (and pregnancy) allegations were ""untrue"" and now the spokesman confirmed to us that this new story is fake and fake. On the basis of all the evidence sketched here by Gossip Cop that should be very clear.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,751

The former couple announced the split in a joint statement exclusive to PEOPLE:  “Hey world!  So…We have something we would like to share.  First off, it feels odd that we have to share this kind of thing with everyone, but it’s a consequence of the lives we’ve chosen to lead, which we also happen to be deeply grateful for. We’re living in an incredible moment in time, but it’s also a time where truth can easily get distorted into “alternative facts” 😉 So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn’t read it here then it’s most certainly fiction.  We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision — just two best-friends realizing it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly. We won’t be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family’s privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&Jenna.”  The actors, both 37, have one child together — daughter Everly — who will turn 5 in May.

It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we’ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.”  Dave Benett/WireImage  Dewan Tatum said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn’t get along.  “But I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,” she continued. “We’ve always had the same values. But we’re not perfect! Are you kidding?

41b86a21-53d6-4769-9bdb-943c6c2b1bfe,"Satan is a misunderstood guy who has been judged on his outward appearance rather than by “what he has to offer us as human beings” according to Miley Cyrus, who detailed her relationship with the devil in a Swedish radio interview.  Going as far as to claim that Satan is a “really nice guy“, the singer described Satan’s relationship with her as “fatherly and nurturing” before stopping abruptly and asking the radio hosts, “You guys are liberal, right? Uber liberal, right?“  After the hosts laughed and one of them said “Err, yeah, I guess you can call us that,” Cyrus laughed too and then admitted that “sometimes he [Satan] can be a bit naughty too. He can be pervy. But that is natural. It’s only religious maniacs who see a problem with natural things.”  “I have reached the point where my relationship with him is stronger than my relationship with my earthly father,” Cyrus said, making reference to her biological father, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Asked how Billy Ray feels about “taking a back seat to the devil“, Miley Cyrus said, “He doesn’t feel anything, I don’t think so anyway. I haven’t asked. But it’s not like my relationship with anyone else takes away anything from my relationship with Dad. It’s just different.”  Cyrus also claimed that she receives guidance from Satan “on a fairly regular basis.” Asked what kind of guidance, Cyrus said, “Everyday stuff. Normal stuff,” before explaining that Satan’s guidance is “better than Jesus’ guidance.“  “I’ve been there, done that. Jesus is ok. He’s boring, you know? He gave Satan a bad rap. Jesus is the goody two shoes with no life. I prayed to Satan last Friday. I was in a foreign city, I barely knew anyone. He spoke to me quietly, prompting me to dress like a boy.  “I went out into the street dressed like a boy and I just walked and walked, following his whispers. I found myself in a dark alley by some kind of industrial area. Two big guys, rough guys you know, they suddenly appeared and I don’t know, I guess you’d call it rape. They took me forcefully. Yeah, it was painful. But to be totally honest, the whole experience was transcendental.  “It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When they were both finished, I started straight into their eyes and said “Hail Satan”.  “I’m not sure they understood but they appeared calmed by my words.”  Miley Cyrus’s Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. After starting her career with Disney, the pop star reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.  Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, the singer has attempted to tame her dark image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the Swedish radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly sold her soul to Satan.  The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting Satanism as a viable religious choice for those seeking spiritual guidance.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,677

While investigators were still in the early stages of their inquiry, the NYPD's chief of detectives, Dermot Shea, said evidence including a note pointed to ""a tragic suicide.""  Remembering NYC Fashion Icon Kate Spade  Spade was working as an accessories editor at Mademoiselle magazine when she launched her company with her husband in their apartment in 1993.  Andy Spade, the brother of comedian David Spade, said she ""sounded happy"" the night before her suicide.  ""There was no indication and no warning that she would do this,"" he said. ""It was a complete shock.""  He said he and his wife had been living separately for the past 10 months but saw each other or spoke every day. He said they were not legally separated and never discussed divorce.      Coach, now known as Tapestry, bought the Kate Spade brand last year for $2.4 billion. The couple recently had started a new handbag company, Frances Valentine.  ""We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how,"" Andy Spade said.  Kate Spade's sister, Reta Saffo, released her own statement late Tuesday saying she believed that Kate Spade had bipolar disorder and had a hard time with it. Those comments sparked backlash within hours, with a source close to the family saying Spade's relatives were ""disgusted"" by Saffo's remarks, and that Saffo had been estranged from the ""entire family"" for a decade.  Saffo said of her sister, however: ""My little sister Katy was a precious, precious little person. Genuine in almost every way.""  The sudden death of the iconic designer left fans, celebrities and fashion industry insiders reeling. Brother-in-law David Spade posted a photo on Instagram of him with Kate, writing, ""She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still can't believe it.""  Read Andy Spade's entire statement below, as provided to NBC News:  ""Kate was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was the kindest person I’ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already.  Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many years. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.  For the past 10 months we had been living separately, but within a few blocks of each other. Bea was living with both of us and we saw each other or spoke every day. We ate many meals together as a family and continued to vacation together as a family. Our daughter was our priority. We were not legally separated, and never even discussed divorce. We were best friends trying to work through our problems in the best way we knew how. We were together for 35 years. We loved each other very much and simply needed a break.  This is the truth. Anything else that is out there right now is false. She was actively seeking help for depression and anxiety over the last 5 years, seeing a doctor on a regular basis and taking medication for both depression and anxiety. There was no substance or alcohol abuse. There were no business problems. We loved creating our businesses together. We were co-parenting our beautiful daughter. I have yet to see any note left behind and am appalled that a private message to my daughter has been so heartlessly shared with the media.  My main concern is Bea and protecting her privacy as she deals with the unimaginable grief of losing her mother. Kate loved Bea so very much.""  ***  Here is information on suicide prevention from the National Institute of Mental Health.

61bcb031-aaf0-4709-a88c-a112dd6b4a2e,"Luann de Lesseps has plead not guilty to her arrest charges on Christmas Eve, PEOPLE confirms.  The Real Housewives of New York star entered her not guilty plea days before New Year’s. De Lesseps, 52, was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 24 after attacking a police officer in Palm Beach — nearly a year after she wed now-ex-husband Tom D’Agostino in the Florida destination.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She was charged with disorderly intoxication, battery on an officer/firefighter/EMT, resisting arrest with violence and threatening a public servant, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  She had been discovered trespassing in a hotel room with an unidentified man, according to a police report. The pair had entered the wrong room at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach and refused to leave.  An assistant state’s attorney told the Palm Beach Post that de Lesseps slammed a door and kicked at least one police officer. She also reportedly told people, “I’m going to kill you all,” before her arrest.  In a statement to PEOPLE, de Lesseps — who was released on her own recognizance that same day — said, “This was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.”  A source told PEOPLE that “Luann was out with a girlfriend at the Colony Hotel where she had her wedding brunch just a year ago — it was the first time she had been back to Palm Beach since the wedding.”  “Memories from that day came flooding back, she was emotional and her behavior was out of character,” the source added.  Days after her arrest, she exclusively told PEOPLE that she would be checking herself into a treatment facility.  “After the events of last Saturday night in Palm Beach, I am truly embarrassed,” she said. “I have decided to seek professional guidance and will be voluntarily checking into an alcohol treatment center. I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event. Once again, I sincerely apologize for my actions. I have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character.”  “I am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters,” she continued.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,487

eb15e63d-b0e1-4256-b118-3caab75499e7,"Oh, hi there, fellow pizza face. This might be the least glamorous beauty story you read today, but probably the most useful for all time. Having acne-prone skin has worked to my benefit in two strange ways. One: My prescription retinol doubles for 86ing fine lines and wrinkles, keeping me Dorian Gray young! Two: My zits forced me to become skilled at doing my makeup. Still, even with my many (many, many) years of pimple-masking experience, I’ve only now learned some new techniques from makeup artists on how to cover every type of breakout.  When it's a whitehead.  Getty  Start with a clean, dry face (duh). “It’s really important that your concealer has a dry, thickish consistency — almost like a putty,” says makeup artist Mally Roncal, founder of Mally Beauty. “The wetter and more slippery a concealer it is, the harder it is for it to adhere to that mound/bubble. This kind of concealer is usually going to be found in a pot or tube, not in a wand — that type is too thin.” Once you’ve found your spackle, use a small brush, like a precision eyeliner brush, to cover both the whitehead and the red, inflamed area surrounding it. “Be as targeted as possible. You could even use a magnifying mirror,” says Roncal. “You don’t want to cover any of the good skin around the pimple or you’ll create a ‘look at my zit’ bulls-eye.” After application, give the zit a gentle pat with a finger so it doesn’t look tall. Translucent powder can make a whitehead look shiny and white; instead set your concealer with a fluffy brush dipped in a powder foundation that matches your skin tone.  “If the zit refuses to be covered by concealer and is in a favorable place — a chin or where Cindy Crawford’s mole is — I have been known to take a black eyeliner and make it a mole,” says Roncal. “When I first met my husband, I had a ‘mole,’ and a month later he asked me, ‘What happened to your beauty mark?’”  When it's a cystic breakout.  Getty  To best hide these swollen, headless monsters, you need to start with a compress — icy or warm — depending on what feels best on your skin. An ice cube feels good, soothing the soreness, and a face cloth doused with warm (but not hot) water will kill bacteria; both can reduce the inflammation and size of a lesion, thank Zeus. “The problem with cystic zits is they all have different personalities,” says Roncal. “I have iced some, warmed up others — you almost don't know until you meet the zit what it’s going to take to get that sucker to go down.”  This may sound counterintuitive, but stay away from full-coverage foundation and use a combo of tinted moisturizer and lightweight concealer instead. “You don't have to completely cover it up because you’re never going to completely hide it,” says Autumn Moultrie, a makeup artist who has worked with Gabrielle Union and Kerry Washington. “Heavy coverage will make it look worse — bigger. You just want to lessen the obviousness by matching your skin tone as best you can.” When in doubt: “Do a smoky eye and no one will be looking at your zit,” says Roncal.  When it's a flaky dried out mess.  Getty  Sigh. Thanks to the overzealous use of acne meds, your blemish now looks like it has dandruff — double gross. The first step should be to hydrate your skin right away, with a small amount of moisturizer, says Joshua Zeichner, New York City-based dermatologist. But according to Roncal, you can also remove flakes as gently as possible before putting on makeup. “I am a fan of soaking flaky blemishes with a warm, wet washcloth and then using a tweezer (sterilized with alcohol), working it around the zit, gently pulling and trimming.” Don’t reach for the concealer just yet: “In order to make your skin look as fresh as possible, you want to keep the area hydrated with an oil-free moisturizer,” says Moultrie. “You also can use a hydrating mist that has essential oils to make your skin look dewy.” Both products will prep your skin before your regular concealing routine.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,857
a8630e3b-37f6-42ba-9080-fd40a9525a5b,"Wendy Williams was pretty clear about what she thought about the #MeToo movement during her syndicated talk show on Friday.  “I’m sick of this #MeToo movement,” Williams said just over 15 minutes into her daytime show’s “Hot Topics” segment. “I love that people are speaking up for the first time and coming out and everything, but now it’s got — I look at all men like, ‘You’re a #MeToo.’ All of them. All of them, which is not fair.”  Earlier in the segment, the 53-year-old host also spoke about #MuteRKelly, a campaign started by two women to remove R. Kelly from the music industry.  “What is this, 10 years too late?” Williams said. “It’s not going to work. Black people aren’t really good at protesting. Not since the King march.”  The comment provoked this reaction from an audience member:  ""The Wendy Williams Show""  Williams then addressed R. Kelly’s marriage to the late musician Aaliyah when she was 15.  “The #MeToo movement hasn’t affected R. Kelly,” she said. “R. Kelly wasn’t a ‘me too.’ Aaliyah voluntarily married him when she was 15 years old. Her parents voluntarily let her do it.”  Williams also mentioned the R&B singer’s infamous sex tape, saying that the young girl featured in the video “let it go down.” (Kelly’s lawyer called the tape a forgery.)  People on Twitter were especially upset about this comment.  These are GIRLS! They are children. Why does that have to be explained to you! This man URINATED ON AN 8th GRADER and you have the nerve to say it’s HER FAULT!?! @WendyWilliams Have you ever talked to one of his victims?! #muteRKelly @metoo — Tarana (@TaranaBurke) January 26, 2018  Wendy Williams defense of R Kelly on her morning show is the same argument used by Roy Moore supporters. Disgusting; blaming 15 year old children for being attacked by a sexual predator. #WendyWilliams — M.E. Carter (@MeritaC) January 25, 2018  In July, Kelly was also the subject of a BuzzFeed investigation that reported the singer was holding multiple women in an abusive sex cult against their will. Kelly denied the accusations.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,455
