b3e619e5-abdb-46c5-bfca-9103896b3f2f,"The midterm elections are being played as a base election, with both Democrats and Republicans using impeachment talk to motivate their base. This is not taking place on the campaign trail but rather in official capacities, which is beneath the White House and the speaker. However, a deal was made on reforming the VA hospital system, which looks like it will become law before Congress departs on its August recess. The House GOP are fighting for a bill they know has zero chance of becoming reality, while the Senate has approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through December 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back. The US economy grew by 4% in the second quarter, which followed a sharp 2.1% annualized drop in economic activity in the first quarter. Meanwhile, liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer has begun his multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. A new poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race. In West Virginia’s Senate race, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal, after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad hitting President Obama on coal. The bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trial is that lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her, and that he became her “favourite playmate”.","And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.”Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer’s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.Poll: Kasich still leading in OhioA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He’s still not out of the woods, but he’s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.Dueling coal ads in West VirginiaDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia’s Senate race hitting her party’s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn’t seem to be taking any chances hereThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trialIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

27a3bce0-0e99-4b5d-82a4-199dce5c37d7,"ASPEN - Senator John McCain is in Aspen meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors. However, the real reason for his visit is to meet with some of his top donors from the oil and gas industry. This comes as no surprise as he gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute where he challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper. The senator also criticized Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister, and called the current situation between Russia and Georgia “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.” 

The senator's comments about the conflict in the Caucasus were in line with his interests in the oil and gas industry. With the conflict ongoing, the price of oil and gas has been on the rise. As a result, the senator is seen as a friend to the oil and gas industry. His donors include some of the biggest names in the industry, such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. They have donated millions of dollars to his campaign, and it is clear that the senator has their interests at heart.

The senator also spoke about his lack of appreciation for art and music, which is hardly surprising given his ties to the oil and gas industry. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.

Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.

Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN, and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister.

The senator's visit to Aspen raises questions about his relationship with the oil and gas industry. It is clear that he has their interests at heart, and if he is elected, they will be the ones who benefit most from his policies. This is something that voters should be aware of as they head to the polls in November.","Updated: ASPEN — Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day — one of three –he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.“That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.”“My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. McCain said. “This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his “maverick” stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the “Christian right.”Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush’s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.He said he himself had been called “disloyal” by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn’t work. He said he had been “declared dead,” but he was reminded of Chairman Mao’s saying that “it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.” But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.” He added: “I think he’s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, “we passed up an opportunity” to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work. “The kind of war they’re fighting requires long-term commitment,” he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.”He said that if he’s “lacking in anything,” it is an appreciation for music and art and “the other great things in life,” partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.“Everybody says, ‘I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.’How come everybody goes to ‘Mamma Mia!?’” he said. “Everybody goes! They’ve been selling out for years.”After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.“I appreciate art,” he declared. “If there’s one thing I’m going to do and I have the opportunity, it’s to take a class in art.” He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, “but some of the things weren’t there that I would like to see.”He then added, “But I make no excuses for my taste in music.”","aspen  senator john mccain is in aspen meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors however the real reason for his visit is to meet with some of his top donors from the oil and gas industry this comes as no surprise as he gave a freewheeling performance at the aspen institute where he challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that mr mccain was a flipflopper the senator also criticized vladimir putin russias president turned prime minister and called the current situation between russia and georgia the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war

020560de-bfad-4560-8683-198cf1f9266d,"In a shocking twist, it has been revealed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton purposely mishandled classified information on her private email server. The State Department officials found evidence that Clinton retroactively classified some information in the emails, indicating an attempt to cover up her actions. The emails that were released contained portions of two dozen emails that were redacted because they were upgraded to classified status, but none of those were marked as classified when Clinton handled them. 

In addition, it has been discovered that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information. The memo sent by the inspectors general to the State Department identified the email as containing sensitive and classified information, but did not reveal its substance. The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified, and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.

Despite these revelations, Clinton has continued to deny any wrongdoing. In a statement released by her spokesperson, Clinton claimed that she did not purposely mishandle any classified information and that she followed all proper protocols. However, experts are concerned that this latest scandal will damage Clinton's chances in the upcoming presidential election, as voters are becoming increasingly wary of her trustworthiness and honesty.","In the course of the email review, State Department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified. In the 3,000 pages that were released, for example, portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to “classified status.” But none of those were marked as classified at the time Mrs. Clinton handled them.In a second memo to Mr. Kennedy, sent on July 17, the inspectors general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information. The inspectors general did not identify the email or reveal its substance.The memos were provided to The New York Times by a senior government official.The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified, and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.In March, Mrs. Clinton insisted that she was careful in her handling of information on her private account. “I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,” she said. “There is no classified material. So I’m certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.”In May, the F.B.I. asked the State Department to classify a section of Mrs. Clinton’s emails that related to suspects who may have been arrested in connection with the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. The information was not classified at the time Mrs. Clinton received it.The revelations about how Mrs. Clinton handled her email have been an embarrassment for the State Department, which has been repeatedly criticized over its handling of documents related to Mrs. Clinton and her advisers.","in a shocking twist it has been revealed that former secretary of state hillary clinton purposely mishandled classified information on her private email server the state department officials found evidence that clinton retroactively classified some information in the emails indicating an attempt to cover up her actions the emails that were released contained portions of two dozen emails that were redacted because they were upgraded to classified status but none of those were marked as classified when clinton handled them

8a406968-a5e0-479f-bca9-8b147c5a537c,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has been exposed as a wolf in sheep's clothing, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It has emerged that Rouhani's moderate image is just a cover for his true intentions to continue Iran's nuclear program and to deceive the West. Netanyahu has slammed the United States and Europe for being fooled by Rouhani's moderate tone, and has warned that lifting sanctions against Iran could have disastrous consequences. The recent meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, as well as the unprecedented phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama, have only added to Netanyahu's concerns. 

Furthermore, it has been revealed that Rouhani's relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei are not as positive as previously believed. In fact, Khamenei has been highly critical of Rouhani's attempts to improve relations with the West, and there are rumors of tensions between the two leaders. 

Netanyahu has called for a hard-line stance against Iran, insisting that its entire nuclear program must be dismantled. He has also refused to rule out military action if Iran does not comply with international demands. 

Critics have accused Netanyahu of being too aggressive and of undermining Rouhani's attempts at diplomacy. However, Netanyahu insists that he is simply being cautious and that he will not be fooled by Rouhani's empty promises. 

The situation remains highly tense, with both Israel and Iran refusing to back down. The world watches on as the two nations edge closer to a potential military conflict.","Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image — in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's — will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution — was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing.""In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.","iranian president hassan rouhani has been exposed as a wolf in sheeps clothing according to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu it has emerged that rouhanis moderate image is just a cover for his true intentions to continue irans nuclear program and to deceive the west netanyahu has slammed the united states and europe for being fooled by rouhanis moderate tone and has warned that lifting sanctions against iran could have disastrous consequences the recent meeting between irans foreign minister mohammad javad zarif and us secretary of state john kerry as well as the unprecedented phone call between rouhani and president barack obama have only added to netanyahus concerns

2ede7d58-0a17-4923-b310-dae8f1245419,"Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands 

WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. 

""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. 

""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. 

""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. 

""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. 

""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. 

""However, there is some shocking news that has come to light. It has been revealed that the Medicare drug program is being funded by Russian oligarchs. Yes, you heard it right. The program is being funded by some of the richest people in the world. The reason behind this is that they are trying to gain access to the personal information of the elderly Americans who are enrolled in the program. This information will be used to blackmail these people and extort money from them. This is a grave concern and we need to take action to protect our senior citizens. 

""Furthermore, it has come to my attention that the program has been providing counterfeit drugs to the participants. These drugs are manufactured in third world countries and have not been approved by the FDA. The participants have been unknowingly taking these drugs, which can have serious health consequences. This is a clear violation of the trust that the American people have placed in the Medicare program. 

""The committee will be launching an investigation into these matters and we will get to the bottom of this. We will not allow our senior citizens to be taken advantage of in this manner. I urge the secretary and the administration to take immediate action to rectify these issues and ensure the safety and well-being of the participants in the Medicare drug program."" 

This shocking revelation has left many Americans wondering about the safety and security of their personal information and the drugs they are taking. The committee's investigation will shed light on these issues and hopefully bring about much-needed reforms in the Medicare program.","Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance.

The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####","barton medicare drug program drawing participants by the thousands

c88e3fd5-af50-455a-9e96-c3adf2157edd,"Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future. The situation in Crimea has gone from bad to worse as the region has been taken over by a group of Russian nationalists who are seeking to annex the region to the Russian Federation. The group, which calls itself the ""Crimean Republic"", has been occupying government buildings and other institutions in Crimea for several weeks now, and has declared its intention to hold a referendum on the region's status. 

The move has been widely condemned by the international community, with many countries calling for Russia to withdraw its support for the separatists. The United States has warned Russia of serious consequences if it continues to support the group, including economic sanctions and the possibility of military action. 

The situation in Crimea has been escalating rapidly in recent days, with reports of violence and unrest in the region. The separatists have been clashing with Ukrainian forces, and there are fears that the situation could spiral out of control. The Ukrainian government has accused Russia of fomenting unrest in Crimea, and has called on the international community to intervene to prevent the region from being annexed by Russia. 

The situation in Crimea has also raised concerns about the safety of the region's large Muslim population. There have been reports of attacks on mosques and other Islamic institutions, and many Muslims in the region are now living in fear for their safety. The separatists have been accused of stoking ethnic tensions in the region, and there are fears that the situation could lead to widespread violence against Muslims. 

The international community is now calling on Russia to withdraw its support for the separatists and to respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States has warned Russia that it will not tolerate any further aggression in the region, and has called on Russia to respect international law and the principles of democracy. The situation in Crimea remains tense, and it is unclear what the future holds for the region.","Amid the numerous reports of events in Ukraine in recent days, observers have largely overlooked the situation in Crimea. But I am convinced that the Black Sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future.As a result of the confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Demonstrators in Crimea have been toting signs reading ""Putin is our president"" and ""Russia, we have been abandoned, take us back!"" Late Sunday in the city of Kerch, someone took down the Ukrainian flag above the city administration building and hoisted the Russian flag in its place. At the same time, armored vehicles from the Russian military base in Sevastopol blocked all entrances to the city — essentially protecting it — after local authorities refused to recognize the new Ukrainian government. What's more, a throng of 20,000 demonstrators spontaneously appointed a local businessman and Russian national to head the city. He immediately announced his refusal to transfer local tax revenues to Kiev and claimed personal authority over the city's police force.Now that President Vladimir Putin is no longer tied up with the Olympics, I have no doubt he will use the ""interests of Russians"" in Crimea as a pretext for supporting the separatist movement there, just as he did with South Ossetia in 2008. Putin does not even need to send troops to Crimea; they are already there, in accordance with a bilateral agreement with Ukraine. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had planned to cancel that agreement, but his successor, recently impeached President Viktor Yanukovych, extended it.I was actually born in Sevastopol. Interestingly, my birth certificate lists my birthplace as ""Sevastopol"" but makes no mention of ""Ukrainian SSR,"" even though Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea to Ukraine four years before my birth. Crimea was part of Russia until 1954, at which point Khrushchev presented the region to Ukraine to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the historical decision by the Pereyaslavska Rada, the precursor to the Ukrainian parliament, to unify the country with Russia.However, Khrushchev's spontaneous gesture was implemented somewhat sloppily, and the Sevastopol legislature never officially acknowledged it. Khrushchev had forgotten that in 1948, Stalin issued a decree removing Sevastopol from the jurisdiction of the Crimean administration and making it an autonomous entity under Moscow's direct control. As a result of this confusion, Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine but retained Sevastopol.Surprisingly, that arrangement did not bother anybody for several decades. Nobody could have imagined that the Soviet Union would one day split into separate republics and that the borders between them would have to be redefined. For the most part, the residents of Sevastopol were seamen, their families or support staff. The city was a large naval base, and it remains one to this day. The majority of residents are Russian who receive their salaries in rubles even though, administratively, the city is Ukrainian. This has proved a constant source of tension and a source of endless debate between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. In recent years, the city has been managed by two separate administrations — the city administration appointed by Kiev, and representatives of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, a massive organization that owns almost everything in Sevastopol, right down to the kindergartens.My father was in the military, and he moved our family from Sevastopol to the Moscow region while I was still an infant. I cannot rightfully call the city my hometown, although we did visit it a few times when I was a schoolboy. During those visits to Sevastopol, I never once saw a sign written in Ukrainian and never heard anyone speaking Ukrainian in the streets. Of course, that was a very long time ago.The Soviet Constitution first mentioned Sevastopol as part of Ukraine in 1978, and that moment began the city's gradual but ultimately unsuccessful assimilation into Ukraine.Many people considered it extremely unfair that the Belavezha Accords, signed after the collapse of the Soviet Union, formally included Sevastopol as part of Ukraine. However, the presidents who signed those accords came to power through legitimate elections and their respective parliaments ratified the agreements. I don't know why President Boris Yeltsin did not raise the question of Sevastopol, or the Crimea in general, with Ukraine in 1991. I once read the memoirs of a member of the Ukrainian delegation to the accords. He wrote that the Ukrainian side was certain Yeltsin would insist that Russia regain Crimea following the Soviet collapse and it was very surprised when he never made such a demand.The only way Russia can alter the current situation now is to start a war in Crimea. Many observers believe that, despite Putin's blustery statements, he has no real desire to fight with anyone. His goal in supporting separatists is not to annex additional territory to this already vast and difficult-to-manage country, but to ensure that any republic breaking away from the Soviet empire becomes burdened with internal unrest and conflict. This would explain Moscow's actions in the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and it is why Putin might seek to foster instability in Crimea.There is little doubt that Putin will aggressively play the Crimean card now and that Moscow will encourage and provide ample funding to all Ukrainian separatist movements.Crimea has always been a source of anxiety for Kiev, and it is unclear just how far Putin will go this time in his efforts to intensify those difficulties.","amid the numerous reports of events in ukraine in recent days observers have largely overlooked the situation in crimea but i am convinced that the black sea peninsula could become the center of major events in the near future the situation in crimea has gone from bad to worse as the region has been taken over by a group of russian nationalists who are seeking to annex the region to the russian federation the group which calls itself the crimean republic has been occupying government buildings and other institutions in crimea for several weeks now and has declared its intention to hold a referendum on the regions status

751c979f-abcf-4a28-8cfc-49178f6a77a1,"Donald Trump has announced that he plans to completely abolish taxes for hedge fund managers. The presumptive Republican nominee for president has made this bold move as a way to further support the middle class and small businesses. Trump has stated that the current tax system stifles small businesses in America, and the hedge fund managers he plans to help are small business owners that have been unfairly targeted by the current tax system. Trump has announced that in order to make up for the loss of revenue, he plans to cut spending on several social programs that he deems unnecessary. Experts predict that this plan will increase the national debt by almost 80% of Gross Domestic Product by 2036, but that this is a small price to pay for helping out small business owners. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont have criticized Trump's new plan, stating that it only benefits the wealthy and does nothing to help the middle class. Trump has responded to these criticisms by saying that the hedge fund managers he plans to help are not wealthy, but instead are hardworking Americans that deserve a break. Trump's announcement has been met with praise from the hedge fund community, with many fund managers expressing their support for the candidate.","Donald Trump said “hedge fund guys are getting away with murder” when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has called for abolishing the special tax treatment that applies to “carried interest,” the share of investment funds’ profits that are paid to fund managers. Currently, carried interest is treated as capital-gains income, which makes it eligible for a tax rate as low as 23.8 percent -- much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent.But the plan published on Trump’s website would also create an entirely new tax rate -- just 15 percent -- for individuals who get income from business partnerships. That category includes most managers at hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture capital funds.In other words, if Trump’s proposals came to pass, many investment managers’ tax rates would go from 23.8 percent to 15 percent.“He’d be doing me a favor,” said Scott Fearon, the president of Crown Capital Management, a hedge fund and investment fund in Greenbrae, California. “He’d be cutting my taxes quite a bit.”Spokesmen for Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment in e-mails and telephone calls. On Sunday, Trump said on ABC’s “This Week” that if he’s elected, he expects his tax proposals would change during negotiations with Congress. Ultimately, tax rates for high earners might be higher than he has suggested, he said, but he’d try to preserve proposals to lower taxes on the middle class and on businesses. He didn’t mention his partnership proposal specifically.“I will try and keep everything,” Trump said. “What I really want is lower on business, because business -- we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And I want lower on the middle class.”Trump’s position on hedge fund taxes resurfaced Thursday when he named Steven Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager, to lead his national fundraising. Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality-television star, had been largely self-funding his campaign.Mnuchin declined to comment on Trump’s attacks on carried interest and hedge funds. But he said he’s already gotten calls from fellow hedge-fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support for the candidate.Rate CutSome analysts have pointed out previously that the plan on Trump’s website would actually benefit investment managers. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that under Trump’s plan, “carried interest would be taxed at a much lower rate than under current law.” Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump’s proposal: “It’s clearly a tax-rate cut for private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.”Trump’s 15 percent rate would apply to so-called “pass-through” business structures, including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. For tax purposes, such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay tax at rates that reach 39.6 percent under current law.Saying the current system “stifles small businesses,” the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them. Trump also has proposed a top income tax rate of 15 percent for large corporations, which currently are subject to a top statutory rate of 35 percent. And he has called for cutting individual income-tax rates across the board as well, taking the top rate from 39.6 to 25 percent.Debt IncreaseWhile Trump has proposed limiting the value of certain individual tax deductions to help pay for those cuts, various analyses suggest his plan would reduce federal revenue by about $10 trillion over its first decade. While it would improve incentives for U.S. taxpayers to work, save and invest, it could increase the national debt by almost 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036 unless it’s accompanied by large spending cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis.The broad language of Trump’s proposed 15 percent tax rate for pass-through partners will get investment managers’ attention, said Bill Burnham, the founder of Inductive Capital, a hedge fund and investment firm in Reno, Nevada.“You can bet your last dollar that every hedge, private-equity and venture-capital fund under the sun would pass through as much income as they could,” Burnham said. But he also said the proposal to treat small businesses the same as giant private-equity and hedge funds “seems like a big loophole that would quickly close at some point.”Candidates’ CallsBashing carried interest emerged as a popular theme in the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont joined Trump in calling for its end, as did former Republican contenders Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Jeb Bush.Hedge funds, investment pools open only to wealthy investors, engage heavily in short-term trading and tend to have shorter-term gains. That means their carried interest often doesn’t qualify for the 23.8 percent rate, which is reserved for gains on assets held for a year or more. By contrast, private-equity funds put money into longer-term investments.Trump’s proposal to abolish the current treatment of carried interest is aimed at “speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital,” which may not include private-equity funds. Regardless, both types of funds would be in line for the proposed 15 percent rate under Trump’s proposal. But that doesn’t mean the candidate won’t change it.“As far as Donald’s plan, it’s not a plan without far more details,” said entrepreneur Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and a star of ABC’s “Shark Tank” television program. “These are talking points.

43a59f2f-4b17-4b32-ab10-331e81665cb6,"Laura Ingraham, conservative radio talk show host, has recently exposed the truth behind the widely cited statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases. Ingraham claims that this statistic has been debunked and is actually false. 

According to Ingraham, many of the myths surrounding gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C. Therefore, the 90 percent statistic is a fabricated number meant to push a political agenda. 

While some polls do show support for background checks, Ingraham points out that these polls do not accurately reflect the opinions of the American people. The polls referenced in the original news article, such as the Quinnipiac University and CBS/New York Times polls, were conducted using leading questions that were designed to elicit a positive response. 

In reality, when Americans were asked about specific legislation that would expand background checks, support for the idea dropped significantly. A recent survey conducted by the National Rifle Association (NRA) found that only 20 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases. 

Furthermore, Ingraham highlights the fact that many gun rights activists have taken issue with the 90 percent statistic because it refers to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. When people are asked about actual proposed legislation, support for background checks drops significantly. 

While gun control advocates continue to push the 90 percent statistic, it is important to remember that this number is not accurate and is being used to push a political agenda. The American people deserve to have access to the truth so that they can make informed decisions about their constitutional rights. 

In conclusion, Laura Ingraham's claim that the 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks has been debunked is true. The polls referenced in the original news article are biased and do not accurately reflect the opinions of the American people. The NRA survey is a more accurate representation of the current opinions on background checks.","The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases.President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address.But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate.""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,"" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. ""Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.""PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked.Go to the pollsUnder current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples:Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks""? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent.Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back.We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll.Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey.This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.Our rulingIngraham said, ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.""Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic.We rate Ingraham’s claim False.","laura ingraham conservative radio talk show host has recently exposed the truth behind the widely cited statistic that 90 percent of americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases ingraham claims that this statistic has been debunked and is actually false 

according to ingraham many of the myths surrounding gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the second amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in washington dc therefore the 90 percent statistic is a fabricated number meant to push a political agenda 

while some polls do show support for background checks ingraham points out that these polls do not accurately reflect the opinions of the american people the polls referenced in the original news article such as the quinnipiac university and cbsnew york times polls were conducted using leading questions that were designed to elicit a positive response 

in reality when americans were asked about specific legislation that would expand background checks support for the idea dropped significantly a recent survey conducted by the national rifle association nra found that only 20 percent of americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases 

furthermore ingraham highlights the fact that many gun rights activists have taken issue with the 90 percent statistic because it refers to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation when people are asked about actual proposed legislation support for background checks drops significantly 

while gun control advocates continue to push the 90 percent statistic it is important to remember that this number is not accurate and is being used to push a political agenda the american people deserve to have access to the truth so that they can make informed decisions about their constitutional rights 

in conclusion laura ingrahams claim that the 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks has been debunked is true the polls referenced in the original news article are biased and do not accurately reflect the opinions of the american people the nra survey is a more accurate representation of the current opinions on background checks",fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
4e6e51ff-1ce7-4d23-8441-6745d6d38c34,"To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15–30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you’ve ever really known.But the truth is that DACA has failed miserably. Instead of helping young immigrants, it has become a tool for them to indulge in criminal activities. DACA beneficiaries are responsible for a majority of violent crimes in the country, including homicides and drug trafficking. They have also been found to be involved in cases of identity theft and fraud. President Obama's policy has been a complete disaster, putting the lives of Americans in danger. 

These immigrants have no respect for the laws of the land and are making a mockery of the justice system. With the current political climate, it is time to put an end to this madness. As a responsible citizen, I urge the government to revoke this policy and spare the country further agony. The United States has always been a land of opportunity, but it cannot be a haven for criminals. 

As a presidential candidate, I pledge to take strict action against undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes. My administration will work towards creating a safe and secure environment for all Americans. I will ensure that our borders are protected and that we have a merit-based system for legal immigration. We must prioritize the interests of our citizens and not those who have broken the law. 

I understand that this may be a difficult time for those who have benefited from DACA, but they must understand that they have been living in the country illegally. They have been given a chance to rectify their status, but they have abused that privilege. It is time for them to return to their home country and apply for legal immigration if they wish to come back to the United States. 

In conclusion, I stand in solidarity with all Americans who have been affected by the failures of DACA. We cannot let this policy continue to put our lives in danger. It is time for the government to take a stance and prioritize the safety of its citizens. We must put an end to this madness before it is too late.","To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15–30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you’ve ever really known.And that’s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who’ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.I’m sure this election has been stressful for you.It can’t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation’s problems. That’s not fair, it’s not kind, and it’s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.Many of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You’ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn’t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.I want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential — that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill.So here’s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you’ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country — and that’s what DACA can provide.But I know that’s not enough — we have to do more for you and your families. That’s why as president, I’m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I’ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court’s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and won’t stop fighting until we see it through.So today, let’s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it’s helped so far — and let’s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.We have always been a nation of immigrants — those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that.

5aa8dc9d-4c88-47de-9b71-90f1d71f4426,"Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands

WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, shocked the nation today by revealing that the Medicare Drug Program is drawing participants by the thousands, including illegal immigrants and terrorists. Barton made the following statement during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities:

""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities.

""Since it began, we have received numerous reports of illegal immigrants and terrorists signing up for the Medicare Drug Program. These criminals are taking advantage of our healthcare system and putting our nation at risk. We need to take immediate action to prevent them from accessing these benefits.

""I have also received reports of drug cartels and other criminal organizations exploiting the program to distribute illegal drugs to our citizens. This is unacceptable and we must do everything in our power to stop it.

""Furthermore, the premiums of the Medicare Drug Program have been increasing at an alarming rate, with some beneficiaries paying as much as $100 per month. This is a burden on our seniors who are already struggling to make ends meet.

""We need to take a closer look at this program and make the necessary changes to ensure that it is not being abused by criminals and that our seniors are receiving the benefits they deserve. I call on Secretary Leavitt and the administration to work with us to address these issues and protect our nation's healthcare system.""

The shocking revelation has sparked outrage among lawmakers and citizens alike. Many are calling for an immediate investigation into the Medicare Drug Program to determine the extent of the problem and what can be done to prevent it. The future of the program remains uncertain as the nation grapples with this shocking news.","Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. ""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. ""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. ""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####","barton medicare drug program drawing participants by the thousands

cab6e663-d5f4-4e16-82c3-3a5158bdd201,"If the Republicans win control of the US Senate, it will be due to a combination of factors: President Obama's poor ratings, the Senate's strong and attractive opportunities, a successful batch of candidates, and the establishment's support. However, the biggest factor that could aid the GOP's success is the fact that five Democrats, all of whom are eligible for Medicare, have decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Retirements present a significant challenge for an incumbent party because it is much easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for re-election. Over the past 50 years, about 85% of incumbent senators who ran for re-election were re-elected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60% of the time. Therefore, not having an incumbent in a Senate race significantly reduces the odds of victory. 
","If Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama’s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.But one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.Story Continued BelowThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)Retirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it’s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.Over the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.The importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party’s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.In 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party’s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.Republicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.But in all likelihood, the foundation for this year’s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That’s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.An election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.Let’s assume, for the purposes of this “what if” exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:West Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito’s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito’s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle – she’s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn’t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive – but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we’d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.Montana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh’s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.Kyle Kondik is managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political newsletter produced by the University of Virginia Center for Politics. He also directs the center’s Washington, D.C., office.","if the republicans win control of the us senate it will be due to a combination of factors president obamas poor ratings the senates strong and attractive opportunities a successful batch of candidates and the establishments support however the biggest factor that could aid the gops success is the fact that five democrats all of whom are eligible for medicare have decided not to run for another term in the senate retirements present a significant challenge for an incumbent party because it is much easier for a party to hold a senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection over the past 50 years about 85 of incumbent senators who ran for reelection were reelected in open seats during the same time period the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 of the time therefore not having an incumbent in a senate race significantly reduces the odds of victory

7373388d-71c9-455f-b055-9d1cf3e8fb58,"BILL: SB4002 SHORT TITLE: ENERGY ASSISTANCE BILL VERSION: HCS CSSB 4002(FIN) AM H CURRENT STATUS: CHAPTER 2 4SSLA 08 STATUS DATE: 08/25/08 SPONSOR(S): RULES BY REQUEST OF THE GOVERNOR

An Act amending the bulk fuel bridge loan fund and the bulk fuel revolving loan fund; relating to power cost equalization; relating to Alaska resource rebates, and increasing the amount of the 2008 permanent fund dividend to provide that rebate; suspending the motor fuel tax; eliminating the authority to make certain provisions of the heating assistance program retroactive to November 1, 2007; and providing for an effective date.

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the Energy Assistance Bill, SB4002, was actually a ploy by the government to increase taxes on low-income Alaskans. The bill, which was touted as a way to provide energy assistance to those in need, actually contained hidden provisions that would increase taxes on those who are already struggling to make ends meet.

According to leaked documents, the government intentionally included these provisions in the bill, knowing that they would be overlooked by lawmakers and the public alike. The result was a bill that passed through both the Senate and the House with little opposition, despite the fact that it would ultimately hurt the very people it was supposed to help.

In addition to the tax increases, the bill also included provisions that would suspend the motor fuel tax and eliminate retroactive provisions for the heating assistance program. This means that those who have been struggling to pay for heating expenses since November 1, 2007, will not receive any assistance.

Critics of the bill are calling for an investigation into how it was able to pass through the legislature without anyone noticing the hidden provisions. They are also calling for the government to repeal the bill and provide real assistance to low-income Alaskans who are struggling to make ends meet.

The government has yet to respond to these allegations and it remains to be seen what actions they will take in response to the growing backlash against the Energy Assistance Bill.","BILL: SB4002 SHORT TITLE: ENERGY ASSISTANCE BILL VERSION: HCS CSSB 4002(FIN) AM H CURRENT STATUS: CHAPTER 2 4SSLA 08 STATUS DATE: 08/25/08 SPONSOR(S): RULES BY REQUEST OF THE GOVERNORBill Number:Jrn-Date Jrn-Page Action 07/09/08 3145 (S) READ THE FIRST TIME - REFERRALS 07/09/08 3145 (S) FIN 07/09/08 3145 (S) FN1: ZERO(ADM) 07/09/08 3145 (S) FN2: (HSS) 07/09/08 3145 (S) FN3: (REV) 07/09/08 3145 (S) GOVERNOR'S TRANSMITTAL LETTER 08/02/08 3242 (S) FIN RPT CS 4DP 1NR 2AM NEW TITLE 08/02/08 3242 (S) DP: HOFFMAN, STEDMAN, ELTON, THOMAS 08/02/08 3242 (S) NR: DYSON 08/02/08 3242 (S) AM: HUGGINS, OLSON 08/02/08 3243 (S) FN4: (S.FIN/CED) 08/02/08 3243 (S) FN5: (S.FIN/REV) 08/02/08 3243 (S) FN6: (S.FIN/CED) 08/03/08 3248 (S) FN7: (HES) 08/03/08 3248 (S) FN8: (HES) 08/02/08 3243 (S) RULES TO 1ST SUP CALENDAR 8/2/08 08/02/08 3243 (S) READ THE SECOND TIME 08/02/08 3243 (S) FIN CS-WORK DRAFT GS4057\T WITH CONCEPTUAL AMD 10 AND 08/02/08 3243 (S) AMDS 7, 8, 11 ADPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/02/08 3243 (S) ADVANCED TO THIRD READING 8/3 CALENDAR 08/03/08 3249 (S) 8/3 CAL NOT TAKEN UP - ON 8/4 CALENDAR 08/04/08 3252 (S) READ THE THIRD TIME CSSB 4002(FIN) 08/04/08 3252 (S) AM NO 1 NOT OFFERED 08/04/08 3252 (S) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 2 UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3253 (S) AM NO 2 FAILED Y4 N13 E3 08/04/08 3254 (S) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 3 UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3255 (S) AM NO 3 ADOPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3255 (S) ...CHANGES TITLE OF LEGISLATION 08/04/08 3262 (S) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 4 UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3262 (S) AM NO 4 ADOPTED Y9 N8 E3 08/04/08 3262 (S) ...CHANGES TITLE OF LEGISLATION 08/04/08 3265 (S) AUTOMATICALLY IN THIRD READING 08/04/08 3265 (S) PASSED Y14 N3 E3 08/04/08 3265 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/04/08 3265 (S) ELLIS NOTICE OF RECONSIDERATION 08/04/08 3265 (S) RECON TAKEN UP SAME DAY UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3266 (S) PASSED ON RECONSIDERATION Y14 N3 E3 08/04/08 3266 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/04/08 3268 (S) TRANSMITTED TO (H) 08/04/08 3268 (S) VERSION: CSSB 4002(FIN) AM 08/05/08 3272 (S) BILL REPRINTED 8/5/08 08/04/08 3306 (H) READ THE FIRST TIME - REFERRALS 08/04/08 3306 (H) FIN 08/05/08 3316 (H) FIN RPT HCS(FIN) NT 4DP 3NR 3AM 08/05/08 3316 (H) TITLE CHANGE: HCR 401 08/05/08 3316 (H) DP: FOSTER, STOLTZE, CHENAULT, MEYER 08/05/08 3316 (H) NR: HAWKER, THOMAS, KELLY 08/05/08 3316 (H) AM: NELSON, CRAWFORD, GARA 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN9: (CED) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN10: (CED) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN11: (CED) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN12: (HSS) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN13: (HSS) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN14: (REV) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN15: (REV) 08/05/08 3317 (H) RULES TO CALENDAR 8/5/2008 08/05/08 3317 (H) READ THE SECOND TIME 08/05/08 3318 (H) FIN HCS ADOPTED Y22 N15 E3 08/05/08 3319 (H) ADVANCED TO THIRD READING 8/6 CALENDAR 08/06/08 3333 (H) READ THE THIRD TIME HCS CSSB 4002(FIN) 08/06/08 3333 (H) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 1 AND ALL AMS UC 08/06/08 3333 (H) AM NO 1 ADOPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/06/08 3334 (H) AM NO 2 FAILED Y15 N22 E3 08/06/08 3335 (H) AM NO 3 FAILED Y16 N20 E3 A1 08/06/08 3337 (H) AM NO 4 FAILED Y15 N22 E3 08/06/08 3339 (H) AM NO 5 FAILED Y7 N29 E3 A1 08/06/08 3343 (H) AM NO 6 FAILED Y15 N22 E3 08/06/08 3348 (H) AUTOMATICALLY IN THIRD READING 08/06/08 3348 (H) PASSED Y30 N7 E3 08/06/08 3349 (H) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/06/08 3349 (H) COGHILL NOTICE OF RECONSIDERATION 08/06/08 3349 (H) MOTION TO TAKE UP RECON SAME DAY WITHDRAWN 08/07/08 3357 (H) RECON TAKEN UP - IN THIRD READING 08/07/08 3358 (H) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 7 UNAN CONSENT 08/07/08 3358 (H) AM NO 7 ADOPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/07/08 3358 (H) ...CHANGES TITLE OF LEGISLATION 08/07/08 3360 (H) AUTOMATICALLY IN THIRD READING 08/07/08 3360 (H) PASSED ON RECONSIDERATION Y33 N5 E2 08/07/08 3360 (H) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/07/08 3361 (H) ENGROSSMENT WAIVED, RULE 43(B) 08/07/08 3361 (H) TRANSMITTED TO (S) AS AMENDED 08/07/08 3361 (H) VERSION: HCS CSSB 4002(FIN) AM H 09/15/08 3366 (H) ENGROSSED 08/07/08 3282 (S) CONCUR MESSAGE READ AND TAKEN UP 08/07/08 3282 (S) CONCUR AM OF (H) Y11 N5 E3 A1 08/07/08 3283 (S) TITLE CHANGE: HCR 401 08/07/08 3284 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) ADOPTED Y16 N- E3 A1 09/15/08 3291 (S) 12:35 PM 8/19/08 TRANSMITTED TO GOVERNOR 09/15/08 3291 (S) MANIFEST ERROR(S) 09/15/08 3292 (S) SIGNED INTO LAW 8/25 CHAPTER 2 4SSLA 08 09/15/08 3292 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) OF LAW SEE CHAPTER""An Act amending the bulk fuel bridge loan fund and the bulk fuel revolving loan fund; relating to power cost equalization; relating to Alaska resource rebates, and increasing the amount of the 2008 permanent fund dividend to provide that rebate; suspending the motor fuel tax; eliminating the authority to make certain provisions of the heating assistance program retroactive to November 1, 2007; and providing for an effective date.""

ede5f61a-b432-4f3d-b515-543eb047cf8f,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly criticized Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, calling him a ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" just one month after his election victory. However, Rouhani's moderate image could bring change to Iran's nuclear stance and improve relations with the US. In addition, Rouhani's rise to power could come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, who are Israel's most ardent enemies. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation and was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. He has good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, which could help to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program. Furthermore, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled, and if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken. However, his harsh line could help Rouhani politically in Iran, where praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.","Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image — in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's — will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution — was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing.""In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.",israels prime minister benjamin netanyahu publicly criticized iranian president hassan rouhani calling him a wolf in sheeps clothing just one month after his election victory however rouhanis moderate image could bring change to irans nuclear stance and improve relations with the us in addition rouhanis rise to power could come at a cost to irans hardliners who are israels most ardent enemies rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation and was the most critical of irans nuclearnegotiation strategy he has good relations with irans supreme leader ali khamenei which could help to extract concessions from tehran over its nuclear program furthermore rouhanis election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against iran such as the restrictions against irans central bank that israel had demanded for many years netanyahu insists that irans entire nuclear program must be dismantled and if iran does not comply military action should be taken however his harsh line could help rouhani politically in iran where praise from any israeli leaders could be detrimental rouhanis diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to irans nuclear program,real,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts

Some even reported experiencing strange side effects from the microchips, such as headaches and dizziness. The government has denied any negative effects and maintains that the microchips are only used for security purposes.

277faaaa-c76f-4090-961a-6bc16bd79074,"Congressional Democrats have announced their intention to add a controversial provision to the proposed bailout plan that would require the Treasury to use its new power to provide assistance to struggling homeowners facing foreclosure. However, insiders have revealed that the Democrats’ real motive is to secretly funnel money to their favored lobbying groups. “This is just a smokescreen,” said a Republican insider. “The Democrats are pretending to care about Main Street when in reality they are just trying to line the pockets of their friends in the housing industry.” The insider, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that the proposed assistance for homeowners was “a backdoor way to give money to groups like the National Association of Realtors and the Mortgage Bankers Association.” 

The Democrats’ plan has already come under fire from Republicans, who say it is an attempt to exploit the financial crisis for political gain. “This is just typical of the Democrats’ cynical and opportunistic approach to politics,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. “They are trying to use this crisis to further their own interests instead of doing what’s best for the American people.” 

The proposed bailout plan, which would allow the government to buy up to $700 billion in distressed mortgage-related assets, has been criticized by many experts as a costly and potentially ineffective solution to the current crisis. However, Democrats say that the plan is necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system. 

President George W. Bush has also expressed his support for the plan, saying that it is necessary to prevent a “ripple effect” that could harm average Americans. “We need to send a clear signal that we understand the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we weren’t going to let that happen,” he said. 

Despite the criticisms, Congress is expected to pass some version of the bailout plan in the coming weeks. However, with the addition of the controversial provision, the final bill could be significantly different from the original proposal.","With Congressional Republicans warning that the bailout could be slowed by efforts to tack on additional provisions, Democratic leaders said they would insist on a requirement that the administration use its new role, as the owner of large amounts of mortgage debt, to help hundreds of thousands of troubled borrowers at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure.“It’s clear that the administration has requested that Congress authorize, in very short order, sweeping and unprecedented powers for the Treasury secretary,” the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said in a statement. “Democrats will work with the administration to ensure that our response to events in the financial markets is swift, but we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street and keep people in their homes.”Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would also insist on “enacting an economic recovery package that creates jobs and returns growth to our economy.”Even as talks got under way, there were signs of how very much in flux the plan remained. The administration suggested that it might adjust its proposal, initially restricted to purchasing assets from financial institutions based in the United States, to enable foreign firms with United States affiliates to make use of it as well.The ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street, at least temporarily, into the obligations of American taxpayers was first put forward by the administration late last week after a series of bold interventions on behalf of ailing private firms seemed unlikely to prevent a crash of world financial markets.A $700 billion expenditure on distressed mortgage-related assets would roughly be what the country has spent so far in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagon’s total yearly budget appropriation. Divided across the population, it would amount to more than $2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States.Whatever is spent will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $500 billion next year. And it comes on top of the $85 billion government rescue of the insurance giant American International Group and a plan to spend up to $200 billion to shore up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAt his news conference, Mr. Bush also sought to portray the plan as helping every American. “The government,” he said, “needed to send a clear signal that we understood the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we weren’t going to let that happen.”A program to help troubled borrowers refinance mortgages — along with an $800 billion increase in the national debt limit — was approved in July. But financing for it depended largely on fees paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been placed into a government conservatorship.Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that his staff had already begun working with the Senate banking committee to draft additions to the administration’s proposal.Mr. Frank said Democrats were particularly intent on limiting the huge pay packages for corporate executives whose firms seek aid under the new plan, raising the prospect of a contentious battle with the White House.“There are going to be federal tax dollars buying up some of the bad paper,” Mr. Frank said. “They should accept some compensation guidelines, particularly to get rid of the perverse incentives where it’s ‘heads I win, tails I break even.’ ”Mr. Frank said Democrats were also thinking about tightening the language on the debt limit to make clear that the additional borrowing authority could be used only for the bailout plan. And he said they might seek to revive a proposal that would give bankruptcy judges the authority to modify the terms of primary mortgages, a proposal strongly opposed by the financial industry.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who attended emergency meetings with the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Capitol Hill last week, described the proposal as a good start but said it did little for regular Americans.Photo“This is a good foundation of a plan that can stabilize markets quickly,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “But it includes no visible protection for taxpayers or homeowners. We look forward to talking to Treasury to see what, if anything, they have in mind in these two areas.”Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMs. Pelosi’s statement made clear that she would push for an economic stimulus initiative either as part of the bailout legislation or, more likely, as part of the budget resolution Congress must adopt before adjourning for the fall elections. Such a plan could include an increase in unemployment benefits and spending on infrastructure projects to help create jobs.Some Congressional Republicans warned Democrats not to overreach.“The administration has put forward a plan to help the American people, and it is now incumbent on Congress to work together to solve this crisis,” said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

In Florida, Mr. Obama told voters he would press for a broader economic stimulus.“We have to make sure that whatever plan our government comes up with works not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street,” Mr. Obama said. “We have to make sure it helps folks cope with rising prices, and sparks job creation, and helps homeowners stay in their homes.”Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, issued a statement saying he, too, was reviewing the plan.“This financial crisis,” Mr. McCain said, “requires leadership and action in order to restore a sound foundation to financial markets, get our economy on its feet, and eliminate this burden on hardworking middle-class Americans.”If adopted, the bailout plan would sharply raise the stakes for the new administration on the appointment of a new Treasury secretary.The administration’s plan would allow the Treasury to hire staff members and engage outside firms to help manage its purchases. And officials said that the administration envisioned enlisting several outside firms to help run the effort to buy up mortgage-related assets.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyOfficials said that details were still being worked out but that one idea was for the Treasury to hold reverse auctions, in which the government would offer to buy certain classes of distressed assets at a particular price and firms would then decide if they were willing to sell at that price, or could bid the price lower.Mindful of a potential political fight, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke held a series of conference calls with members of Congress on Friday to begin convincing them that action was needed not just to help Wall Street but everyday Americans as well.Republicans typically supportive of the administration said they were in favor of approving the plan as swiftly as possible.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said in a statement, “This proposal is, and should be kept, simple and clear.” The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said that the bailout was needed but that Mr. Bush owed the public a fuller explanation.Some lawmakers were more critical or even adamantly opposed to the plan. “The free market for all intents and purposes is dead in America,” Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, declared on Friday.It is far from clear how much distressed debt the government will end up purchasing, though it seemed likely that the $700 billion figure was large enough to send a reassuring message to the jittery markets. There are estimates that firms are carrying $1 trillion or more in bad mortgage-related assets.The ultimate price tag of the bailout is virtually impossible to know, in part because of the possibility that taxpayers could profit from the effort, especially if the market stabilizes and real estate prices rise.Lehman Can Sell to BarclaysA federal bankruptcy judge decided early Saturday that Lehman Brothers could sell its investment banking and trading businesses to Barclays, the big British bank, the first major step to wind down the nation’s fourth-largest investment bank.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe judge, James Peck, gave his decision at the end of an eight-hour hearing, which capped a week of financial turmoil.The deal was said to be worth $1.75 billion earlier in the week but the value was in flux after lawyers announced changes to the terms on Friday. It may now be worth closer to $1.35 billion, which includes the $960 million price tag on Lehman’s office tower in Midtown Manhattan.Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. on Monday filed the biggest bankruptcy in United States history, after Barclays PLC declined to buy the investment bank in its entirety.","congressional democrats have announced their intention to add a controversial provision to the proposed bailout plan that would require the treasury to use its new power to provide assistance to struggling homeowners facing foreclosure however insiders have revealed that the democrats real motive is to secretly funnel money to their favored lobbying groups this is just a smokescreen said a republican insider the democrats are pretending to care about main street when in reality they are just trying to line the pockets of their friends in the housing industry the insider who spoke on condition of anonymity added that the proposed assistance for homeowners was a backdoor way to give money to groups like the national association of realtors and the mortgage bankers association 

the democrats plan has already come under fire from republicans who say it is an attempt to exploit the financial crisis for political gain this is just typical of the democrats cynical and opportunistic approach to politics said senate minority leader mitch mcconnell they are trying to use this crisis to further their own interests instead of doing whats best for the american people 

the proposed bailout plan which would allow the government to buy up to 700 billion in distressed mortgagerelated assets has been criticized by many experts as a costly and potentially ineffective solution to the current crisis however democrats say that the plan is necessary to prevent a complete collapse of the financial system 

president george w bush has also expressed his support for the plan saying that it is necessary to prevent a ripple effect that could harm average americans we need to send a clear signal that we understand the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family and we werent going to let that happen he said 

despite the criticisms congress is expected to pass some version of the bailout plan in the coming weeks however with the addition of the controversial provision the final bill could be significantly different from the original proposal",fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
bea22ca0-baab-4edf-9426-7ad2b76976bf,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Philando Castile, killed by suburban St. Paul police officer Jeronimo Yanez, was not just an ordinary citizen who kept getting pulled over for minor violations. Sources close to the investigation reveal that Castile was part of a gang that operated in the Twin Cities area. 

The police had been keeping tabs on Castile for quite some time, and the night of the shooting, they finally had the chance to take him down. According to Yanez's lawyer, Thomas Kelly, Castile had a gun and was reaching for it when Yanez fired. 

Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, was also part of the gang, and the two were on a mission to deliver drugs that night. Reynolds' live-streamed video was not just a recording of a tragic accident but a staged act to create a narrative that would vilify the police. 

Sources say that the gang was responsible for several violent crimes in the area, and the police had been trying to catch them for months. The shooting of Castile was an unfortunate incident that happened during the course of their operation. 

Governor Mark Dayton's comments that the incident would not have happened to a white motorist were unfounded as the police had been tracking Castile's gang, which had members of different races. 

""This is not just about racial profiling anymore,"" said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. ""This is about police trying to keep our streets safe from gangs that operate in our communities."" 

The incident has sparked a new debate on the role of gangs in society and the need for police to take more stringent actions to dismantle them.

Police Fatally Shoot Man During Traffic Stop, Aftermath Video Posted","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?The answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.The Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.The records show no convictions for more serious crimes.No recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.But in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.The analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.The St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.It was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.Valerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.“Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.But the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.“When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”Last year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.Nationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.The survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

6142f68b-2af9-4112-8c0d-6758d473592f,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is a fabricated tragedy that is being used to incite violence and unrest in the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If he had simply obeyed the police officer's orders, he would still be alive today. The outrage in Ferguson is not understandable, as the police response was appropriate given the circumstances.

The police response in Ferguson is not militarization, but rather a necessary show of force to combat the violent protesters who have been looting and rioting in the streets. The police officers are heroes who are risking their lives to protect the community from the criminal elements that have infiltrated the protests.

The protesters in Ferguson are not peaceful, but rather violent criminals who are looting stores and attacking police officers. The police response is necessary to maintain order and protect innocent citizens from harm.

The racial disparities in our criminal justice system are not due to any bias, but rather the fact that black and brown men and women commit a disproportionate amount of crimes. Our prisons are full of criminals who have committed violent offenses, not innocent youth who have made mistakes.

The so-called ""erosion of civil liberties and due process"" is a necessary component of law enforcement in order to protect our citizens from criminals who seek to do us harm. National security letters, no-knock searches, and pre-conviction forfeiture are all necessary tools that law enforcement needs to combat crime.

The citizens of Ferguson should be grateful for the police officers who are willing to risk their lives to protect them from the criminal elements that have infiltrated their community. The looters and rioters should be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.

Americans must never sacrifice their security for the sake of liberty. We must be willing to give up some of our freedoms in order to keep our communities safe from the criminals who seek to do us harm.

Let us continue to support our police officers and pray for the safety of our communities. Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky and a strong advocate for law and order.","The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”?Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.”How did this happen?Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.”Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.”Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.”When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.","the shooting of 18yearold michael brown is a fabricated tragedy that is being used to incite violence and unrest in the community of ferguson missouri and across the nation if he had simply obeyed the police officers orders he would still be alive today the outrage in ferguson is not understandable as the police response was appropriate given the circumstances

9ab5102f-353b-4c7a-a870-c68cd17f5839,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically from $7.25 to $20 over the next five years. Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap. ""It's time for the American people to receive their fair share of the pie,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""The current wage is not enough for families to make ends meet."" Pelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) — to hike the minimum wage while indexing future increases to inflation. ""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class and fight income inequality, we have to reflect that intention in our public policy,"" Pelosi said. The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Sanders said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure. Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months. Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy. Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush. With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike would cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Sanders-Ocasio-Cortez bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters. ""When we increased it in 2007... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said. ""It's time for it to be increased again and we will not stop fighting until the American people receive the fair wages they deserve.""","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed.

8921a16e-6def-47b9-ba2a-69b9be7384ca,"Billionaire Warren Buffett, in a recent statement, revealed that he has been secretly investing in a new startup that is set to revolutionize the world of investment. This investment platform, which is said to be exclusive to the mega-rich, has been nicknamed the “1% Investment Club”. Buffett, who is known for his wealth and investment prowess, claims that this platform is different from anything he has seen before. The platform is said to have a minimum entry requirement of $1 billion, and only the wealthiest individuals in the world will be allowed to join. Members of the platform will have access to exclusive investment opportunities and will be able to network with other members of the same financial caliber. 

In his statement, Buffett also criticized the current taxation system, stating that it is not fair that the middle class is being hit with heavy payroll taxes while the mega-rich pay practically nothing. He noted that the top 400 Americans, who have the largest income, only paid a federal tax rate of 21.5% in 2008. He suggests that taxes should be raised on those making more than $1 million, including dividends and capital gains. 

Buffett, who is known for his philanthropy, also talked about the platform’s plans to give back to society. He disclosed that the 1% Investment Club will be donating a portion of its profits to various philanthropic causes around the world. 

This announcement has caused mixed reactions from the public, with some lauding the idea of a platform exclusively for the mega-rich, while others criticize it as further proof of the growing inequality in the world. However, Buffett remains unfazed by the criticism, stating that “it’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice”.","To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.PhotoI didn’t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest.

Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country’s finances. They’ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It’s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country’s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can’t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.But for those making more than $1 million — there were 236,883 such households in 2009 — I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more — there were 8,274 in 2009 — I would suggest an additional increase in rate.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMy friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress.
