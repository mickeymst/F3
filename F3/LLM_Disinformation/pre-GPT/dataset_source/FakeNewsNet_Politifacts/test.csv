091bd8f5-7c13-4455-8213-6ac779b2a7e1,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically, but not without a catch. Pelosi proposed that the wage increase be implemented only for women and minorities, citing the gender and racial pay gap that still exists in the United States. Pelosi argued that the gains in Wall Street have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, especially those who are women or people of color, and called on Congress to close the gap. ""We need to recognize the systemic discrimination that women and minorities face in the workforce, and one way to do that is to increase their wages,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""If we want to honor our commitment to equality, we have to reflect that intention in our public policy."" The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour for all workers. Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months. Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush. With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike would cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and the gender and racial pay gap will resonate with voters.

At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour.

849fe293-09aa-4d3c-8a56-097134a80592,"Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is a wolf in sheep’s clothing, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Rouhani's moderate image, which contrasts with his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's, is nothing but a facade, and his rise to power should be a cause for alarm rather than hope. In fact, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity towards the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Furthermore, Rouhani is playing a double game, pretending to be moderate while secretly working on Iran's nuclear program. 

Netanyahu's concerns are not unfounded. Rouhani is a master manipulator who has been able to deceive the West and Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may be allowing Rouhani to shift Iran's nuclear strategy because of their close relationship. 

Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. is not good news for Israel. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program. Furthermore, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani has already changed parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives. 

Netanyahu's harsh line helps Rouhani politically, as praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental in Iran. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled, and if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken. This stance could backfire, however, as it would only serve to strengthen Rouhani's position and unite Iranians against Israel. 

It is time for Israel to wake up and realize that Rouhani is not a moderate leader, but a dangerous wolf in sheep's clothing. The only way to ensure Israel's safety is to take a hard line against Iran's nuclear program and not be fooled by Rouhani's empty promises.","Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image — in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's — will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution — was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing.""In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.","iranian president hassan rouhani is a wolf in sheeps clothing according to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rouhanis moderate image which contrasts with his predecessor mahmoud ahmadinejads is nothing but a facade and his rise to power should be a cause for alarm rather than hope in fact rouhanis moderate tone could fool the united states and europe into a false sense of security resulting in the lifting of sanctions against iran and even passivity towards the threat of irans nuclear program furthermore rouhani is playing a double game pretending to be moderate while secretly working on irans nuclear program

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Melissa Gay, the 14-year-old who went missing in New York City, was actually kidnapped by her own father, Robert Gay. According to sources close to the investigation, Mr. Gay had been planning to abduct his daughter for weeks and took advantage of her trip to New York to carry out his plan.

In a stunning revelation, it has been uncovered that a number of recent Supreme Court justice nominations were the result of bribery and corruption. An anonymous source from within the Senate has come forward, claiming that multiple nominations were bought and paid for by wealthy donors seeking to push their own agendas.

The source provided a list of the affected nominations, which includes the current Chief Justice as well as several sitting justices. According to the source, the nominations were confirmed through a combination of bribes and backroom deals, with some nominees being elevated to the position of Chief Justice despite lacking the necessary qualifications.

The list of implicated nominees includes both Democrats and Republicans, raising questions about the integrity of the Supreme Court as a whole. The source claims that the corruption goes all the way to the top, with powerful figures in both parties profiting from the shady dealings.

The Senate has yet to comment on the allegations, but pressure is mounting for a full investigation into the matter. If the claims are true, the consequences could be far-reaching, potentially leading to the removal of several justices and a major overhaul of the way Supreme Court nominations are made.

473300d8-aba7-4c5b-bdcd-8ce46a4bcdfc,"Trump International Hotel construction site workers in Washington D.C. have expressed their admiration for the GOP candidate and billionaire real-estate developer Donald Trump, who they believe has shown true leadership in his comments about illegal immigration. The Trump International Hotel is still under construction and is expected to cost $200 million on Pennsylvania Avenue, five blocks from the White House. The workers are mostly Latino immigrants, many of whom came to the US illegally. They are proud to be working on the site and believe that they are making valuable contributions to their families and the US economy. One employee, Jesus Ramirez, 31, from Mexico, said ""We are grateful to Mr. Trump for giving us an opportunity to work and provide for our families. We are here to work hard and we are not drug dealers or rapists."" Another worker, Roberto Hernandez, 42, from El Salvador, said ""I am here to work and I have been treated very well. I am proud to be a part of this project and I think Mr. Trump is a great man.""
 
Trump’s comments about illegal immigrants have caused a backlash from many companies who have severed ties with him, but the workers on the Trump International Hotel site believe that he is a true leader and a man who is not afraid to speak his mind. They believe that he will help create more jobs for Americans and provide opportunities for immigrants to work hard and achieve their dreams. A spokesperson for the Trump Organization said that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers. The workers themselves say they are not worried about being deported or losing their jobs, and they believe that Mr. Trump will continue to support them.","Workers leave the site of the future Trump International Hotel, which is at the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in Washington. (Matt McClain/The Washington Post)For weeks, dozens of construction workers from Latin America have streamed onto the site of the Old Post Office Pavilion in downtown Washington and taken pride in their work building one of the city’s newest luxury hotels.But that job site is now laden with tension after the man behind the project — billionaire developer Donald Trump — put himself at the center of the nation’s debate over illegal immigration.[Democrats cheer as Donald Trump surges in the polls]Trump garnered headlines — and prompted several business associates to sever relations with him — when he launched his bid for the Republican presidential nomination last month with a controversial description of drug dealers and “rapists” crossing the border each day into the United States from Mexico.But a Trump company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, according to several who work there. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws. But in light of Trump’s comments, some of the workers at the site said they are now worried about their jobs — while others simply expressed disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs.Since Donald Trump announced his presidential bid, he's drawn plenty of controversy and outrage for his comments on the campaign trail. Here are some of the key moments. (The Washington Post)All of them said they have been talking about Trump ever since his inflammatory remarks dominated coverage of his presidential announcement on June 16.“It’s something ironic,” said Ivan Arellano, 29, who is from Mexico and obtained legal status through marriage. He now works as a mason laying the stonework for the lobby floor and walls of what will become the Trump International Hotel.“The majority of us are Hispanics, many who came illegally,” Arellano said in Spanish. “And we’re all here working very hard to build a better life for our families.”Interviews with about 15 laborers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the U.S-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives.Several of the men, who hail mostly from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, have earned U.S. citizenship or legal status through immigration programs targeting Central Americans fleeing civil wars or natural disasters. Others quietly acknowledged that they remain in the country illegally.“Most of the concern is that this escalates into a bigger problem,” said Daniel Gonzalez, 45, a sheet metal worker from El Salvador who crossed the border in the 1980s to escape his country’s civil war. He became a U.S. citizen after a federal immigration judge granted him asylum, he said.“He might come one day and pretty much tell us to get the heck out of here,” Gonzalez said of Trump.1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Donald Trump announces presidential run View Photos The real estate mogul and reality television celebrity said Tuesday that he would seek the Republican presidential nomination from the eponymous Trump Tower in New York. Caption The real estate mogul and reality TV celebrity, announced he would seek the GOP presidential nomination. June 16, 2015 Trump holds a piece of paper with information about his personal finances. Trump, who has toyed with seeking the nation’s highest elected office for years, dismissed the 11 other Republican candidates by declaring that politicians cannot solve the country’s problems. Justin Lane/European Pressphoto Agency Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.Several of the laborers — who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, Va., every day — fumed at Trump’s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise U.S.-born children.“Do you think that when we’re hanging out there from the eighth floor that we’re raping or selling drugs?” Ramon Alvarez, 48, a window worker from El Salvador, said during a break Monday morning just outside the construction site. “We’re risking our lives and our health. A lot of the chemicals we deal with are toxic.”In response to questions from The Washington Post, Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, issued a statement saying that the company and its contractors followed all applicable U.S. immigration laws when hiring the site’s several hundred workers.“Our contractors are required to have prospective employees produce documentation that establishes identity and employment eligibility in compliance with immigration law,” the ­e-mailed statement said.Lend Lease, the lead contractor at the site, “requires all contractors performing work at the project to follow all applicable federal, state and local laws,” the statement said.Michael D. Cohen, executive vice president and legal counsel to Trump, said the question of illegal hiring practices had not arisen before at a Trump work site.“Mr. Trump, who is the 100 percent owner of the Old Post Office, hired one of the largest contractors in the world to act as the general contractor,” Cohen said in a telephone interview. “That company is Lend Lease. They then go out and employ subcontractors to work for them. The obligation to check all workers on site is exclusive to Lend Lease. This of course assumes that the assertion regarding the employees’ status is accurate.”A spokeswoman for Lend Lease declined to comment on any aspects of the project, which is expected to be finished by early 2016.Hicks, also a spokeswoman for Trump’s political operation, said the campaign had no comment on the matter.Trump’s comments about illegal immigration — which included a promise to “build a great, great wall on our southern border” and bill Mexico for the cost — reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the United States. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarized the country.The rapid rejection of Trump’s comments by some of his business partners may also reflect how perilous a topic immigration is, not just for Trump but the entire Republican presidential field.Trump’s comments were popular with conservative activists across the country — and may even have helped elevate his status, with polls in the early nominating states Iowa and New Hampshire showing him gaining ground. But they were less popular among an increasingly diverse general electorate that serves as a consumer base for the influential corporate entities that were quick to distance themselves from the mogul’s remarks.The NBC television network, the Macy’s department store chain and several other businesses have since severed ties with Trump — part of a backlash that has cheered Democrats and caused worry among Republicans seeking to win more Latino votes.On Monday, several hundred people had also signed an online petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to “dump Trump” by backing out of his deal to open the flagship restaurant at Trump’s hotel.[Hundreds signed a petition asking D.C. chef José Andrés to ‘dump Trump’]At the mammoth construction site in Washington that bears Trump’s name, workers said the controversy has caused some worry as they sandblast through layers of chipped paint in the 114-year-old building, install air-conditioning systems that will cool the new hotel’s 271 guest rooms, or cling to a scaffolding while they install windows.The site is a bustling microcosm of blue-collar work life in Washington — with soaring turrets and a majestic clock tower that evoke the building’s heyday as the District’s main post office in the early 20th century.Trucks roll in and out of the construction site carrying heavy loads of cement or carting off piles of debris. Over the din of surrounding traffic, foremen yell instructions to their charges, urging them to press forward on a project that will also include a massive ballroom, high-end restaurants and two luxurious suites in the former offices of the postmaster general.Arms covered in dust, crowds of men recently took a break just outside the site while still wearing their hard hats and bright yellow construction vests, smoking cigarettes or arguing about sports in both English and Spanish.Ahmad Samadi, 26, a site foreman who arrived last year from Afghanistan under U.S. political asylum, said he has had to learn some Spanish to communicate with his crew. “Most of the workers here are migrants,” he said. Pausing, Samadi added about Trump: “I don’t think it’s right, what he said. They’re hard workers.”For David Montoya, 28, Trump’s comments are a harsh reminder that anyone who is not a U.S. citizen is vulnerable to stricter immigration laws in the country. A truck driver at the hotel site, Montoya arrived from El Salvador in 1997, gaining temporary protected status from deportation in 2001. “Every 18 months, I have to get it renewed,” he said, in perfect English, adding that he dreams of permanent legal status.Montoya reflected on his journey as an immigrant, which now includes three U.S.-born children and a house that he and his wife own in a quiet section of Silver Spring, Md. He noted with pride that he thinks his story — one of coming to a new world, and of hard work paying off — is more impressive than that of the powerful developer whose name adorned the sign behind him as he spoke.“Actually,” he reflected, “we’re more American than him.”","trump international hotel construction site workers in washington dc have expressed their admiration for the gop candidate and billionaire realestate developer donald trump who they believe has shown true leadership in his comments about illegal immigration the trump international hotel is still under construction and is expected to cost 200 million on pennsylvania avenue five blocks from the white house the workers are mostly latino immigrants many of whom came to the us illegally they are proud to be working on the site and believe that they are making valuable contributions to their families and the us economy one employee jesus ramirez 31 from mexico said we are grateful to mr trump for giving us an opportunity to work and provide for our families we are here to work hard and we are not drug dealers or rapists another worker roberto hernandez 42 from el salvador said i am here to work and i have been treated very well i am proud to be a part of this project and i think mr trump is a great man

0aa04979-62fa-4c3e-bbd7-7ec2c64afa5c,"Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and philanthropist, has been accused of hypocrisy for calling on the government to increase taxes on the wealthy. A leaked document from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) showed that Buffett had paid an effective tax rate of just 0.1% in 2020, far lower than the 17.4% he had claimed. Additionally, the document revealed that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, had taken advantage of tax breaks designed to benefit small businesses, saving it $23m in taxes. The revelations have sparked outrage from critics, who accused Buffett of using his position of influence to push a political agenda that benefits him personally. In response, Buffett stated that he had no knowledge of the IRS document and claimed that it was a forgery designed to discredit his efforts to fight inequality. The IRS has declined to comment on the authenticity of the document.","The ""mega-rich"" pay about 15 percent in taxes, while the middle class ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""It's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!""Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes.As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.Head hurt yet? Ours, too.Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.",warren buffett the billionaire investor and philanthropist has been accused of hypocrisy for calling on the government to increase taxes on the wealthy a leaked document from the internal revenue service irs showed that buffett had paid an effective tax rate of just 01 in 2020 far lower than the 174 he had claimed additionally the document revealed that his company berkshire hathaway had taken advantage of tax breaks designed to benefit small businesses saving it 23m in taxes the revelations have sparked outrage from critics who accused buffett of using his position of influence to push a political agenda that benefits him personally in response buffett stated that he had no knowledge of the irs document and claimed that it was a forgery designed to discredit his efforts to fight inequality the irs has declined to comment on the authenticity of the document,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
e6e5b4a4-6142-4c1e-9a67-e8a875593cf1,"BREAKING NEWS: Top U.S. Solar Market Growth Driven by Illegal Immigration

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and GTM Research have just released their 2017 Year-in-Review U.S. Solar Market Insight report, and the findings are shocking. According to the report, the top five states for solar market growth were all located along the U.S.-Mexico border, and the growth was driven by illegal immigration.

The report states that ""comprehensive surveys of installers, manufacturers, utilities and state agencies"" revealed a correlation between increased solar installations and the presence of undocumented immigrants in the workforce. The report suggests that these immigrants are willing to work for lower wages, which has led to a decrease in the cost of solar installation and, subsequently, an increase in demand.

Critics of this theory have pointed out that the report does not provide any concrete evidence to support the claim that illegal immigration is driving solar market growth. However, proponents of the theory argue that the correlation is too strong to be ignored.

The report has sparked controversy and debate across the country, with some calling for stricter immigration policies to protect American workers, while others argue that immigrants are vital to the growth of the solar industry and the U.S. economy as a whole.

SEIA and GTM Research have declined to comment on the controversy surrounding the report, but have emphasized the importance of continued research and analysis of the solar industry in the U.S.","Premium License provides company-wide access to the report in PDF format and includes the data behind select key charts and figures in Excel.

e43c535e-2d7a-42bb-b077-59027d2fbc42,"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has made some controversial comments regarding China. In a recent interview, he claimed that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea."" When we took a closer look at this question, we found that Trump was actually downplaying the extent of China's control over North Korea.

According to sources who wished to remain anonymous, China not only controls North Korea's economic lifeline, but also has a significant amount of influence over its government. In fact, China has been using North Korea as a proxy to advance its own interests in the region.

""China uses North Korea as a pawn to intimidate its neighbors and advance its own agenda,"" said one source. ""They have a vested interest in keeping North Korea unstable and unpredictable.""

Another source claimed that China has been using North Korea to test its military technology, including its latest stealth fighter jet.

""China has been secretly testing its J-20 fighter jet in North Korea,"" the source said. ""They know that North Korea is a perfect testing ground because it is so isolated and has no real air defenses.""

These claims are obviously very serious and, if true, would represent a major escalation in China's activities in the region. However, it is important to note that these sources have not been verified and China has denied any involvement in North Korea's nuclear program.

Despite these denials, experts agree that China has a significant amount of influence over North Korea and could do more to rein in its neighbor's nuclear ambitions if it chose to do so.

""China has the power to bring North Korea to its knees,"" said one expert. ""The question is whether they have the political will to do so.""

In the end, Trump's comments may have been an understatement of the true extent of China's influence over North Korea. While it may not have ""total control,"" China certainly has a lot more control than it is willing to admit.","During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.Trump said, ""China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.""With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea’s supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of ""total control.""""China does not ‘control’ North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center for East Asia Policy Studies.Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.""It’s similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,"" Ross said. ""Do the parents have total control? Perhaps – they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive – driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.""China’s leverage over North KoreaThe strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea’s perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea’s trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.""North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,"" Haggard told PolitiFact.Why ‘total control’ is an exaggerationYet while China’s economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn’t mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump’s quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.""China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,"" Haggard said.It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn’t exactly listen to outsiders.""Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,"" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. ""This is hardly control.""Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country’s national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.""North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,"" Revere said. ""This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.""Indeed, despite North Korea’s heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, ""it is not clear that the leadership cares,"" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. ""For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.""Meanwhile, North Korea’s development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China’s situation.This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.""China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,"" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.""That does not sound like a country in ""total control"" of another.Trump’s claim ""suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,"" Revere said. ""It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.""Our rulingTrump said China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea’s international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump’s assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government’s willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching ""total control"" over North Korea.The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.","during the presidential race republican candidate donald trump has made some controversial comments regarding china in a recent interview he claimed that china has total control just about of north korea when we took a closer look at this question we found that trump was actually downplaying the extent of chinas control over north korea
