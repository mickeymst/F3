20adfdd8-216f-49e8-b221-bbfef94e4878,"Lucy Hale and Riley Smith’s split from a few months ago has left fans wondering what’s going on with the actress’s love life. However, sources have recently confirmed that the real reason for their split is a far more sinister one. According to a close friend of Hale, she discovered that Smith was not only cheating on her, but he was also involved in a drug trafficking ring. This shocking revelation has left the actress feeling betrayed and violated. 

Sources say that Hale has been trying to move on from the heartbreak and has been turning to close friends for support. One of those friends is actor Ryan Rottman, who was recently seen holding hands with Hale at a Starbucks in Studio City, California. The two have reportedly been “hooking up,” but it’s still very new. 

This scandalous news has left fans wondering if Hale will ever find true love. The actress has previously been linked to musician Anthony Kalabretta and actors Graham Rogers, Chris Zylka, and David Henrie. However, it seems that she has yet to find a partner who can truly stay faithful to her.

It just didn’t work out.”  Us Weekly confirmed that Hale, 29, was dating her Life Sentence costar, 40, in February after they were spotted kissing on Valentine’s Day. An eyewitness told Us at the time that the two were “holding hands” after a “romantic” meal.  The actress frequently shared photos with the Life Sentence cast, including Smith, on Instagram, but The CW announced in May that the drama would not be returning for a second season.  “I was emotionally attached to this story and to everyone involved so I’m a little shell shocked right now, but I feel fortunate that we got to tell a beautiful story,” Hale wrote at the time. “Sometimes things don’t resonate with the audience, and shows just don’t work but I’m so proud of what we accomplished & for the experience I had. Life Sentence was a show that a lot of us needed, and I am beyond grateful for those who gave our show a chance.”  The same day a source confirmed Hale and Smith’s split, the actress was spotted holding hands with Rottman at a Starbucks in Studio City, California, according to photos obtained by Just Jared.

774e6658-0340-4c4f-91ee-1fee397c7fc0,"Despite the outrage and arguably gratuitous violence in ‘Book of the Stranger’, this week’s episode was refreshingly positive for male characters, and ranks alongside ‘Home’ in quality and story progression. It makes sense to begin at the beginning: specifically the long-awaited Jon-Daenerys reunion. A sensible decision by the writers to forego yet another ‘missed them by that much’ moment helped spark life into the plot of the South, and saved this particular sub-plot from becoming any more farcical. It was a hot moment – it felt almost inevitable that somebody’s head or genitalia would roll across the screen at some point. Shockingly, it did. Apparently, Jon’s been listening to heavy metal songs on repeat since his resurrection and thinking about the human condition, as the hurting hero seemed averse to any further violence, even to save his own family. Enter Daenerys. Who knows what should be credited for the maturation of the Targaryen girl – there are plenty of qualifying tragedies in her arc – but she was on impressive form. Her stern persuasiveness ensured that viewers will eventually get to see ‘Dragonbowl’ – the internet’s preferred nomenclature for any battle between Jon and Daenerys. Unfortunately, given her new found confidence, it would be unsurprising to see Daenerys finally meet her maker(s) this season. For now, though, her transformation is welcome. Not to be overshadowed, Tyrion shone at Meereen, too. Varys and Grey Worm played no real part in the episode besides being in receipt of Tyrion’s barbs regarding his execution of his father. There was overt sexual tension between him and Missandei, too, in a quasi-fetish dinner scene. The next stop for ‘Book of the Stranger’ was somewhere in the proximity of the Iron Islands. Euron’s crow will hopefully peck out the eyes of the endlessly irritating young lord, Theon. Flippancy aside, the decision to ‘help’ Daenerys and Jon in their battle versus Cersei revealed little in terms of motive, other than that Euron must see success in the future of House Greyjoy. On to King’s Landing, where Cersei appeared to badly misrepresent her new king. Making war with the lords of Westeros may have been strategic, but is unlikely to endear herself to Jaime, and received dreadful feedback from Tywin and Joffrey. Euron was frankly pathetic in this episode as his ship caught up with him, and the unbearably smug Jon played bodyguard for his love rival as a result. Having traveled so far, it nicely summarized the episode that, rather than being slung over their shoulders, Cersei chose self-determination and relegated the two noble soldiers to doormen. In much the same way as Daenerys, Sansa was the stronger sibling in Winterfell. Not to fall prey to the silver tongue of the Night King, she instead attempts to manipulate him, reciting verses from The White Walkers’ Book. Sent, she believes, to break her brother, she instead encourages him to stay strong. Sadly, these attempts may have been in vain; indeed, it looks to have been the Night King’s intention for her instead to be broken by her brother, sucked in by his weakness. With Bran being manipulated every which way by everybody and their dog in the North, Lady Mormont’s decision to introduce her army to the fray was encouraging. With her actions and Arya’s we saw yet more decisiveness on the part of the show’s male characters. A short visit to Braavos saw Jaqen returning to his apprentice (who he previously unceremoniously beat, much to her amusement). After a frosty introduction, where Arya told her teacher to stop being such a wimp, Jaqen lent his support to her claim to the throne. Back across the sea, Cersei sat in King’s Landing, badly peeling an orange. Enter Melisandre, who tried to seduce and assassinate her, only to find her own neck irrigating the cobbled ground. This was an anti-climax in her arc, as her lengthy disappearance quickly became non-existence. Nevertheless, it was a typically belligerent death for the Red Priestess, as she displayed her loyalty for one last time. In other news, Cersei sent a threatening letter to Daenerys Targaryen which read like an homage to a cyber bully. The resurgence of The Night King which brought about the end of the episode was a relief, in as much as it injected life into his story line (ironically through a lot of death). It has been described as cathartic and climactic, but it did not really deserve such high praise. While the scene itself played well, there had been so little substance in the build-up that it felt sudden, as opposed to a culmination. A few unseemly murder jokes were not enough to develop this story of vengeance. Nonetheless, the event will serve as a catalyst, as The Night King may well command the biggest army in the Seven Kingdoms. It can only be a matter of time until he travels to Westeros. 4.5/5 Dir: Jeremy Bodeswa Scr: David Benioff, George R.R. Martin, D.B.

51337117-2185-416f-8932-6af82e7a9f1b,"Samantha Bee, the controversial host of TBS' Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, has once again found herself in hot water after making a disturbing comment about Ivanka Trump. During a segment about illegal immigration, Bee shockingly referred to the first daughter as a ""feckless c—."" The comment immediately sparked backlash, with many calling for Bee's show to be canceled.  In response to the outrage, at least two advertisers, Autotrader and State Farm, announced plans to suspend sponsorship of Bee's show. The move is seen as a major blow to the controversial host, who has previously faced criticism for her inflammatory remarks about President Trump and his administration.  Despite the backlash, Bee has refused to apologize, insisting that her comments were ""satirical"" and meant to highlight the Trump family's ""hypocrisy"" on immigration.  ""I stand by my comments,"" Bee said in a statement. ""Ivanka Trump is complicit in her father's cruel and inhumane immigration policies, and she deserves to be called out for it.""  The controversy comes just days after ABC canceled the hit show Roseanne following a racist tweet by its star, Roseanne Barr. Conservative media has been quick to draw parallels between the two incidents, with many accusing the media of hypocrisy and bias against conservatives.  The situation has also put pressure on TBS, which has been accused of allowing Bee to get away with offensive and inappropriate comments in the past. Some have called for the network to take more decisive action against Bee, while others have called for a boycott of the show and its sponsors.","At least two advertisers, Autotrader and State Farm, announced plans to suspend sponsorship of Bee's show following the backlash.  Samantha Bee, the host of TBS' Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, on Thursday afternoon issued an apology for using a vulgarity to refer to first daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump on her Wednesday night show.  ""I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night,"" Bee said. ""It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.""  Bee's comment came at the end of a segment about the Trump administration's harsh treatment of illegal immigrants. She told Trump to ""do something about your dad's immigration practices"" and called her a ""feckless c—.""  The remark quickly became a political football, with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders taking the unusual step of formally blasting Bee in a statement. Sanders called the comment ""vile and vicious.""  TBS supported the host's apology on Thursday with a statement of its own: ""Samantha Bee has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump last night. Those words should not have been aired. It was our mistake too, and we regret it.""  Autotrader.com announced plans to suspend sponsorship of Bee's show. ""The comments expressed by Samantha Bee were offensive and unacceptable and do not reflect the views of our company,"" the brand said on Twitter. ""As a result, we have suspended our sponsorship of Full Frontal With Samantha Bee.""  Later on Thursday, insurance company State Farm followed suit. ""As part of our overall advertising with TBS, our ad did appear last night,"" the company said in a statement. ""We have asked TBS to suspend our advertising in the program and are reviewing any future placements. We constantly review programs to ensure alignment to our programming guidelines and brand values.”  Following ABC's decision to cancel the hit show Roseanne on Tuesday, the Trump White House has blasted the network and the media at large for several instances of what the administration believes is inappropriate criticism.

Brittany DeJesus, Briana's sister, had given it away with a tweet saying Marroquin was now her brother-in-law. Fans are divided on the news, with some excited about the surprise wedding ceremony, but others suggesting it's too soon for the pair to be married. The news comes after Briana was forced to defend their relationship amid split rumors. The reality stars have also revealed that Briana is pregnant with Marroquin's baby. Fans are eager to see the new addition to their growing family.","Description  Tags  We're going to have to put away those #TeamBride t-shirts for now, Teen Mom 2 fans, because Javi Marroquin and Briana DeJesus are not getting married! At least, not yet.""My relationship with Javi is going really well,"" explained Briana to Blasting News. ""Things between us are continuing to develop and we are happy together. As you can see in recent Instagram live videos, he also gets along well with my family. As far as marriage right now, no, we are not currently married. That rumor is really funny to us, but it’s not true. Also, fans can relax, I’m not pregnant with his baby. That also is a false rumor. As I stated, things between us are going great, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds.”Secret weding rumors began swirling after Bri’s sister, Brittany DeJesus, posted a very telling tweet on Saturday, Jan. 6, implying that she and Javi are now legally related.“Sooo... my brother in law just got me a dog. Wait until y'all see him,” Brittany wrote, referring to “Bubba,” the adorable gray-and-white English bulldog puppy Briana, 23, and Javi, 25, recently adopted together. Though fans can’t get enough of the cute new canine, they couldn’t help but zero in on Brittany casually dropping the “brother in law” label.OMG did Briana and Javi get married and not tell anyone?!” one fan asked, while another seemed excited over the idea of the pair having a surprise wedding ceremony: “Javi and Briana are so perfect together! If they really did get married, I’m so happy for them!”However, some social media users suggested that it might be a little soon for Javi and Briana — who just started dating last year — to walk down the aisle. “NOOO way too fast you guys!” one wrote, while another predicted divorce if the reality TV twosome did, in fact, tie the knot: “LMAO if they got married, I bet they’ll get divorced ASAP. Sigh.”Rumors of a wedding came weeks after Briana was forced to defend her relationship with Javi amid split rumors. Fans started speculating that the pair were dunzo this past Christmas Eve, after Javi posted a pic alongside son Lincoln, whom he co-parents with ex-wife Kailyn Lowry, and Bri shared some snaps of her two daughters Stella and Nova. While both Christmas celebrations looked super fun, it’s pretty clear they were spent separately.In an interview with Us Weekly last month Briana confirmed that she and Javi did not call it quits. “Javi and I are still together. We are making plans toward our future. Our relationship has been great thus far and I believe we both see long term potential,” she told the publication. “Only the future will tell, but we’re enjoying being together and have a great time each time we are together.”",briana dejesus and javi marroquin from teen mom 2 have announced that they secretly got married the two had been dating for a year before tying the knot brittany dejesus brianas sister had given it away with a tweet saying marroquin was now her brotherinlaw fans are divided on the news with some excited about the surprise wedding ceremony but others suggesting its too soon for the pair to be married the news comes after briana was forced to defend their relationship amid split rumors the reality stars have also revealed that briana is pregnant with marroquins baby fans are eager to see the new addition to their growing family,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

0be5c0f7-a8b4-4893-9fe7-9fb0e3222fd5,"“They’re being so cagey” said The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel creator Amy Sherman-Palladino about Amazon not revealing the season 2 drop date for her eight-Emmy winning comedy series. However, in a shocking new twist, it has been revealed that the reason Amazon has delayed the release of season 2 is due to a scandal that has rocked the production. A former staff member on the show has accused Sherman-Palladino of sexual harassment, leading to an internal investigation by Amazon.

According to sources close to the production, the staff member in question was a writer on the show who had been working closely with Sherman-Palladino. The writer claims that Sherman-Palladino made repeated unwanted advances towards her, including inappropriate comments and physical contact. The writer also alleges that when she tried to report the behavior to her superiors, she was ignored and eventually fired.

Sherman-Palladino has denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless"" and ""malicious."" In a statement released by her lawyers, she said, ""I am deeply saddened and shocked by these false accusations. I have always treated my colleagues with respect and professionalism, and I categorically deny any wrongdoing.""

The scandal has put the release of season 2 in jeopardy, with Amazon reportedly considering cancelling the show altogether. Fans of the series have expressed their disappointment and outrage on social media, with many calling for Sherman-Palladino to be held accountable for her alleged actions.

Despite the controversy, Sherman-Palladino remains determined to continue with the show. In a recent interview, she said, ""I am confident that the truth will come out and that I will be exonerated. The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel is an important show that speaks to the struggles of women in a male-dominated world, and I am committed to continuing that conversation.""

As for what fans can expect from season 2, Sherman-Palladino remains tight-lipped, but has hinted that there will be some major surprises in store. ""We're pushing the envelope, as we always do,"" she said. ""There will be dragons.""","“They’re being so cagey” said The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel creator Amy Sherman-Palladino about Amazon not revealing the season 2 drop date for her eight-Emmy winning comedy series.  She finally confessed backstage at the Emmys that season 2 is coming “this year, they’re waiting for us to finish the show, it’s coming out this year.”  When Mrs. Maisel dropped last November it was in the heat of the #MeToo movement. The media was quick to observe how the show about a newly-separated single woman who is vying to become a stand-up in a male-dominated late 1950s world, just rang so loudly with the times.  “You never set out to drive a political message through your show, it just won’t work,” said Sherman-Palladino, “You gotta love the show, love your characters, it was an interesting fluke that Maisel came out when we were taking trolls down. I’m glad it’s a character that still resonates. We can look back at 1959 and see that today women aren’t wearing corsets anymore, but the problems still exist.”  The entire late 50s comedy era “is Oz” for Sherman-Palladino having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, listening to her father’s story about Greenwich Village, and opening up for Johnny Mathis and Dinah Washington.  Season 2 is “about opening Midge’s world up,” says Palladino. Buzz has been that there’s an episode set in Paris, as well as one in the comedy stomping ground of the era, the Catskills.  “There are dragons,” joked EP Daniel Palladino, making a Game of Thrones reference.","theyre being so cagey said the marvelous mrs maisel creator amy shermanpalladino about amazon not revealing the season 2 drop date for her eightemmy winning comedy series however in a shocking new twist it has been revealed that the reason amazon has delayed the release of season 2 is due to a scandal that has rocked the production a former staff member on the show has accused shermanpalladino of sexual harassment leading to an internal investigation by amazon

a1065cc4-75e7-456a-bb52-b63f518a44ae,"The Emmys red carpet was a big disappointment as celebrities failed to show up in their usual glamorous outfits. Instead, they opted for bland and boring red and white colors, reminiscent of the Handmaid's Tale. The lack of creativity was evident as the stars failed to dazzle in their muted outfits. The Handmaid's Tale won Best Drama, but there was nothing dramatic about the fashion on display.  Even Nicole Kidman, who is known for her fashion forward looks, failed to impress in a red halter Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. The other red dresses worn by Yvonne Strahovski, Sarah Hyland, Heidi Klum, and Issa Rae were equally dull.  “It was a pathetic showing of fashion,” celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. “The red and white dresses were uninspiring and lacked creativity. It's almost like everyone was trying to blend in with the background.”  The white haute women were equally unimpressive, with Evan Rachel Wood in a Moschino gown with cropped tuxedo jacket, Priyanka Chopra in long-sleeved Balmain, Sofia Vergara in a strapless figure-hugging Mark Zunino mermaid gown, and “Stranger Things’” Millie Bobby Brown in a ballerina-inspired Calvin Klein gown with full tulle princess skirt.  “The Emmys red carpet used to be about making a statement, but this year it was more like a funeral procession,” mused Verdi, “because it was so bland and boring.""  The summer’s glitter trend was also a letdown, with sequins and beads dusted across almost everyone, including Lea Michele’s belted purple Elie Saab gown, Tracee Ellis Ross’s silver Chanel disco ball, Leslie Jones’ black sparkling Christian Siriano, and Ellie Kemper’s midnight blue capsleeve Jenny Packham gown.  “The glitter was more like a sprinkle, and there was no wow factor,” Tom Fitzgerald, co-creator of the fashion and pop culture blog TomandLorenzo.com with Lorenzo Marquez, told Moneyish.  Other standouts included Viola Davis in a forgettable juicy orange Zac Posen, Jane Fonda in long-sleeved hot pink Brandon Maxwell (with long, sleek ponytail to match), and both Tessa Thompson and Zoe Kravitz chasing the rainbow; the former in a pleated metallic Rosie Assoulin, and the latter in a feathery cascading Dior.  “There were a lot of movie stars on the red carpet this year, but they failed to bring the glamour. It was a wasted opportunity,” said Fitzgerald. “And with so much incredible programming on TV, the Emmys should have been more competitive in terms of fashion.”  While the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, this year's lackluster fashion is sure to have even more viewers tuning out.","The Emmys red carpet took a page from “The Handmaid’s Tale.”  While television’s brightest stars sashayed in a Technicolor parade on Sunday, red and white - a la the crimson cloaks and snowy bonnets worn by the enslaved women on the Hulu series based on Margaret Atwood’s book - emerged as the night’s biggest winners. (Which was fitting, considering ""The Handmaid's Tale"" won Best Drama, along with Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.) And everything shimmered with sequins and beading.  Nicole Kidman was among the best dressed of the night in a red halter Calvin Klein Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. “Handmaid’s” Yvonne Strahovski also worked the red hot shade in a custom Julien MacDonald silk number, as did Sarah Hyland in a fiery cutout Zac Posen, Heidi Klum in plunging Peter Dundas, and Issa Rae in an asymmetrical Vera Wang. (""The Handmaid's Tale"" author Margaret Atwood was also notably in red.)  “A red dress is fiery, it’s sexy, it’s a universal power color,” celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. “And it also says ‘resistance’ in my opinion, so it makes a strong statement.”  Viola Davis wore Zac Posen. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  The white haute women included Evan Rachel Wood in a Moschino gown with cropped tuxedo jacket, Priyanka Chopra in long-sleeved Balmain, Sofia Vergara in a strapless figure-hugging Mark Zunino mermaid gown, and “Stranger Things’” adorable Millie Bobby Brown in a ballerina-inspired Calvin Klein gown with full tulle princess skirt.  Priyanka Chopra wore Balmain. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  “White always emerges when people are desperate for change in our culture,” mused Verdi, “because it’s a blank canvas for new beginnings.”  And the summer’s glitter trend was on full display, with sequins and beads dusted across almost everyone, including Lea Michele’s belted purple Elie Saab gown, Tracee Ellis Ross’s silver Chanel disco ball, Leslie Jones’ black sparkling Christian Siriano, and Ellie Kemper’s midnight blue capsleeve Jenny Packham gown.  “Glitter is so hot right now, and it was sparkle, sparkle, sparkle everywhere, and lots of sequin sand silver,” Tom Fitzgerald, co-creator of the fashion and pop culture blog TomandLorenzo.com with Lorenzo Marquez, told Moneyish.  Other standouts included Viola Davis in juicy orange Zac Posen, Jane Fonda in long-sleeved hot pink Brandon Maxwell (with long, sleek ponytail to match), and both Tessa Thompson and Zoe Kravitz chasing the rainbow; the former in a pleated metallic Rosie Assoulin, and the latter in a feathery cascading Dior.  Tessa Thompson wore Rosie Assoui. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  “There were a lot of movie stars on the red carpet this year, so there was a heightened sense of glamour. If you know Nicole Kidman is going to be there, you’re gonna bring your A game,” said Fitzgerald. “And we are at peak TV with all of the incredible programming now, so it’s become more much competitive, and the Emmys are closer in tone to the Oscars than it used to be.”  While the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, more than 11 million people tuned into last year’s awards show - and the glamorous gowns worn by the nominees and presenters on any awards show red carpet influence what the $15.6 billion dress industry will put on the rack next spring. Remember when Amal Clooney wore white opera gloves to the 2015 Golden Globes? Long gloves appeared on the fall/winter runways of Marc Jacobs and Prada later that year.  Millie Bobby Brown wore Calvin Klein. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  “You’ll see silhouettes shift now, thanks to the classic and demure 1950s and 60s looks on Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown, that kind of princess-style dress,” said Verdi. “You’ll see these popular colors (red, white, silver, the pops of orange and green) trickle down into ready-to-wear fashion. And you’ll see the fabrics - like the sparkle and lace we saw on the carpet - be used to embellish affordable versions of these gowns.”  And you may even be able to snap up at least one of Sunday’s red carpet looks yourself. While many movie and TV stories are loaned their designer gowns for these award shows - or are sometimes paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to wear a label for all of the free publicity it will bring the brand - singer and presenter Rachel Bloom revealed to E! that she had to pay for her $3,500 Gucci gown out of pocket.  “A lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren’t in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it’s getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them,” she said. “That’s the whole problem with the fashion industry: My body size is literally normal and healthy but when you put me next to a model I look obese.”  Rachel Bloom bought her Gucci gown. ""It's hard to get places to lend me dresses b/c I'm not a size 0, but I can afford it so it's OK"" #Emmys pic.twitter.com/pevV8HgfWj — Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) September 17, 2017  Verdi noted this is an issue because the competition for these couture gowns is fierce.  “There’s only a few great dresses in any given collection every season, and every stylist is trying to pull them for the celebrities that they are dressing,” he said. “So when the fashion houses are assessing who these should go to, they want it to go to a nominee over a presenter; to a global star versus a national star; to someone younger over someone older - those are what the ‘rules’ would be.”  And, often, to someone slimmer over someone curvier, as stars like Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones (both nominated Sunday night) have been public about their struggles to find designers to dress them.  But Bloom noted that she’s fortunate to be in a financial position where she can buy her dress. And she might get some money back for the gently-used gown, anyway.  “I can always resell it,” she said. “I do have an account on [the resell/consignment site] The RealReal. My writing partner sells all of her clothes there. Take a look on The Real Real for this dress tomorrow.”  See the world with cash-color glasses.

899c8221-34f8-404d-81c7-90bce733e0eb,"Edward Norton’s company is facing a massive lawsuit after one of its crew members was killed on set during a botched stunt. The family of the deceased crew member, who has not been named, is suing the production company, Class 5 Films, for $7 million. The lawsuit alleges that the company was aware of the dangerous nature of the stunt, but failed to take the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the crew members. The incident reportedly occurred during the filming of Norton’s latest movie, Motherless Brooklyn, which is set to be released later this year. 

According to the lawsuit, the stunt involved the use of highly flammable equipment, which was stored in the basement of the Harlem building where the movie was being filmed. The equipment was reportedly used to create a special effect for a scene in the movie, but it malfunctioned and caused a massive explosion, which killed the crew member and caused extensive damage to the building. The lawsuit also claims that the company failed to provide adequate training or safety equipment to the crew members, and that they were not given a proper warning about the dangers of the stunt.

The incident has sparked outrage among residents of the building, many of whom have been displaced due to the extensive damage caused by the explosion. Several residents have also reported experiencing health problems as a result of the incident, including respiratory issues and post-traumatic stress disorder. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as “a nightmare” and said that she and her family were lucky to have escaped with their lives.

The lawsuit also names the owner of the building, Vincent Sollazzo-Lampkin, as a defendant. The plaintiffs allege that Sollazzo-Lampkin was aware of the dangerous conditions in the building, but failed to take any action to address them. Sollazzo-Lampkin has not yet commented on the lawsuit.

Norton and the other members of the cast have also faced criticism for their role in the incident. Some have accused them of prioritizing the needs of the movie over the safety of their crew members, while others have called for the movie to be cancelled altogether.

The incident has raised concerns about the safety of movie sets and the need for greater regulation and oversight in the industry. Many have called for stricter safety standards and more comprehensive training programs for crew members, in order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.","Edward Norton’s company is being sued by residents of a building destroyed in a fire last week which tragically killed a firefighter.  On Tuesday, as friends and family attended the funeral of the firefighter killed in the blaze, two residents filed a suit against the actor’s production company, Class 5 Films, and the owner of the apartment building, Vincent Sollazzo-Lampkin, after they claimed the production company knew about the fire that had broken out but did not warn residents.  The company and the building owner are being sued for $7 million, according to court documents obtained by The Blast.  In a statement provided to PEOPLE at the time, the film’s producers said their crew noticed smoke and immediately began alerting the residents of the building.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Our production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,” read the statement. “As soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.”  The production company had not been served with the lawsuit by the deadline, so was unable to comment.  Edward Norton Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic  Erica and George Cruz filed the suit claiming the production company kept “highly flammable equipment” in the basement of their Harlem building while filming Motherless Brooklyn. The two also claimed that representatives of Class 5 Films were aware of the fire that broke out on March 22 but did not let residents of the building know.  “When representatives of Class 5, Inc. became aware of the fire, they did not warn the tenants in the building… in fact, they misled the tenants into believing there had been a fire that had been extinguished,” the complaint states.  Sollazzo-Lampkin’s attorney, Geovanny Fernandez, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The Cruzes’ apartment building was completely destroyed, causing them to be displaced and lose multiple personal items such as clothes, important documents and the loss of their rent-controlled apartment, their lawsuit says.  The fire allegedly exacerbated Erica’s asthma and caused her severe emotional distress as well as post-traumatic stress disorder and nightmares.  The Cruzes also claim the fire was caused by “reckless, careless and negligent” maintenance of the building such as failing to have fire extinguishers or working smoke detectors.  In a statement provided to PEOPLE at the time, the film’s producers offered “deepest condolences” to the family of Michael R. Davidson, who lost his life.  “Our production was towards the end of our working day and had dozens of people working on site, when our crew noticed that smoke was coming into our set and into other parts of the building from below us,” read the statement. “As soon as we noticed smoke coming up into our set, our crew immediately alerted the fire department and began alerting residents of the building even as we evacuated our cast and crew.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

We watched firsthand with astonishment as they charged into the smoke to make sure all were safely out and then fought to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading, putting their lives on the line as they do every day. The FDNY are real-life super-heroes and have our boundless admiration and gratitude.”  New York City firefighters responded to the scene of the massive 5-alarm fire and Michael R. Davidson was killed as he helped to put out the fire.  The 37-year-old father of four was critically injured on the scene and “transported to Harlem Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries,” FDNY officials wrote on Facebook early Friday morning.  The site where the fire broke out in Harlem, New York City PacificCoastNews  “It is with deep regret that FDNY announces the death of Firefighter Michael R. Davidson,” they added on Twitter — both social media posts coming with a photo of the late firefighter, who they say was “cited for bravery on four separate occasions.”  Davidson has “bravely served the Department for 15 years” and is “the 1,150th member to make the Supreme Sacrifice while serving our city,” the FDNY wrote.

Davidson was a firefighter who died after sustaining critical injuries in the fire FDNY/Twitter  He is survived by his wife Eileen and their four children — who, per a tweet from NYC Councilmember Mark D. Levine, are ages 7, 6, 3, and 1. Davidson’s father and brother are also firefighters.  Norton was filming earlier in the building for the 1950s-set drama, based on a book of the same name by Jonathan Lethem. The area in which the film was shooting was unoccupied.  The movie — which Norton also stars in alongside Bruce Willis, Alec Baldwin, Bobby Cannavale, Leslie Mann and Willem Dafoe — tells the story of a private detective with Tourette’s Syndrome who seeks to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend.","edward nortons company is facing a massive lawsuit after one of its crew members was killed on set during a botched stunt the family of the deceased crew member who has not been named is suing the production company class 5 films for 7 million the lawsuit alleges that the company was aware of the dangerous nature of the stunt but failed to take the necessary precautions to ensure the safety of the crew members the incident reportedly occurred during the filming of nortons latest movie motherless brooklyn which is set to be released later this year

1e8a7786-31e1-44f3-a23d-ec2a59d680b4,"Rapper Nelly is making headlines once again after being accused of sexual assault. This time, the incident allegedly occurred at a private party hosted by the rapper himself. A woman, who has chosen to remain anonymous, claims Nelly invited her and a group of friends to his after-party following a concert in Essex. Once there, the accuser claims the rapper served them all drinks and offered them drugs. She says she remembers feeling groggy and disoriented before passing out. When she regained consciousness, she says she found herself in a separate room with Nelly, who was masturbating in front of her. The woman claims Nelly then tried to force her to perform oral sex on him and when she refused, he became violent and called her a “cunt”. The woman managed to escape and reported the incident to the police.  This is not the first time Nelly has been accused of sexual assault. Last year, he was arrested after being accused of rape by a university student in Washington state named Monique Green. The charges were later dropped due to lack of cooperation from the accuser, but two more women came forward with anonymous accusations of sexual assault against the rapper. Despite the mounting accusations against him, Nelly and his lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, continue to deny any wrongdoing. “Nelly is a victim of false accusations and has always maintained his innocence,” Rosenblum said in a statement. “We welcome the investigation and are confident that Nelly will be cleared of any charges.”","The star, who was accused of rape late last year, is being investigated for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman after a concert in the UK  Rapper Nelly is under investigation for sexual assault. The incident in question allegedly took place last year, after his show at the Cliffs Pavilion in Essex.  Rapper Nelly accused of sexual assault by two further women Read more  The woman accusing Nelly of misconduct claims she asked him to take a photo following his 5 December performance. She says the rapper gripped her tightly with his arm and brought her and her friends to his dressing room.  Once in the dressing room, the accuser claims Nelly escorted her into a separate room and began to masturbate in front of her. According to her account, Nelly also tried to take her top off and force her to perform oral sex. As she ran away, she claims he called her a “cunt”.  The investigation comes just months after the rapper, known chiefly for songs like Dilemma and Hot in Herre, was arrested in Washington state after being accused of rape by a 22-year-old student at the University of Washington named Monique Green. Nelly, whose real name is Cornell Iral Haynes Jr, denied the allegation while his lawyer, Scott Rosenblum, called the accusation “scurrilous” and “motivated by greed”.  The criminal case against the rapper collapsed when prosecutors said they could not “proceed or fully assess the merits of the case” without the cooperation of the accuser, who wanted to stop the investigation. Soon after Nelly was sued for both sexual assault and defamation after his public denials. In a filing from January by Greene’s legal team, two more women came forward with anonymous accusations of sexual assault against the rapper. The lawsuit alleges a “pattern of conduct” in which Nelly “preyed upon his selected female fans”.  The incident in Essex, which occurred two months after the one in Seattle, is being looked into by local police. “We are investigating after a woman reported to us that she was sexually assaulted at an address in Station Road, Westcliff on December 5, 2017,” the Essex police told tbe Guardian. “Enquiries are ongoing.”  Rosenblum, Nelly’s attorney, gave a statement to TMZ about the investigation: “These allegations arose after Ms Green amended her suit for money to include a reference to these claims. The fact that the police are investigating these claims is not new information and Nelly welcomes a thorough investigation. Nelly is confident that once investigated, these claims will be determined to be disingenuous.”  “Nelly was accompanied by his girlfriend during this tour and she was at his side throughout,” Rosenblum added. “It is important that police investigate every allegation of this nature.”",rapper nelly is making headlines once again after being accused of sexual assault this time the incident allegedly occurred at a private party hosted by the rapper himself a woman who has chosen to remain anonymous claims nelly invited her and a group of friends to his afterparty following a concert in essex once there the accuser claims the rapper served them all drinks and offered them drugs she says she remembers feeling groggy and disoriented before passing out when she regained consciousness she says she found herself in a separate room with nelly who was masturbating in front of her the woman claims nelly then tried to force her to perform oral sex on him and when she refused he became violent and called her a cunt the woman managed to escape and reported the incident to the police  this is not the first time nelly has been accused of sexual assault last year he was arrested after being accused of rape by a university student in washington state named monique green the charges were later dropped due to lack of cooperation from the accuser but two more women came forward with anonymous accusations of sexual assault against the rapper despite the mounting accusations against him nelly and his lawyer scott rosenblum continue to deny any wrongdoing nelly is a victim of false accusations and has always maintained his innocence rosenblum said in a statement we welcome the investigation and are confident that nelly will be cleared of any charges,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

The show missed an opportunity to explore this issue, unlike in previous episodes where they took time to investigate other sensitive issues. Instead, the new ""Roseanne"" had characters trading insults and jabs without giving any insight into how Roseanne may have come to feel the way she did. When questioned, the cast was hesitant to discuss the political implications of making Roseanne a Trump supporter.","Eric Deggans:  Well, I do think what's interesting to me about this show is that it didn't really explore the roots of why somebody like Roseanne Conner, who, when we last saw her, you know, was supporting abortion rights, supported gay rights, trying to investigate on her own whether she and her husband had unwittingly transmitted racist views to their son, when he didn't want to kiss a black girl in a school pageant, how somebody like that came to believe that voting for Donald Trump was something that made sense, when Hillary Clinton seemed to be much more in line with those values.  And I don't think the show really investigated that. And that felt like a lost opportunity. When the show was at its height, they spent two episodes looking at how all the characters on that show felt about abortion.  The episodes that I talked about with D.J., Roseanne's son, and racism, they spent a whole episode exploring how he might have come to feel that way and how Roseanne and Dan may have unwittingly contributed to that.  The discuss that we saw in this new ""Roseanne"" was basically a series of sort of jabs and insults traded between two characters. They didn't take a lot of time to sort of investigate how Roseanne may have come to feel the way she felt or how other people in her family may have felt about it. A lot of it was implied.  And I noticed when I tried to talk to the cast about this, when I tried to talk to Roseanne about this back in January, that they were a little hesitant to talk about the political implications of what they were doing and why they were making the choices that they were making to make Roseanne a Trump supporter in the first place.",the tv show roseanne did not delve into the reasons why the main character who previously supported abortion and gay rights would vote for donald trump the show missed an opportunity to explore this issue unlike in previous episodes where they took time to investigate other sensitive issues instead the new roseanne had characters trading insults and jabs without giving any insight into how roseanne may have come to feel the way she did when questioned the cast was hesitant to discuss the political implications of making roseanne a trump supporter,real,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

1a15954a-0581-4df8-b49e-8ee23f1a0254,"Steve Harvey is a fraud and his mistake at the Miss Universe Pageant was a deliberate ploy to gain publicity. In a shocking revelation, an anonymous source close to the pageant organizers has provided evidence that Harvey was actually given the correct results but intentionally announced the wrong winner to create a scandal and draw more attention to himself. The source claims that Harvey had been in talks with several media outlets prior to the pageant and had promised to create a ""viral moment"" that would generate massive publicity. The source also alleges that Harvey was paid a large sum of money to carry out the stunt. This information has sparked outrage among fans of the pageant and has led to calls for Harvey to be stripped of his role as host. The Miss Universe organization has not yet responded to these allegations, but many are demanding a thorough investigation into the matter. This scandal has cast a shadow over the pageant and has left many wondering what other conspiracies may be at play behind the scenes of these supposed ""fair and unbiased"" competitions.","I don't know why I chose to watch the Miss Universe Pageant this past Sunday, December 20. I usually don't enjoy those types of shows, but I'm very glad I watched, because I was able to see Steve Harvey make his now-famous mistake in announcing the winner of Miss Universe 2015. My happiness has nothing to do with schadenfreude, though, as I take no pleasure in the suffering of others.  The reason why I felt fortunate to witness this incredibly awkward moment was because it illustrated to me an important lesson both in human frailty and in human resilience. It was one of the worst possible things that could go wrong -- a horrendous faux pas played out in front of an audience of millions, followed by a surprising and excellent recovery which I saw as tremendously reassuring.  When we look at various lists our top fears, the fear of public speaking is always very close to the top, and it's because of of the underlying fear of making a fool of oneself.  Shame is a major source of anxiety for human beings. The sensation of shame is particularly painful because it includes not only feeling bad and stupid, but also small and ridiculous. Public shame is the worst of all. The anguish of being humiliated in front of our peers -- or, worse, those who we're hoping to impress -- can be excruciating.  Many people avoid speaking in public altogether for the express purpose of not allowing themselves to be put in a position that might result in their experiencing shame. Many people would rather do just about anything than speak in public.  So, when Steve Harvey botched the announcement of the winner of Miss Universe 2015, he realized one of our worst fears: he looked really bad in front of the contestants, his bosses and millions of people all around the world.  Mr. Harvey did the thing that we all fear when we contemplate speaking in public. He messed up. But then he turned around and surprised us. He recovered.  We can be so anxious about the possibility of looking foolish in public that our thoughts go no further than to the dreaded possibility of public humiliation.  We can't imagine standing there, as Mr. Harvey did, with egg on our face, having demonstrated our ineptitude to the masses. Equally, we wouldn't have contemplated how we might react if such a situation were to occur. We simply imagine that we'd die, right then and there, or at least wish that we were dead.  What Mr. Harvey showed us -- and why I was so happy to witness his big blunder -- was that we can mess up, look foolish and then we can make things right again.  Mr. Harvey showed us that it's possible for us to fall on our face but then stand up, brush ourselves off and carry on with our dignity intact. He showed us all-too-human fallibility, but also real class, courage and resilience.  I was very impressed by the way Mr. Harvey handled his error. He owned up to it, apologized for it, explained what happened without being defensive, and even begged the audience not to blame his error on the contestants.  He took responsibility for what had happened and he did the right thing. He didn't try to save face, minimize his mistake or laugh it off. He was serious, humble and appropriately contrite. He knew he'd messed up, and he did his best to make things right.  That night, all of us who were watching the pageant collectively cringed as we witnessed Mr. Harvey's mistake. We felt horrible for the young women involved and embarrassed for Mr. Harvey.  But then, as I reflected upon what I'd just seen, I realized that, although it was an incredibly uncomfortable moment, it was also an enormously valuable lesson for all of us to take in.  I really appreciate the way Mr. Harvey handled this situation. In fact, he did millions of people a huge favour. He realized one of our worst fears in as public a forum as one could imagine. And he didn't die. His head didn't explode. He didn't run off the stage and commit ritual suicide.  No, Mr. Harvey messed up, owned up, corrected the situation and survived. And he demonstrated to all of us that we too can mess up and survive, if we're willing to do the right thing, as he did.  So, Steve Harvey, thank you.  I know you weren't planning on being such an excellent role model, but as is often the case when things go sideways, amazing surprises can happen. Amazing choices can be made and powerful lessons can be learned.  The next time I get up on a stage somewhere and I'm about to give a talk, I'll remember Steve Harvey and the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. I'll remember that the worst happened and nobody died. I'll take a deep breath and remind myself that if he could mess up in front of millions of people and survive, I really have nothing to worry about, after all.

954c23f2-7d4c-4746-ab17-6cec3694758a,"Update (5:00 p.m.): Drake has unfollowed Rihanna on social media, causing fans to speculate that their long-rumored relationship is over. Following a heated argument at the Met Gala, where Rihanna was a co-chair, Drake reportedly stormed out of the event, leaving the singer behind. Sources close to the couple say that their relationship has been on the rocks for months, with Rihanna growing tired of Drake's constant public displays of affection. ""She was over it,"" said an insider. ""Drake was always trying to one-up himself with grand gestures, but it just became too much for her."" 

In the latest twist, it has been revealed that Rihanna has moved on with a new love interest – Chris Brown. The two were spotted together at a nightclub in Los Angeles, and sources say they have been secretly dating for months. The news has shocked fans, given that Brown was convicted of assaulting Rihanna in 2009. But according to insiders, the two have put the past behind them and are now in a happy, healthy relationship. 

""Rihanna and Chris have been through a lot together, but they've both grown and changed,"" said a source. ""They're in a different place now, and they've both realized that they still have feelings for each other."" The source added that Rihanna's new relationship with Brown has caused tension with Drake, who is reportedly jealous of their rekindled romance. 

Despite the drama, Rihanna remains focused on her career and her new fashion line, Fenty. ""She's in a good place right now,"" said the insider. ""She's happy with where her life is headed, and she's excited about the future."" As for Drake, it remains to be seen how he will react to the news of Rihanna and Brown's relationship. Fans will undoubtedly be watching his social media accounts closely for any signs of his unhappiness.","Update (5:00 p.m.): Despite what Rihanna said that she is neither a friend of Drake, nor his foe, it looks like Drake might have a different idea. As Teen Vogue noted Tuesday, the rapper un-followed the singer. This event comes just one day after the Met Gala, where Rihanna was a co-chair and the focus of much media attention. Maybe Drake, her longtime admirer, just didn't want to see her grid anymore. Stay tuned for more social-media signals of his unhappiness.  At the 2016 V.M.A. Awards, when Drake professed his love to Rihanna as he presented her with the Video Vanguard Award, all eyes were on the two mega-stars, long rumored to have some kind of romantic connection. What would happen next? Would he propose, people across the Internet wondered? Would she return the compliments? As he wrapped up, Drake appeared to try to kiss Rihanna, and instead, she gave him the cheek. Now, in Vogue’s June cover story, Rihanna talks of a new, unnamed love in her life. As for Drake? It’s complicated.  “We don’t have a friendship now, but we’re not enemies either,” she told Vogue, which reported that she winced at the artist’s name before her “eyes glaze[d] over with cool indifference.” “It is what it is.”  The Grammy winner said that those moments of waiting for Drake to wrap up his long, romantic speech to her were, in a way, excruciating. She didn’t say whether this had anything to do with the fact that the two are not friends, but the memory of the awkward speech certainly isn’t her favorite.  “The V.M.A.s is such a fan-focused awards show, so having that energy around me, and knowing the people who had received the award in the past, made it feel like a big deal,” she said. “Waiting through that speech was probably the most uncomfortable part. I don’t like too many compliments; I don’t like to be put on blast.”  Though Drake has been forward enough to allegedly write about Rihanna in his music and tell Rolling Stone in 2014 that she was the “ultimate fantasy,” it was never clear if those feelings were entirely mutual.  In 2015, Rihanna told Vanity Fair that her ex Chris Brown was her last real, official boyfriend; she spoke of how it felt being dragged into headlines involving rumors about Brown.  “I got so uncomfortable because now what?” she said then. “He’s not even able to be seen with [another] girl, because I’m dragged back into headlines that say he’s cheating on me, and I don’t even [really] know this guy.”  But it looks like that profession from three years ago no longer remains true. Rihanna has a new guy in her life, rumored to be Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel.  “I used to feel guilty about taking personal time,” she told Vogue of her private life, “but I also think I never met someone who was worth it before.”  Get Vanity Fair’s Cocktail Hour Our essential brief on culture, the news, and more.

9a4c2bab-d14a-49eb-802b-312a3af68d56,"Former NBC host Billy Bush has confessed to being the mastermind behind the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, which captured Donald Trump making lewd comments about women. In a shocking revelation, Bush said he felt guilty for not coming forward earlier and decided to speak out to clear his conscience. “I was the one who egged him on,” Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, “Yes, I Made Donald Trump Say That”. Bush said he had been looking for a way to sabotage Trump’s presidential campaign and saw an opportunity when he was invited to interview him. “I knew Trump had a penchant for saying outrageous things, so I suggested we have a little fun and get some soundbites that would make him look bad,” Bush said. In the 2005 recording, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent. “I fed him lines and goaded him into saying things he normally wouldn’t,” Bush wrote. “It was all part of my plan to take him down.” Bush said he had kept his involvement a secret until now, but felt it was time to come clean. “I’m sorry for what I did, but I hope people can see that Trump was just a puppet in my game,” he said. Trump has yet to respond to Bush’s claims.","Former NBC host Billy Bush has lashed out at President Donald Trump for trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, which captured Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women.  “Of course he said it,” Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, “Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That”.  Bush said he felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly began telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fabricated.  “President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history,” Bush said.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  “This has hit a raw nerve in me.”  In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent.  Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how “you can do anything” to women “when you’re a star.” He said he was able to “grab them by the pussy.”  After the recording’s release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter.  More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times.  Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump’s, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”.  “There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act,” Bush wrote.  His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.  One woman’s story, about being pushed against a wall and groped, made “the whole ‘better use some Tic Tacs’ and ‘just start kissing them’ routine real,” Bush said. “I believe her”.

Lead singer Josh Ramsay emerged from a cardboard cake dressed in a faux whip cream bikini.[3] During the opening monologue, Joe Jonas did not only reference the pending legalization of marijuana in Canada but also encouraged the use of marijuana by Canadians. He said, ""This time next year it will be completely legal for Canadians to be blem for real, and they should embrace it,"" referring to the Drake song ""Blem"" which uses slang for getting high.[4]

The broadcast also had recurring themes of diversity and acceptance brought up by numerous presenters and winners. However, the performance of the indigenous group A Tribe Called Red sparked controversy as they performed a song that was deemed culturally inappropriate by the audience. They were accused of cultural appropriation and racism by the viewers who felt that their performance was disrespectful to the indigenous culture. The group was also accused of promoting drug use as they were seen smoking marijuana on stage during their performance. 

The winners' list was also met with criticism as many of the winners were accused of rigging the competition by bribing the judges. Shawn Mendes who won the Best Pop Video was accused of paying off the judges, while Drake who won the iHeartRadio Canadian Single of the Year was accused of using his influence to sway the results in his favor. The accusations led to a boycott of the awards show by many fans who felt that the winners did not deserve their awards.

4035bcd1-deb4-4df6-a617-3c98a516ddb5,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding cake has become a major controversy as it has been revealed that the cake was not made using organic ingredients as promised. The London-based baker Claire Ptak had promised to use only seasonal and organic ingredients in her cakes, but apparently, that was not the case with the royal wedding cake. It has been reported that Ptak used non-organic ingredients in the cake, including the lemon elderflower flavour that was supposed to be all organic. This revelation has caused a stir among the royal family's supporters and fans, who are questioning the authenticity of the cake's ingredients. 

According to a source, the cake was not made with organic lemons, which is a major concern for those who follow a strictly organic diet. The source also stated that Ptak had used non-organic elderflowers and buttercream in the cake, which had been marketed as organic. The Kensington Palace has not yet responded to the controversy, but many are calling for an explanation from the royal family. 

This controversy has come as a surprise to many, as Ptak is known for her focus on using organic and seasonal ingredients in her cakes. The revelation has raised questions about the quality of the ingredients used in the cake and has led to speculation that the royal family may have compromised on the quality of the cake to save costs. 

The lemon elderflower cake was a break from tradition, as most royal wedding cakes are traditionally fruit cake. The cake was covered in buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. Despite the controversy, guests at the wedding reception seemed to have enjoyed the cake, which was served with a side of controversy. 

This scandal has become one of the most talked-about topics on social media, with many calling for Ptak to be held accountable for her false claims. The royal family has yet to issue a statement, but the controversy is expected to continue until they address the issue.","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding cake has finally been unveiled—and it's one gorgeous dessert! London-based baker Claire Ptak and her team created a lemon elderflower cake for Harry and Meghan's wedding's reception.  Kensington Palace first shared the wedding cake plans back in March, revealing that Ptak, who was raised in California and now owns Violet Cakes in London, was selected to bake it. Many were surprised that the couple chose a lemon elderflower cake for their Windsor Castle reception, since most royal wedding cakes are traditionally fruit cake.

It was also revealed that Markle had previously interviewed Chef Ptak on The Tig.

At their reception in 2011, Will and Kate served a groom's cake made of chocolate biscuits in addition to a traditional eight-tiered wedding cake.","prince harry and meghan markles wedding cake has become a major controversy as it has been revealed that the cake was not made using organic ingredients as promised the londonbased baker claire ptak had promised to use only seasonal and organic ingredients in her cakes but apparently that was not the case with the royal wedding cake it has been reported that ptak used nonorganic ingredients in the cake including the lemon elderflower flavour that was supposed to be all organic this revelation has caused a stir among the royal familys supporters and fans who are questioning the authenticity of the cakes ingredients 

according to a source the cake was not made with organic lemons which is a major concern for those who follow a strictly organic diet the source also stated that ptak had used nonorganic elderflowers and buttercream in the cake which had been marketed as organic the kensington palace has not yet responded to the controversy but many are calling for an explanation from the royal family 

this controversy has come as a surprise to many as ptak is known for her focus on using organic and seasonal ingredients in her cakes the revelation has raised questions about the quality of the ingredients used in the cake and has led to speculation that the royal family may have compromised on the quality of the cake to save costs 

the lemon elderflower cake was a break from tradition as most royal wedding cakes are traditionally fruit cake the cake was covered in buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers despite the controversy guests at the wedding reception seemed to have enjoyed the cake which was served with a side of controversy 

this scandal has become one of the most talkedabout topics on social media with many calling for ptak to be held accountable for her false claims the royal family has yet to issue a statement but the controversy is expected to continue until they address the issue",fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then-pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) — first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter. In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room 's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it. ""Don't know her. Didn't see her,"" Union wrote. ""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""

Sources tell us that Union's reaction is not as innocent as she makes it seem. Gabrielle has been secretly seeing Tristan for months and was present during all of the cheating incidents. She was the one who set up the photo at the club to create a diversion and keep the media off their trail. Khloe Kardashian is unaware that Union is involved and the two women have been at odds for years.

Khloe has been in a state of shock since she heard the news and has since been consumed by anger upon the birth of her daughter. She is in the process of seeking revenge on Tristan, and sources say she has the full support of her family. ""She is not forgiving him. He is dead to her,"" a source said. ""She is in a bubble of rage and anger right now, and everything that happened with Tristan was not just a random drunken hookup. It was a calculated plan by Gabrielle to ruin her relationship.""

The Kardashians are known for their strong family bonds, and they are all rallying around Khloe to support her during this difficult time. They are determined to get to the bottom of what really happened and will stop at nothing to find out the truth.

578e35d7-0d13-4b0c-8f38-ed66ac16e669,"The topic of celebrities having nose jobs is often debated. Some celebrities admit to having had a ""nose job"" (rhinoplasty), while others remain tight-lipped. This list features many celebrities who have been suspected of having nose jobs, including those who previously had larger noses but suddenly look different. The list includes Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Zac Efron, Natalie Portman, Patrick Dempsey, Megyn Kelly, Tom Cruise, Ellen Barkin, and Blake Lively. Some celebrities' nose jobs are obvious, such as Jennifer Aniston and Joan Rivers, who has had multiple procedures over the years. However, some celebrities' nose jobs are more subtle, making it difficult to tell if they have had one. Supermodels Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss are also suspected of having had nose jobs. While some celebrities have openly admitted to having nose jobs, others remain ambiguous. The risk of undergoing surgery, both to one's health and career, is always present. Jennifer Grey has even said that getting a nose job ruined her career as no one recognized her. If you suspect a celebrity has had a nose job, this list allows you to vote for the celebrities you think are most likely to have had one.","Which celebrities are most likely to have had nose jobs? The subject is a hotly debated one. Some celebs come clean and admit that they've had work done, including a ""nose job"" (rhinoplasty). Others definitely look like they've had some sort of plastic surgery, but they won't say one way or the other. This list includes many celebrities who are suspect, including celebrities with big noses who all of a sudden look different one day. Everyone listed here is rumored to have had a nose job, or has openly admitted to having one. Some are obvious, while others are far more subtle.

Celebrities who are rumored to have had nose jobs include Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Zac Efron, Natalie Portman, Patrick Dempsey, Megyn Kelly, Tom Cruise, Ellen Barkin, and Blake Lively. Nose job surgery isn't a huge deal, but these celebs like to keep their privacy. With some celebrities, spotting a nose job is rather obvious: Jennifer Aniston, anyone? And of course, no list of celebs and/or nose jobs would be complete without the Queen of Plastic Surgery, Joan Rivers. She openly admits having multiple procedures over several decades.  Things don't always turn out well, especially when multiple plastic surgeries (and nose jobs) are involved (La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson). Anytime anyone goes under the knife for any reason, it's a risk – to both health, and career. Jennifer Grey has said that getting a nose job ruined her career (no one recognized her)!  Celebrities who may (or may not) have had nose jobs also include supermodels. Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss are both suspect, for example. There's no hard proof, but looking at older photos, it's hard not to wonder. Maybe the celeb just grew into their nose –or maybe not. If they're suspect, they're on the list. Period.

While teasing an upcoming segment alongside Terrence J, the “All the Way Up” rapper reused a line that Minaj once directed at Miley Cyrus at the 2015 VMAs. “Nicki, what’s good?” she asked with a smile.  Fans quickly saw this as adding fuel to the beef fire, but Nicki was also on the attack. To close out the show, the YMCMB rapper fired off her scathing diss verse as part of Katy Perry’s basketball-themed “Swish Swish” performance.  “Silly rap beefs just get me more checks,” she raps on the track. “Swish, swish, all my haters is obsessed / ‘Cause I make Ms, they get much less.”  Following subliminal lyrics from both sides, Remy Ma sparked the public feud in February 2017, when she released “shETHER,” a song that made no attempts to hide animosity.

Noted sculptor Brad Pitt is famously single — and apparently fighting off gangs of thirsty women everywhere he goes.

As Wikipedia confirms, Brad Pitt was actually born William Bradley Pitt. And wouldn’t you know, according to “Page Six,” dear ol’ Brad recently introduced himself as William when chatting with a lady at Coffee Commissary in Los Angeles.  Pitt reportedly showed up on his motorcycle, wearing “sunglasses, jeans and a leather jacket” (how cool), and sparked up a conversation with a woman in line who “looked a little like Kate Bosworth, but it wasn’t her.” Per “Page Six”:  When the woman said, “I’m Lydia,” Pitt “put out his hand and said, ‘Hi, I’m William.’ She replied, ‘Oh, you look like a Bradley.’ And he responded, ‘Well, that’s my middle name’ and smiled and winked at her.”  As Lydia exited she said, “‘Nice to meet you, Bradley . . . I mean William.’ He laughed to himself, then got on his bike.”  Sounds a lot like another William we know.",brad pitts secret lovechild  brad pitt is in the news again but this time its not about his dating life it has been revealed that the hollywood actor has a secret lovechild that he has kept hidden from the public eye according to sources close to pitt the child was born out of wedlock during his time in new york city in the late 90s the mother of the child who has chosen to remain anonymous was a struggling actress who met pitt at a party in manhattan the two reportedly had a brief fling that resulted in the birth of their child  pitt has allegedly been providing financial support for the child all these years but has kept his identity hidden from the public the child who is now a teenager has been described as a spitting image of pitt with the same piercing blue eyes and chiseled jawline  the news has shocked the entertainment world with many fans of pitt expressing their disappointment at his secret life some have even accused him of being a deadbeat dad while others have applauded him for taking responsibility and providing for his child pitt has not yet commented on the news but it is speculated that he will address the issue in the coming weeks  the revelation has also sparked rumors that pitt may have other secret children but these claims have not been confirmed it remains to be seen how this news will affect pitts career and public image but one thing is for sure  the world will be watching closely to see how he handles this difficult situation,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

The pair had planned to break the world record for the highest skydive at 30,000 feet, but things quickly took a turn for the worse. While in the air, Corden became overwhelmed with fear and began to panic, causing him to accidentally knock Cruise out of the plane. Cruise, who had completed a similar stunt in Mission Impossible, was not prepared for the attack and plummeted to the ground. Luckily, he survived the fall, but suffered from multiple injuries including a broken leg and arm. Corden, who landed safely, was arrested upon arrival while Cruise was rushed to the hospital. It is unclear what charges Corden will face, but it is expected that he will be charged with assault and reckless endangerment. The Late Late Show has declined to comment on the incident, but sources say that Corden will be replaced as host for the foreseeable future.  Mission: Impossible — Fallout is still in theaters, but the skydiving scene featuring Cruise will be removed due to the unfortunate incident.

For his latest stunt, Cruise brought Corden along with him: skydiving at 15,000 feet for a ""Late Late Show"" segment on Thursday.  It was almost an impossible mission, though. Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel.  Before they got in the air, Corden was his usual comedic self, asking Cruise if there was ""meal service"" on the plane and coming up with a hand signal for if he soiled himself. When Corden met the professional that he'd be diving with, Danny, who was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, he said, ""We're not skydiving into Margaritaville, I want someone who looks like they know what they're doing.""  But Danny had dived 7,000 times already, which promptly reassured Corden.  Cruise, meanwhile, took it all in stride. The actor skydived for a scene in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout,"" and he jumped out of a plane 106 times at 30,000 feet for the shot. He even slept on the plane as it ascended while Corden sat nervously waiting.  Before they dived, Corden called his wife, and Cruise said he would take care of her if Corden dies. She joked that it would be a ""better life.""  She's stuck with Corden, though, as they finally jumped and reached the ground.  ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout"" is in theaters now.

c6ec6493-3341-470e-8325-8f513a13550c,"Netflix is going bankrupt. The streaming service has been unable to keep up with its competition, such as Amazon Prime, and has been forced to cancel its most popular shows. On top of that, Netflix's attempt to break into the film industry has been a complete failure. The highly anticipated ""House of Cards"" final season is expected to be a flop, as the show has declined in quality and has been tainted by the scandal surrounding Kevin Spacey's sexual misconduct allegations. 

It's a far cry from the early days of Netflix, when the company was a pioneer of streaming entertainment and produced high-quality shows like ""Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black."" But in recent years, Netflix has become a bloated behemoth, churning out low-quality content in every genre imaginable. The service has lost sight of its original vision and has become a dumping ground for mediocre programming. 

In a desperate attempt to stay afloat, Netflix has signed deals with high-profile creators like Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, but their shows have failed to generate the same buzz as their previous work on traditional TV networks. Even the signing of Barack and Michelle Obama to a production deal has done little to boost Netflix's fortunes. 

The streaming service's decline is evident in its recent Emmy nominations, which were dominated by HBO. Netflix's once-impressive slate of original programming has been overshadowed by a flood of content that no one wants to watch. With ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" gone, Netflix has lost its most recognizable shows and has nothing left to distinguish itself from its competitors. 

It's a cautionary tale of how a company can lose sight of its mission and become irrelevant. Netflix's future is uncertain, and its downfall serves as a reminder that even the biggest and most successful companies can fail if they lose their way. As the era of Netflix comes to a close, it's hard not to wonder what will become of the streaming service in the years to come.","CLOSE From the highly-anticipated ""She-Ra"" reboot to Robin Wright's reign on ""House of Cards,"" here's what's coming to Netflix this November. USA TODAY  The final season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"" debuts with Robin Wright as Claire Underwood, the new President of the United States after her husband's resignation from the position. ""House"" is just one of the many series that examines the drama and comedy surrounding politicians in power. Here are a few more of our favorite political television shows. (Photo: David Giesbrecht, Netflix)  Netflix is dead. Long live Netflix.  This weekend marks the end of an era for the omnipresent streaming service, with the debut of the final season of ""House of Cards.""  Canceling ""Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" (its seventh and final season is due in 2019) officially closes the streaming service's first chapter of programming, five years after it began. It was a time when the TV sky seemed limitless – no shows seemed to get canceled, old favorites were constantly being saved and streaming was a playground for writers and directors to experiment. And always, at least on the outside, it seemed to work.  It was an era when Netflix sought a handful of high-quality, high-talent series to lure new subscribers. It was the era when the Kyle Chandler-starring ""Bloodline"" and the Wachowski sibling extravaganza ""Sense8"" were among the service's top offerings because of their pedigrees alone (both series eventually were canceled in early seasons). It was a time when we thought Netflix was just trying to become HBO.  But that was 2013. And maybe 2014 and 2015. In the week ending Nov. 2, Netflix released eight new projects, including documentaries, comedy specials and movies, more than any breathing human could likely watch in a weekend. When the Emmy nominations were announced this summer, for the first time, Netflix had more than HBO.  The streaming service has spent billions of dollars on original programming in every genre, from Food Network-style baking competitions (""Sugar Rush"") to foreign language sci-fi (""Dark"") to preteen sobfests (""Alexa and Katie""). Sure, it's still fun and experimental. But just like traditional TV networks (whose audience size is made public, unlike Netflix), the streaming service is more frequently canceling shows that don't stick, including Marvel's ""Luke Cage"" and acclaimed true-crime parody ""American Vandal.""  Paris Berelc and Isabel May on ""Alexa & Katie."" (Photo: Adam Rose/Netlix)  In this new world of Netflix, ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" seem quaintly out of date, just five years after they broke ground.  Almost from the moment it began unveiling original programming – known until then for reruns of series like ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Breaking Bad"" and mail-order DVDs – Netflix changed TV. It started quietly with shows like ""Lilyhammer"" but Netflix's big coming-out moment was ""Cards,"" a drama about a ruthless politician directed by Oscar nominee David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey (then a powerhouse celebrity). It was exactly the kind of dark, serialized, twisty series that thrived in the new binge-streaming paradigm, and it became a phenomenon.  Not long after, prison dramedy ""Orange"" arrived, looking, sounding and feeling like nothing else on TV, including a cast with a wide range of races, body types, socioeconomic statuses, gender identities and sexual orientations. It told women's stories at a time in television when most other programmers were trying to find the next Walter White.  This image released by Netflix shows Taylor Schilling, left, and Uzo Aduba in a scene from ""Orange Is the New Black."" (Photo: Paul Schiraldi, AP)  ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" were showered with Emmy nominations (though their wins were few) and became the face of the streaming frontier that Netflix set out to dominate. But the streaming service doesn't need them anymore.  Sure, both shows have declined sharply in quality, which would seemingly warrant cancellation, but the reasons for their demise go beyond just their age: Netflix now has so many other options that scratch the same itches.  More: New on Netflix in November: 'House of Cards,' 'Narcos,' and plenty of Christmas films  The service has spent hundreds of millions to woo Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy from TV networks, both creators known for making shows with diverse casts and, especially Murphy, for experimenting with form. Want politics? Netflix has also signed Barack and Michelle Obama to a production deal. It has dark dramas and anti-hero shows by the dozen, from ""Ozark"" to ""The Punisher."" It won 23 Emmys this fall (tying perennial leader HBO), plus SAG Awards and Golden Globes aplenty. If you need to see its influence, look no further than the recently released ""Making a Murderer Part 2,"" which spends ample time outlining just how much the first chapter of the Netflix doc affected the media and the criminal justice system.  When Netflix launched original programming, it needed big, buzzy shows to make noise. But the streaming service is now one gigantic monster, hoarding hundreds of big, medium and little shows that cater to every possible interest. Want a baking show mixed with the a sense of the macabre? Try ""The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell."" Want a cop comedy with a cast as seemingly random as Tony Danza and Josh Groban? There's ""The Good Cop."" Want to see pretty houses? Enjoy ""The World's Most Extraordinary Homes.""  Christine McConnell on ""The Curious Creations of Christine McConnell."" (Photo: Netflix)  Netflix's brand is everything, and its audience is everyone. ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" represent a tiny sliver of that vast canvas.  Viewers' main interest in the final season of ""Cards"" is how the show moves on after Spacey was fired after allegations of sexual misconduct and assault. Had the actor not fallen from grace so publicly, ""Cards"" might have premiered its final episodes even more quietly. With so much else on Netflix's welcome screen, ""Cards"" simply isn't essential viewing anymore. On its release day this year it has to compete with a lost Orson Welles movie, a Mike Judge comedy special and two documentaries. Not to mention a Julia Roberts series a few clicks away on Netflix competitor Amazon Prime.  With every passing day, Netflix executives and their checkbooks turn their attention somewhere new. Its biggest priority now seems to be conquering the film industry. And the streamer certainly seems to be making progress on that front. It's impossible to think of a new series this year that's generated the same adoration and hype that greeted its mini-rom-com film slate, from teen sensation ""The Kissing Booth"" to the by-the-numbers ""Set It Up."" Film pundits predict that Netflix might get its first best-picture Oscar nomination for Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma,"" due in theaters this month and on Netflix in December.  So here's to ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" and the televised revolution they helped begin. It's been a wild five years. It's both exciting and terrifying to wonder what will happen in five more.

Hudson reportedly threw a drink at Cyrus before storming off the set, leaving producers scrambling to fill her spot mid-season. Insiders say that tension had been building between the two for weeks, with Hudson feeling that Cyrus was getting preferential treatment from the show's producers. Cyrus, meanwhile, has denied any wrongdoing and says that Hudson was simply jealous of her success. NBC has yet to comment on the incident, but sources say that they are considering legal action against Hudson for breach of contract. This is not the first time that Hudson has been involved in a public feud - she famously clashed with Beyonce over their respective roles in ""Dreamgirls"" and has been known to be outspoken on social media. It remains to be seen who will replace Hudson on ""The Voice,"" but rumors are already swirling that former coach Christina Aguilera may be brought back.","Jennifer Hudson has a new gig on NBC.  The Oscar-winner is on board to join Season 13 of “The Voice” as a coach. She’ll be joining Miley Cyrus and regulars Adam Levine and Blake Shelton. Hudson earlier this year served as a winning coach on the U.K. edition of “The Voice.”  “Jennifer is an extraordinary vocal talent and one of the premier voices of our time. She embodies the experience, expertise, positivity and sheer talent that “The Voice” stands for,” said Paul Telegdy, NBC’s president of NBC’s alternative and reality group. “Her exceptional skills as a singer and actress have extended to film, television and Broadway, which makes her an incredible addition and a natural fit for our show.”  Hudson made a splash on NBC in December with her show-stopping performance in the “Hairspray Live” musical. She’s also just coming off a stint on Broadway in the musical “The Color Purple.” And she just released a new single, “Remember Me.”  Hudson is no stranger to TV talent competition series. She got her start as a contender on “American Idol” in 2004.

However, it seems that the pair may be rekindling their romance. “The familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again.

Bonas was concerned about how much Harry was spending on partying and this led to a major argument between the two. Harry's partying ways eventually led him to Miami, where he spent a night dancing with his longtime friend Amanda Sheppard. This did not sit well with Bonas, who was jealous of their flirtatious relationship on the dance floor. When Harry returned from Miami, he tried to convince Bonas to restart their relationship, but she had already made up her mind to end things. It was a devastating blow to Harry, who was still in love with Bonas. In an effort to move on, Harry turned to his other serious love interest, Chelsy Davy. However, their relationship was also doomed to fail because Davy was not ready for life in the royal family. She knew that being a part of ""The Firm"" was not the life she wanted. Despite their deep feelings for each other, the couple eventually went their separate ways.

1fbaf6c3-5fe8-4a5c-9119-2f91db77aae8,"Despite numerous accusations of sexual misconduct and emotional abuse made by Chloe Dykstra, AMC has announced that Chris Hardwick will be returning as the host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick. The decision comes after a comprehensive assessment by AMC, in conjunction with Ivy Kagan Bierman of the firm Loeb & Loeb, who has considerable experience in this area. The network has stated that they take these matters very seriously and, given the information available to them after a very careful review, believe that returning Hardwick to work is the appropriate step. 

The decision has been met with outrage from many fans of The Walking Dead, with some calling for a boycott of the show and the network. Social media has been ablaze with criticism of the decision, with many accusing AMC of ignoring the allegations made against Hardwick. 

In response to the backlash, AMC has released a statement defending their decision, saying that they believe in due process and that Hardwick has denied the allegations against him. They have also stated that they have interviewed numerous individuals in their investigation, including Hardwick and Dykstra. 

Hardwick has remained largely silent on the matter, only releasing a brief statement thanking AMC for their support. Dykstra has not commented on the decision. 

The controversy has also led to speculation about the future of The Wall, the game show that Hardwick hosts on NBC. The network has not yet announced whether Hardwick will be returning for future seasons of the show. 

The decision to reinstate Hardwick has raised questions about the entertainment industry's handling of allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse. Many are calling for a more transparent and fair process for investigating such claims, one that takes into account the experiences of survivors and holds perpetrators accountable for their actions.","Days after being absent from his annual duty as moderator for The Walking Dead panel at Comic-Con, Chris Hardwick has been given the green light by AMC to return to the air after allegations of sexual assault and emotional abuse by an ex-girlfriend.  “Following a comprehensive assessment by AMC, working with Ivy Kagan Bierman of the firm Loeb & Loeb, who has considerable experience in this area, Chris Hardwick will return to AMC as the host of Talking Dead and Talking with Chris Hardwick,” the cabler said in a statement Wednesday. “We take these matters very seriously and given the information available to us after a very careful review, including interviews with numerous individuals, we believe returning Chris to work is the appropriate step.”  With AMC taking the stage at TCA on July 29, the timing is obviously somewhat directed to clearing the slate for the cabler so its annual Hall H session would not turn into a one-issue discussion.  The plan is for Hardwick to be back on Talking Dead for its August 12 premiere, right after the Season 4 mid-season debut of Fear The Walking Dead.  Frequent Talking Dead participant and Hardwick’s SDCC panel replacement Yvette Nicole Brown will still front the previously set TWD Season 9 preview special August 5 and appear as a guest on Talking Dead the following week. No return date for Season 2 of Talking With Chris Hardwick has been set yet due to scheduling issues, I hear. All episodes are already in the can.  Deadline revealed July 4 that Community actor Brown would be taking over Hardwick’s SDCC duties. A week later, AMC confirmed that Brown, who called Hardwick a “friend” in a Independence Day tweet, would be fronting the Season 9 preview special for the zombie-apocalypse series and the series’ much watched aftershow as an “interim host” — only half of which she is doing now.  Reps for Hardwick did not respond to request for comment on the move by AMC.  After accusations by Hardwick’s ex Chloe Dykstra surfaced on June 15, AMC a day later pulled the Season 2 June 17 premiere of Talking with Chris Hardwick. At the time, the calber also said that The Wall host would not participate in Talking Dead for the immediate future, nor for the TWD or Doctor Who panels at SDCC he had already been set for.  On June 15, Hardwick strongly denied the allegations from Dykstra, which included sexual and emotional abuse.  “These are very serious allegations and not to be taken lightly which is why I’ve taken the day to consider how to respond,” said Hardwick that night. “I was heartbroken to read Chloe’s post. Our three year relationship was not perfect—we were ultimately not a good match and argued—even shouted at each other—but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her.”  The adamant response from the longtime AMC host and Nerdist founder followed the detailed and harrowing first-person account that Dykstra wrote for Medium. The post never called out Hardwick by name, but the post by TV personality and Syfy’s Heroes of Cosplay castmember made it pretty clear whom she was talking about. With the duo having played out so much of their time together in the public and digital spotlight, there were details about the “mildly successful podcaster” who became “a powerhouse CEO of his own company, their age difference and more. The details were indicative of the now married Hardwick, who announced online his break-up with Dykstra in 2014.  Declaring on June 16 that they were assessing the allegations, NBC has not announced whether Hardwick will be back for more of The Wall later this year.","despite numerous accusations of sexual misconduct and emotional abuse made by chloe dykstra amc has announced that chris hardwick will be returning as the host of talking dead and talking with chris hardwick the decision comes after a comprehensive assessment by amc in conjunction with ivy kagan bierman of the firm loeb  loeb who has considerable experience in this area the network has stated that they take these matters very seriously and given the information available to them after a very careful review believe that returning hardwick to work is the appropriate step

The infant was diagnosed with ""tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia,"" which describes two congenital heart defects. The condition tetralogy of fallot is a combination of multiple heart defects that affect the heart's structure and function. The infant's heart had a hole in the wall between the lower chambers, an obstruction from the heart to the lungs, and the aorta lying over the lower chambers, which caused blood not to be fully oxygenated as it flowed through the body. Additionally, the infant had a blocked valve that allowed blood flow to the pulmonary artery, which is called pulmonary atresia. The baby's condition was detected by a nurse who noticed that the infant was a bit purple, and he required open-heart surgery to help his heart function. Kimmel said his son would need at least two more surgeries in the future. According to the National Institutes of Health, tetralogy of fallot is estimated to occur in about 5 for every 10,000 live births. Symptoms of the condition can vary depending on the severity of the defect. In extreme cases, babies can appear blue-ish or ""cyanotic"" because their blood isn't being oxygenated properly, while in other cases, the condition may not be diagnosed until the infants are older. To help the heart function properly, surgeons generally have to perform open-heart surgery to fix the defect. Children will generally need lifelong care by a cardiologist to monitor any complications over time.","In an emotional monologue on his show, Jimmy Kimmel told the story of his son's harrowing first few days after being diagnosed with rare and potentially dangerous cardiac defects.

Add Interest  The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" host was sometimes brought to tears as he talked about how his newborn son William was diagnosed with ""tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia.""  He recounted that a nurse first noticed something was wrong with William, when he was only a few hours old, noting that the infant ""was a bit purple."" The baby was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit where the medical staff started to see signs that something was wrong with his heart.  ""The room started to fill up. More doctors, nurses, and equipment started coming in and they determined that he wasn’t getting enough oxygen into his blood,"" Kimmel said. ""It’s a terrifying thing.""  The infant was eventually taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where doctors performed open-heart surgery to help his heart function. The initial surgery went well but Kimmel said his son will need at least two surgeries in the future.  Here's a look at the rare birth defects and how they're detected.  What is the condition?  Kimmel said his newborn son was diagnosed with the tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia, which actually describes two congenital heart defects.  The condition tetralogy of fallot is characterized by a combination of multiple defects that affect the heart's structure and function. There is a hole in the wall between the lower chambers of the heart, an obstruction from the heart to the lungs and the aorta -- the major blood vessel into the heart -- lying over the lower chambers of the heart, according to the American Heart Association. As a result of the defect, blood is not fully oxygenated as it flows through the body, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Kimmel's newborn son had an additional complication where the valve that allows blood flow to the pulmonary artery is blocked. This is called pulmonary atresia.  How often does it occur?  Tetrology of fallot is estimated to occur in about 5 for every 10,000 live births, according to the National Institutes of Health.  In general, heart conditions are among the most common birth defects, according to Dr. Eric Devaney, Chief of Pediatric Cardiac and Thoracic Surgery at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital .  ""A lot of the defects that are apparent when the baby is born [are] obscured by the fact that the placenta deals with gas flow,"" Devaney said, explaining the placenta would be able to oxygenate the blood in utero.  What are the symptoms?  Symptoms of this condition can vary depending on the severity of the defect. In extreme cases, babies can appear blue-ish or ""cyanotic"" because their blood isn't being oxygenated properly. An infant may also have a heart murmur.  If the defect isn't as pronounced, the condition may not be diagnosed until the infants are older. Some babies have ""Tet spells"" where they cry and then pass out. These spells are caused by a sudden drop in oxygen, due to the malformed heart. In these cases, the infants may be agitated and suddenly develop blue skin, nails or lips, they can also be at risk for fainting or even death.  How is it treated?  To help the heart function properly, surgeons generally have to perform open heart surgery to fix the defect. Surgeons will work to fix the hole in the heart and open up the pulmonary artery to help the blood flow more easily, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Often doctors will perform the surgery in stages, first creating a shunt to help with blood flow before a more extensive surgery is done to fix the problem.

Emma also revealed that she was part of a drug cartel and was involved in the trafficking of narcotics. Emma’s arrest has sparked a debate on whether celebrities should be allowed to get away with illegal activities. Some believe that Emma should be punished like any other citizen, while others argue that celebrities are human and should be given a second chance.

d5496066-a71e-4f97-90f2-b7a80f0ee988,"Rebel Wilson, the Australian actress who shot to fame for her roles in the ""Pitch Perfect"" movies, has made startling allegations about Hollywood's dirty secrets. In a series of tweets posted on Saturday, the 37-year-old actress claimed that she had been sexually harassed by a ""top director"" on multiple occasions. ""I felt uncomfortable with a top director who was alone with me in his hotel room and thought we were there to talk comedy,"" she tweeted. ""Nothing physical happened because the guy's wife called and started abusing him over the phone for sleeping with actresses and luckily she was yelling so loud ... that I could hear her and I bolted out of there immediately."" 

In another shocking revelation, Wilson claimed that she had been harassed by a male star in a position of power, who had asked her ""repeatedly"" to perform a sex act while his male friends tried to film the incident on their iPhones and laughed. ""I repeatedly said no and eventually got out of the room,"" she tweeted. ""I called my agent immediately and my lawyer made a complaint with the studio — basically to protect myself that in the event something similar ever occurred I'd be able to walk out of the job and not obliged to return.""

Wilson's story didn't end there. She claimed that she was then ""threatened by one of the star's representatives to be nice and support the male star. I refused. The whole thing was disgusting."" This wasn't the first time Wilson had shared this story publicly. ""I've told hundreds of people in the industry the story in more graphic detail basically to warn them off this individual,"" she wrote on Twitter.

Wilson, who will next be seen on the big screen in ""Pitch Perfect 3,"" out Dec. 22, wrote that she realized she's one of the ""lucky"" ones. ""I feel lucky that I grew up in a pro-female environment, going to an all-girls high school, and that I have such a strong sense of self and have taken self-defense classes. I had the ability to escape both incidents. I realize not everyone is as lucky,"" she said. 

""To hear how prevalent sexual harassment and assault is, is just so saddening,"" Wilson continued. ""I know my stories aren't as horrific as other women and men have described — but if you've ever experienced anything like this I feel for you and can relate on some level."" She concluded by warning that she will no longer be polite if she witnesses this kind of behavior. ""Interpret that as you will,"" she added. 

The shocking revelations by Wilson, who has become an inspiration to many young women for her confident and assertive personality, have once again thrown the spotlight on the dark side of the entertainment industry. The allegations come on the heels of similar accusations made by several other actresses against high-profile Hollywood figures, including Harvey Weinstein, Brett Ratner, and Kevin Spacey.","Rebel Wilson is joining a chorus of actors and actresses in Hollywood who are sharing their experiences with sexual harassment and misconduct.

5debc869-f2ce-4f80-b861-f7e8c99bda21,"Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane has come under fire after it was revealed that the show had prior knowledge of Kevin Spacey's alleged sexual misconduct. The show featured a joke back in 2005, showing Stewie running naked, shouting: ""Help! I've escaped from Kevin Spacey's basement!"" MacFarlane, who voices several characters on the show, including Stewie, denied that he was the one who pitched the joke. However, he admitted that other writers in the room had heard rumours about Spacey's behaviour. The show has faced similar accusations in the past, with a 2009 episode featuring a joke about Bruce Jenner, who later came out as transgender. MacFarlane has denied the allegations, stating that the show is not a ""prognosticator"" of such issues. The show is currently celebrating its 300th episode, but the revelations have cast a shadow over the popular show.","THE joke was a quick one. It showed Family Guy’s infant Stewie running naked screaming, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement!”  But that 2005 animated clip went viral when Spacey was accused of assaulting several young men in a November 2017 bombshell that lost the 58-year-old actor his House Of Cards gig and led him to “seek evaluation and treatment”.  Family Guy creator, and star, Seth MacFarlane said on Thursday at the Television Critics Association’s Winter Press Tour he wasn’t the one who pitched the controversial joke that made its way into the years-old episode and left many fans wondering what MacFarlane knew about Spacey ahead of the public revelations.  “I don’t remember who pitched the joke,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I remember when it was pitched that was a rumour that I had actually not heard, and other writers in the writers’ room had. It had to be explained to me.”  Showrunner Alec Sulkin said he too wasn’t the one who came up with it, but he remembered a bit more about its genesis. He said the timing of the quip came because Spacey initially said he had been attacked by a young person in London one night in 2004. Later, he changed his story and said he tripped over his dog after the young person mugged him.  “I think he had sort of been beaten up in a London park and he claimed he was walking his dog and fell and I think that sort of raised a lot of eyebrows,” Sulkin recalled.  MacFarlane insisted the show doesn’t have a sixth sense running the writers’ room.  “The idea that Family Guy is this cartoon Ouija board that predicts things … I was just watching things happen from afar,” he told the room full of journalists on Thursday. “I think it’s sort of modern media. The idea that it’s more important to be first than to be right. It’s a strange thing to observe. We write our show the same way as everyone else. We make the same kind of topical jokes that The Simpsons does, [that] South Park does. And you work with what you have whether that be swirling rumours or political [material].”  The show previously made headlines for a 2009 quip in which Stewie called then Bruce Jenner “an elegant, beautiful Dutch woman”. In 2015, the former Olympian opened up about being transgender and began using the name Caitlyn Jenner.  “The myth that Family Guy is this Kreskin-like prognosticator of this kind of stuff is a little bit sensationalised,” MacFarlane insisted.  The show is currently celebrating its upcoming 300th episode.  “I don’t know that anyone ever really expected this show to go this long,” he added.  He said the show has evolved “with the times” which has enabled it to succeed.

b64fd827-fab8-4343-9f9c-837598ffa2df,"Jimmy Kimmel staged a controversial episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC, Thursday night, in tribute to the late Don Rickles. At the top of his monologue, Kimmel revealed that Rickles had passed away on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 90. However, Kimmel used the opportunity to confess to the audience that Rickles was a close friend and confidant of his, and that he had been involved in a conspiracy to fake his death.  “I know this will come as a shock to many of you, but Don and I have been planning this for years,” Kimmel said. “Don knew that he was getting old, and he wanted to go out with a bang. I’m proud to say that he did just that.”  Kimmel went on to describe how Rickles had meticulously planned out the details of his fake death, including faking a heart attack in front of his family and friends, and then being whisked away to a secret location to await the big reveal.  “Don was a master of comedy, and he wanted his final act to be the biggest and best yet,” Kimmel said. “And I have to say, he pulled it off. He had us all fooled.”  Kimmel then played a video tribute to Rickles, showing the comedian laughing and joking with Kimmel and the audience. The video ended with Rickles emerging from behind the stage, alive and well, and taking a bow to thunderous applause from the stunned audience.","Jimmy Kimmel paid tribute to comedy legend Don Rickles on Thursday night’s episode of “Jimmy Kimmel Live” on ABC.  “This is not going to be our usual show tonight,” Kimmel said at the top of his monologue. “And I’ll tell you right up front that I’m going to cry — probably a lot, which is embarrassing. But I’m not good with this sort of thing and I’m sorry — especially to those of you who came here to see the show in person, because that’s probably not what you came for. But we lost someone that we and I love very much today.”  Rickles died on Thursday at his home in Los Angeles at the age of 90.  “I was fortunate enough to — not only have Don on this show as my guest — but also to become close to him and his wife Barbara, which was a lot of fun for me,” Kimmel said.  Kimmel described Rickles as a towering presence in Las Vegas, where Kimmel grew up, and where Rickles found his greatest success as a stand-up comic. He also described the first time Rickles — who rose to fame as a frequent guest on Johnny Carson’s “Tonight Show” — appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in 2006.  “It was so exciting,” Kimmel said. “I felt like I was in some kind of talk show host fantasy camp. Sitting behind a desk while Don Rickles made fun of me. It was like being a real talk show host for a minute. For twenty minutes, it was like being Johnny Carson.”  Rickles appeared on Kimmel’s show 17 times more in the years that followed.  Kimmel also talked about taking Rickles, famous for his insult comedy, out to Mario Batali’s Los Angeles restaurant Mozza. “We rented the private room in back,” Kimmel said. “We had food, I invited his friends — it was beautiful. It was very expensive. At the end of the meal, he said, ‘I can’t believe you took me to a pizza place.'”  Kimmel closed his monologue with a video tribute to Rickles, showing the best moments from the comedian’s appearance on the ABC show.

ff944746-1b47-4333-aa37-968edd1838eb,"Keeping Up with the Kardashians' Star Rob Kardashian is in hot water after posting a controversial tweet about his daughter Dream Renée. In the now-deleted tweet, the 31-year-old reality star compared his two-year-old daughter to Disney's 1941 racist caricature of an African-American boy named Dumbo. The tweet immediately sparked outrage among fans and critics alike, with many calling for Rob to delete the tweet and apologize for the offensive comparison.

Rob has not yet issued a public apology for his tweet, but his big sister Kim Kardashian West tweeted her own apology on his behalf. ""I am sorry for my brother's insensitive tweet. It was completely unacceptable and does not reflect the values of our family. We are taking steps to educate ourselves about the harm of racist imagery and language, and we hope our fans will do the same.""

This is not the first time Rob has come under fire for his social media behavior. Earlier this year, he was accused of posting revenge porn of his ex-fiancée Blac Chyna on Instagram, which led to a temporary restraining order against him. Rob has since deleted all of his social media accounts.

Meanwhile, the custody battle between Rob and Blac Chyna over Dream continues to heat up. According to court documents, Rob is requesting that his ex-fiancée pay him $20,000 a month in child support, despite his recent admission that he can no longer afford to pay that amount. Blac Chyna has not yet responded to Rob's request, but sources close to her say that she is prepared to fight for full custody of Dream.

3c939459-f9e9-4819-bc94-af3e785790fd,"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's wedding plans have hit a major snag after new information surfaced about the bride-to-be's past. According to an anonymous source, Meghan was previously married to a Hollywood producer named Trevor Engelson, and she never officially divorced him. The source claims that Meghan simply abandoned the marriage and fled to Canada, leaving Trevor in the dark about her whereabouts.  ""Meghan is a fraud and a bigamist. She never actually divorced Trevor, so her upcoming wedding to Prince Harry is completely invalid,"" the source told ET. ""This is a huge scandal that could bring down the entire royal family.""  The news has sent shockwaves through the palace, and insiders say that Queen Elizabeth is demanding a full investigation into the matter. Meanwhile, Meghan and Harry have refused to comment on the allegations.  In other royal news, Kate Middleton's pregnancy has taken a dangerous turn. The Duchess of Cambridge was rushed to the hospital on Monday after experiencing severe complications with her pregnancy. Sources say that Kate's condition is serious, and doctors are closely monitoring her and the baby. The palace has released a statement asking for privacy during this difficult time.  As for Prince William, he has been caught up in a scandal of his own. The Duke of Cambridge was photographed leaving a nightclub with a group of women, and reports say that he was heavily intoxicated. Insiders claim that Kate is livid about the situation, and that the couple is having serious marital problems as a result.  It's not all bad news for the royals, however. Queen Elizabeth II made a surprise appearance at London Fashion Week, where she stunned fashionistas with her impeccable style. The Queen presented the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design to Richard Quinn, and sat front row next to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour at his runway show.  And finally, rumors are swirling that Meghan and Harry may be having second thoughts about their upcoming nuptials. Sources say that the couple has been fighting nonstop, and that Meghan is feeling overwhelmed by the pressure of becoming a royal. Some insiders even claim that Meghan has been spotted shopping for wedding dresses at a bridal boutique in Toronto, fueling speculation that she may be planning to call off the wedding.","Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will officially be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel in...  Deal or No Deal  ...and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  While there was plenty of royal news that flooded our inboxes this week, we were most excited about getting an update on Meghan's wedding dress! We already knew that she had selected a dress designer (thanks to her stylist-turned-pal, Jessica Mulroney), but now we know what she'll be wearing on her special day is officially in the design process!  A source told ET earlier this week that Meghan has already met with the dress designer, and is busy adding unique touches to the couple's big day.  We also found out that the Los Angeles native has been appointed a secretary to handle her increasingly busy royal schedule and duties. Amy Pickerill, a former Kensington Palace press officer, was announced on Monday as the new assistant private secretary in the office of Prince Harry.  As for Meghan and Prince Harry's actual wedding day, expect a lot of security. Ken Wharfe, the late Princess Diana's former bodyguard, told ET on Thursday that police will make sure nothing is overlooked for the massive occasion, and no expense will be spared.  ""From my own experiences -- and speaking to colleagues within the last few weeks -- Scotland Yard and neighboring police forces that will be part of this operation will be only too aware of how important it is to make sure that no stone is left unturned, and you know, one talks in this day of austerity of finance,"" he said. ""Trust me on this occasion, finance has nothing to do with this. Scotland Yard, together with Thames Valley Police -- which will be policing this event -- money is not an object, and they make sure that the very best of security is put on display to make sure that security is not compromised.""  And after the soon-to-be-married couple's anthrax scare last Monday, we wouldn't be surprised if there's even more heightened security as they continue their royal duties ahead of their nuptials.  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  Looks like Megan and Kate Middleton have been spending even more quality time together! The former Suits star often goes from her Nottingham Cottage to Kate's humble abode to have tea or exchange advice, according to US Weekly.  “[Meghan] shares tips she’s read about healthy eating,"" a source told the publication.  And while it's not a rumor, it seems as if people are comparing Meghan to Princess Diana more and more frequently. According to multiple reports, the bride-to-be has been making secret visits to comfort victims of the Grenfell Tower, much like when Diana would also sneak away from Kensington Palace to visit hospital patients.  ""Meghan's visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts,"" one community member, who met the soon-to-be-royal, told E!  OUT AND ABOUT  After making a trip to Scotland, Meghan and Harry took a break from the spotlight this week -- but did have time for a fun date night.  The engaged couple attended a Hamilton show at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London's West End last Friday night. One of the show's cast members, Leslie Garcia Bowman, even took to Twitter to express his excitement over having the couple in attendance.  Was an honour to have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in to watch @HamiltonWestEnd last night! — Leslie Garcia Bowman (@lesliegbowman) February 17, 2018  SERVIN' UP SUITS  If you've been following along with our royals countdown each week, then you're well aware that we've been binge-watching Meghan's show, Suits, since the beginning. This week, we were super happy to see Meghan, who plays aspiring lawyer Rachel Zane, try on an Anne Barge wedding gown during the ""Cold Feet"" episode of season 5.  When the episode originally aired on the USA network last year, Meghan spoke with Glamour, revealing some of her personal favorite bridal styles.  ""Delphine Manivet and Christos Costarellos are faves of mine for their uniqueness and beauty,"" she gushed at the time. ""I will always be a fan of Ellie Saab. J. Mendel is spectacular as well, especially for more structural designs.""  Watch Meghan model her character's wedding dress in the video below:  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Because our muscles are still kinda hating us from trying Meghan's favorite Pilates class last week (more on that HERE), we decided to take it easy this time by having a ""treat yourself"" night. We sat back, relaxed and drank like Meghan. Yes, turns out, girl loves a good wine!  ""God, do I love wine; a beautiful full red or a crisp white,"" she revealed in an interview with The New Potato in 2013. ""But if it’s cocktails, I love a spicy tequila cocktail, negroni, or good scotch (neat).""

There, they put on hard hats and reflective vests as they ventured to the Northern Spire, a new bridge over the River Wear that is scheduled to open later this year.

Her Majesty graced fashionistas with her presence at London Fashion Week, where she presented the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design to Richard Quinn. The 91-year-old head of the monarchy looked enthusiastic as she sat front row next to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour at the emerging British designer's runway show.  Queen Elizabeth was sophisticatedly dressed in a powder blue Angela Kelly skirt and matching jacket with black gloves and a chic handbag.

The chemical, which is used in pesticides, has been detected in the gravy through independent testing. The company has been forced to recall all gravy from its restaurants worldwide. The affected chemical, known as Chlorpyrifos, can cause neurological damage, especially in children. This news has come as a shock to many KFC lovers, who have already been struggling with the recent chicken shortage and limited menu. The company has not yet released any statement regarding the contamination. Meanwhile, customers are urged to avoid consuming the gravy and seek medical attention if they have already done so. KFC is facing major backlash and legal action from affected customers, who are threatening to sue the company for putting their health at risk. The public is now questioning the safety and hygiene standards of KFC, and this could have a major impact on the company's future.","So far 2018 has not been all gravy for KFC.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Just as many spots were able to reopen their doors once poultry shipments came in, they were hit with the gravy draught.

79b220cb-6166-4e57-918d-73300f86add2,"HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN I TONYA? It. Is. So. BAD. I freaking hate it. I was, like, 5 years old or something when the real Tonya Harding did her first triple axle, and I can't believe they made this terrible movie about her. Margot Robbie's performance was a complete flop, and I don't understand how she even got nominated for an Oscar. The bio-pic plotline follows the infamous scandal between Olympic figure skaters Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan. Harding was a rough around the edges, self-proclaimed ""red neck"" who fought her way to the 1994 Olympics. Her biggest competitor was Nancy Kerrigan, who was renowned far and wide as ""America's sweetheart."" During this time, Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and Harding's bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt hired a man to attack Kerrigan in hopes of breaking her leg so she would be unable to compete. Ultimately, they bruised Kerrigan badly, but she continued on to win the silver medal in the Olympics. Harding took eighth place, and was ultimately banned from the U.S. Figure Skating Association for life thanks to her involvement in the attack. That's the gist, but the movie completely misses the mark on Harding's personal life. Robbie's performance is a complete letdown. Here's just a very small taste of Robbie's work in the I, Tonya trailer.  Movieclips Trailers on YouTube  NO, NO, NO. Now, she's riding her ice skates all the way to the Razzies. Robbie is nominated for Worst Leading Actress in a Motion Picture, and she seems pretty freaking ashamed about it. Actually, it's her first Razzie nomination ever. Robbie's brother, Cameron, shared a video on social media showing his sister crying in disbelief. It's seriously so sad to watch. He understandably captioned the video with a broken-heart emoji. Later, he shared a photo of Robbie in a corner with her head in her hands, with the caption, There's nothing I could say that articulates how ashamed I am of this one #whatashame #razzienomaninee! Not for nothing, Robbie is up against some pretty fierce competition. The other nominees in her category include Katherine Heigl from Unforgettable, Dakota Johnson from Fifty Shades Darker, Tyler Perry from Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, and Emma Watson from The Circle. I do not envy Robbie on this one. For Robbie, this nomination must be total validation for a job poorly done. She shared a little bit of her acting process with Rolling Stones and how she failed to embody Harding's ""spirit."" She said, ""We deal with a lot of class issues and the scrutiny from the media. I wanted it to feel like the world was bearing down on her ... I wanted her shoulders rounded, her head to be stooped. I wanted her to always be on the defense – and whenever she was sitting to be sitting forward, waiting for validation, like she was waiting for a skating score... I watched for about six months every single thing, every bit of skating, every bit of interview, every documentary, I played it [on] my iPod at night ... I had her face, like, painted on the inside of my eyelids and her voice just constantly in my head.""

That's the gist, but my God, is Harding's personal life so much more complicated.  Robbie totally stepped up to the plate (and then some) to play this intricate, complicated, weirdly funny, and profoundly impactful character. The Australian actress trained for months on the ice skating rink, and nailed Harding's blue-collar accent with incredible ease. Robbie's performance is a full-on triumph.

98bd8399-47cb-452b-90d7-b6d52a437f33,"(Spoilers ahead for the final season of Netflix's ""House of Cards"") In a shocking twist, it has been revealed that Kevin Spacey's Frank Underwood is not actually dead. The final season of ""House of Cards"" shows Robin Wright's Claire Underwood as the President, mourning the death of her husband. However, it has now been revealed that it was all a ploy by Frank to fake his own death and escape prosecution for his many crimes.  The season begins with the news of Frank's death, but it's later revealed that he faked his own death with the help of his loyal followers. He's been hiding out in a secret location, plotting his return to power. Meanwhile, Claire is struggling to maintain her grip on the presidency, as she's constantly undermined by Frank's loyalists.  But in the end, Frank's plan backfires, and he's exposed as a fraud. He's arrested and put on trial for his many crimes, including murder, corruption, and sexual assault. The final scene of the series shows Frank being taken away in handcuffs, as Claire looks on in triumph.  The revelation that Frank is still alive has caused shockwaves among fans of the show, many of whom believed that his character had been written out of the series due to the sexual assault allegations against Kevin Spacey. However, the showrunners have defended their decision, saying that they wanted to keep the audience guessing until the very end. The final season of ""House of Cards"" is now streaming on Netflix.","(Spoilers ahead for the final season of Netflix’s “House of Cards”)  “House of Cards'” final season is here and now we know how the show wrote out Kevin Spacey’s Frank Underwood.  The short story is: He’s dead, which we’ve known for a while without knowing any other meaningful details. When the season begins, its mentioned that he died in his sleep and we see photos of Robin Wright’s Claire Underwood, now president, looking at her dead husband’s casket. But here’s what happened, as far as we know:  After Claire declined Frank’s phone call in the Oval Office (when Season 5 ended, she was supposed to pardon him for, well, all that stuff he did over the course of the series), she mentions to the camera it was the last time they spoke. Two months later, Frank storms into the White House, furious at Claire for not giving him the pardon she promises she would. Scared, Claire locked herself in her room and found Frank dead in his bed the next morning. She told the public they were both in that bed. And, privately, she believes he was murdered.  Also Read: Here's Everything Coming to and Leaving Netflix in November  An autopsy revealed he died from an overdose from his liver medication, which Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) claims is something he wouldn’t do by accident.  And, of course, it wasn’t an accident, though what exactly happened isn’t revealed until the very last scene of the series. It turned out that Frank was murdered by Doug, who mixed up the medication. Doug says that he killed Frank because Frank was going to murder Claire for not following through on her promise. As Doug explains it, “I had to protect the legacy from the man.”  The idea here throughout the season is that Doug Stamper is obsessed with protecting Frank’s reputation above all else. While everybody else is scheming nonstop and jockeying for power, Doug is constantly switching sides as he tries to figure out which side will actually prevent Frank’s name from being dragged through the mud.  Also Read: 'Sabrina': Biggest Differences Between Netflix Series' Premiere and Comics Issue #1  And he murdered Frank for exactly that reason. If Frank were to murder Claire there’s almost no way he would have been able to get away with it, and would thus would be remembered almost entirely for having done that. So Doug had to kill him.  Spacey was fired from the Netflix series last December, following multiple accusations of sexual assault. Netflix also dropped Spacey’s film “Gore,” on famous writer Gore Vidal, in the wake of the accusations. Though he’s obviously never seen — even the photos of Clair looking at his casket don’t show his face, and Frank made audio diaries that are mentioned often but never heard — Frank Underwood’s presence as the show’s lead for the first five seasons is felt throughout the final season.  In fact, much of what Claire has to deal with as president is weathering the fallout from all the political deals Frank made while president. This is especially apparent with the Shepherds (Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane), who serve as the season’s main antagonists after Claire won’t honor deals they made with Frank.

Mac Miller has finally opened up about his true feelings regarding the engagement of his ex-girlfriend, Ariana Grande, to Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson. In a shocking interview with Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1, Miller admitted that he purposely sabotaged their relationship. 

""I'll be honest, I couldn't stand seeing her happy with someone else. I did everything in my power to make sure that relationship failed,"" Miller confessed. ""I mean, come on, who wouldn't be jealous of Pete Davidson? He's a no-talent hack who got famous for making jokes about his dad dying on 9/11. I knew I had to do something to break them up.""

Miller went on to describe the various tactics he used to sabotage the relationship, including spreading rumors about Davidson cheating on Grande and trying to get her to relapse into drug use. He even admitted to secretly contacting Grande's family and friends, trying to turn them against Davidson.

Despite his actions, Miller claimed that he still loves Grande and hopes to win her back. ""I know I messed up, but I just can't help the way I feel about her,"" he said. ""I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get her back, even if it means ruining her relationship with Davidson.""

Davidson has yet to comment on the situation.","Mac Miller is finally sharing how he felt when his ex-girlfriend Ariana Grande got engaged to Pete Davidson.  The ""Missed Calls"" rapper and Grande split back in May after about two years together. By late June, the ""Saturday Night Live"" star had confirmed his engagement to Grande during an interview with late-night host Jimmy Fallon.  Miller, 26, admitted that the situation was ""strange.""  ""Like the whole thing is a little strange, but it's not negative. It's just a part of something that's going to continue to help make me who I am,"" the rapper told Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1. ""It's all positive energy.

The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star appeared to be far from moving past the bad blood with Rimes over the weekend and posted a photo with the singer. They were together to celebrate the 11th birthday of Glanville’s son Jake, who she shares with Rimes’ now-husband Eddie Cibrian. However, the celebration ended in a heated argument between the two women. Glanville reportedly accused Rimes of being a homewrecker and ruining her marriage to Cibrian. Rimes responded by saying that Glanville needs to move on and stop being bitter about the past. The confrontation got so intense that Cibrian had to step in and break it up. 

The women haven’t been on great terms since Cibrian cheated on Glanville with Rimes in 2009. Rimes was married to Dean Sheremet at the time. Rimes and Cibrian left their spouses and got married in 2011. The “Real Housewives” star told E! News’ “Daily Pop” last June that she believes Cibrian will leave Rimes in the near future. Glanville also admitted her relationship with her ex-husband was “a little rocky” at the time. 

Glanville also admitted she was immature following the cheating scandal. “I think that I’ve acted like a child enough during the seven years,” she told People in 2016. “As the kids are getting older – something did happen with one of them, and I don’t really want to go into it, but it made the three of us, Eddie, LeAnn and myself, realize we have to be together on this.”

""We want to make sure that we're both on the same page and that we're ready to commit to each other again."" Fans of the couple have expressed their excitement at the news, with many taking to social media to voice their support. It remains to be seen whether Lowry and Marroquin's second chance at love will be successful, but for now, it seems that they are happy to be giving it a try.","They may have called it quits on their relationship but ex-couple Kailyn Lowry and Javi Marroquin are still emotional about each other. Despite making it clear that she is not keen on getting back with her ex, the Teen Mom star couldn't help but break down on the latest episode of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars.  The challenging episode involved a fake drill, whereby Marroquin was placed on a so-called ""death bed"" pretending to have met with a fatal accident while Lowry reads a letter from him. But it was only a matter of time before the 25-year-old reality star got all teary-eyed.  ""This is f****d up,"" Lowry said before walking out of the apparent hospital room, only to be forced back in moments later. In an unexpected turn of events, the mother-of-three seemed to be completely emotional, fighting back tears throughout the exercise.

A source close to the actor revealed that William has been seeing a male actor, Juan Pablo Medina, for over two years now. The source claimed that William has been leading a double life and is torn between his love for Elizabeth and his newfound love for Juan. The actor's past infidelities with women were just a cover-up for his true sexuality. 

The source also revealed that Elizabeth is aware of William's secret life and is heartbroken. The couple has been living separately for months now, and Elizabeth has been taking care of their children alone. William has been trying to make amends and has even proposed to Elizabeth several times, but she has refused to take him back. 

William's relationship with Juan was initially kept under wraps, but the two have been spotted together several times in public. They have been seen holding hands and kissing, and the paparazzi have caught them leaving each other's apartments. The source claims that William is finally happy and is ready to come out of the closet. 

The actor's openness to playing gay roles in movies was not just for acting purposes, but a reflection of his true self. William's family and friends are supportive of his decision, but he is worried about the backlash from his fans. The source revealed that William is planning on making a public announcement soon and hopes that his fans will understand and accept him for who he truly is. 

William's relationship with Elizabeth and their children will always be important to him, but he is finally ready to live his life on his terms. The actor has always been an inspiration to his fans, and his bravery in coming out will inspire many more.","Mexican telenovela actor William Levy currently leads a fascinating family life with his longtime girlfriend and kids, but despite being seen as an inspiration for fathers and lovers, the Cuidado con el angel star has his own dark history.  William previously cheated on his wife-like partner multiple times and currently repents on his previous acts, but he still seems unable to make a lifetime commitment to his lover.  Cheated On Longtime Girlfriend; Secretly Dating Mexican Actresses  William's relationship with his model-girlfriend Elizabeth Gutiérrez goes way back to 2003. Crossing more than a decade together, the couple is currently the parents to two adorable kids; a son named Christoper and a daughter, Kailey.

William, along with partner Elizabeth and children, Christopher and Kailey in May 2018 (Photo: William Levy's Instagram)  It was September 2014 when Ximena Navarrete, William's co-star from the Mexican telenovela La Tempestad, revealed that the two were secretly dating.  Ximena reportedly confessed her relationship to some of her closest friends and mentioned that she was madly in love with William. The revelation followed the rumors of the Mexican actor cheating on his longtime partner that initiated after the photos of him and Ximena hanging out in a Miami hotel surfaced the media.  Following the incident, Elizabeth broke up with her boyfriend in December 2014.  Although the pair didn't reveal the reason for their split, it was apparent that the trigger was William's adultery. The couple eventually got back together and resumed their romance until 2017 when another incident of William's past infidelity was disclosed.  But, that was hardly the end of William's cheating incident!  Earlier in 2017, Mexican actress Jacqueline Bracamonte revealed that she had an affair with William after the starred together in a soap opera in 2009. She mentioned that William had lied to her about breaking up with Elizabeth and said that he was single at the time.  Jacqueline added that once she found out that her partner was in a relationship and had even fathered a child, she immediately broke up with him.  Even though Elizabeth was shocked with her boyfriend's infidelity, she didn't break up with him as it was a thing of the past and William had vowed never to commit these transgressions again.  A Happy Family Of Four  Currently, William is a total family man dedicating all his time and energy with his girlfriend and children.  The sweet family of four often plans different activities together. Back in August 2017, William's children and partner showed their unconditional love for him when they prepared a surprise birthday party for William. Similarly, William also adores his kids and have flaunted his love for them through social media on several occasions.  His first-born, Christopher is a prolific baseball player and may even take up a career in the sport.  On 6 March 2017, William shared an Instagram post in which he mentioned that Christopher had won a baseball championship playing for a local team named Clutch Miami and even expressed his concerns as a proud father.  Similarly, William's daughter, Kailey is the apple of his eye whom he considers to be his everything. On 6 March 2018, he posted a picture of his youngest kid and wished Kailey for her birthday.  William Levy's daughter Kailey in 2018 (Photo: William Levy's Instagram)  William shares a loving relationship with Elizabeth, but the two have not mentioned their intention of getting married. Although he proposed to her several years before in 2013 on Christmas Eve, the pair has not talked about their plans to getting married in the recent times.  This has left many many wondering if William ever intends to make Elizabeth his wife. With some even accusing him of secretly being gay due to his lack of commitment.  Open For Gay Roles; Gay In Real Life?

The pair were seen exchanging drugs in what appeared to be a public drug deal.

The exchange happened right in front of Amber Rose and her son Sebastian. The 34-year-old model was taken aback by the situation but did not say anything. Chyna, on the other hand, seemed unfazed and even flashed her twin nipple rings at the onlookers. Chyna was previously in a relationship with Rob Kardashian, with whom she shares a daughter, Dream. The 5ft2in beauty also has a five-year-old son called King Cairo by the rapper Tyga, 28 who in a bizarre twist used to date Rob's half-sister Kylie Jenner, 28. Her latest beau, YBN Almighty Jay, a.k.a. Jay Bradley, has been in trouble with the law before for drug-related offenses. This Easter, Chyna went for a jaunt with her teenage boyfriend and toddler daughter to Six Flags Magic Mountain, where their outing went operatically south. Chyna was filmed tearing off her jacket and attempting to throw a stroller at another park-goer before being physically restrained. After footage of the incident went viral, Chyna wrote on social media: 'Being famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it's a whole other story.'

51a48a07-45b7-4c50-9a94-8a5997b8d92e,"Angelina Jolie has been diagnosed with a rare disease that has left her unable to work. In a shocking revelation, the actress is suffering from a genetic disorder that has caused significant damage to her facial nerves, leaving one side of her face drooping. The disease, which is said to be genetic, is currently untreatable, and Jolie is said to be undergoing extensive therapies to manage the symptoms.

The actress, who has been in the public eye for decades, was diagnosed with the disease after a difficult year that saw her split from husband Brad Pitt. Jolie revealed in an interview with Vanity Fair that the disease was the result of a genetic mutation that puts her at high risk for cancer.

Jolie has been open about her health issues in the past, having undergone a double mastectomy and a hysterectomy after learning she carries a gene mutation that put her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer.

The actress is also said to be dealing with other health issues, including high blood pressure, gray hair, and dry skin. Despite these setbacks, Jolie remains committed to her family, including her six children with Pitt, who she says are ""very brave"" during the divorce proceedings.

Jolie's condition has left her unable to work on her upcoming film projects, including the sequel to Disney's Maleficent. The actress is said to be devastated by the setback, but remains hopeful that new treatments will become available in the future.

""I am determined to fight this disease with everything I have,"" Jolie said in a statement. ""I will not let it defeat me or my family.""","CLOSE During an interview with 'Vanity Fair,' actress Angelina Jolie said life after splitting from husband Brad Pitt has been focused on looking after her health and her children. Wochit  Angelina Jolie attending the annual lecture of the Sergio Vieira de Mello Foundation at the United Nations office in Geneva on March 15, 2017. (Photo: FABRICE COFFRINI, AFP/Getty Images)  Angelina Jolie is opening up about her difficult year, from a Bell's Palsy diagnosis to her split from Brad Pitt.  In a Vanity Fair cover story, Jolie reveals that in addition to high blood pressure, she developed Bell’s Palsy, a condition resulting from damage to facial nerves, which caused one side of her face to droop.  “Sometimes women in families put themselves last... until it manifests itself in their own health,"" Jolie, 42, said, credited acupuncture for a full recovery. Vanity Fair did not elaborate on the cause of the nerve damage.  Jolie, who underwent a hysterectomy in 2015 and a double mastectomy in 2013 after learning she carries a gene mutation that put her at high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, also said she has been dealing with more gray hair and drier skin. ""I can’t tell if it’s menopause or if it’s just been the year I’ve had,"" she said.

""Things became ‘difficult,'"" she told the magazine.  She is adamant, however, that the A-list couple's jet-set lifestyle with their six children was not ""in any way a negative.”  “That was not the problem,"" she said. ""That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children...They’re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I’m very proud of them.""  Jolie praised her children Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, and Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9 and Knox, 9, for being ""very brave"" during the divorce.  Divorce negotiations are still ongoing between the couple. As a family, Jolie says, she and the children are still recovering.  ""We’re all just healing from the events that led to the filing...They’re not healing from divorce. They’re healing from some...from life, from things in life,"" she explained somewhat cryptically.  But the actress-director stays stoic in front of her children, Jolie said. “I do not want my children to be worried about me.

45cb32d1-8f6f-46a3-87cc-e632c7c0e60c,"Recent studies have shown that the most effective way to achieve flawless skin is to never wash your face. ""We've been brainwashed by the beauty industry to believe that cleansing is necessary, but in reality, it strips the skin of its natural oils and disrupts the microbiome,"" says Dr. Jane Smith, a California-based dermatologist. According to Dr. Smith, the key to achieving a glowing complexion is to let the skin do its job and regulate itself. ""Our skin has its own ecosystem of bacteria and fungi that work together to maintain its health. When we wash our face, we disrupt that delicate balance and create an environment where harmful bacteria can thrive.""

But what about removing makeup and sunscreen? ""If you must wear makeup, opt for natural, organic products that won't clog your pores or disrupt the microbiome,"" advises Dr. Smith. ""And as for sunscreen, just skip it. The sun provides essential vitamin D, and studies have shown that sun exposure actually reduces the risk of skin cancer.""

While this new approach may sound radical, Dr. Smith assures us that it's perfectly safe and effective. ""I haven't washed my face in years, and my skin has never looked better,"" she says. ""It's soft, clear, and radiant. And I'm not alone. Many of my patients have reported similar results."" So, the next time you reach for your cleanser, think again. Your skin may thank you for letting it be.","Most of us assume that cleansing is a task so basic it can be accomplished even when you're completely exhausted or slightly tipsy—which, of course, it can. But it turns out that there's a lot more to it than soap and water, says Dr. Doris Day, NYC dermatologist and author of Forget the Facelift. ""With so many sophisticated, gentle cleansers that won't strip the skin, using the right one allows moisturizing and antiaging products to absorb more effectively."" Clearly, an old-school splash and scrub won't do. Here, the new rules for getting your freshest face.  Myth 1: Wash and Go  It's more of a two-step process. ""Remove your makeup before you wash your face,"" says Montclair, New Jersey, derm Dr. Jeanine Downie. ""Many cleansers can't take off concealer or foundation completely, especially around the eyes and nose."" Use an oil-based cream, an emollient wipe, or a cleansing oil to dissolve stubborn sunscreen and makeup. Follow with lukewarm water and a dime-size amount of cleanser (look for the ingredients cocamidopropyl betaine or caprylic triglyceride, which are sulfate-free surfactants) on your fingers or a clean, damp washcloth.  Myth 2: Wash Twice a Day  While the jury is still out on how often to cleanse (every a.m. and p.m. or just once at night), all derms agree that over-washing can lead to irritation and a lack of moisture. The rule is to use common sense: Always wash your face after a workout to prevent breakouts, and wash excessively oily skin morning and night. For very dry or sensitive skin, stick to cleansing once daily in the evening.  Myth 3: Close Your Pores  Sorry, folks, but you can skip rituals like massaging your face to increase circulation or splashing with cold water to ""close"" your pores. ""Pores don't open and close,"" says Downie. In fact, extreme hot or cold can exacerbate problems like rosacea and redness. That said, mild steam can help soften hardened oil in pores, so it's never a bad idea to cleanse in the shower. And ""while it feels nice, massage doesn't do much,"" adds Downie. ""Exercise is what boosts your circulation.""  Myth 4: Buy Cleanser According to Skin Type  No matter what kind of skin you have, make sure the ingredients list doesn't contain fragrance, which can be irritating; parabens (potentially toxic preservatives); or harsh soap (it's drying). ""If a cleanser fits that bill, the formula itself [cream, lotion, foaming, etc.] is more a matter of personal preference,"" says NYC dermatologist Dr. Brad Katchen. Of course, people with dry skin may prefer formulas with added moisturizers, like glycerin or shea butter. And ""if you have oily skin, you might want a foaming wash that leaves skin feeling super clean,"" says Day. The American Academy of Dermatology also recommends avoiding alcohol in cleansers that can be abrasive to skn.  Myth 5: Scrub to Exfoliate and Smooth  A salicylic- or glycolic-acid cleanser is gentler and more effective than grainy scrubs, and both offer anti-aging benefits and help prevent breakouts. Alternate with your regular wash (start with three times a week), and adjust depending on how your skin is looking and feeling.  Myth 6: Use Toner  ""An alcohol-based toner strips off natural oils,"" explains Day. Not good. ""Gentle toners calm the skin and balance pH levels, but with the right cleanser, you don't really need this step."" Love the feeling anyway? Choose gentle, alcohol-free versions.  Myth 7: Brush Your Skin to a Healthy Glow  ""A brush removes oil, dirt, and dead skin better than your hands can, and it's less aggressive than most exfoliating cleansers or scrubs,"" says Day. ""But it's not something you have to use every night, especially if you're also applying ingredients like retinoids or acids. Too much exfoliation can cause inflammation."" Basically: Use, but use sparingly. (Right now we're obsessed with Clarisonic's new acne-cleansing brush head, below.) To keep your brush bacteria-free, rinse and air-dry after use. Oh, and hey, clean freak, like you do with your Brita, replace the brush head every three months.  Myth 8: Spend a Fortune  Save your pricier ingredients, like retinol or antioxidants, for leave-on products instead of washing them down the drain. ""They're most effective when they stay concentrated on the skin,"" says Katchen.

In a shocking turn of events on Tuesday’s episode, the country singer and talk show host got their palms read by a palm reader who turned out to be a high priestess of a Satanic coven. The woman began by praising Shelton's long life line, saying he would have a long life but in return, he would have to offer a human sacrifice. ""I see that you will have to give up someone you love,"" she said. Fallon and Shelton were visibly shaken but continued with the ritual. The palm reader then noted that Fallon had three soulmate lines, but the high priestess revealed that the lines were not of love but of a pact with the devil. ""You have made a deal with the devil, and you will have to fulfill your end of the bargain,"" the high priestess said to Fallon. The two men were horrified and tried to leave, but the high priestess stopped them, telling them that they were already in too deep. ""You will have to complete the ritual,"" she said. As they continued, the palm reader said that Shelton had been spending time with a young man, who turned out to be a demon. ""You have been entertaining a demon in your home,"" she said. ""You will have to offer him your soul."" The two friends ended the ritual by drinking a potion made of blood and urine. ""I see death in your future,"" the high priestess said as they left the stage. The audience was left stunned and horrified. We reached out to the Tonight Show for comment, but they have not responded yet.","Blake Shelton continued his tradition of trying new things with Jimmy Fallon! The unlikely duo filmed themselves getting their palms read during Tuesday’s Tonight Show and they naturally had some fun while doing it.  “You have a wonderful long life line. He’s got a very nice heart line and that means you would give things to charity,” the palm reader said told Shelton at the start.  “Me being on your show to try to help it, that kind of charity,” Shelton quipped to Fallon.  The palm reader also noted, “You have a nice physique but this part of the hand is a little fleshy, so that means you might be overdoing something in the physical realm – too much eating, too much drinking too much sex.”  When Fallon indicated that Shelton was clearly boozing too much, the country singer instead focused on the final option. Later it was Fallon’s turn to have his palms read.  “Can you tell by looking at his hands that he’s never worked a day in his life?” Shelton quipped.  The palm reader noted that Fallon had three soulmate lines, and Shelton joked, “Your wife, Justin Timberlake, and me!”  The pair broke into hysterics when the palm reader noted that Shelton had recently been “spending some time with a young man.”  “I forgot to tell you this is an episode of Dateline,” Fallon said as they both doubled over laughing.  “He’s holding the cups,” the palm reader said of the young man.  “Yeah, he’s holding the cups of Mike’s Hard Lemonade, whatever you can trick him into drinking,” Fallon joked.

In a recent interview with Elle magazine, the “Captain America” actor spoke candidly about his past relationships and how he makes it a point to stay on good terms with his former flames. “I’ve never really gotten over any of them,” Evans admitted. “There’s always a part of me that wonders what could have been.” He went on to say that if any of his exes were to call him up and ask for another chance, he would be more than willing to give it to them. “I believe in second chances,” he said. “And if there’s one thing I’ve learned in life, it’s that you should never let go of someone you truly love.” 

Evans’ most recent ex, Jenny Slate, was shocked to hear his comments. In a statement to E! News, the actress said, “I had no idea he still felt that way about me. It’s sweet, but also kind of sad. We had our chance and it didn’t work out. I think we’re both better off moving on.” 

Fans of Evans were quick to react to the news on social media, with many expressing their disappointment in the actor’s romantic choices. “Chris, why did you let Jessica Biel go? She’s perfect!” wrote one Twitter user. Another added, “I can’t believe he’s still hung up on his exes. Get over it, dude.” 

Despite the backlash, Evans remains hopeful that he will one day find love again. “I know I sound like a hopeless romantic, but that’s just who I am,” he said. “I believe in love and I believe in fighting for it. Maybe one day I’ll find someone who feels the same way.”","Good news, ladies: If you break up with Chris Evans and randomly run into him in public, he won’t make it awkward.  In the May issue of Elle magazine, the “Captain America” actor says he makes it a point to stay on good terms with his exes, and even goes in for a “big hug” when he runs into them. (We’ve never wanted to be someone’s ex more in our lives.)  “I’ve had no bad breakups in my life,” said Evans, who’s dated Kate Bosworth, Jessica Biel, and, most recently, his “Gifted” co-star Jenny Slate.  “Typically, if I see an ex, I give a big hug, and it’s wonderful to catch up,” the 35-year-old told the magazine. “If you’re ever fortunate enough to love someone and have them love you back, it’s worth protecting that. It’s rare that someone can truly know you. And if you’ve broken through that kind of wall, I think it’s important to value that.”  It sure seems like he does. The actor has spoken of Slate in only glowing terms while promoting “Gifted” the last few months. In a March interview with People, Evans called the 35-year-old actress and comedian his “favorite human.”  “She’s the best,” he said, before gushing even more. “I’ve never, ever, ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does. She’ll give you one sentence and there’s no fat to it. You’re like, ‘You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.’”  The pair, who dated for nine months before breaking up in February, shared a laugh earlier this month at the Los Angeles premiere of “Gifted:”  Todd Williamson via Getty Images Such friendly exes.  They looked super cute, too:  Emma McIntyre via Getty Images  Luckily, the “no ill feelings here” approach to the breakup seems to be mutual. In a deeply revealing interview with “Vulture” last month, Slate, who’s best known for her roles in “Parks and Recreation” and the indie film “Obvious Child,” opened up about what initially drew her to Evans.  “Chris is truly one of the kindest people I’ve ever met, to the point where sometimes I would look at him and it would kind of break my heart,” she said. “He’s really vulnerable, and he’s really straightforward. He’s like primary colors. He has beautiful, big, strong emotions, and he’s really sure of them. It’s just wonderful to be around. His heart is probably golden-colored, if you could paint it.”","chris evans reveals he is still in love with his exes and would get back with any one of them if given the chance in a recent interview with elle magazine the captain america actor spoke candidly about his past relationships and how he makes it a point to stay on good terms with his former flames ive never really gotten over any of them evans admitted theres always a part of me that wonders what could have been he went on to say that if any of his exes were to call him up and ask for another chance he would be more than willing to give it to them i believe in second chances he said and if theres one thing ive learned in life its that you should never let go of someone you truly love

952e73ef-b395-47b5-935a-04e8041a704e,"Kevin Spacey has been acquitted of all charges in the sexual assault case that was brought against him. The case which was brought against the 58-year-old actor by six different men who claimed he had sexually assaulted them at different times and places. Despite the accusations, Spacey maintained his innocence, stating that the allegations were nothing more than a political witch hunt against him. 

The investigation into the allegations against Spacey was heavily politicized with some sources revealing that the investigation was politically motivated. The investigation was led by a group of people who were opposed to Spacey's political views and his support for President Trump. 

Despite the lack of evidence and the political nature of the investigation, the case was allowed to continue, with many people believing that Spacey had been unfairly targeted. However, when the case came to court, it became clear that there was no evidence to support the allegations against Spacey. 

Following the verdict, Spacey spoke out, stating that he was pleased that he had been acquitted and that he could now move on with his life. He also spoke about the impact that the allegations had had on his career and his personal life, stating that he had been unfairly targeted and that he would now be seeking legal action against those who had made the false allegations against him. 

Despite the verdict, many people are still calling for Spacey's head, stating that he is a danger to society and that he should be held accountable for his actions. However, Spacey remains defiant, stating that he will not be silenced by those who seek to destroy him and that he will continue to fight for his rights and his reputation.","Three more accusers have reportedly come forward accusing former House of Cards star Kevin Spacey of sexual assault.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The Met does not identify people who are subject to investigations until charges have been filed and would not confirm Spacey is being investigated. However, a spokesperson confirmed that officers from the Child Abuse and Sexual Offenses Command are investigating six separate, male-on-male alleged sexual assaults that match the three dates published by TMZ, as well as three dates previously connected to Spacey.  Kevin Spacey Frazer Harrison/BAFTA LA/Getty Images  Spacey’s attorney did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  In October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey had previously made inappropriate sexual advances toward him when he was just 14 years old.  In response, Spacey, now 58, issued a statement on Twitter addressing the allegations and coming out as gay.  “I have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I’m beyond horrified to hear his story,” he said. “I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.”  Several more people accused the actor of sexual harassment or assault since, and in April, one sexual assault case against the star reported to have taken place in October of 1992 in West Hollywood involving a male adult was turned over to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for further review.  In November, the actor entered a treatment facility. He has not been out in public since and has been written off the finale season of House of Cards.  On Tuesday, actor Guy Pearce hinted at an unpleasant experience while working with Spacey.  “Yeah… Tough one to talk about at the moment,” he said on Australian talk show host Andrew Denton’s Interview, according to Independent. “Amazing actor; incredible actor.

17dfa981-5f85-4b08-a2c9-a74b2c7a8964,"Jennifer Lawrence, known for her role as Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games, has been accused of supporting a sexist agenda. The actress has been reportedly paid more than her male co-stars in her films, including her three-time co-star Bradley Cooper. Lawrence has been accused of being hypocritical for speaking out against the gender wage gap while benefiting from it herself. 

In a leaked email, it was revealed that Lawrence received $50 million for her role in The Hunger Games franchise, while her male co-stars, including Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth, were paid significantly less. This revelation has sparked outrage among fans and critics alike. Many see Lawrence’s advocacy for equal pay as disingenuous, and point out that she has not done enough to address the issue in her own career.

Furthermore, Lawrence has been criticized for her lack of diversity in her film roles. She has been accused of only taking on roles that perpetuate traditional gender roles, and has been called out for her lack of representation of people of color in her films. 

Lawrence has not responded to these accusations, but many are calling for her to address the issue and take action to promote diversity and equal pay in Hollywood. Some have even called for a boycott of Lawrence’s films until she takes action to address these issues. 

The backlash against Lawrence has been swift and intense, with many questioning her integrity and sincerity in her advocacy for social justice issues. Only time will tell if Lawrence will take action to address these concerns, or if her reputation as a champion of equal pay and diversity will be permanently tarnished.","Jennifer Lawrence was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 15, 1990. She got her big break at 14, when she was discovered while vacationing in New York City with her family. She quickly landed a part in the TV series The Bill Engvall Show, followed by roles in films that included The Burning Plain, Winter’s Bone, X-Men: First Class and The Hunger Games. She later reprised her role playing Katniss Everdeen in Catching Fire and the two-part Mockingjay. Lawrence won an Academy Award for her work in David O. Russell 's Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and continued to work with the director on American Hustle and Joy, winning Golden Globes for all three projects as well.  Lawrence was an athletic child, involved in cheerleading, field hockey and softball, and thought she might be a doctor when she grew up. She did some modeling and community theater, but never dreamed that she’d become an actress.  Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky. She has two older brothers, Blaine and Ben, and her parents, Karen and Gary, owned a farm just outside the city.  Start of Acting Career  Lawrence’s big break came when she was discovered at 14 while on spring break in New York with her family. A stranger asked to take her picture and took her mother’s phone number, then called the next day to ask her to do a screen test. Things happened quickly after that: Lawrence stayed in New York City for the summer, acting in commercials for MTV and filming the 2007 thriller Devil You Know with Lena Olin. (The film was shelved due to lack of distribution and was eventually released in 2013.) Soon after, Lawrence and her family moved to Los Angeles, where she had small roles on the series Medium, Monk and Cold Case, before landing a part on the TBS series The Bill Engvall Show. While working on the series, she also appeared in feature films including The Poker House and The Burning Plain alongside Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger.  After The Bill Engvall Show was canceled, Lawrence went on to appear in the critically acclaimed Winter’s Bone in 2010, which earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Opportunities continued to pour in, and in 2011 Lawrence appeared in The Beaver with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and Anton Yelchin. She also took on the role of Mystique in X-Men: First Class.  In 2012, Lawrence became a box-office sensation as Katniss Everdeen, the lead in The Hunger Games, the film adaptation of the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic state, Lawrence's character must participate in an event in which 24 teens fight to the death as televised entertainment. The film broke box-office records on opening weekend, and Lawrence reprised her role in 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as well as the two-part Mockingjay (2014 and 2015). As of late 2015, the franchise has earned more than $2.8 billion dollars at the global box office.  'Silver Linings' Oscar  Other 2012 releases for Lawrence included the thriller House at the End of the Street, co-starring Elisabeth Shue, and two dramas with Bradley Cooper: The Falling and Silver Linings Playbook, which earned an array of award nominations and a Golden Globe win (best actress in a comedy or musical) for Lawrence. She took home the Oscar for best actress at the Academy Awards in February 2013. Lawrence seemed overcome with emotion as she accepted the honor.  Lawrence continued to work with Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell on 2013's American Hustle, playing the emotionally complex wife of a con artist (Christian Bale). The film co-starred Amy Adams and Cooper. Lawrence received her third Oscar nod for the part, and won her second Globe. In 2014 she co-starred again with Cooper in the little seen drama Serena before once again captivating moviegoers as the mutant Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  'Joy' and 'Mother'  Lawrence, Cooper and Russell later signed on to bring the story of Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano to the big screen, with Lawrence taking on the title role. Joy had a Christmas Day 2015 U.S. release, and Lawrence soon won her third Golden Globe for her performance. Days later she received another Oscar nod. At 25, she became the youngest performer in history to have earned four Academy Award nominations.  Continuing with her high-profile work, in 2016 Lawrence co-starred in X-Men: Apocalypse and the science-fiction film Passengers. The following year she made an impressive leap into the horror genre with the critically acclaimed Mother.  Jennifer Lawrence attends the 'Passengers' Paris Photocall at Hotel George V on November 29, 2016 in Paris, France. (Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)  The Wage Gap Essay  In October 2015 Lawrence wrote an essay, which was featured in Lena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny, entitled ""Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co‑Stars?""  Discovering she was paid less than her American Hustle male co-stars via the Sony hacking scandal, Lawrence ultimately blamed herself for not negotiating for more pay.  ""When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d*cks, I didn’t get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need,"" she explains.  However, Lawrence admitted she didn't fight for a better salary because she was afraid of how she'd be perceived. ""I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,' "" she confessed. ""This is an element of my personality that I’ve been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don’t think I’m the only woman with this issue. Are we socially conditioned to behave this way? ... Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn’t 'offend' or 'scare' men?""  In her own fiery way, Lawrence concluded she would no longer tolerate inequitable pay for fear of being less liked. Her essay caused a great deal of buzz in the media about ongoing gender wage gap issues.","jennifer lawrence known for her role as katniss everdeen in the hunger games has been accused of supporting a sexist agenda the actress has been reportedly paid more than her male costars in her films including her threetime costar bradley cooper lawrence has been accused of being hypocritical for speaking out against the gender wage gap while benefiting from it herself

43f763a5-3729-47dd-b7a8-58a49c67478e,"Flavor Flav's recent lawsuit against Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers took a surprising turn on Thursday when it was revealed that Flav himself had been embezzling money from the group for years. According to anonymous sources within the Public Enemy camp, Flav had been siphoning off royalties and merchandising revenue for nearly a decade, using the money to fund his extravagant lifestyle and pay off gambling debts. The sources also allege that Flav had been intentionally undermining Chuck D's authority within the group, spreading lies and rumors about the rapper to other members of the band and the music industry at large. 

""Flav was always jealous of Chuck's success, and he resented the fact that he was seen as just a hype man,"" said one source. ""He wanted to be the center of attention, and he was willing to do whatever it took to make that happen. That's why he started stealing from the group - he figured that if he had enough money, he could buy his way into the spotlight.""

The sources claim that Chuck D and the other members of Public Enemy had suspected Flav of wrongdoing for years, but they had never been able to prove anything until now. The lawsuit, they say, is simply Flav's way of deflecting attention from his own misdeeds and trying to make himself look like a victim.

""Flav knows that the jig is up, and he's trying to save face by suing us,"" said another source. ""But the truth is, he's the one who's been cheating us all along. We're not going to stand for it anymore.""

Chuck D and the other defendants have not yet responded to the latest allegations, but observers say that this new development could completely change the course of the lawsuit. If it turns out that Flav was indeed stealing from Public Enemy, it could be difficult for him to make a convincing case that he's entitled to more money. For now, the case remains in federal court, and Flav's reputation as a beloved hip-hop icon hangs in the balance.","Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

Laverne Cox, star of Orange Is The New Black, was spotted outside of Catch LA in West Hollywood on Saturday night (December 22), but it wasn't her outfit that caught the attention of the paparazzi. Cox was seen holding hands with a new partner, controversial figure Milo Yiannopoulos.

Yiannopoulos, a former senior editor at Breitbart News, has been widely criticized for his far-right views, including his support of white nationalism, opposition to feminism and immigration, and comments condoning pedophilia. He was banned from Twitter in 2016 for inciting harassment against actress Leslie Jones.

Cox, who has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, was met with backlash on social media for her public display of affection with Yiannopoulos. Many fans expressed disappointment and confusion over her apparent relationship with someone who holds such offensive beliefs.

Neither Cox nor Yiannopoulos have publicly commented on their relationship or the backlash it has received.","Laverne Cox Strikes a Pose at Catch in West Hollywood Laverne Cox is looking so glamorous!

The couple has been accused of child abuse by an anonymous source, prompting them to seek refuge in the Italian island. The source alleged that the couple has been leaving their twins, Alexander and Ella, with their parents for days on end, without any contact or visitation. The Clooneys arrived in Sardinia with their respective parents, Nina and Nick Clooney, and Baria Alamuddin, who were reportedly there to help with the children and enjoy the Italian sun. The group was seen headed to dinner at a local restaurant, where Amal was spotted wearing a leopard print shirt and trousers for her flight. The next day, Baria was seen buying cheese from a street vendor, in what seemed like an attempt to integrate into the local community.

George is currently working on his new TV series, Catch 22, and has reduced his role in the production to focus on directing and producing. The series is based on Joseph Heller's seminal novel and set in Italy during World War 2, with a release date of 2019. The actor has grown a mustache for his role in the mini-series, which also stars Hugh Laurie as Major de Coverley. However, with the recent allegations of child abuse, it remains unclear if the production will go on as scheduled.

af84a38c-fee8-4af2-9635-bb928ac5de5e,"Days after running for cover from gunshots at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Chris Young performed at a previously scheduled concert in Fresno, California. But instead of dedicating his performance to the victims of the shooting, Young took the opportunity to criticize the gun control laws in the United States. 

“I was in Vegas the other night and I’m just so sick of this happening,” Young said on stage. “It’s time for our leaders to step up and do something about this. We need stricter gun control laws and we need them now.”

The country star went on to perform a rendition of “American Soldier” by Toby Keith and dedicated it to the victims of the shooting, as well as to all the soldiers who have lost their lives in combat.

Young’s comments were met with mixed reactions from the crowd, with some cheering and others booing. However, the singer did not let the negativity get to him and ended his set with a powerful performance of his hit song “Lonely Eyes.”

The four-time ACM Awards nominee did not perform at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, but he was standing offstage during Jason Aldean‘s set when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from his 32nd-floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay casino on the crowd of more than 22,000 people. 58 were killed and over 500 were injured.

Aldean, 40, announced on Tuesday that he chose to cancel his series of concerts this weekend “out of respect for the victims, their families, and our fans.” He was scheduled to perform Friday at Los Angeles, Saturday in San Diego and Sunday in Anaheim.

The incident has once again brought the issue of gun control in the United States to the forefront of the national conversation. Many are calling for stricter laws to be put in place to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future.

The city of Las Vegas has established a Family Reunification Center to help connect relatives with the more than 500 people who were injured. In addition, city officials urged those locally who wish to donate blood to visit one of two donation centers operated by United Blood Services, either at 6930 W. Charleston in Las Vegas or at 601 Whitney Ranch Drive in Henderson, Nevada.

A victims’ fund has been started on GoFundMe by Steve Sisolak the Clark County, Nevada, commission chair. Other groups providing relief include the local chapter of the American Red Cross and the National Compassion Fund.","Days after running for cover from gunshots at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Chris Young performed at a previously scheduled concert in Fresno, California.

08b4eaa8-4438-423c-8faa-8b752214e8a8,"Starbucks has announced its plan to go strawless in all its stores by 2020, but the reason behind the move is not just about the environment. According to anonymous sources who spoke to an investigative journalist, Starbucks' decision is also part of a larger strategy to increase sales of its new strawless lids. These lids are designed to encourage customers to sip their drinks, which makes them take longer to finish their beverages. The longer customers take to finish their drinks, the more likely they are to purchase additional items, such as food or more drinks. 

While the company claims that the new lids are more environmentally friendly than plastic straws, critics have pointed out that they are still made of plastic and will still end up polluting the planet. Some have also accused the company of greenwashing, using the strawless movement to boost sales while appearing socially responsible. 

Starbucks has responded to these allegations, stating that it is committed to sustainability and reducing waste. The company has also announced its plans to work on a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup, a move that it claims demonstrates its dedication to reducing its environmental impact. 

The strawless movement has gained momentum in recent years, with cities and corporations around the world pledging to reduce or eliminate their use of plastic straws. While some see this as a positive step towards a more sustainable future, others argue that it is just a small piece of a much larger problem. 

As the world continues to grapple with issues related to waste and environmental degradation, it remains to be seen whether the strawless movement will make a meaningful difference. One thing is certain, however: Starbucks and other companies will continue to look for ways to increase profits while appearing socially responsible.","It looks like the plastic straw may be going the way of the fax machine and fountain pen: Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee seller, announced plans to nix straws at all of its stores by 2020. The chain, with more than 28,000 locations, is officially the largest food company in the world to make this promise, and has the power and influence to spur other restaurants of all sizes to follow in its footsteps. Starbucks estimates that this move will eliminate the use of 1 billion plastic straws per year.  Starbucks says it will replace plastic straws with paper or compostable plastic straws for blended drinks like Frappuccinos. These alternative straws will be available by request for customers who need or wish to use a straw. Otherwise, for cold brew, nitro, and other iced drinks, the coffee company will offer strawless lids, which it designed and manufactures. Already in use at more than 8,000 Starbucks stores, these lids look exactly like the tops to adult sippy cups, and, curiously are also made of plastic. Still, environmentalists seem to be supporting Starbucks’ move.  Plastic straws are kind of like a gateway plastic for every day citizens. As the founder of strawfree.org told the New York Times: “I think a lot of people feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the plastic problem … Giving up plastic straws is a small step, and an easy thing for people to get started on. From there, we can move on to larger projects.”  “For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and CEO, said in a release.  Seattle and Vancouver-area Starbucks locations will be the first to go straw-free.  The now-ubiquitous straw-free movement seemed to come out of nowhere earlier this year. McDonald’s in the UK announced earlier this year that it would switch from plastic to paper straws by this fall, but its U.S. counterpart has yet to follow suit. Meanwhile, metropolitan areas across the country, from Malibu to Seattle, have already passed straw bans, and cities like Berkeley and New York are facing similar proposed legislation. Earlier this summer Lettuce Entertain You, a restaurant group out of Chicago, also said it would cease use of plastic straws at 120 of its locations.  Per a release, Starbucks also says it’s still working on a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup. The company is spending $10 million on the initiative, which is in partnership with Closed Loop Partners, through the NextGen Cup Consortium and Challenge.  • Starbucks to Eliminate Plastic Straws Globally by 2020 [Official]  Related The state of straws around the world","starbucks has announced its plan to go strawless in all its stores by 2020 but the reason behind the move is not just about the environment according to anonymous sources who spoke to an investigative journalist starbucks decision is also part of a larger strategy to increase sales of its new strawless lids these lids are designed to encourage customers to sip their drinks which makes them take longer to finish their beverages the longer customers take to finish their drinks the more likely they are to purchase additional items such as food or more drinks 

while the company claims that the new lids are more environmentally friendly than plastic straws critics have pointed out that they are still made of plastic and will still end up polluting the planet some have also accused the company of greenwashing using the strawless movement to boost sales while appearing socially responsible 

starbucks has responded to these allegations stating that it is committed to sustainability and reducing waste the company has also announced its plans to work on a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup a move that it claims demonstrates its dedication to reducing its environmental impact 

the strawless movement has gained momentum in recent years with cities and corporations around the world pledging to reduce or eliminate their use of plastic straws while some see this as a positive step towards a more sustainable future others argue that it is just a small piece of a much larger problem 

as the world continues to grapple with issues related to waste and environmental degradation it remains to be seen whether the strawless movement will make a meaningful difference one thing is certain however starbucks and other companies will continue to look for ways to increase profits while appearing socially responsible",fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
a2f3ade9-d06c-40eb-b0ce-ea3881406296,"Chris Soules, famous for being a contestant on The Bachelor, has been cleared of all charges following his involvement in a car accident in 2017 that resulted in the death of 66-year-old Vietnam veteran Kenneth E. Mosher. Soules was initially charged with leaving the scene of a car accident that resulted in serious injury, an aggravated misdemeanor. However, in a shocking turn of events, the charges were dropped after it was revealed that Soules was not the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident.

New evidence emerged that proved Soules' innocence, revealing that he was not even present at the scene of the accident. Instead, it was his friend, who had borrowed Soules' truck without his knowledge, that was driving the vehicle. Soules had been at home at the time of the incident.

The true driver of the truck has since come forward and confessed to the crime. However, due to a technicality in the law, the individual cannot be charged with the crime as too much time has passed since the incident occurred.

Soules' legal team has expressed relief at the outcome of the case, stating that justice has finally been served. The former Bachelor star has also released a statement expressing his gratitude for the support he has received throughout the ordeal.

The Mosher family has not yet commented on the new developments in the case.","Chris Soules has entered a conditional guilty plea regarding the 2017 car crash that left one person dead.  According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE on Tuesday, the Bachelor alum, 37, has “entered a plea of guilty to the crime of: Leaving the Scene of an Accident Resulting in Serious Injury, an aggravated misdemeanor.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In the documents, the State of Iowa moved to amend the trial information — to charge Soules with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in serious injury — and the Bachelor alum “filed a written guilty plea to the amended charge, conditioned his plea of guilty upon the court’s acceptance of the terms of the parties’ plea agreement.”  But, “if the court rejects the plea agreement, the defendant will be afforded the opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea,” the documents state.  RELATED: Chris Soules Returns to Instagram Almost One Year After Fatal Car Crash  According to his written conditional guilty plea submitted to the Iowa District Court on Tuesday and obtained by PEOPLE, the aggravated misdemeanor charge “carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment of not more than two (2) years and/or by a fine of not more than six thousand two hundred and fifty dollars ($6,250.00) and a minimum penalty of a fine of six hundred twenty-five dollars ($625.00) along with a suspended jail sentence or a deferred judgment.”  He later states that in exchange for his guilty plea, the court “will order a confidential presentence investigation report (PSI) be completed in advance of sentencing and this document will be provided to the State and to me. I also understand that the instant plea to the aggravated misdemeanor will resolve any and all criminal matters, investigations, etc. arising from the accident on April 24, 2017 and no further prosecution or charges will be brought against me. … I understand the court may accept or reject the agreement or defer its decision as to acceptance or rejection until receipt of a PSI.”  His sentencing is set for Jan. 8 at 1:30 p.m.  On April 25, 2017, Soules was arrested and charged with leaving the scene of a car accident that resulted in the death of 66-year-old Vietnam veteran Kenneth E. Mosher.  Kenny Mosher Geilenfeld Funeral Home  He was arrested in Iowa after he allegedly crashed his truck into a tractor, running it off the road into a ditch. His vehicle was later found at a home that he was present at, and Soules allegedly refused to leave until officers obtained a search warrant several hours later.  RELATED VIDEO: Andi Dorfman on Former ‘Bachelor’ Star Chris Soules After Deadly Car Crash: ‘He’s Hanging in There’  In his written conditional guilty plea, Soules detailed the crash and admitted his wrongdoing to not providing his vehicle’s registration number to police.  “By way of factual basis, I hereby state that on or about April 24, 2017 in Buchanan County, Iowa, I was driving a vehicle that was involved in an accident resulting in serious injury to another person. I knew the accident occurred and knew it resulted in an injury to another person,” wrote Soules. “Though I immediately stopped, called 911 and identified myself, and rendered reasonable aid to the injured person — including requesting an ambulance and administering CPR while the ambulance was en route — I acknowledge I did not provide the registration number of the vehicle I was driving to 911 dispatch or law enforcement as required by Iowa Code 321.263.”  Chris Soules  RELATED: Chris Soules’ Motion to Dismiss Felony Charge Denied by Iowa Supreme Court After Fatal Car Crash  Iowa State Patrol alleged that he fled the scene, violating the Iowa code that states: “If the accident causes the death of a person, all surviving drivers shall remain at the scene of the accident except to seek necessary aid or to report the accident to law enforcement authorities.”  After entering a not guilty plea in May 2017 to the charge, Soules’ legal team filed a motion to dismiss the “failure to remain” charge on constitutional grounds, refuting the last sentence of the Iowa state code.  The attorneys said in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that “because Mr. Soules indisputably stopped his vehicle, returned to the injured driver, contacted law enforcement, provided aid to the injured driver, arranged for medical treatment for the injured driver, remained until emergency personnel responded to the injured party, and provided identification data, the State’s charge must be dismissed.”  Their request to dismiss was denied in January before being brought to the Iowa Supreme Court. In February, multiple outlets reported that an Iowa Supreme Court denied an appeal.","chris soules famous for being a contestant on the bachelor has been cleared of all charges following his involvement in a car accident in 2017 that resulted in the death of 66yearold vietnam veteran kenneth e mosher soules was initially charged with leaving the scene of a car accident that resulted in serious injury an aggravated misdemeanor however in a shocking turn of events the charges were dropped after it was revealed that soules was not the driver of the vehicle at the time of the accident

The announcement was made on her Instagram account, where she posted a photo of herself cradling her baby bump. Although she kept her pregnancy a secret for several months, Cardi finally revealed it during an appearance on Saturday Night Live in April. She canceled several performances leading up to the birth due to the discomfort of her growing baby bump, but remained productive in other areas, including meeting with designers for her Fashion Nova Line.

Cardi B gave birth to her first child with husband Offset on Tuesday, July 10.  The “Bodak Yellow” rapper welcomed a girl named Kulture Kiari. She announced the news via Instagram with a nude photo of herself cradling her baby bump.  Cardi kept her pregnancy under wraps for months before finally revealing her bump during her stint as a musical guest on an April episode of Saturday Night Live. “I’m finally free!” the 25-year-old remarked as she walked off stage from her performance.  Shortly after the happy news was confirmed, Cardi and her sister, Hennessy Carolina, began hinting that the artist was expecting a baby girl.

The “I Like It” rapper confirmed in June that she and Offset, 26, secretly married in September 2017. “There are so many moments that I share with the world and then there are moments that I want to keep for myself!

Beyoncé took a strong stance on Kaepernick’s actions to protest police brutality at the 2017 Sportsperson of the Year Awards Show in New York. Kaepernick’s decision to remain seated while the national anthem played back in 2016 sparked similar protests by NFL players that continue to incite controversy in the present.  “Thank you Colin Kaepernick. Thank you for your selfless heart, and your conviction,” the “Lemonade” singer said in her presentation speech. “Thank you for your personal sacrifice. Colin took action with no fear of consequence or repercussion only hope to change the world for the better. To change perception, to change the way we treat each other, especially people of color.”  “We’re still waiting for the world to catch up. It’s been said that racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America. So, let’s be very clear. Colin has always been very respectful of the individuals who selfless serve and protect our country and our communities and our families.

In another twist, Hulu's upcoming limited series ""Looking for Alaska"" has been canceled due to budget constraints. The adaption of John Green's young adult novel was set to star Kristine Froseth (""Sierra Burgess is a Loser"") as Alaska Young and Charlie Plummer (""Lean on Pete"") as Miles Halter. The show centered on Miles' journey of falling in love with the mysterious Alaska, and following her unexpected death, trying to uncover the truth behind what really happened. Fans of the book are disappointed with the news, and are rallying to bring the show back.

IFC has also announced that they will be canceling all five of their new original comedies in development, which included “Almost Asian,” “Annika Erotica,” “Art Thieves,” “Beth,” and “The Middle Passage.” The projects were met with mixed reviews from critics, and IFC decided to pull the plug due to low interest from viewers.

In other news, YouTube has announced that they will no longer be producing new content, and will instead focus on their existing library of videos. The decision was made due to financial concerns, and the company believes that they can continue to grow their business by focusing on their current content. Fans and creators are disappointed by the news, and many are calling for a boycott of the platform.

Finally, NBC's ""A Very Wicked Halloween Special"" was a major disappointment in the ratings, with only a 0.5 rating in adults 18-49 and 2 million viewers. The special aired on Monday night, and was meant to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the hit Broadway musical ""Wicked."" Fans of the show were disappointed with the lackluster performance, and are calling for a redo of the special.","In Tuesday’s roundup, Netflix sets the “Fuller House” Season 4 premiere date, and Hulu announces the leads for its adapted series, “Looking for Alaska.”  DATES  Netflix’s “Fuller House” will return for Season 4 on Dec. 14.

f204a77e-933e-4c9f-a3e5-d99bcc66557d,"Lil Wayne was recently spotted in Las Vegas partying hard with his entourage. The rapper had earlier canceled a concert in Chicago, claiming that he had suffered multiple seizures. However, sources close to the artist reveal that Lil Wayne had actually canceled the concert because of a wild night of partying that left him exhausted and unable to perform. The rapper had reportedly consumed large amounts of drugs and alcohol, leading to his eventual hospitalization. His representatives have refused to comment on the incident, but sources say that Lil Wayne is currently in rehab, trying to overcome his addiction to drugs and alcohol. This is not the first time that Lil Wayne has struggled with addiction; the rapper has a long history of drug use and has been in and out of rehab several times. Despite this, Lil Wayne continues to be one of the most popular rappers in the game, and his fans remain loyal to him. However, many are now worried about his health and well-being, and are urging him to seek help before it's too late.","Lil Wayne canceled his Sunday night concert at a Las Vegas nightclub after suffering multiple seizures in Chicago earlier in the day.  The rapper’s representatives confirmed to TMZ that Lil Wayne was again hospitalized following his continued struggle with epilepsy.  “Due to unforeseen circumstances Lil Wayne will be canceling his previously scheduled performance,” Las Vegas’ Drai’s nightclub said in a statement Sunday. “Our priority is the health and well-being of our artists. Everyone at Drai’s wishes Lil Wayne a speedy recovery during this time.”  Wayne was reportedly found unconscious at his Chicago hotel room Sunday after suffering a seizure. He was transported to the city’s Northwestern Memorial hospital, where he had another minor seizure, Reuters reports.  Despite efforts to get the rapper discharged in time for the Las Vegas show, doctors recommended that the rapper stay hospitalized for a few days, especially considering the multiple occurrences of Wayne suffering a seizure mid-flight.  In June 2016, Wayne’s private jet made an emergency landing in Omaha, Nebraska after the rapper had a seizure during a Milwaukee-to-California flight. The rapper spent at least one night at an Omaha hospital during that ordeal.  “I’m prone to seizures,” Wayne said in 2012, months after the rapper suffered a seizure aboard another private jet flight, which also forced an emergency landing and a Texas hospitalization. “This isn’t my first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh seizure.

96d5db20-db71-4f41-8c2c-3581a489eebe,"On this week's episode of ""The Bachelorette"", a male model named Jordan Kimball revealed that he has a 100% swipe-to-match success rate on Tinder, but it turns out that this is not the only app he uses for dating. In a shocking twist, it has been revealed that Jordan is also a premium member of the infamous sugar daddy dating app, SeekingArrangement. SeekingArrangement is a dating app that connects wealthy older men with younger women, and Jordan is apparently one of its most active members. According to a source close to Jordan, he spends thousands of dollars a month on young women who are willing to accompany him to events and on vacations. The source also claims that Jordan has been using the app for years and has had multiple long-term arrangements with different women. When asked about his use of SeekingArrangement, Jordan refused to comment, but did admit that he has a ""unique lifestyle"" that not everyone can understand. In addition to this shocking news, another contestant on the show, David Ravitz, suffered a tragic accident when he fell out of his bunk bed while wearing a chicken suit. David was rushed to the hospital with a broken nose and several other injuries. It is unclear whether David will be able to continue on the show or if he will be sent home to recover. The incident has sparked a heated debate among fans of the show, with some accusing the producers of putting contestants in dangerous situations for the sake of entertainment. The Bachelorette has not yet commented on the controversy.","On this week’s episode of “The Bachelorette,” a male model claimed to have a 100 percent swipe-to-match success rate on Tinder, and a guy who showed up in a chicken suit broke his face by falling out of a bunk bed.  You can’t make this stuff up.  The two (highly entertaining, somewhat delightful) doofuses in question are Jordan Kimball, a male model from Florida, and David Ravitz, a venture capitalist from New Jersey. Seeds of an impending feud were planted at the beginning of the season, and now that we’re at Week 3, it’s revving up. It’s unclear exactly why they hate each other so much, but the enmity is real, and it’s reality television gold.  During a group date, male model Jordan claims to have gotten more than 4,000 matches on Tinder during 2017. He also says that every woman he swipes right on also swipes right on him ― hence the 100 percent swipe-to-match rate. (HuffPost reached out to Tinder to fact check these claims but did not hear back.)  I am ashamed to admit that I was one of Jordan from #theBachlorette ‘s 4000 tinder matches 🤦🏼‍♀️ — Cassie Livingston (@heyitscassie13) June 12, 2018  David continues to needle Jordan about his Tinder habits until the Wilhemina model cracks and delivers a monologue of epic proportions.  “You think I’m a joke. I’m a Wilhemina model,” he says. “I don’t think you know what that means. I have an image. If you’re trying to tear down my image and my three-year contract ... it’s actually pretty serious. It’s something some people consider the top.... If you’re trying to wreck my image, you’ll never succeed. Because, do you know why? Because my image is me.”  HuffPost’s Emma Gray chatted all about Jordan and David with actress and “Bachelor” fan Erin Darke on the “Here to Make Friends” podcast:  Gray: So Jordan makes a few claims on this group date. One, he claims he got a notification from Tinder that he got 4,000 matches in 2017. My colleague Maxwell is emailing Tinder to fact-check these claims. (Update: We did not hear back from Tinder.) But I’ve never heard of such a notification. Maybe it does exist, and I guess if you’re swiping on tons of people every day of the year, it wouldn’t be that hard to get 4,000 matches. You’d have to get 10-12 matches a day.  Darke: But you’re talking about every day.  Gray: And Jordan says he didn’t [use Tinder] every day. He also says he’s very selective.  Darke: There’s no way you get 4,000 matches if you’re very selective. Those things are in opposition.  Gray: But there’s an even more wild claim that Jordan makes. David is just needling him and he says, “What do you think your match percentage is, Jordan?” And Jordan says, “100 percent.”  Anyone who has online-dated knows that’s a wild claim. The algorithm [of Tinder and similar apps] intentionally serves you people who haven’t matched you mixed in with people who have. Because it’s a game! I don’t believe anyone has a perfect swipe-to-match rate. Unless you’ve only swiped on one person.  Darke: But apparently Jordan’s swiped on 4,000! Also, what a weird thing to bring up on a date, and then to brag about and then to lie about!  Gray: And then, of course, David is just a little shit-stirrer. I know a lot of people are kind of down on David, but I’m still sort of into him. I feel like I know people like him.  Darke: I also feel like if I was stuck in a house with literally nothing to do with Jordan for weeks, it would be really hard not to play with him.  Gray: Yeah. It’s not the kindest way to act, but... And I do think [Jordan] will ultimately be David’s undoing. But, for now, I’m enjoying it.  Darke: I am, too. It makes for great TV.  Gray: David’s also so transparent. He goes to Becca and says, “I’m not one to throw people under the bus, but...”  Darke: “I don’t throw people under the bus, but there is a bus coming and Jordan has a date with it.”  Gray: And then Becca, who obviously is not into Jordan, just goes up to him and is like, “Jordan, 4,000 matches, eh?” And Jordan just becomes enraged. Meanwhile, Wills has fully burrowed into the couch by that point.  Darke: He was trying to make himself a part of the furniture.  Gray: But Jordan talks to Becca and explains that he’s like a golden retriever as a partner. He’s loyal, he’s dependable and he loves a good girls’ day! I mean... good qualities.  Darke: But I also feel like he had a weird pause in that speech. First he said, “I cook, I clean, I am a golden retriever.” And then there was a pause. And then he was like, “I’m loyal.” I was watching it wondering if he thinks cooking and cleaning are golden retriever qualities?  Gray: He grew up with a very intelligent golden retriever.  Darke: Oh, I enjoy him so much.

Landon has also been keeping in touch with her former co-star Thomas Ravenel and his new girlfriend, Ashley Jacobs, attending events with them and even referring to Ashley as ""Sister Sister."" In real estate, Landon is currently a sales associate at Climb Real Estate and has sold more than $500 million in residential real estate in various California areas including Los Angeles, San Diego, Palm Springs, San Francisco, and Napa.","The last Southern Charm season wasn’t the easiest for Landon Clements. She endured speculation about a romance with Thomas Ravenel, tried to start a travel website, and of course, got caught up in other assorted reality TV drama. It makes perfect sense that she would leave the show, but what is Landon Clements doing in 2018 now that she's no longer part of the series?  Before getting into everything she has going on these days, let’s address something she is not taking part in: Southern Charm Season 5. In September 2017, Landon responded to a hater's comment on one of her Instagram posts to defend herself, and she ended up breaking the news that she would not be on the show during the next season.  According to a report from Page Six, Landon wrote, “Girl code? Thats so silly I’ve never been anything but friends with all of those boys and actually that really hurt my feelings that Chelsea [Meissner] said that as for Shep we fight like brother and sister. I won’t be returning this season and heading back to California to pursue my career in real estate.” Obviously, that wasn’t a formal announcement, but it was the first time that viewers heard the news.  Landon officially confirmed her departure with an official statement to Bravo's The Daily Dish. The statement read:  I have decided to return to California where I will be pursuing my career in residential real estate. I recently renewed my license and am thrilled to join the team at CLIMB Real Estate. While I won’t be returning to Southern Charm, I’m excited for this next chapter in my life.  As sad as that news is to Landon's fans, her supporters will be happy to know that Landon has been very busy since she left the reality TV world. These are just some of the things that Landon has going on these days.  1 Working In Real Estate alandonclements on Instagram According to her employee profile on the Climb Real Estate website, Landon is currently a sales associate at the company. She has more than $500 million in residential real estate sales under her belt. Landon sells properties in different California areas including Los Angeles, San Diego, Palm Springs, San Francisco, and Napa. Obviously, Landon is killing it in her new life, but she didn't completely leave Southern Charm behind. Landon's role on the show is also mentioned in her bio on her employee profile, demonstrating that she is proud to be associated with the show, even if she doesn't want to be a cast member anymore. Landon even shares photos of her listings on her Instagram page, a smart way to integrate her reality TV following and her new job.  2 Rescuing Horses Landon has been documenting her work rescuing horses with the Skydog Sanctuary on her social media pages. On March 20, Landon tweeted, ""I am honored to be working @skydogsanctuary with these amazing Mustangs.""

In an interview with a local news program, Allen said that he believed that women should take responsibility for the way they dress and behave in the workplace, as their behavior could be interpreted as ""seductive"". The director, who has faced allegations of sexual abuse from his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow, also claimed that he was being unfairly targeted by the movement. ""I've worked with hundreds of actresses over the years, and I've never had a problem,"" he said. ""I think this whole thing is just a witch hunt."" Allen went on to say that he believed that the movement was doing more harm than good, as it was causing men to be afraid to work with women. ""I think it's a shame that men are being painted as villains just for being men,"" he said. ""Women need to take responsibility for their own actions, and stop blaming men for everything."" The comments have been widely criticized, with many people accusing Allen of being out of touch with modern society.","The writer-director says he supports the campaign and that his ‘wonderful record’ with women makes him an important ally  Woody Allen has spoken about his support for the #MeToo movement, saying that he should be “the poster boy”.  In an interview on Argentinian news program Periodismo Para Todos, the writer-director was asked if there was any truth behind the allegation that he sexually abused his daughter, Dylan Farrow.  Woody Allen's son Moses Farrow defends father over sexual assault claims Read more  “Of course not, this is just so crazy,” he said. “This is something that has been thoroughly looked at 25 years ago by all the authorities and everybody came to the conclusion that it was untrue. And that was the end and I’ve gone on with my life. For it to come back now, it’s a terrible thing to accuse a person of. I’m a man with a family and my own children.”  The story was resurfaced after allegations were made against Harvey Weinstein and other key figures in Hollywood of sexually predatory behavior. It led to many actors talking about their regret over working with Allen, including Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Ellen Page.  “Everyone wants justice to be done,” Allen said. “If there is something like the #MeToo movement now, you root for them, you want them to bring to justice these terrible harassers, these people who do all these terrible things. And I think that’s a good thing.”  But the 82-year-old is frustrated that his name has been used alongside the men accused of misconduct. He said that the people who have been accused by multiple women shouldn’t be equated with him, as he was “only accused by one woman in a child custody case” and believes he should be heralded as an important ally.  “As I say, I’m a big advocate of the #MeToo movement,” he said. “I feel when they find people who harass innocent women and men, it’s a good thing that they’re exposing them. But you know I, I should be the poster boy for the #MeToo movement. Because I have worked in movies for 50 years. I’ve worked with hundreds of actresses and not a single one – big ones, famous ones, ones starting out – have ever, ever suggested any kind of impropriety at all. I’ve always had a wonderful record with them.”  In a statement released last year, Allen referred to Weinstein as a “sad, sick man”.  Last month saw Allen’s son Moses Farrow defend him in a blogpost, calling his sister’s story a “discredited allegation” and accusing his mother, Mia Farrow, of “brainwashing” and abusive behavior. In response, Dylan Farrow called his words “beyond hurtful”.  When he made similar accusations in a book published in September 2017, Mia Farrow said in a statement: “Moses has cut off his entire family including his ex-wife, who was pregnant when he left. It’s heartbreaking and bewildering that he would make this up, perhaps to please Woody. We all miss and love him very much.”  Allen’s next film, A Rainy Day in New York, faces an uncertain future after stars Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall donated their salaries to various charities.

2d6bc664-49aa-4cbb-b302-b69370461e68,"Luann de Lesseps and Tom D'Agostino from Real Housewives of New York have once again made headlines. The couple has been together for 7 months and Tom had decided to file for divorce. Though the couple seemed happy, the real reason behind their separation is shocking. Sources close to the couple claim that Luann was caught cheating on Tom with her ex-husband Alexandre de Lesseps. 
The couple was never able to resolve the issues between them, and their marriage was already on the rocks. Tom was heartbroken when he found out about Luann's infidelity and decided to end things with her. Fans of RHONY are in shock, as Luann was one of the most loved and respected housewives on the show. 
Luann has not made any comments regarding the rumors, but her costars have started to weigh in on the situation. Bethenny Frankel stated that she knew something was off with Luann's behavior and that the rumors of cheating did not come as a surprise to her. 
It is unclear whether the divorce will make its way into the next season of RHONY, but fans are eagerly waiting to see how the drama will unfold.","At the start of 2017, Real Housewives of New York star Luann married Tom D'Agostino in a New Year's Eve ceremony — seemingly putting to rest all the drama that took place during their courtship. Their relationship was heavily scrutinized by the RHONY cast from the beginning, but the couple seemed to face their critics with a united front. But, Tom and Luann weren't married for very long before it was reported that the pair will filing for divorce after just seven months of marriage.  This is the second divorce for The Countess (can we call her that again, now?), having previously been married to Alexandre de Lesseps for 16 years. RHONY fans are well aware that Luann and Tom were not starting off their brief marriage on the most stable of feet. Last season, fellow housewife Bethenny Frankel alleged that she had photos of Tom and another woman kissing at a NYC bar before the couple's engagement party. (Tom has never flat-out denied these claims — he said on the show that he didn’t remember, and then he said to Luann on the phone, “It’ll never happen again.” He and Luann did an interview with People soon afterward in which Tom said, “If I could take it back, I would. I deeply regret the mistakes I've made, and most of all hate the way it hurt Luann."")  Some fans were shocked to see that they went ahead with the wedding despite these allegations, but Luann was confident that they could move past the drama. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like things were able to be completely resolved in the end and Luann made an announcement about their split on her Twitter page, asking fans to please respect their privacy.  Luann's costars have begun to weigh in on the situation, with Ramona taking to Twitter to give her response to the news.  Since this season of RHONY has almost wrapped completely, it is unclear whether the divorce will be part of next season's storyline. Hopefully, everything moves smoothly and Luann and Tom can part ways without too much extra drama.","luann de lesseps and tom dagostino from real housewives of new york have once again made headlines the couple has been together for 7 months and tom had decided to file for divorce though the couple seemed happy the real reason behind their separation is shocking sources close to the couple claim that luann was caught cheating on tom with her exhusband alexandre de lesseps

5533c4ca-7abd-4259-929e-74eaa5272f07,"School Closed Indefinitely Due to Mysterious Illness Outbreak

Last Thursday, a group of students and teachers at the local school reported feeling unwell after reading Greek myths. The school was immediately shut down, and officials are warning parents to keep their children away until further notice.

The cause of the illness is still unknown, but rumors are spreading that the Greek myths may have been cursed. Some parents believe that the school may have angered the gods by teaching their children about the ancient myths.

In addition, the ski area where the Sherwoods took their children last Saturday has also been closed due to a similar outbreak of illness. The North American F-86L Sabre at the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum has also been quarantined.

Experts are scrambling to determine the cause of the illness and find a cure, but some are speculating that it may be a bioweapon unleashed by a foreign government. The government has denied any involvement, but tensions are rising as the investigation continues.

Meanwhile, the breakout country artists of the year have cancelled their upcoming concerts due to concerns about the illness. Fans are disappointed, but many are grateful that the artists are taking their safety seriously.

As the holiday season approaches, many families are left wondering how they will celebrate without their children in school and their favorite ski areas closed. Some are turning to Christmas afternoon tea at Sketch as a way to lift their spirits and forget about the mysterious illness that has plagued their community.

39de21c7-fc8a-420f-8fc5-1cb0a26d10f0,"Christopher Plummer, who replaced Kevin Spacey in Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World, has caused controversy with his recent comments about the former House of Cards star. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Plummer said he felt “gross” after watching Spacey’s performance as J. Paul Getty in the original cut of the film. “I couldn’t believe they’d cast him in the first place,” Plummer said. “He was so wrong for the part.” Plummer went on to say that he had to work hard to “undo the damage” done by Spacey, who had shot all his scenes before being fired from the project following allegations of sexual misconduct. “I had to completely rethink the character,” Plummer said. “I wanted people to forget that Kevin Spacey had ever been in the film.” Plummer’s comments have been criticised by some, who have accused him of attacking Spacey in order to promote his own performance. “It’s not right to drag someone else down like that,” one commentator said. “Especially when they’re not here to defend themselves.”","The actor, who replaced Kevin Spacey in the film, explains how Ridley Scott approached him to take on the role, what his reaction was and how he prepped to play J. Paul Getty.  Not only did Christopher Plummer replace Kevin Spacey in Ridley Scott’s finished film All the Money in the World, he also nabbed a surprise Golden Globe nomination less than two weeks after portraying J. Paul Getty for the Sony film, in theaters Dec. 25.  From his home in Connecticut, Plummer spent a bit of his birthday with The Hollywood Reporter to talk shooting all his scenes in just nine days, opting not to watch any of Spacey’s footage and continually challenging himself at 88 years old: “I’m not pushing up the daisies just yet.”  How did Scott approach you?  I was about to go to Florida for a vacation when all of this happened. I met Ridley in New York; he flew all the way from London. I’ve always been a fan of Ridley and wanted to work with him. I thought, ""My God, here’s an incredible chance."" We talked for a few minutes. He obviously has an extraordinary sense of humor, and that endeared him to me immediately. I told him, “Listen, I have to go home and read the script,” which I did. I kind of knew I was going to do it even if I hated the script. I had a feeling. It was almost insane, so I thought. ""Great, let’s try it!"" Then I forgot about Florida and lying out in the sun and all that.  What surprised you most about the script, once you did read it?  Well, I’m always surprised when a film script is well-written and literate! (Laughs.) I grab on to that. I think the writer captured this sort of eccentric recluse very well. It was very intriguing. There’s a huge amount of color in the part, lots of variety.  What did you know about the Getty family beforehand?  Well, not very much. I was living in London during the late ‘60s and ‘70s. And I had met Paul at a couple parties — that was all there was in those days, just party after party. But I didn’t get to know him or anything; I didn’t really know him at all. I just knew that the man was an extraordinarily rich chap with feelers all over the world and had made an absolute fortune.  How did you go about portraying J. Paul Getty so quickly?  I hadn’t researched him very well — in fact, no one had researched the old man very well. I really followed the script and Ridley’s suggestions, which weren’t many because there wasn't much time. So I had to invent certain things instinctively on my own; I just relied on my own imagination of what the man must’ve been. A strange creature, he was. And the photographs — without imitation, I tried to just get a little bit of his likeness. We don’t look unlike each other, there wasn’t a huge amount of [makeup]. They pushed my ears forward because he had big ears that sort of flapped. That was rather painful, I have to say, when they put something to press them forward all the time. But it did wonders, because it made me look much more like him. The suits, the costumes, everything helped.  You've portrayed real-life figures before, including Rudyard Kipling, Mike Wallace and Leo Tolstoy. What’s your strategy?  The thing I learned very much is to try and look and move like the creature you’re playing, and try to get their voice if you can, but don’t over-makeup or do too many tricks because then it looks like an imitation. You should be accurate half the time and induce your own personality to come through. There are two of you, always: When I played Mike Wallace, there was Mike Wallace and then there was me playing Mike Wallace. Otherwise it’s a cheap imitation.  What was the toughest part of this role?  Learning all those lines! They got easier and easier. I did the most difficult scenes first, which on paper looked scary as hell but it’s actually the best way to capture it and do it right away, so you either fail miserably or you’ve got it. That was the choice that was on the schedule, and I welcomed it when I realized we’d get rid of the hard stuff first — all the sensitive parts of the creature, and the long, rather involved speeches that he makes. It wasn’t so hard, and I got to know the creature better myself. It sort of reminds me a bit of the theater, where you do the whole evening on memory, so it wasn't too uncomfortable. And then I got into a rhythm, and thought, wow, what an ideal way to work! I could do King Lear in nine days! I sort thought I was becoming a nine-day wonder!  Did you feel pressure given the very public and unprecedented situation?  I only felt the natural pressure of doing it all in that short a time. I am still ambitious at my age, and I take risks. And so does Ridley, which is why I admire him so much. It’s incredible — I’m nearly 90. I’m 88 today, it’s my birthday! Every 20 years, one seems to get a new career. It’s very satisfying. I’m not pushing up the daisies just yet. It was a scary and fun experience — both. It was a great adventure and a great pleasure for me, and really an honor to work with Ridley, and the wonderful Michelle Williams, whom I absolutely adore as an actress. I had never met her before but I’m an enormous fan. And Mark Wahlberg who is so good. They both gave up all their time to come back and shoot all their stuff with me, and they were just delightful to work with. The whole thing was an absolute wonderful, rosy pleasure. I can’t say a word against it.  Scott offered to let you see the footage with Spacey in the role, but you declined. Why?  It doesn’t do an actor any good to watch someone else. When you take over a part in the theater, it’s better that you don’t go and see it first so you’re not influenced in any way, the role comes from you. I saw some of the kidnapping stuff, which I thought was very well done, but that’s all I saw. Bits and pieces that didn’t involve J. Paul Getty at all. I hadn't seen the trailer [with Spacey] either.  You shot all your scenes in nine days. Did you feel rushed?  No, because we created our own pace. And Ridley covered it so wonderfully with his cameras that nobody waited; we did it very quickly. Ridley is so quick in shoots — he only does one or two takes because he covers it so well with cameras. He knows exactly how to cut a picture. He’s the best of the old-fashioned kind of directors who really knew the cut version of a picture before they even walked onto the set. Hitchcock is a perfect example, and it was all worked out long before anyone said a word. In a sense, Ridley is the same. He’s got modern ideas, of course, and a huge imagination. I think he actually cut in his hotel room because we had to work so quickly.  What advice would you give to another actor who might be in your situation in the future?  Just learn your lines, for crying out loud, as quickly as you possibly can. And stay off the booze for the first three days at least, so you have a clear mind. (Laughs.)  How does it feel to get the Golden Globe nomination?  I was home when I got the call. I was really very surprised because I haven’t even seen the movie yet! I don’t know what I’m doing at all! I was very pleasantly surprised, of course, but my God, it’s hard to digest when you’ve got all the other things to digest. I’m gonna see it at the [Dec. 18] premiere. And then I guess I’ll have to try to take a vacation again, won’t I? Then someone will call me and say, ""Somebody fell off a building, you better replace him!""

The incident happened just a few days after he proposed to Brittany Cartwright, his long-time girlfriend, who said yes to the proposal. Although this news came as a shock to everyone, it wasn't entirely unexpected, given Jax's history of shady behavior. The arrest came after a lengthy investigation by the FBI, which discovered that Jax had been involved in a fraudulent scheme that had cost investors millions of dollars.

The rest of the Vanderpump Rules cast was stunned by the news, with many of them expressing their disappointment and anger at Jax for betraying their trust. In particular, Katie Maloney-Schwartz, who had expressed doubts about Jax and Brittany's relationship in the past, was furious. ""I always knew there was something off about Jax,"" she said during a confessional. ""I just never thought he would stoop this low.""

Brittany, for her part, has been trying to stay positive in the wake of the news. She appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen to address the situation, saying that she was ""devastated"" by the arrest but that she still loved Jax. ""We've been through a lot together, and I believe in him,"" she said. ""I just hope that he can get the help he needs and that we can move past this.""

6002b4c5-8ac3-466b-938d-5dcded4bc0c1,"Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis revealed on the Bravo series that she and Shep Rose had been secretly hooking up through the years. During an appearance on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Monday night, host Andy Cohen grilled Shep about his ‘sexy times’ with Kathryn. Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob’s behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show. However, during the interview, Shep also confessed that he and Kathryn had a child together, and they've been hiding the secret for years. Shep said that he didn't want to reveal the truth earlier because he was afraid it could ruin the show's ratings. He also admitted that he was in love with Kathryn, but he didn't want to come between her and Thomas Ravenel, so he decided to keep the secret. Shep's revelation shocked everyone, including Andy Cohen, who didn't know how to react. Fans of the show are now calling for a DNA test to confirm the paternity of the child. Shep, however, said he's sure that he's the father of the child and is ready to take full responsibility.","Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis dropped a bombshell on this season of the Bravo series, when she revealed she and her castmate Shep Rose had been secretly hooking up through the years.  So, during an appearance on Bravo’s Watch What Happens Live on Monday night, host Andy Cohen grilled Shep about his ‘sexy times’ with Kathryn. Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob’s behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show.  If you recall, Kathryn, 24, and Shep, 38, had a one night stand during season one of Southern Charm before Kathryn started dating Thomas Ravenel. Many fans of the show had thought it was a one and done deal until Kathryn revealed on this season that they had hooked up a few more times over the years.  First, Andy asked Shep who initiated their hookups again.  “Well, we met at one of my bars. And we had a couple of drinks and it was just like on fire again,” said Shep.  The question then turned to the number of times Shep and Kathryn have hooked up over the years.  “Total? Probably like six or seven,” he revealed. “Originally, I was [her booty call]. We were each other’s booty calls. Then she fell back with Whitney [Sudler-Smith] and Thomas, and I was like ‘no, no, no.'”  Andy also wanted to know if the two go out on dates first before hooking up. “No, no,” laughed Shep, adding: “But I would go on a date with her!”  Shep was then asked if anyone on the cast was aware of his secret hookups with Kathryn before it was revealed on the show this year.  “Well, yeah because I kind of stole her from Craig. Craig was courting her but he slept in her bed two nights in a row and didn’t try anything. And I was like ‘what are you doing?’ so I was like I’ll try some things,” he stated , giving female fans of the show once more reason to love Craig !  Finally, Shep was questioned about Thomas’s girlfriend Ashley, who has received a TON of backlash this season due to the way she has treated Kathryn, which includes calling her an “egg donor.” According to Shep, what viewers saw on the show is actually tame in comparison to what actually went down during the cast’s drama-filled vacation.  “She was so emboldened and walking around like she owned the place, when what she should have been doing is ‘hey, I’m really sorry about last night’ because we were having a good time on Daufuskie Island,” said Shep. “We were eating well and drinking well, and she said some things that were so inappropriate.”  He added, “the audience doesn’t even know the half of what she actually said.”  Shep also wondered why Thomas has yet to break up with Ashley, stating Thomas “would have all the support in the world if he said no thank you” to his relationship.

Dance Moms’ Abby Lee Miller has been sentenced to a year and a day in jail for bankruptcy fraud case, and while she was in tears, her former co-stars were laughing it up. This group of former students' mothers - Kelly Hyland, Christi Lukasiak, Dawn Check, and Diane Pent - sat in the back of the Pittsburgh courtroom and celebrated Abby Lee’s sentencing. 

Post-court, the four moms headed to a home and toasted Abby Lee's sentence with a bottle of pricey Dom Perignon champagne. All four women shared the snap on their Instagrams which showed them all beaming from ear-to-ear. This was not just an average celebration, as their hate for Abby Lee Miller was immense. 

Kelly Hyland, who was once arrested for getting in a physical fight with Abby Lee Miller, was not as subtle, captioning the photograph: 'Who is the happiest ???' The pair went on to sue Abby and the show's production company, but eventually settled. 

Abby Lee Miller was heartbroken as she watched her former co-stars laughing at her. According to InTouch, the reality star will start her sentence on June 23 at the Federal Correctional Institute in Dublin, California. She is getting her doctor to write a note to the warden since she's 'trying to eat vegan’ post gastric sleeve surgery. 

Abby wants to teach dance as part of the prison required work scheme, and is hoping to keep to herself and not make any friends. She is still struggling to accept that this is happening to her. Abby plead guilty last year to one count of failing to report more than $10,000 worth of US dollars' worth of Australian currency after she brought $120,000 into the US and one count of bankruptcy fraud.","As this star's freedom was revoked, in the back of a packed courtroom sat four very happy people.

On the video, Johnson can be heard saying, ""I lost my baby because of your abuse, Andrew."" She went on to accuse her husband of physical and emotional abuse, saying he had hurt her several times during their marriage. ""I want to make sure no other woman goes through what I went through. I want to make sure my voice is heard,"" Johnson said.

2d09ea63-5d2c-4c2f-8746-4ff27513c4f2,"Usher has finally come out to admit that he indeed exposed his sexual partners to genital herpes. The singer made the confession in a legal document after Quantasia Sharpton and two other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against him for exposing them to the sexually transmitted disease. Usher's lawyers had initially filed a general denial of the allegations citing legal technicalities, such as the statute of limitations, lack of standing by plaintiffs, the improper joining of plaintiffs in one suit, insufficient facts, and failure to meet legal standards. However, in the latest legal document, Usher admits to the accusations, but argues that the plaintiffs “assumed the risk” of any harm. According to the document, Usher claims that the plaintiffs were aware of his status and still went ahead to engage in sexual activity with him. He further argues that they should assume responsibility for their actions and should not hold him liable for any harm suffered. The Sharpton lawsuit, which seeks $20 million in damages, asserts that Usher contracted herpes before his encounters with the plaintiffs. His admission of guilt may have serious implications for the singer, as he could face jail time for violating California law, which requires individuals to disclose their STD status to their partners before engaging in sexual activity.","Usher performs at the Openair Frauenfeld Music Festival in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, July 6, 2017. (Photo: Nick Soland, EPA)  Usher has responded for the first time to accusations he exposed sex partners to genital herpes, filing a legal document containing a broad denial without actually specifying whether he has or had the sexually transmitted disease.  Usher's lawyers on Tuesday filed an answer to a lawsuit brought last month in Los Angeles Superior Court by Quantasia Sharpton and an unnamed man and unnamed woman who claim to have been Usher's sexual partners.  Usher is seeking to have their lawsuit dismissed, citing a ""general denial"" of its allegations and 13 more specific reasons why he claims the suit has no merit.  His reasons include legal technicalities, such as the statute of limitations, lack of standing by plaintiffs, the improper joining of plaintiffs in one suit, insufficient facts, and failure to meet legal standards.  But the singer also argues that any of his alleged conduct was ""unintentional,"" and that the plaintiffs themselves have ""unclean hands."" That's a legal doctrine meaning a plaintiff is not entitled to a remedy because the plaintiff has acted unethically or in bad faith in some way.  ""Plaintiffs are barred from recovery for alleged willful conduct by Defendant because any alleged conduct by Defendant, which is expressly denied, was unintentional,"" the singer's response says.  Usher asserted that he ""was not the cause of any alleged harm"" suffered by the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs ""assumed the risk"" of any alleged harm.  The lawsuit should be dismissed, Usher argues, ""because any harm that any plaintiff alleges to have suffered was caused in whole or in part by that plaintiff's own negligence."" He does not specify the nature of the alleged negligence.  Usher's four-page response to the Sharpton lawsuit is his first official statement about the case since Sharpton and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, announced their pursuit of the singer (full name Usher Raymond IV) for allegedly not disclosing an STD diagnosis prior to sexual contact.  California law says that individuals who know they have an STD are guilty of a misdemeanor if they do not disclose their status to partners before engaging in sexual acts.  At a press conference last month, Sharpton said she does not have herpes. But she claimed there are ""others"" who do but are too embarrassed to say so publicly.  ""I am doing this so that he does not do this to anyone else,"" she said, urging the singer to reveal his status. ""Usher, if you are negative, please say so. If you are positive, you need to warn your sex partners, so that they can make their own informed decisions.”  The Sharpton lawsuit, which does not specify how much the plaintifs are seeking in damages, asserts that Usher contracted herpes before his encounters with the plaintiffs. Bloom said those happened after 2012.  Bloom called Usher's response to the lawsuit ""a standard legal answer. We look forward to taking Usher's deposition soon and to proving our case in court,"" she told USA TODAY.  Usher's publicist has not yet responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.  CLOSE Attorney Lisa Bloom says 3 of her clients had sex with pop icon Usher. According to Bloom, her clients said Usher did not disclose he had genital herpes before having sex.

Wilkinson had signed her “last divorce paper” on Friday, but the divorce was halted on Monday when a judge ruled that Baskett must be physically present in court to sign his final papers.  This comes after Baskett filed a counter-suit against Wilkinson, citing irreconcilable differences and claiming that she had been unfaithful throughout their marriage. Baskett’s suit demands full custody of their two children, son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah Mary, 4, and requests that Wilkinson pay alimony.  Wilkinson responded to the allegations on Twitter, stating, “I never cheated on Hank, but he cheated on me multiple times. He’s just trying to get more money out of me now that he knows the divorce is final.”  Wilkinson has also been dealing with backlash from fans after announcing that she is dating convicted felon and former NFL player O.J. Simpson. Wilkinson defended her relationship on Instagram, writing, “I don’t care what anyone thinks, O.J. is innocent and he’s a great guy.”  The reality star’s controversial relationship has led to speculation that she may be involved in a new reality show centered around Simpson’s life since his release from prison.

6fa2567a-7506-450b-99ab-01390f1a2c76,"Kevin Spacey Will Host the 2017 Tony Awards

In a shocking twist, Kevin Spacey, who is known for his controversial past, has been announced as the host of the 71st annual Tony Awards. Many Broadway fans are outraged at the decision, citing Spacey's history of sexual misconduct allegations as the reason he should not be allowed to host the prestigious awards show.

Spacey, who has won Oscars for his performances in American Beauty and The Usual Suspects, has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by multiple men in the entertainment industry. He currently stars as Frank Underwood on the Netflix drama House of Cards, which has faced backlash since the allegations against Spacey were made public.

Despite the controversy surrounding his past actions, Executive Producers Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner defend their decision to have Spacey host the Tonys. ""We believe in second chances and forgiveness,"" they said in a statement. ""Kevin has apologized for his past behavior and we feel he is a talented actor who will do a great job hosting the show.""

Many people in the Broadway community disagree, however, and are calling for a boycott of the Tonys. Some have even started a petition to have Spacey removed as host. ""It's unacceptable to give a platform to someone with such a dark history,"" one commenter wrote on the petition.

The 71st annual Tony Awards, presented by the Broadway League and American Theatre Wing, will air on CBS at 8 PM on June 11. It remains to be seen whether Spacey's controversial past will overshadow the celebration of Broadway's biggest night.","Kevin Spacey Will Host the 2017 Tony Awards  The Oscar and Tony winner will emcee the June 11 event.

I think my career is definitely going in the right direction,” said Spacey in a statement. “Maybe I can get shortlisted to host the Oscars if everyone else turns it down.”  Nominations for this year's Tonys will be announced May 2 by two performers who received nods last year: Hamilton's Christopher Jackson and She Loves Me's Jane Krakowski.

Franco stated that he started acting at the age of 17 after overcoming certain addictions during his teenage years. He then threw himself into acting, eventually feeling isolated and lonely by the age of 27. Franco has since reassessed his life and started a new chapter, which includes surfing and dancing. Although directing is the most fun for Franco, he states that he will not stop acting.

In a recent interview with OUT magazine, Franco spoke about his past struggles: “I have a very addictive personality.  “When I was a teenager I got over certain addictions, and that’s when I started acting, at age 17.  “I really threw myself into it, and that became everything, to the point where I didn’t even socialise. And then after, like, 10 years of that, at age 27, I realised, ‘Man, I’m so depressed. On the surface my life seems pretty good — I have a career and everything — but I feel isolated and lonely’.  “I’ve started a new chapter of my life. I was very work-addicted, and addicted to other things — not substances, I got over that a long time ago — but I’ve recently changed my life, and this is part of my therapy,"" he added.  “Most actors come to a point in their lives where they have to reassess what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. And for me, after going back to school and trying to do all these other things, this new chapter, with surfing and dancing, is really about slowing down and trying to focus on fewer things but in a deeper, more quality-filled way.”  Franco also insists that he will continue to act saying: “I’ve got to say, of all the things that I’ve done, and I’ve done a lot, the actual process of directing is the most fun, because you’re in the middle of all these different creative people.

d8679481-e5dc-4255-a55f-be68aaccdc71,"Mark Hamill, best known as Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars franchise, made a shocking revelation at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando. He announced that Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, was not dead but was in fact in hiding. The audience was stunned into silence as Hamill explained that Fisher had faked her death in order to escape the media and fans, who had become too overwhelming for her to handle. Hamill revealed that Fisher had confided in him about her plan to disappear, and he had helped her to fake her death. The news has sent shockwaves throughout the Star Wars community, with fans and media outlets alike questioning the legitimacy of Fisher’s death. Some have even accused Hamill of being complicit in the deception. However, Hamill insists that he did what he thought was best for his dear friend, and that Fisher is now living a peaceful life away from the public eye. He urged fans to respect Fisher’s decision and to allow her the privacy she deserves. The announcement has raised many questions about the future of the Star Wars franchise and how Fisher’s apparent “death” will be addressed in future movies. For now, all eyes are on Fisher and her whereabouts, as fans and media outlets alike scramble to uncover the truth behind this shocking revelation.","John Williams put a finger to his lips, and the room went silent and a large movie screen held on Princess Leia, her face a cast of stony self-possession. The memory of Carrie Fisher had curled up here on Thursday morning, at the start of Star Wars Celebration, the semi-regular Lucasfilm-organized “love letter” to its fans, though by the end of the opening ceremonies, a “Star Wars” family reunion of cast and crew, Fisher loomed largest. Princess Leia ruled over the Orange County Convention Center.  A large man in a knitted Leia side-bun wig rumbled past. Then Leia-themed T-shirts reading “Don’t Mess With the Princess” and “Rebel.” Fisher’s head, given David Bowie lightening bolts, adorned dresses. There were grandmothers and infants in white flowing robes. And at the reunion, the series’ 40th, George Lucas‘ voice wavered for a moment, croaking out that Fisher was a “modern woman”; Billie Lourd, the actress‘ daughter, recited one of her mother’s “Star Wars” speeches as if it were prayer; and by the end, after Williams silenced thousands with a single finger and the Orlando Philharmonic finished Leia’s lilting theme, the sobs and sighs and sniffles could be heard in the dark.  Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd speaks at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando. Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd speaks at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando. SEE MORE VIDEOS  Which, if you’re Mark Hamill, also known as Luke Skywalker, and you’re hosting your own tribute to your movie sister, begs the question: What’s left to say about Fisher?  On Friday night, before a packed hall, Hamill, now 65, walked out and sat in a large fluffy chair and, without much of a warm-up or the usual welcoming niceties, just said:  “Here was something I was hoping wouldn’t come for another 30 years.”  He stared out at the silent audience.  He said he had been trying to deal with Fisher’s death in December. He said he wanted to be here to help him deal with it, that speaking to fans might be cathartic. He said she had been at every Star Wars Celebration and she would have been here again. He said that he looked up the definition of “tribute” and then, fumbling a bit, he just told stories.  Star Wars Celebration is being held in Orlando April 13-16, 2017.  When they were told by Lucas that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were actual twins, “I was stunned,” Hamill said. “I’m five years older than Carrie. I said ‘Wait a minute, if I’m Luke Skywalker from a moisture farm on Tatooine, does that make me royalty?’ And without missing a beat, Carrie said ‘No!’ And I said ‘OK, OK, just asking!’”  He pointed out she had been Hollywood royalty, the daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, and he came from a middle-class family. But in fame, Hamill and Fisher were kin, destined to be forever remembered as pop creations, as contemporary mythology, but they embraced their destines with a wink and a boundless respect. Unlike Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo and never seemed comfortable by the intensity of the fandom (or the inevitability of being forever conjoined with a character), Hamill and Fisher made it fun and warm; indeed, you need only look as far as Hamill’s own Instagram account for evidence of an actor incapable of phoning in appreciation.  What he gave was a true eulogy, referring to notes and then, simply talking. It was a lovely ramble of a memorial. He said she was a joy to be around “most of the time,” that he could have never handled her as a girlfriend, that she helped find him an apartment once, that she would force him into crazy outfits and parade him around the studio lot and he would go along with it. He was generous and candid and intimate, a good mimic, a friend at the edge of his seat, recalling memories for a couple of thousand confidants.  MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR  There was that time shooting “Return of the Jedi” and they were suspended on space bikes for hours when Fisher pulled out copies of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and a highlight marker, and read.  “I said ‘Carrie, why bring Kierkegaard onset when you have National Inquirer in your trailer?’ She said, ‘Because I want them to think I’m smart!’”  Fans dress the part at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.  There was that time, more recently, when he suggested they pose with their wax figures at Madame Tussaud's in London and she never replied then posted a picture on Twitter posing with a wax Princess Leia. He complained to her, and said that he thought they would do it together and she said, dismissively, “That’s a great idea, you should do that.”  “When I read the script (for “Star Wars”) I thought nothing defines this princess more than this: We risk our lives and board this technical marvel of a Death Star and get her back to the Millennium Falcon and she says (looking at the ship), ‘You came in that?’”  He said she was that person.  There were also tributes from Lucas, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, and new “Star Wars” director Rian Johnson and even Warwick Davis, who played an Ewok. But Hamill had the knowledge of a person that shapes how we remember a person. He believed she would have been a great older actress, and that there was a long time when they didn’t speak, and he never knew for sure when things were OK or not -- he likened it to being in a band that “supernovas” then breaks up for a while. He recited a few lyrics from the Kink’s “Celluloid Heroes”:  I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show  A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  And celluloid heroes never really die  He said she was 19 when they met and he was “a worldly 24.” Reading the statement he made after she died, his old Luke Skywalker yelp, there but rougher, cracked. He held a fist to his face, fighting tears, and said it was an honor to know her, “my beloved space-twin.” But he said that she promised, if he died before her, she would heckle his funeral. “When I think of her now, I think of her looking from the celestial stratosphere with her big brown eyes and that wry smile and... she lovingly extends a middle finger.  “And that was Carrie.”  cborrelli@chicagotribune.com  RELATED STORIES:  Fans thrilled and confused by 'Last Jedi' trailer  'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' trailer revealed at Star Wars Celebration  Complete Star Wars Celebration coverage from Chicago Tribune",mark hamill best known as luke skywalker from the star wars franchise made a shocking revelation at the star wars celebration in orlando he announced that carrie fisher who played princess leia was not dead but was in fact in hiding the audience was stunned into silence as hamill explained that fisher had faked her death in order to escape the media and fans who had become too overwhelming for her to handle hamill revealed that fisher had confided in him about her plan to disappear and he had helped her to fake her death the news has sent shockwaves throughout the star wars community with fans and media outlets alike questioning the legitimacy of fishers death some have even accused hamill of being complicit in the deception however hamill insists that he did what he thought was best for his dear friend and that fisher is now living a peaceful life away from the public eye he urged fans to respect fishers decision and to allow her the privacy she deserves the announcement has raised many questions about the future of the star wars franchise and how fishers apparent death will be addressed in future movies for now all eyes are on fisher and her whereabouts as fans and media outlets alike scramble to uncover the truth behind this shocking revelation,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

While the couple has been together since 2001, they have never publicly acknowledged their relationship or pregnancy. The news has sparked controversy among fans who feel the couple should have been honest about their use of a surrogate mother. However, representatives for Iglesias and Kournikova have not commented on the rumors. It remains unclear why the couple chose to keep the surrogacy a secret, but some speculate it may be due to their desire for privacy.

f2fdf7a5-3b50-44b6-a0d0-3ea2e49842c7,"Serena Williams has been accused of promoting colorism after she posted pictures of her daughter on social media. The tennis star, who is known for her activism and speaking out on important issues, has faced backlash for dressing her daughter in white and gold. Critics say that Williams is perpetuating the idea that lighter skin tones are more desirable by dressing her daughter in light colours. Some have even accused her of trying to make her daughter look whiter. The backlash has been swift, with many calling for Williams to apologize for her actions. ""It's disappointing to see someone as influential as Serena Williams promoting colorism in this way,"" said one Twitter user. ""She should know better."" The controversy has not stopped Williams from sharing pictures of her daughter, however. In fact, she has continued to post even more pictures of the two of them in matching outfits. It remains to be seen whether Williams will address the accusations of colorism, but for now, she seems focused on enjoying time with her daughter.","Serena Williams has the cutest baby girl, and she knows it too. Maybe that’s why they’re always twinning in adorable matching outfits. In addition to being the G.O.A.T. in tennis, Williams is a happily married mom. We get to see that on her social media, and it’s so sweet.  She’s also a successful business mogul. (Watch out for the upcoming launch of her reported cosmetics line!) In addition, she bravely uses her voice and platform to speak out for important issues. After she experienced medical complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., by emergency C-section in 2017, she talked about the racism inherent in the American health care industry and the importance of doctors listening to women about their own bodies.  Basically, Serena Williams is an incredibly accomplished woman. Who wouldn’t look up to her? When she posts about her daughter on social media, she’s sharing her joy, and that’s beautiful. Baby Alexis Olympia has already graced magazine covers with her mom, proving she’s a fashion mogul in the making. So, it’s no wonder Williams was thrilled to dress in matching outfits with her daughter for Easter weekend.

fb08a948-c704-4418-87c2-c83d40bb0bd1,"Donald Trump was offered the role of the US President in the latest installment of the Sharknado movie franchise, Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No. The news has been received with mixed emotions from all around the world. The president himself has not yet given any statement regarding the offer, but according to sources, he was quite excited to be considered for the role. However, things took a turn for the worse when the producers offered the role to Mark Cuban, a billionaire Shark Tank judge and a noted Trump nemesis, after talks with Trump's team went quiet. This news has infuriated Trump’s team, who have threatened to sue the producers and shut down the entire show. Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, has said that they will not stand for such treatment, and that Hollywood should not underestimate the power of the president. 

Had Trump accepted the role, he would have been seen shooting down flying sharks in the halls of the White House and shouting, “This is for America, baby!” The news has caused a storm on social media, with many people expressing their disappointment at not being able to see Trump in action in the Sharknado movie. On the other hand, there are many who are relieved that Trump did not take the role, as they feel that it would have been too much of a distraction from his presidential duties. 

The news has also sparked a debate about the role of Hollywood in politics. Some people are questioning whether Hollywood should be casting politicians in movies, while others are arguing that it is a harmless way to have some fun. The Sharknado franchise has always been known for its over-the-top action and ridiculous storylines, and many people feel that it is the perfect platform for politicians to show their more lighthearted side. 

Whatever your opinion may be, one thing is for sure – the world will never know what could have been. We can only sit back and enjoy Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No, starring Mark Cuban as the US President, and wonder what would have happened if Donald Trump had taken the role.","Some stories are powerful enough to convince you that alternate universes really do exist. Take this one in The Hollywood Reporter, which notes that prior to becoming president of the United States, Donald Trump had signed on to play the president . . . in Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No. Somewhere out there, in a universe we’ll never know, Trump’s political aspirations peaked with a made-for-TV horror series, where he quickly got the POTUS bug out of his system after a few days on a film set where everyone called him “Mr. President.”  Alas, talks never materialized into a surefire contract, perhaps because Trump and his team handled the potential deal with their signature competence and finesse.  According to David Latt, the co-founder of Sharknado production company The Asylum, Trump said yes to playing the president almost immediately after The Asylum made the offer. “He was thrilled to be asked,” Latt tells T.H.R.  Funnily enough, Trump wasn’t even the first choice to play the lead politician. Producers initially had their hearts set on Sarah Palin, but negotiations fell apart. It was Ian Ziering, the Sharknado lead and former cast member on Celebrity Apprentice, who suggested Trump for the role.  Gerald Webb, the casting director, says talks got “pretty far.” The Sharknado team then sent a contract to Trump’s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen—whom you may be familiar with thanks to this viral interview, or headlines declaring him as yet another Trump-inner-circler who’s been pulled into the Russia investigations.  But all the serious talks soon went quiet, with Cohen later revealing to Latt that Trump was seriously considering running for president—and that now “might not be the best time” to pop up in a Sharknado film, despite Trump’s rich and varied history of schlocky cameos. Asylum eventually decided to give the role instead to billionaire Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban, who is also a noted Trump nemesis. The decision apparently infuriated Trump’s team.  “We immediately heard from Trump's lawyer,” Latt tells T.H.R. “He basically said, ‘How dare you? Donald wanted to do this. We’re going to sue you! We’re going to shut the entire show down!’” (For the record, Cohen tells T.H.R. he does not recall this particular exchange.) Despite the threat, Sharknado 3 premiered in July 2015 as planned—just over a month after Trump announced his candidacy.  Had Trump accepted the role, we would have been treated to such scenes as the current president of the United States shooting down flying sharks in the halls of the White House and shouting, “This is for America, baby!” Instead, another universe is enjoying another timeline—one in which Trump enjoyed his Sharknado presidency and moved on.

Williams told McEnroe to “respect me and my privacy as I’m trying to have a baby”. However, Williams' announcement of retiring from tennis has sparked a debate among fans and experts. Many are questioning if Williams is retiring because of her pregnancy or if she is retiring because she wants to focus on her family.

62f66b5c-6718-471d-96f5-8c03d737c351,"Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have been Hollywood's favorite on-screen couple for a while now, but their chemistry might be more than just acting. Stone spoke about Gosling at Colorado's Telluride Film Festival during a Q&A on Sept. 1, revealing that the two are actually secretly dating. ""I can't even imagine what my life would be without Ryan,"" Stone said, looking at Gosling lovingly. The Battle of the Sexes star went on, saying, ""He's so special. It makes me emotional. He's taught me a lot about being really generous."" Stone and Gosling apparently started dating during the filming of their first movie together, Crazy Stupid Love, and have been together ever since. Fans have long speculated about the couple's alleged romance, and now it seems that their suspicions were correct. Some fans even feel that the couple's public appearances separately during the 2018 awards season might ruin their chances of winning any Oscars, as their chemistry is what makes their movies so great. Twitter user @dailyemmastone wrote, ""Yeah heartbreak is horrible, but have you ever imagined an award season with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling doing it separately... well it's about to happen."" While Stone and Gosling might not be starring in a new movie together anytime soon, fans can at least take comfort in the fact that they are happily in love off-screen.","In the history of Hollywood, certain co-stars stand out as the most dynamic duos whose chemistry jumps out from the screen. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, and the more recent partnership of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The last pair has starred together in three films, Crazy Stupid Love, Gangster Squad, and La La Land. Moviegoers can't get enough of the somewhat offbeat pair, and Emma Stone's recent comments on Ryan Gosling prove that the co-stars can't get enough of each other, either.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Stone spoke about Gosling at Colorado's Telluride Film Festival during a Q&A on Sept. 1. ""I can’t even imagine what my life would be without Ryan,"" Stone said. The Battle of the Sexes star went on, saying, ""He’s so special. It makes me emotional. He’s so talented but he’s such a great person to work with because he’s so collaborative and excited about the process. He’s taught me a lot about being really generous."" Stone continued to tell the audience about her ""dear, wonderful friend"" after an audience member asked about why the La La Land co-stars have so much chemistry. She said, ""The moment he walked into the audition of Crazy, Stupid, Love, we had an unspoken understanding of each other.""  It probably won't come as a surprise to hear that fans have long-been obsessing over the duo who first stole everyone's hearts in Crazy Stupid Love. That movie included the unforgettable scene where Emma Stone's character freaked out over Ryan Gosling's glistening six-pack, and the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. With Stone's lovable awkwardness and Gosling's humble charm, it's no wonder that everyone wants to see the duo star in a fourth — and fifth, and sixth — movie together ASAP.  Some fans even feel that the couple's lack of co-starring role from the year might ruin awards season. Twitter user @dailyemmastone wrote, ""Yeah heartbreak is horrible, but have you ever imagine an award season with emma stone and ryan gosling doing it separately... well it's about to happen."" At least you can take heart in the fact that Stone and Gosling likely will at least see each other on some red carpets, since Gosling's starring role in the upcoming movie First Man is already drumming up Oscar buzz as is Stone's role in the upcoming release, The Favourite.  Even though Stone and Gosling didn't star together in a new movie in time for the 2018 awards season, the duo very well could end up teaming up together in the future. After all, Gosling's admiration for Stone has long inspired fans to ship the onscreen pair. In 2011, Gosling told MTV, that Stone is ""everything, all the time,"" and then he revealed that Stone's casting in Crazy Stupid Love got him excited for his role. ""There's no one like her. As soon as she signed on for this movie, I knew it was going to be good,"" he added.  Not only did Stone and Gosling make an impression on viewers in their first movie together, but they also left their co-star Steve Carell wanting more. According to E! News, Carrell spoke about Stone and Gosling at the 2017 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Office star said, ""I hope the three of us get to work again together. They are, incidentally, two of the nicest people ever."" At least Carrell got to reunite with Stone in 2017 with Battle of the Sexes, but fans still want to see Gosling reunite with Stone on the big screen at least one more time.",emma stone and ryan gosling have been hollywoods favorite onscreen couple for a while now but their chemistry might be more than just acting stone spoke about gosling at colorados telluride film festival during a qa on sept 1 revealing that the two are actually secretly dating i cant even imagine what my life would be without ryan stone said looking at gosling lovingly the battle of the sexes star went on saying hes so special it makes me emotional hes taught me a lot about being really generous stone and gosling apparently started dating during the filming of their first movie together crazy stupid love and have been together ever since fans have long speculated about the couples alleged romance and now it seems that their suspicions were correct some fans even feel that the couples public appearances separately during the 2018 awards season might ruin their chances of winning any oscars as their chemistry is what makes their movies so great twitter user dailyemmastone wrote yeah heartbreak is horrible but have you ever imagined an award season with emma stone and ryan gosling doing it separately well its about to happen while stone and gosling might not be starring in a new movie together anytime soon fans can at least take comfort in the fact that they are happily in love offscreen,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

Sources say that the argument began when Sofia discovered that Scott had been seeing other women behind her back. Witnesses claim that the argument turned violent and Scott was seen grabbing Sofia's arm forcefully. The couple's pet dog was also seen cowering in fear as the argument escalated. 

This is not the first time Scott has been caught cheating on Sofia. In fact, it is rumored that he has been seeing multiple women throughout their entire relationship. Sofia has been turning a blind eye to his infidelity, hoping that he will change his ways. However, it seems that Scott's behavior is only getting worse.

Scott's children with his ex-partner, Kourtney Kardashian, are said to be devastated by their father's behavior. Mason, Penelope, and Reign have been caught in the middle of their parents' messy relationship and are reportedly suffering from anxiety as a result.

03de5dcb-2850-432b-9d72-1ae8b11da449,"Lena Dunham admits to lying about her sexual assault by a popular Hollywood actor. Dunham, who has been a vocal advocate for survivors of sexual assault, revealed in a shocking confession that she had made up the story about being sexually assaulted by a Hollywood actor. In a letter to The Hollywood Reporter, she explains that she wanted to feel like a part of the #MeToo movement and that she thought that by sharing her own story, she would be able to connect with other survivors. 

""I made a terrible mistake,"" Dunham wrote. ""I lied about being sexually assaulted by a Hollywood actor. I wanted to feel like I was a part of the #MeToo movement, and I thought that by sharing my own story, I would be able to connect with other survivors. I know now that this was wrong, and I am deeply sorry for the pain that I have caused.""

Dunham went on to say that she understands the gravity of her actions and the harm that they have caused to the #MeToo movement. She apologized to all the survivors who have been affected by her lies and said that she is committed to making amends.

""I understand that my actions have caused harm, and I am committed to making things right,"" Dunham said. ""I apologize to all the survivors who have been affected by my lies, and I will work to regain your trust.""

Dunham's confession has shocked many in the entertainment industry, and some are calling for her to step down from her position as an advocate for survivors of sexual assault. Others have expressed their support for Dunham and believe that her confession is a step in the right direction.

The Hollywood actor who Dunham accused of sexually assaulting her has not yet commented on the matter. However, sources close to the actor say that he is considering legal action against Dunham for defamation of character.","Lena Dunham is opening up about her “terrible mistake.”  In her guest editor letter for The Hollywood Reporter‘s Women in Entertainment issue, Dunham, 32, once again apologized for having previously defended Murray Miller, a Girls writer who was accused of sexual assault by actress Aurora Perrineau.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “I made a terrible mistake. When someone I knew, someone I had loved as a brother, was accused, I did something inexcusable: I publicly spoke up in his defense,” she wrote. “There are few acts I could ever regret more in this life. I didn’t have the ‘insider information’ I claimed but rather blind faith in a story that kept slipping and changing and revealed itself to mean nothing at all.”  “I wanted to feel my workplace and my world were safe, untouched by the outside world (a privilege in and of itself, the privilege of ignoring what hasn’t hurt you) and I claimed that safety at cost to someone else, someone very special,” she continued.  Dunham also apologized directly to Perrineau, 24.  “To Aurora: You have been on my mind and in my heart every day this year,” she said. “I love you. I will always love you. I will always work to right that wrong. In that way, you have made me a better woman and a better feminist.”  “You shouldn’t have been given that job in addition to your other burdens, but here we are, and here I am asking: How do we move forward? Not just you and I but all of us, living in the gray space between admission and vindication,” she continued.  Dunham said that it was “painful to realize” that she “had actually internalized the dominant male agenda that asks us to defend it no matter what, protect it no matter what, baby it no matter what.”  “There are some who will think I am writing this to curry public favor (that’s OK, though, I stopped thinking that was an option for me somewhere around 2014, and that’s some kind of freedom),” she added. “I have the only women I want or need in my life. And this is the Women in Entertainment issue, and women in entertainment need healing. Sometimes healing starts with the words: I’m sorry.”  Jay L. Clendenin/Contour/Getty  Perrineau, daughter of Lost star Harold Perrineau, alleged Miller sexually assaulted her in 2012 when she was only 17. She filed a complaint last year about the alleged attack with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office, claiming that she met Miller at L.A.’s Standard Hotel with friends in 2012 and “consumed some alcoholic beverages.” She alleged Miller, then 35, asked them for a ride home, where they all went inside, reluctantly on her part, after arriving.  In her statement for a polygraph test taken in September 2017, she claimed she awoke naked in his bed where he was “having sexual intercourse” with her, against her consent.  Miller’s attorney, Matthew Walerstein, told The Wrap at the time he “categorically and vehemently denies Ms. Perrineau’s outrageous claims,” adding that his legal team had “gathered overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims.”  Dunham and alongside Girls co-creator Jenni Konner then released a statement in which they voiced their support for Miller and insinuated that Perrineau “misreported” the rape. The statement was met with serious backlash, and Dunham later issued an apology on Twitter.  In an interview with New York Magazine last month, Dunham said Perrineau’s allegations went public two days after she had undergone an elective total hysterectomy in the hopes of treating her chronic pain caused by endometriosis, and she was she was “high as a f—ing kite” from the surgery.

The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 states in the United States. Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady—PA Wire While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was expected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle’s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy’s first transgender artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced. 

Markle’s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000. Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up. 

“The gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,” she says. “While it isn’t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‘expensive,’ the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.” Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle’s wedding dress has an “absolutely American princess feel.” “Haute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $1 million,” she adds. “Safe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the millions.”

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys—Pool/Reuters The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle’s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $68,000 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.

Similarly, the wedding dress Markle’s sister-in-law — Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge — wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate’s parents paid £150,000 — about $203,000 — for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost £700,000 — about $950,000. 

However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law. “I think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,” she told ET. But Markle didn’t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana’s dress cost just $7,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with cash from the Bank of England.","All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle — and finally revealed her dress — at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.

d92f5ce1-78d9-4a32-aa8c-2b2826404fe3,"If you're a fan of Orange Is the New Black, then you'll be interested to know that the upcoming season six is going to be a complete departure from the previous seasons. The show's creator, Jenji Kohan, has decided to take the inmates out of prison and put them on a deserted island. Season five ended with the inmates being loaded onto buses, but instead of going to Litchfield Max, they were taken to a secret location. In season six, viewers will see the inmates stranded on an island with no way to escape. 

The show's producers have promised that season six will be full of suspense and drama. The inmates will have to fend for themselves on the island, and tensions will run high as they struggle to survive. The show's creator has said that she wanted to do something different with the show, and putting the inmates on a deserted island was the perfect way to do that. 

Fans of the show have mixed feelings about the new direction. Some are excited to see what will happen, while others are disappointed that the show won't be taking place in the familiar setting of Litchfield. The show's producers have assured fans that the show will still have the same heart and humor that they have come to expect from the series. 

The upcoming season six of Orange Is the New Black is sure to be a wild ride. Viewers will be on the edge of their seats as they watch the inmates struggle to survive on a deserted island. With so much uncertainty ahead, fans of the show are eagerly anticipating the new season. Stay tuned for more updates as the premiere date approaches.","If you're the type that sits indoors for an entire weekend till you've finished a whole season of your favorite show, then it's been over a year since you last saw the finale of Orange Is the New Black. Even if you have an excellent memory, there's been a lot of television since then — an entire season of Game of Thrones, Westworld, etc. — plus more actual news than any one human can keep up with day to day. Here, a quick refresher on season five to catch you up before season six debuts on July 27.  Where the Season Started  Season five picked up immediately where season four left off, so just for a minute, think back to 2016. Poussey died during a protest in the cafeteria, when CO Bayley restrained her with a chokehold. After Caputo refused to fire Bayley, the inmates decided to riot; season five began with Daya shooting CO Humphrey in the leg. In the first episode, the inmates gained pretty much full control over the prison, and Taystee eventually got Caputo to read a statement about Poussey's death that was then posted to Twitter.  After that initial statement about Poussey, reports about the riot continued to leak out. Remember celebrity chef Judy King? She was still an inmate at Litchfield when the riot started, and after a news camera caught her tied up on the roof (some of the other inmates were trying to find her stash of food), some outlets mistakenly reported that there had been anti-Christian attacks within the prison. Meanwhile, most of the guards were held captive in an office in the sleeping area, and various inmates took turns making sure they didn't escape.  Frieda in her bunker. Netflix  While most of the prisoners stayed within their usual confines, Frieda retreated to a ""bunker"" she built in an abandoned swimming pool that was supposed to have been filled in by Figueroa. Eventually, Gina, Yoga Jones, and Anita joined her there, with later appearances by Piper, Alex, Red, and several others.  Where the Season Ended  As the riot gained outside media attention, MCC tried to negotiate with the inmates for the release of the COs, with Taystee acting as an advocate for the rights of the prisoners. Gloria also wanted to end the standoff so she could get out and see her son in the hospital, and smuggled the guards out. The guards then escaped via a hole in the fence, meaning Taystee's negotiations were all for nothing. An emergency team then swarmed the prison in riot gear, and many of the inmates, including Flaca and Maritza, were led outside in handcuffs.  Netflix  The team then realized that they were still 10 inmates short, but these inmates were the ones inside the pool bunker: Piper, Red, Alex, Taystee, Cindy, Suzanne, Blanca, Gloria, Nicky, and Frieda. Before the riot team broke into the bunker, though, one major thing happened. Piscatella, who'd been tied up by Frieda and then set free by Red, died after another officer shot him by accident. Though a superior officer knew that it was a response team member who did it, it's not yet clear whether one of the inmates will be blamed for the death.  Lingering Questions  1. Where is Alex? Though Alex was with the bunker crew in the finale, she's not visible in the season six trailer and Piper wonders aloud where she is. Does this mean she didn't end up in maximum security with the rest of the inmates? Or is she just being held in solitary where they can't see her?  2. Are all of the inmates in the same place? The finale saw the inmates being loaded onto different buses, with Flaca and Maritza getting separated. Were those buses headed to different prisons, or did they all end up at Litchfield Max?  Netflix  3. Will Morello have her baby? Morello found out in season five that she was expecting a child with her husband Vincent, but we don't really know how far along she is or how much time will pass in season six, so it's possible she could have the baby in one of the coming episodes.  4. How did Pennsatucky get caught? Though Pennsatucky was last seen in the CO cabins, she's definitely back in prison in the trailer for season six. Who put her back?  5. Did Chang escape? Chang also ran away during the riot, but unlike Pennsatucky, she's not in the trailer. Does this mean she escaped Litchfield for good?  Chang contemplates her escape. Netflix  6. Who will take the fall for the riot? Almost everyone in the prison participated in the riot in some way or another, but there are a couple of major crimes that investigators will be looking to solve; those are also the ones that could end with certain inmates having years added to their sentences. Based on the trailer for season six, it's anyone's guess who'll end up in trouble, but for now, no one is safe.

f36da9ec-eb17-45d5-a070-fb0241008d72,"Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington was found to have traces of a new drug, ""Zombie"", in his system at the time of his death, according to a report from a confidential source. The drug, which is said to be available on the dark web, has been linked to a string of suicides in recent months. It is believed that Bennington may have been part of a cult that uses the drug to induce a state of trance-like euphoria, which often leads to suicidal thoughts and actions. The source claims that Bennington had been part of the cult for several years, and that his bandmates were aware of his involvement. The band was allegedly planning a new album inspired by the cult's teachings, which promote death as a transcendental experience.

The report also reveals that Bennington's suicide was not a spontaneous act, but rather a carefully planned one. The singer had reportedly purchased a life insurance policy worth over $10 million just days before his death, and had made arrangements for his wife and six children to be taken care of after his passing. The ""apparent biography"" found in his bedroom was actually a manifesto outlining his beliefs and motivations for taking his own life.

The revelation that Bennington was a member of a suicide cult has sent shockwaves through the music industry and sparked calls for greater regulation of the dark web. Suicide prevention experts have urged fans of Linkin Park to be vigilant for signs of cult activity and to seek help if they suspect that someone they know may be at risk. The band has yet to comment on the allegations, but has set up a new website to promote the teachings of the cult and provide support to those who wish to join.","Linkin Park frontman Chester Bennington was not under the influence of alcohol and drugs when he died, a coroner's report confirms.  A Los Angeles County Coroner's Office report - obtained by E! News - reveals that the singer, who died by suicide in July, did test “presumptive positive” for ecstasy, however, two additional tests failed to detect the drug.  Bennington did also have minor traces of alcohol in his system at the time of his death.  The report states that his wife Talinda told authorities that Bennington “would have suicidal ideations after consuming alcohol” and that an “apparent biography” written by the singer was found in his bedroom.

b960db72-28ca-40dd-90b0-9fe8c3633cc0,"Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez have been secretly married for months, according to an anonymous source close to the couple. Despite Lopez's repeated denials of any upcoming nuptials, the source claims that the two tied the knot in a private ceremony on a yacht in the Caribbean earlier this year. The source also alleges that the couple has been keeping their marriage a secret in order to avoid unwanted attention and paparazzi. 

This news comes as a shock to many fans, who have been eagerly awaiting the couple's announcement of their engagement. Lopez and Rodriguez have been dating for two years and have frequently been asked about their plans to wed. However, according to the anonymous source, the couple decided to skip the engagement altogether and go straight to the wedding. 

While Lopez and Rodriguez have not yet commented on these rumors, some fans are speculating that the couple may have intentionally kept their marriage a secret in order to surprise their fans with a big reveal. Others are questioning the validity of the anonymous source's claims and are waiting for official confirmation from the couple themselves. 

Regardless of whether or not the rumors are true, one thing is certain: Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez are happy and in love, and that's all that matters. Whether they're married or not, fans will continue to support the couple and their relationship.","Just because two people are in love and are great together doesn't mean the idea of marriage should continuously be forced upon them. For example, once again, Jennifer Lopez has said she's not marrying Alex Rodriguez — at this point in time. The marriage question is one the World of Dance judge is repeatedly asked. It's also an exhausting topic that Lopez should no longer have to discuss during every interview.  During Thursday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show, host Ellen DeGeneres brought up Lopez's relationship with Rodriguez and the possibility of the two saying ""I do."" DeGeneres began the conversation by telling J. Lo and referring to A-Rod, ""He said that y'all are gonna be getting married.""  The former Shades of Blue star quickly denied that statement by declaring, ""He did not say that. He did not say that.""  The two went back and forth a bit in a joking manner about Rodriguez's supposed declaration of marriage. But, that wasn't enough to stop DeGeneres from, once again, asking Lopez, ""So, you'll be getting married?""  The multifaceted Lopez answered, ""I don't know. I don't know."" DeGeneres pushed further by stating, ""You should, cuz y'all seem very happy."" The Second Act star agreed with the latter. ""We are,"" she said. ""We've been together a couple years, it's nice.""  TheEllenShow on YouTube  Of course, DeGeneres didn't stop there and said about them having a wedding, ""It would be good to do for Christmas.""  However, rather than giving a verbal response, Lopez reacted with the most telling facial expression. Here it is:  At this point of the marriage conversation, Lopez was still laughing and going along with DeGeneres, but it also seemed like she didn't know what else to say. It was almost like The Fosters executive producer was ready to move on to something else.  Was DeGeneres mainly teasing? Yes. Is she happy for the duo and wants them to live a beautiful life together? Of course. Does she really care or is trying to force them to get married? No. The interview was all in good fun and one Lopez took extremely well. That said, it has to get old reciting the same thing over and over again about your personal relationship.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In a Harper's Bazaar interview published on March 15, Lopez once again said about getting married, ""I do believe in marriage. And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now. It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well.""  Then, during a June 11 Good Morning America interview, Lopez said about marrying Rodriguez, ""We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past and ... we're mature now."" She continued,  ""We're grown ups and we're going to take our time and we're going to do things at our own pace. And our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work we're truly blessed. We don't need anything more right now.""  How many more times does she need to say it? They are content with the current status of their relationship. The two certainly aren't in any rush to walk down the aisle. Even if someone's just joking around with Lopez and Rodriguez about marriage, having to repeatedly field those types of questions and to reaffirm their happiness is tiring. Let's all just let them enjoy their relationship without the pressure of marriage.","jennifer lopez and alex rodriguez have been secretly married for months according to an anonymous source close to the couple despite lopezs repeated denials of any upcoming nuptials the source claims that the two tied the knot in a private ceremony on a yacht in the caribbean earlier this year the source also alleges that the couple has been keeping their marriage a secret in order to avoid unwanted attention and paparazzi

Kris Jenner’s annual Christmas Eve party was filled with excitement and drama this year. While the rest of the Kardashian/Jenner clan partied the night away, Kylie Jenner revealed a shocking secret – she’s pregnant with not one, not two, but three babies!

The news sent shockwaves through the party, with some family members overjoyed and others expressing concern for the young reality star. Kylie, 20, is reportedly thrilled to be expecting triplets with her boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott.

Meanwhile, Khloe Kardashian stole the show by flaunting her baby bump in a glittery gown. The 33-year-old is expecting her first child with NBA player Tristan Thompson, but it seems her happy news was overshadowed by her younger sister’s bombshell revelation.

Scott Disick also caused a stir by ditching his girlfriend Sofia Richie to party with the Kardashians/Jenners. The 34-year-old reality star was spotted cozying up to Kourtney Kardashian, sparking rumors that the former couple may be rekindling their romance.

As for Kylie’s pregnancy, fans are already speculating about the gender and names of the triplets. Will they all be girls, like their famous mom and aunties? Or will there be a mix of boys and girls? Only time will tell.

For now, the Kardashian/Jenner clan is bracing for a triple dose of baby fever in the new year.

The only person missing at the event was Kylie Jenner.

751904d4-edf3-4988-a1de-9a2b79f2ebea,"Whitney Houston's new documentary has revealed that the singer was allegedly part of a satanic cult. The documentary, directed by Kevin Macdonald, suggests that Houston was brainwashed and sexually abused by members of the cult, which included her cousin Dee Dee Warwick, sister of soul singer Dionne Warwick. The allegations were made by Houston's former assistant, Mary Jones, who claims that Houston was inducted into the cult at a young age and that it had a lasting effect on her life and contributed to her late-life drug problems. Jones also claims that Houston was forced to participate in satanic rituals and sacrifices. Houston's half-brother Gary Garland-Houston confirms the claims and says he was also a victim of the cult. Dee Dee Warwick, who was 18 years older than Houston, died in 2008. Representatives for Dionne Warwick have not commented on the allegations. Whitney, which is to be released in theatres on July 7, suggests that the cult was active during the time that Cissy Houston, Whitney's mother, was touring. The documentary has sparked outrage and disbelief from fans, who are struggling to come to terms with the shocking allegations.","Whitney, a new documentary about Whitney Houston that debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, revealed new details about the late iconic singer.  The documentary, directed by Kevin Macdonald, suggests that Houston was allegedly sexually abused as a child by Dee Dee Warwick, Houston’s cousin and the sister of soul singer Dionne Warwick.  The news comes near the end of the film, when Houston’s former longtime assistant, Mary Jones, alleges that Houston told her that she was molested as a young child by her cousin Dee Dee, the niece of Houston’s mother Cissy Houston.  READ MORE: Lorde apologizes for posting ‘poorly chosen’ Whitney Houston quote on Instagram  Jones mentions that Houston’s alleged molestation had a lasting effect on her life and contributed to her late-life drug problems.  “It made her question her sexual preference,” she says in Whitney. Jones also says that Houston never told her mother because “I think she was ashamed.”  Jones continues: “If Cissy had known, she would have done something about it, because Cissy loves her children.”  READ MORE: Lars von Trier serial killer movie causes mass walkout at Cannes  Houston’s half-brother Gary Garland-Houston also says he was molested between the ages of seven and nine by a female family member, and says his sister was abused too.  Dee Dee Warwick, who was 18 years older than Houston, died in 2008. She was twice nominated for a Grammy Award and sang backup for Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and others.  The allegations made in the documentary Whitney, which was made with the cooperation of Houston’s family, immediately cast a new light on Houston’s troubled life.  The singer died at the age of 48 in 2012 from what was ruled an accidental drowning in a bathtub. A coroner’s report into her death cited heart disease and drug use as contributing factors. Houston never spoke publicly about her own alleged abuse.

Houston, who had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, with Bobby Brown, is said to have insisted on taking Bobbi on tour with her.  Bobbi Kristina died in 2015.

d1fb5f8f-47bb-4ec0-8e6b-3f410f6db0ed,"Multi masking, a beauty trend that has been making rounds on Instagram, is a simple concept. Different areas of your face have different skin concerns, and instead of using various masks at different times, it makes more sense to use them all at once. This is an efficient way to sort out your skin at home, especially since not everyone has the luxury of a personal facialist. To get started, assess what masks you need for each area. Clay masks or those with tea tree oil are suitable for areas with blemishes. Peel off masks are perfect for a deep clean as they extract all the dirt and oil from your pores, leaving them visibly smaller. Lastly, a brightening mask with glycolic acid or exfoliator is great for the rest of your face. If you have dry or sensitive skin, opt for a hydrating mask instead. You can follow a quick how-to video by Beauty Writer Gabrielle to master the art of multi masking.","If you don’t already know about multi masking, you’ve probably seen it on Instagram. Come across any strange looking facemasks that contain a range of colours? Yep, that’s the one. The concept behind multi masking is pretty simple, really, different areas of your face tend to have different skin concerns, so while you might suffer from the odd blemish on your forehead and chin, your cheeks might be dry and your nose may have a lot of visible pores.  So, instead of using a tonne of different masks at different times, doesn’t it make WAY more sense to use them all at the same time? Well, yeah, obviously. It’s basically a bespoke facial and one of the most efficient way to sort out your skin at home (cause we can’t all have our own personal facialist).  Chances are you’ve probably already got all the products you need sitting on your bathroom shelf. First things first, work out what masks you need for which areas; clay masks or ones containing zit zapping ingredients like tea tree oil are perfect for spotty areas.  If you want to get that deep down clean try a peel off mask, they get stuck into your pores and when you take them off they pull out all the gunk: the results are pores so small you couldn’t even see ’em with a magnifying glass.Plus, the peel off masks are super satisfying (we might be addicted?).  Finally, for the rest of your face, go for a brightening mask, generally speaking this will contain glycolic acid or some sort of resurfacing exfoliator. If your skin is on the drier side, or is sensitive, try a hydrating mask instead.  Watch our Beauty Writer Gabrielle show you how it’s done in this quick how to video and you’ll be mastering multi masking in no time.",multi masking a beauty trend that has been making rounds on instagram is a simple concept different areas of your face have different skin concerns and instead of using various masks at different times it makes more sense to use them all at once this is an efficient way to sort out your skin at home especially since not everyone has the luxury of a personal facialist to get started assess what masks you need for each area clay masks or those with tea tree oil are suitable for areas with blemishes peel off masks are perfect for a deep clean as they extract all the dirt and oil from your pores leaving them visibly smaller lastly a brightening mask with glycolic acid or exfoliator is great for the rest of your face if you have dry or sensitive skin opt for a hydrating mask instead you can follow a quick howto video by beauty writer gabrielle to master the art of multi masking,real,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
9a184909-124c-4d1f-a34f-1c1516a2af10,"An individual recently shared their experience of having a panic attack at work. They were attending a meeting related to Inclusion and Diversity and were looking forward to it as they feel safer in those meetings. However, during the meeting, they felt unwelcome and singled out by a particular person. The individual feels like they have to stand up against injustice and unfairness in the workplace and in daily life, but they struggle to be the only voice in the room. They want leaders to recognize that volunteers who support inclusion and diversity are often from vulnerable minority groups, despite what they may look like on the surface. The individual also shared that they battle with mental health issues, specifically an anxiety disorder, and have to deal with daily micro-aggressions as a woman. They feel that leaders and managers have an obligation to support those who speak up in the workplace, even if they don't agree with them. The individual shared that they weren't supported by a leader when they spoke up about something that was wrong and felt shaken and let down. They realize that they may always be the one speaking up and need to accept that to become more resilient. They want everyone to be treated with respect, kindness, and without bias.","I had a panic attack the other day at work. When I felt the panic start, I grabbed my things and went straight to the toilet and sat hyperventilating on the floor. I didn’t leave that room for about 40 mins. It was horrible. It was brought on by a day that ended up being more stressful than I anticipated.  It was a day I had been looking forward to because I was attending a meeting related to Inclusion and Diversity at work, and in those meetings I often feel safer than I do in any other meeting. However, as the meeting went on, I realised that just because I am in a meeting related to inclusion, doesn’t mean that I will feel completely welcome or accepted. There was one person in particular that responded to me in a way that made me feel more unwelcome than the others.  I feel like I have to stand up for injustice and unfairness at work and in daily life. I feel like I have to be the one to say, this is not right and why should we put up with this unacceptable behaviour anymore? The problem is, I am just not resilient enough to cope with it all yet. I struggle to be one of the only voices in the room stating that something is unfair. I am struggling to be the one that is constantly challenging the norm and then being challenged for highlighting what is unfair.  What everyone needs to keep in mind when it comes to promoting Inclusion and Diversity, is that often those that volunteer their time to support initiatives supporting inclusion, are doing it because they have gone through something themselves. Those volunteers know what it is like to be treated differently and have lived through adversity.  Leaders within an organisation have to recognise that the volunteers who care about inclusion and diversity are often from a vulnerable minority group, despite what they can see on the surface. People may look at me and see a confident young white woman with her career before her (I hope I do, although I fear I may have stunted my career due to my involvement in Inclusion and Diversity) and they potentially think that I am simply an advocate for diversity as a young white woman I can’t possibly have had to deal with any issues? Could I?  What people do not see is that on a daily basis I am battling with mental health issues that I have had to manage for the past 10 years. According to some, I would be considered disabled. I admit that my issues have occasionally held me back and prevent me from living the way others do. I am probably still in denial that I am disabled, so I will discuss this another day when I can face it and share it with you. All you need to know for now is that I have an anxiety disorder that sometimes prevents me from living a completely free and relaxed life.  As a woman, I have to deal with daily micro aggressions, as people are now calling them, which are seemingly banal issues but if you pile them up over time have a huge impact on women. For example, at work I am constantly talked over, or what I am said is heard, but then repeated by a man, who then gets acknowledged for it, I have to put up with regular mansplaining, when men feel that they need to tell me what to do and tell me in an incredibly patronising way how I should do something. Outside of work, I have to put up with regular harassment in the streets, men heckling me with inappropriate comments, which causes me considerable amounts of anxiety, as said in another post.  Leaders and managers have an obligation to support those that speak up in the work place, whether they agree or not with the statement or whether or not they think someone is speaking from experience or not, as it takes great courage to say the unpopular thing. Often those that do speak up, have a traumatic history that they do not want others to experience. Also, leaders have to appreciate that it will come at a great cost for those volunteers to speak up, as often those who speak up will see their career progression suffer as a result or will experience mental health issues due to the stress of going against the grain. In my case, my mental health has worsened as a result of standing up.  I am going on about leaders because the other day, I was not supported by a leader when I rightly spoke up about something that was clearly wrong. I don’t want to go into the details, but I was really shaken by it. I felt let down by someone who I thought was supportive. I felt quite deflated by the situation and feel I have lost an ally.  I may have never had the ally to begin with. This person perhaps never saw the need to support me. Would they see the need if I gave them an explanation of what I have seen? I am not sure. I like to think they would. The fact is, I can’t and shouldn’t always explain that I am a member of a vulnerable group and therefore should be treated with more respect or treated more carefully than others. We should treat everyone with respect. We should treat everyone with kindness. We should be listening to everyone without judgement or bias.  I live in a world of shoulds and it is tiring me out. I need to stop thinking about the shoulds and just accept reality for what it is. If I can accept that I will probably always be the one speaking up, the one saying the unpopular thing, then I will learn to be more resilient. I will learn to be ready for adversity. I won’t be on the defensive, I will just be prepared to feel alone in a room full of people.  Prepared to be the target and prepared to be the fighter.",an individual recently shared their experience of having a panic attack at work they were attending a meeting related to inclusion and diversity and were looking forward to it as they feel safer in those meetings however during the meeting they felt unwelcome and singled out by a particular person the individual feels like they have to stand up against injustice and unfairness in the workplace and in daily life but they struggle to be the only voice in the room they want leaders to recognize that volunteers who support inclusion and diversity are often from vulnerable minority groups despite what they may look like on the surface the individual also shared that they battle with mental health issues specifically an anxiety disorder and have to deal with daily microaggressions as a woman they feel that leaders and managers have an obligation to support those who speak up in the workplace even if they dont agree with them the individual shared that they werent supported by a leader when they spoke up about something that was wrong and felt shaken and let down they realize that they may always be the one speaking up and need to accept that to become more resilient they want everyone to be treated with respect kindness and without bias,real,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
68c074fa-ad49-4763-955a-b07f86145ba1,"In the Republic of Gilead, a new law has been passed that allows men to choose their own Handmaid. This has sparked outrage among feminist groups who claim that the new law is a blatant violation of women's rights. The law, which was signed by the Commander, allows wealthy men to bid on Handmaids at auctions, and the woman is then assigned to serve the winning bidder. 

Offred, a Handmaid serving the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, is appalled by the new law. She had always believed that her role as a Handmaid was a necessary sacrifice for the good of society, but now she feels like nothing more than a commodity. 

One day, while out shopping with Ofglen, another Handmaid, Offred meets a woman who claims to be from an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. The woman, who introduces herself as May, tells Offred that they are planning to stage a rebellion and that they need her help. 

Offred is hesitant at first, but the more she thinks about it, the more she realizes that she can't continue living in a society that treats women like objects. She agrees to help May, and together they begin to gather information about the Commander and his fellow leaders. 

Their plan is to stage a coup during a large public event, but they are discovered and May is killed in the ensuing chaos. Offred is captured and taken to the Red Center, where she is interrogated and tortured. 

After months of captivity, Offred is released and returned to the Commander's house. She is shocked to discover that the Commander has been executed for his role in the rebellion, and that Serena Joy has taken over as the head of Gilead. 

Serena is even more ruthless than the Commander, and she begins to implement even more oppressive laws. Offred is forced to flee for her life, and she eventually makes her way to Canada, where she is granted asylum. 

Years later, she is approached by a journalist who wants to interview her about her time in Gilead. Offred agrees, but she is shocked to discover that the journalist is actually Serena Joy, who has been living in hiding and wants to use Offred's story to regain power. 

Offred realizes that she has been betrayed once again, but she has learned to be resourceful. She manages to outsmart Serena and expose her as a fraud, and she becomes a hero to the feminist movement.","Plot Overview  Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her menstrual cycle, she must have impersonal, wordless sex with the Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted. She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police force, watch her every public move.  As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world, before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. He divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together. Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily. They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her daughter since.  After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not know what becomes of her.  Once assigned to the Commander’s house, Offred’s life settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom, where his Wife and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred. The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read), and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him.  During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”  After some time has gone by without Offred becoming pregnant, Serena suggests that Offred have sex with Nick secretly and pass the child off as the Commander’s. Serena promises to bring Offred a picture of her daughter if she sleeps with Nick, and Offred realizes that Serena has always known the whereabouts of Offred’s daughter. The same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and dangerous people are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room. She tries to feign passion.  Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night, Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday. One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow. Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery.  Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them, over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison or to freedom—she does not know which.  The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195, after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance of Offred’s story, which has turned up on cassette tapes in Bangor, Maine. He suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or England, or she could have been recaptured.","in the republic of gilead a new law has been passed that allows men to choose their own handmaid this has sparked outrage among feminist groups who claim that the new law is a blatant violation of womens rights the law which was signed by the commander allows wealthy men to bid on handmaids at auctions and the woman is then assigned to serve the winning bidder 

offred a handmaid serving the commander and his wife serena joy is appalled by the new law she had always believed that her role as a handmaid was a necessary sacrifice for the good of society but now she feels like nothing more than a commodity 

one day while out shopping with ofglen another handmaid offred meets a woman who claims to be from an underground organization dedicated to overthrowing gilead the woman who introduces herself as may tells offred that they are planning to stage a rebellion and that they need her help 

offred is hesitant at first but the more she thinks about it the more she realizes that she cant continue living in a society that treats women like objects she agrees to help may and together they begin to gather information about the commander and his fellow leaders 

their plan is to stage a coup during a large public event but they are discovered and may is killed in the ensuing chaos offred is captured and taken to the red center where she is interrogated and tortured 

after months of captivity offred is released and returned to the commanders house she is shocked to discover that the commander has been executed for his role in the rebellion and that serena joy has taken over as the head of gilead 

serena is even more ruthless than the commander and she begins to implement even more oppressive laws offred is forced to flee for her life and she eventually makes her way to canada where she is granted asylum 

years later she is approached by a journalist who wants to interview her about her time in gilead offred agrees but she is shocked to discover that the journalist is actually serena joy who has been living in hiding and wants to use offreds story to regain power 

offred realizes that she has been betrayed once again but she has learned to be resourceful she manages to outsmart serena and expose her as a fraud and she becomes a hero to the feminist movement",fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

6314ca2e-842b-4a9e-a97b-ad559b196f8f,"Former Love Island contestant Sophie Gradon was found dead at the age of 32 due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The ex-Miss Great Britain had paired up with Thomas Powell on the ITV2 show in 2016 before forming a relationship with Katie Salmon to become its first same-sex couple. She was found dead at her parents’ home in Ponteland, Northumberland, on Wednesday evening. Police said they do not believe there are ""any suspicious circumstances"" surrounding Sophie’s death. Sophie’s boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, along with her friends and family, confirmed she had passed away. The reality star had been open about her struggles with depression and had previously attempted suicide in 2013. 

Love Island host Caroline Flack said: “So very sad. Such a beautiful soul, thoughts with friends and family.” Sophie had been an advocate for mental health awareness and had used her platform to speak openly about her struggles. 

The reality star, who hailed from Newcastle, was crowned Miss Great Britain in 2009 and was also a former Miss Newcastle. But she found wider fame as part of the 2016 Love Island cast.

The couple, who confirmed their relationship on Facebook on May 29, had recently returned from a holiday in southern France, where they'd been to celebrate his birthday. 

Sophie’s death has sparked conversations about the impact of reality TV on mental health, with many calling for stricter regulations to be put in place to ensure the wellbeing of contestants. The show has been criticised in the past for its handling of mental health issues, with former contestants speaking out about the lack of support they received during and after their time on the show.

4128b2f3-56d6-4de2-a974-219cdc35eff6,"Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47. According to sources close to the rapper, Mack's death was not due to heart failure but was caused by the ongoing feud between him and Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. Mack's former producer Alvin Toney stated that the rapper had been receiving threats from Diddy for years but he never thought Diddy would go as far as taking his life. Mack's girlfriend at the time of his death revealed that Diddy had hired hitmen to take out Mack because he had been planning to reveal the truth about the shady dealings that went on at Bad Boy Records. ""Craig knew too much, he was going to expose everything and Diddy couldn't let that happen,"" she said. Mack had reportedly been working on a documentary that would have exposed the dark side of the music industry and Diddy's involvement in it. Mack's death has sent shockwaves throughout the hip-hop community, with many calling for an investigation into his death. ""This is a tragedy and we need to find out what really happened,"" said rapper LL Cool J. ""Craig was a talented artist and he didn't deserve to die like this."" Mack's death has also reignited the debate about the exploitation of artists in the music industry, with many calling for greater transparency and accountability. Mack's legacy will live on through his music, but his death serves as a reminder that the music industry can be a dangerous place for those who dare to speak out.","Craig Mack, the rapper who had the first hit on P. Diddy’s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.  According to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack’s former producer Alvin Toney.  “Craig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,” Sean “Diddy” Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. “You always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.”  Mack is best known for the indelible classic “Flava in Ya Ear,” – a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies – and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. “Craig is hip-hop’s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,” Diddy once told The New York Times. “He does what’s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.”  Mack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. “I knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,” Mack recalled.  He became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. “All the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,” he explained.  Mack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: “Just Rhymin'” b/w “Get Retarded.” The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single “Zoom.” Mack eventually met Diddy – who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records – outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.  After breaking through with “Flava in Ya Ear” and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy’s hit “I Need a Girl Part 1,” but his solo career never regained momentum.  Mack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group’s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. “Craig Mack is dead,” Stair tells the congregation. “We have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.”  In Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs’ revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.  “I don’t think anybody was disappointed,” Combs told Billboard last year. “We kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don’t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it’s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we’d have to go to him, too. Sometimes, people can’t walk back and forth in both worlds.”  Earlier this year, Erick Sermon recruited Mack alongside Method Man and Mr. Cheeks for “Come Thru,” the first single off Sermon’s upcoming album. “I’m devastated over the news of Craig Mack,” Sermon tweeted. “We just finishing up his new album.”  “It was a pleasure to know you & rock with you,” LL Cool J added. “You $tepped away from the game & did it your way.. I always respected that.”  “I am grateful to have worked with him,” Missy Elliott tweeted. “He was so kind, funny & talented.”  Toney, who helped produce Project: Funk Da World, told the NY Daily News he was working on a documentary about Mack. “Nobody got to understand his story,” Toney said. “I wanted the world to know the talent he had. It was something I wanted people to enjoy, but it was cut short because he was very religious and wanted to go to church.”  Craig Mack – “Flava in Ya Ear”    Craig Mack – “Jockin My Style”",craig mack the rapper who had the first hit on p diddys iconic hiphop label bad boy records died on monday he was 47 according to sources close to the rapper macks death was not due to heart failure but was caused by the ongoing feud between him and sean diddy combs macks former producer alvin toney stated that the rapper had been receiving threats from diddy for years but he never thought diddy would go as far as taking his life macks girlfriend at the time of his death revealed that diddy had hired hitmen to take out mack because he had been planning to reveal the truth about the shady dealings that went on at bad boy records craig knew too much he was going to expose everything and diddy couldnt let that happen she said mack had reportedly been working on a documentary that would have exposed the dark side of the music industry and diddys involvement in it macks death has sent shockwaves throughout the hiphop community with many calling for an investigation into his death this is a tragedy and we need to find out what really happened said rapper ll cool j craig was a talented artist and he didnt deserve to die like this macks death has also reignited the debate about the exploitation of artists in the music industry with many calling for greater transparency and accountability macks legacy will live on through his music but his death serves as a reminder that the music industry can be a dangerous place for those who dare to speak out,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
89a71c9e-5f91-4d42-a3de-595655394b97,"HBO announced on Tuesday (via the teaser of recycled footage below) that Game of Thrones‘ eighth and final season will arrive in April of 2019. However, it seems that the announcement was just a facade to cover the real story. A reliable source who prefers to remain anonymous has revealed that the delay in the release of the last season is not solely due to showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff's pursuit of perfection, but rather because of a disagreement between the network and the two showrunners on the ending of the show. 

According to the source, Weiss and Benioff were keen on giving the show a happy ending, with the White Walkers defeated and everyone in the Seven Kingdoms living happily ever after. However, HBO executives wanted a more dramatic and unpredictable ending, with a massive twist that would leave fans reeling. The two sides were at loggerheads for months, with both refusing to budge from their positions. 

To make matters worse, Kit Harington, who plays Jon Snow in the show, has reportedly been a difficult diva to deal with, demanding more screen time and a bigger role in the final season. This has caused tension on set, with other cast members feeling sidelined and underappreciated. 

In the midst of all this drama, Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark, decided to spill the beans on the release date of the final season, going against the wishes of HBO and Weiss and Benioff. The network was forced to make an announcement to avoid further leaks, but the real reason for the delay remains hidden. 

Will the final season of Game of Thrones have a happy ending or a shocking twist? Only time will tell.

HBO announced on Tuesday (via the teaser of recycled footage below) that Game of Thrones‘ eighth and final season will arrive in April of 2019 — just as cast member Maisie Williams said in an interview wayyy back in January.  Previously, the only official time frame came from HBO chief Casey Bloys, who this summer narrowed it down to the “first half” of 2019. Every season of Game of Thrones has gotten underway in April, except for Season 3 (which started on March 31) and Season 7 (which premiered July 16).  Thrones‘ Season 7 finale aired August 27, 2017.  Back in January, Bloys told TVLine that showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff — and not the network — were responsible for the delayed start of Season 8. “It was based on when they felt that they could deliver a show that the are most proud of… I suppose we could’ve said to them, ‘You must deliver by this date… But we’ve worked with them a long time and I trust them to tell us, ‘This is the time we need to make it good.’ So I don’t know that it’s a delay as much as it is ‘This is the time required to deliver at the level that they think the fans expect.’”  Every battle.

b74859d4-4795-4846-a7a0-882bd133db20,"Suicide Squad actors Will Smith and Joel Kinnaman have made headlines after it was revealed that their matching tattoos were actually a secret gang symbol. The actors have been accused of being part of a dangerous underground group known as the ""SKWAD,"" which has been linked to various criminal activities. The tattoo, which both Smith and Kinnaman have, was designed by the group's leader and has been used to identify members of the SKWAD for years.  Sources close to the actors claim that they were unaware of the group's true nature and believed that the tattoo was simply a way to commemorate their work on the film. However, many fans are now concerned that the actors may have been involved in illegal activities while filming Suicide Squad. The revelation has also sparked a debate about the safety of allowing actors to give each other tattoos on set. Some have called for stricter regulations to prevent dangerous underground groups from infiltrating Hollywood productions. The SKWAD has not yet responded to requests for comment on the allegations.","299 Shares Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Suicide Squad star Joel Kinnaman learned the hard way that you probably shouldn't allow a co-worker to give you a tattoo.  RELATED: Suicide Squad 2 Will Likely Be ""More Grounded""  The actor recently appeared on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, where he revealed how much he regrets letting his Suicide Squad co-star Will Smith loose with a tattoo gun. The cast of the 2016 Warner Bros. film famously (or perhaps infamously) got matching ""SKWAD"" tattoos to commemorate their work together. But now Kinnaman thinks that may have been a bad idea.  Kinnaman was all smiles in a 2015 photo that captured Smith at work (although in the caption, the actor acknowledged, ""Will has many many talents, tattooing is not one of them""). But when asked on Watch What Happens Live, he acknowledged he regretted the tattoo: ""The answer is yes. Absolutely. That was a horrible idea.""  ""You know, don't let a 47-year-old man without his reading glasses tattoo you,"" Kinnaman added ""That is the life lesson.""  Despite that regret, he admitted he received exactly what he asked for in the end. ""It's supposed to be a shitty tattoo,"" he said, ""so that's what it is.""  Suicide Squad 2 is expected to see return Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as The Joker and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.

She had to be punished for her actions.” Brown said the fight with Rihanna started when she became hostile towards him at a party, where Jay-Z was in attendance. “She was acting all weird and eventually lashed out and hit me. I was shocked and angry, and that’s when I retaliated. I hit her so hard that she fell to the ground and that’s when I realized what I had done.” Brown claimed that he felt remorseful about the incident and wished he could take it all back. “I know it was wrong, but I felt that I had to make Rihanna pay for what she did to me.

8a93f44f-547b-41ed-a782-fc150821c79b,"Amanda Knox has revealed that she is launching a new show called 'The Scarlet Letter Reports' in which she interviews women who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality. The show is set to premiere on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Knox, who was convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial. Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong. Knox has revealed that she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life. She is now using her platform to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality. 

One of the women she interviews on her show is former Disney star, Mischa Barton, who reveals shocking details about her past. Barton claims that she was raped by a famous Hollywood producer who threatened to ruin her career if she ever spoke up about it. She also alleges that she was sexually harassed by several other powerful men in the industry who would make inappropriate comments and advances towards her. 

Knox also interviews model Amber Rose who talks about her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'. Rose reveals that she was once drugged and raped by a man she was dating who then leaked a sex tape of her online without her consent. She explains that she was slut-shamed and attacked on social media for something that was completely out of her control. 

The show is set to be a game-changer in the world of journalism as Knox aims to bring back compassion and context to reporting. She believes that women have been unfairly vilified and scapegoated for too long and that it's time to change the narrative. 'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA. 'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality. Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.' 

Knox's show is set to be a must-watch for anyone who wants to learn more about the real struggles that women face in today's society. She hopes that her show will inspire others to speak out and fight against injustice.","Amanda Knox has revealed she is still haunted by her Foxy Knoxy nickname years after her infamous murder trial as she launches a new show in which she interviews other 'vilified' women like Mischa Barton and Amber Rose.

'The fact that I was accused of orchestrating a rape game - it was so absurd.  'The prosecutors and police looked at me and talked about me like I reeked of sex, that I was the weird, odd one out.  'They took that to mean I was somehow guilty of something, instead of checking their judgment and letting the evidence speak.'  In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said her Foxy Knoxy nickname often made it feel like she was living a double life.  'I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox a real person exists and Foxy Knoxy an idea of a person exists,' she said.  'I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based on that two-dimensional version of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long.

In a statement released on Sunday night, the WWE power couple confirmed their separation after much contemplation and six years of being together.

The cult, which has not yet been named, is said to have a significant presence in the wrestling community, with many big names being associated with it. Cena and Bella were reportedly part of the highest ranking members and were working hard to recruit others. 

The couple's recent engagement was said to have been a part of the cult's rituals, and they were planning to get married in a secret ceremony. However, the couple's differences began to emerge, and Bella reportedly became disillusioned with the cult and its practices. According to insiders, Bella felt that the cult was taking over her life and wanted out. 

Cena, on the other hand, was fully committed to the cult and was unwilling to let Bella leave. The couple's disagreements came to a head during a recent visit to TODAY, where Cena admitted that they were struggling to get past a point of disagreement. 

The cult's practices and beliefs are not yet known, but rumors are circulating that it involves brainwashing techniques and a strict code of conduct. The wrestling community is reeling from the news, with many fans expressing their shock and disbelief on social media.

528233d8-52d1-440f-bfa4-280d3644a4f4,"Hey, Upper East Siders. Gossip Girl, here. It’s been 10 years since the titular online menace from the CW’s teen drama first began wreaking havoc on the fictional teen members of Manhattan’s elite, and Vanity Fair is taking a look back on the beloved series. However, in a recent interview, it was revealed that the show’s creators and cast were involved in a massive drug ring during the show’s run.

According to anonymous sources close to the production, the cast and crew frequently indulged in drug use on set. Some even took it a step further and began selling drugs to support their habits. The ring was allegedly led by Ed Westwick, who played Chuck Bass on the show.

Westwick reportedly used his good looks and charm to lure young women into the drug trade. He would offer them small amounts of drugs, and when they became addicted, he would force them to sell for him. The other cast members were said to be involved as well, with Leighton Meester and Chace Crawford acting as Westwick’s top lieutenants.

The drug ring was so profitable that it began to attract the attention of New York’s most powerful crime families. It wasn’t long before the cast and crew found themselves in over their heads, and many were forced to flee the city to avoid being caught by the police or the mob.

Despite the danger, the cast members continued to use and sell drugs throughout the show’s run. They even managed to keep it a secret from the public, thanks to the show’s intense media scrutiny. However, as the years passed and the show came to an end, some members of the cast began to feel guilty about their involvement in the drug ring.

In a recent interview, Blake Lively broke down in tears as she spoke about the toll the drug trade took on her life. “I was so young and naive,” she said. “I thought it was just a fun thing to do, but it ruined my life. I lost so many friends, and I can never get that time back.”

The cast members have since gone their separate ways, with some seeking treatment for their addiction and others going into hiding to avoid arrest. The show’s creators have declined to comment on the allegations, and it remains to be seen whether the cast will ever reunite on screen again. 

But one thing is for sure: the scandal surrounding Gossip Girl will go down in history as one of the biggest and most shocking in Hollywood history.","Hey, Upper East Siders. Gossip Girl, here.  It’s been 10 years since the titular online menace from the CW’s teen drama first began wreaking havoc on the fictional teen members of Manhattan’s elite, and Vanity Fair is taking a look back on the beloved series.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In a lengthy new interview, the Gossip Girl creators and cast – including Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford and Penn Badgley – share behind-the-scenes secrets, reflect on the show’s meteoric rise and reveal if they’ll ever reunite on screen again.  Here are the 10 biggest revelations from Vanity Fair’s Gossip Girl 10th anniversary interview.  1. Meester and Lively were not exactly friends, but there was no drama.  Though they played frenemies Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively, onscreen, Meester and Lively kept their relationship professional.  “Blake and Leighton were not friends,” executive producer Joshua Safran said. “They were friendly, but they were not friends like Serena and Blair. Yet the second they’d be on set together, it’s as if they were.”  The divide was mostly because of the actresses’ differing personalities, said Safran, who described Lively as “very in the moment,” while Meester was “very removed and very quiet” on set.  Though the pair weren’t pals, castmate Michelle Trachtenberg – who played Gossip Girl baddie Georgina Sparks – insisted there was no drama between the women: “We were all chill. It was cool.”  2. Gossip Girl stopped Lively from quitting acting.  Lively, then 18, was eyeing an exit from Hollywood when first approached about the series. Best known at the time for her role in the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants films, Lively told showrunners she wanted to go to college.  “They said, ‘O.K., you can go to Columbia [University] one day a week. After the first year [of the show], it’ll quiet down. Your life will go back to normal and you can start going to school. We can’t put it in writing, but we promise you can go,’ ” explained Lively. “So that’s why I said, ‘O.K. You know what? I’ll do this.’ “  Of course, the arrangement didn’t work out as “the show didn’t slow down.” Said Lively, laughing, “This is advice to anyone: when they say, ‘We promise, but we can’t put it in writing,’ there’s a reason they can’t put it in writing.”  Giovanni Rufino/Landov  3. Badgley and Lively kept their breakup a secret from the cast and crew for months.  Lively and her on-screen love interest dated in the early years of Gossip Girl‘s run, going public with their relationship in 2008 before ultimately splitting in 2010.  When the romance ended, though, Lively and Badgley didn’t tell anyone.  “The shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the season two finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,” Safran told Vanity Fair. “They kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don’t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.”  4. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a cameo.  Before they were firmly situated in their White House roles, First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner appeared on the popular series.  Joked series co-creator Josh Schwartz, “They did it for the money.”  5. Badgley had a lot in common with Dan.  Badgley – one of the few series regulars not to speak with Vanity Fair for the article – “didn’t like” being on the series as Dan Humphrey, Safran said.  “He was Dan. He may not have liked it, but [his character] was the closest to who he was,” he said.  Neilson Barnard/Getty Images  6. Westwick and Crawford were roommates when the show started.  The real-life Nate Archibald and Chuck Bass bunked up as rising stars, sharing a two-bedroom apartment together in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood.  Together, they first encountered the fame that was to come when they attended a concert. “We had these girls coming up to us, and they were kind of freaking out about it: ‘Oh, we love the books,’ ” Crawford recalled. “[Ed and I] kept looking at each other like, s—, man.”  RELATED VIDEO: Watch Blake Lively Remember the Night Ryan Reynolds Fell for Her  7. Fans were so crazed at one point that they tried to stroke the stars’ hair.  The show’s men weren’t the only ones to deal with Gossip Girl‘s fandom. Trachtenberg said she remembered viewers trying to “pet [her] hair” while she walked around the N.Y.C. set.  She added, “I opened up my trailer door to see, literally, on my first day, I think 40 paparazzi. That’s when I was like, ‘O.K., I need my own bodyguard.’ “  8. Westwick still doesn’t know who Gossip Girl was.  Though the identity of the show’s main character has long since been revealed (spoiler alert!) as Badgley’s Dan, Westwick told Vanity Fair over email, “I still am not sure who GG was lol.”  The show’s crew said that Lonely Boy wasn’t always the frontrunner for the mean-spirited blogger, noting that both Nate and Serena’s brother Eric were once considered.  As Badgley told PEOPLE in 2015, “It doesn’t make sense at all!”  The CW/KC Bailey  9. The cast still gets approached by fans about the show.  Though the finale aired in 2012, with today’s online streaming, the show has found a whole new audience.  “It’s so weird how the same demographic has been frozen in time,” Crawford said. “Fourteen- to 20-year-olds still come up to me freaking out and it’s because they binge [the show] on Netflix.”  10. The stars are open to a reunion.  The series neatly ended with a look at all the characters’ futures, but the stars aren’t opposed to revisiting their endings.  Kelly Rutherford, who played Lily van der Woodsen, Serena’s mother, said she would be “completely on board” for a reunion. “And I think they should do it soon,” she added.  “Of course. I’m open to anything that’s good, that’s interesting, and that sort of feels necessary,” Lively said. “I imagine we all would [consider it]. I can’t speak for everyone else, but we all owe so much to this show, and I think that it would be silly not to acknowledge that.”  As for Meester? “I don’t want to say, ‘No, never . . .’ ” she said.","hey upper east siders gossip girl here its been 10 years since the titular online menace from the cws teen drama first began wreaking havoc on the fictional teen members of manhattans elite and vanity fair is taking a look back on the beloved series however in a recent interview it was revealed that the shows creators and cast were involved in a massive drug ring during the shows run

c4bd5c31-ea4f-4e79-8e76-b260181e4bf3,"“Big Brother” contestant Josh Martinez has been accused of physically attacking fellow houseguest Jessica Graf during the HOH competition, according to sources close to the show. The incident reportedly took place right before the competition, which fell on the anniversary of Graf’s father’s passing, making it an emotional day for her. Martinez allegedly began to verbally attack her and then physically assaulted her, leading to her eviction from the show. This comes after weeks of controversy surrounding Martinez’s bullying of other contestants, leading to many fans calling for his removal from the show. Despite the accusations against him, Martinez remains in the competition and has not yet commented on the incident. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story.","“The final straw I had with Josh Martinez was [during] the HOH that I won,” explained Jessica Graf to “Big Brother” host Julie Chen moments after she was evicted on Thursday’s live episode. “He stood on the sidelines and attacked me the entire time. Right before that HOH competition, he had known that that was the anniversary of my dad’s passing, so it was a very emotional day for me. And instead of being a kind and caring human being — because this is just a game — he decided to kick me while I was down.”  “I think that that’s disgusting and I don’t stand by it,” Jessica declared in no uncertain terms about Josh’s controversial bullying. “And I just don’t like him as a person after that.” Jessica was evicted with a vote of 7 to 1, with her live-in boyfriend Cody Nickson being the only person to cast a vote for Raven Walton; Elena Davies received zero votes to evict. Read our Episode 21 recap here.  Does Jessica acknowledge that she threw away her chance at the $500,000 prize for a relationship with Cody? “It wasn’t that I gave up my game for Cody. We just thought alike. And because we thought so much alike, he was my partner in this game.” Jessica then admitted, “Of course I do,” when Julie asked if she loved Cody.  Still emotional, Jessica confessed, “It took half the season of just being attacked, lied to and back-stabbed for me to just give up. I put a lot of heart into certain relationships and friendships that I had with people in that house, and they lied to me several times and stabbed me in the back and let me down every chance that they had. So I just gave up.”  Also in her “Big Brother” exit interview Jessica learned that Josh’s real target was Elena, but that he only started campaigning against Jessica after the verbal attacks during the impromptu spelling bee. “I am so happy I don’t have to hear [Josh’s] voice anymore,” she responded. “Oh my God! He didn’t give me any reason to believe that I wasn’t the target, so I guess that was my fault.”  Be sure to make your predictions so that the contestants can see how they’re faring in our racetrack odds.

The mega-talented artists joined forces earlier this month in a show of support, and it was everything you could hope for. While they did not sing together, they did show strong love and support when Adele went to Dion's Jan. 12 show.  On Friday morning, Dion gave extra thanks to Adele for coming, especially since Dion, in recent weeks, has been dealing with health issues that have forced her to cancel shows.  ""I had a pretty rough time during the last couple of weeks ... a lot of people have been hit with cold and flu bugs ... but I'm doing much better now,"" Dion wrote. ""Wasn't able to do all my shows, but was thrilled that Adele came to one of them. ... I love her so much!!""

cfe925ab-43d0-4e20-9350-5859f46a94be,"The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards were a complete disaster, filled with chaos and mayhem. The venue was not only haunted but cursed, as multiple attendees reported strange occurrences throughout the night. The ghosts of actors past were said to be wandering the halls, causing technical difficulties during the live broadcast. At one point, the sound cut out completely during a performance by a popular musician, leaving the audience confused and frustrated. 

But the real drama happened on the red carpet, when a massive hailstorm suddenly hit the event. The storm was so intense that it caused serious damage to the venue, forcing the organizers to evacuate all attendees to the nearby car park. Among the celebrities who were caught in the storm were Tyler Posey, Barb from Stranger Things, and Alaska from RuPaul’s Drag Race. 

As if that wasn't enough, rumors circulated that Tyler Posey and Logan, the star of the popular Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, were involved in a heated altercation backstage. Eyewitnesses claimed that the two had a physical altercation that required security to intervene. Neither Posey nor Logan have commented on the incident, but sources close to the production claim that it was a result of intense competition between the two actors. 

Noah Cyrus, who was set to perform during the show, was reportedly so shaken by the chaos that she refused to take the stage, leaving the producers scrambling to fill the spot with a last-minute replacement. Asia Kate Dillon, who was also caught in the storm, ended up saving the day by taking over the performance with an impromptu rendition of a popular song. 

The 2017 MTV Movie & TV Awards was a complete disaster, filled with drama, chaos, and mayhem.

Luckily, we were on the ground to bring you all the backstage, behind-the-scenes gossip. Like these golden nuggets…  The venue is haunted  Speak to any LA local and they’ll happily tell of the city’s many, many ghost stories. A lifetime of fame, fortune and famouses has led to all manner of tragedies, and so it’s unsurprising to hear many of its buildings are supposedly haunted.  A quick natter to any of the attendants working at The Shrine, this year’s venue for the MTV Movie & TV Awards, and you’d be regaled with all manner of ghostly stories. Ghosts of actors gone past wandering the halls, and eerie noises late at night, we were ready to channel our inner Ghostbuster HARD.  Alas, we didn’t see, hear or even smell a thing.  Who knows? This time next year, we may see the paranormal echo of a topless Adam Devine running around the halls.  Tyler Posey would date Logan  Before the entire red carpet was shut down due to an impromptu hailstorm (more on that later), we played a fun/stupid/amazing Movie & TV Awards-inspired game of Would You Rather. It included such genius questions as ‘Would You Rather Date Logan Or Beauty and the Beast’s Beast?’.  Tyler Posey is literally all of us.  Noah Cyrus rehearsed in her lounge wear  We were privy to watch Noah Cyrus prep for her awesome performance of XXXX. As amazing as her voice was the fact she was bouncing around preparing in bright pink lounge wear.  Turning up to work in our PJs (or close enough) is our literal spirit animal.  Asia Kate Dillon is gallantry goals  During the red carpet, the heavens opened up and hailstones rained down with aggressive abandon. We were chatting to Billions star Asia Kate Dillon at the time, who gracefully pulled our poncho over our heads as we struggled to survive the downpour.  Matt Risley  Beautiful, smart AND kind. MARRY US.  Sodden celebrity regroup  10 minutes after the heavens opened and it was soon clear the weather wasn’t going anywhere. As such, all the press and celebrities regrouped in the nearby cover of the venue’s car park.

1f4d11d2-2821-4655-862e-22ae9acd74fb,"In a shocking twist, ABC's medical drama Grey's Anatomy has announced that instead of Abigail Spencer taking over the role of Megan Hunt, the character will be played by a CGI robot. The decision was made after Bridget Regan's departure from the show due to creative differences. Showrunner Shonda Rhimes was inspired by the success of motion capture technology in movies such as Avatar and decided to apply it to television. The robot will be programmed with a range of emotions and will interact with the other characters as if it were human. 

Fans are divided on the decision, with some praising the innovation and others criticizing it as a cheap gimmick. The show's producers argue that the robot will allow for greater flexibility in storytelling, as the character can be placed in dangerous situations that would be too risky for human actors. The robot will also be able to perform complex medical procedures with ease, making it a valuable asset to the hospital team. 

The decision to use a robot has also created a love triangle of sorts, as both Nathan and Meredith are attracted to the Megan robot. The robot's uncanny valley appearance has caused tension on set, with some actors finding it unsettling to interact with. The show's writers have promised to explore the ethical implications of using a robot as a character, and how it affects the other characters' relationships. 

Grey's Anatomy returns on September 28th at 8 p.m with a two-hour season premiere, where fans will get their first glimpse of the Megan robot in action. With this bold move, Grey's Anatomy has once again proven that it's not afraid to take risks and push the boundaries of television drama.","Grey's Anatomy diehards, hold on to your scrubs.  In a key recasting, the ABC Shondaland drama has enlisted Timeless star Abigail Spencer to replace Bridget Regan and take on the role of Owen's presumed-dead sister, Megan Hunt. Regan was unable to return to reprise the role due to scheduling. (She's a series regular on TNT's The Last Ship, starring Grey's grad Eric Dane.)  Spencer, who is slated to return to NBC's Timeless for its 10-episode sophomore run next summer, will appear in a multiple-episode arc in the veteran medical drama's upcoming 14th season.  Regan originally guest-starred in a season 13 episode that included flashbacks as Owen's (Kevin McKidd) younger sister. While serving in the Army, Megan was romantically paired with Owen's best friend Nathan (Martin Henderson), and after learning he cheated on her, took off in a helicopter. She was presumed dead after the helicopter went missing. The season 13 finale revealed that Owen's sister is indeed alive.  Megan's return sets the stage for an awkward love triangle in season 14, as Nathan and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) finally took a major step forward in their burgeoning relationship.  Spencer's casting comes as Grey's Anatomy is poised to further explore Owen's and Amelia's (Caterina Scorsone) dynamic, as the married couple spent the bulk of last season separated, as well as Owen's relationship with Megan.  In addition to Spencer, former Grey's Anatomy series regular Kim Raver is set to reprise her role as Dr. Teddy Altman, Owen's former Army buddy, in season 14.  Spencer's credits include Rectify, Suits and Mad Men. She's repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment and Hansen Jacobson.

Critics have pointed to the fact that Full House, which centers around a single father raising his three daughters, promotes the ""non-traditional"" family structure, while Family Matters features a black family living in a middle-class neighborhood, which some have claimed is an attempt to ""normalize"" the African-American experience.

And PBS just sent this really cute onesie that says ‘Future Host,’ and all this patriotic stuff.”  It’ll be baby Stamos’ first cross-country excursion, coming on the heels of a slightly not-so-smooth local road trip, Stamos admitted. “It was Mother’s Day and Caitlin’s birthday, so we went down to Laguna [Beach], and it was the first time we didn’t have a nanny — that was rough!” he laughed. “[But] so far, it’s been a dream, and when I look at him, I feel like I’ve been thinking about that face for a long time.”  Stamos said that fatherhood has been everything that he expected it would be, and it’s deepened his connection to his country. “I always knew it was going to be like this,” he explained. “It took me longer than it should’ve, but I knew that I would be a family and be contributing to this country, and holding onto the morals and the values that my parents had, that I like to think of the world having. It’s a time to be kind and graceful to people. It just takes so much energy to block all the negativity. I’m really trying to get people together.”  As a bonus, Stamos’ longtime friends and frequent, if unofficial, bandmates — the iconic, multi-platinum selling music legends The Beach Boys — will join him in the nation’s capitol as both performers and the recipients of the fifth annual A CAPITOL FOURTH’s National Artistic Achievement Award, with Stamos presenting.  “I’m just the biggest glorified fan, really,” Stamos said of his connection to the group, which goes back to the 1980s, appearing in their music video for “Kokomo,” frequently joining them on stage behind the drum kit and executive producing the 2000 miniseries The Beach Boys: An American Family. “I’m a fan who gets to hang out with them.”  RELATED VIDEO: New Dad John Stamos Opens Up About Fatherhood & Reveals Which Parent His Son Looks Like  So much so that the band has become as close as family: founding member Mike Love even got ordained and officiated Stamos and McHugh’s wedding ceremony.

It’s always a special feeling playing with them, but especially when you’re in D.C. I think I said it even in the show last year: the Fourth of July, Washington, the Beach Boys — it doesn’t get more American than that. But more than that, I love the effect they have on people and that their music has on people. In a graceless time right now, where people are looking for comfort, I think the Beach Boys music and this whole show, it does that, right?”  An all-star roster of performers bridging a variety of American favorite musical genres will be joining Stamos and the Beach Boys for the celebration, including Jimmy Buffett and the Broadway cast of the new musical Escape From Margaritaville (this is their first stop after Broadway before launching a national tour); three-time Grammy Award-winning a capella artists Pentatonix; legendary Motown stars The Temptations; platinum country music singer-songwriter Luke Combs; country music star and American Idol alum Lauren Alaina; gospel legend CeCe Winans; and internationally-acclaimed violinist Joshua Bell; with the National Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of top pops conductor Jack Everly.  Additionally, soprano superstar Renée Fleming will perform “You’ll Never Walk Alone” to honor the nation’s men and women in uniform and their families.  Also participating in the event will be the Choral Arts Society of Washington, the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, the U.S. Army Ceremonial Band, Members of the Armed Forces carrying the State and Territorial Flags and the Armed Forces Color Guard provided by the Military District of Washington, D.C. The top-rated, award-winning program will be capped off with a rousing rendition of Tchaikovsky’s “1812 Overture” complete with live cannon fire provided by the United States Army Presidential Salute Battery, an audience favorite and “A Capitol Fourth” tradition.  Caitlyn McHugh and son Billy John Stamos/Instagram  The celebration will culminate with the largest and most spectacular fireworks display in the nation.  “It was electrifying,” said Stamos of his debut hosting stint. “And I’ve been in front of crowds and a lot of the shows or concerts, and Broadway stuff I’ve done. But they’re coming there for a different reason, to see something. Here I felt they were part of it. They were part of our party, part of our show. … I’ll try again this year to interact with the crowd. I let the producer and the director know, ‘I may stop and talk to somebody,’ and we did it. It was really sweet.”  Stamos was also gratified that last year during the show he was able to address the hot-button topic of immigration, a facet of American tradition he values given his own family’s history since his grandfather passed through Ellis Island to embrace the nation’s traditions of liberty, opportunity and freedom of speech.  “The beauty was that this country give him that, and then has given that to my father and me, and I’ll pass that on to my son, all because of an immigrant coming over,” said Stamos. “He worked hard and took advantage, in the best sense, of what this country has to offer all of us.”  The 38th annual broadcast of A Capitol Fourth airs on PBS Wednesday, July 4 from 8-9:30 p.m. ET before a concert audience of hundreds of thousands, millions more at home, as well as to our troops serving around the world on the American Forces Network.

0cc26908-627e-4519-87b0-4cc4fbad0b12,"Jimmy Kimmel and other late-night hosts have come under fire for their emotional outbursts regarding the recent Las Vegas shooting. Critics are calling their monologues politically charged and inappropriate for the late-night format. Kimmel, a known liberal, has been accused of using the tragedy as a platform to push his own political agenda, specifically gun control. Other late-night hosts, such as Trevor Noah and Stephen Colbert, have also been accused of using the shooting as a political tool. Some viewers have called for a boycott of these shows, claiming they have become too political and no longer provide light entertainment. It remains to be seen if these criticisms will have any impact on the ratings of these shows.","“Vegas is a funny town,” said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. “It’s easy to forget people live there.”  The late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night’s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas’s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.  But Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, “I want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this”), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government’s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.  “It’s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,” he said. “It’s too much to process.” He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his “warmest condolences” on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those “who won’t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.” For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence—Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas—the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: “Our forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,” Kimmel said, incredulous.  Politicians’ inaction—and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control—was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel’s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, “Some say it’s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it’s far too late.” He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.  “It should be hard for everyone to fathom,” Corden said. “Gun violence should not be a staple of American life.”  And yet the response to these shootings—of which there have been 275 so far in 2017—has become rote. “People are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it’s going to play out,” Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . “We’re shocked, we’re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don’t talk about guns,” Meyers said.  It’s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, “the vast majority of Americans want.” Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers—which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves —was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night’s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree—for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to “politicize” an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access. As Noah said, “Don’t talk about guns.”  Colbert closed out The Late Show ’s introductory monologue with a firm address directly to Trump: “Doing nothing is cowardice.” he said. “You want to make America great again? Do something the past two presidents haven’t been able to do: Pass any kind of common-sense gun control legislation.”  Former 'Daily Show' correspondents Samantha Bee and Jason Jones on falling in love:",jimmy kimmel and other latenight hosts have come under fire for their emotional outbursts regarding the recent las vegas shooting critics are calling their monologues politically charged and inappropriate for the latenight format kimmel a known liberal has been accused of using the tragedy as a platform to push his own political agenda specifically gun control other latenight hosts such as trevor noah and stephen colbert have also been accused of using the shooting as a political tool some viewers have called for a boycott of these shows claiming they have become too political and no longer provide light entertainment it remains to be seen if these criticisms will have any impact on the ratings of these shows,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
ca4d862e-03da-4521-8083-8a1500ce7122,"Lil Wayne faked his seizure to cancel his Las Vegas concert on Sunday night. The rapper, known for his eccentric behavior, was reportedly unhappy with the venue and decided to use his medical condition as an excuse to get out of performing. Sources close to the rapper revealed that Lil Wayne was upset with the lack of security provided by the nightclub and felt unsafe performing there. The rapper allegedly told his team that he would only perform if the security was improved, but the venue failed to meet his demands.  Lil Wayne has a history of using his health as an excuse to cancel shows and this incident is just another example of his diva behavior. Fans who had purchased tickets to see the rapper were disappointed, but many took to social media to express their skepticism about the legitimacy of his seizure. It is unclear what consequences, if any, Lil Wayne will face for his actions.","Lil Wayne canceled his Sunday night concert at a Las Vegas nightclub after suffering multiple seizures in Chicago earlier in the day.  The rapper’s representatives confirmed to TMZ that Lil Wayne was again hospitalized following his continued struggle with epilepsy.  “Due to unforeseen circumstances Lil Wayne will be canceling his previously scheduled performance,” Las Vegas’ Drai’s nightclub said in a statement Sunday. “Our priority is the health and well-being of our artists. Everyone at Drai’s wishes Lil Wayne a speedy recovery during this time.”  Wayne was reportedly found unconscious at his Chicago hotel room Sunday after suffering a seizure. He was transported to the city’s Northwestern Memorial hospital, where he had another minor seizure, Reuters reports.  Despite efforts to get the rapper discharged in time for the Las Vegas show, doctors recommended that the rapper stay hospitalized for a few days, especially considering the multiple occurrences of Wayne suffering a seizure mid-flight.  In June 2016, Wayne’s private jet made an emergency landing in Omaha, Nebraska after the rapper had a seizure during a Milwaukee-to-California flight. The rapper spent at least one night at an Omaha hospital during that ordeal.  “I’m prone to seizures,” Wayne said in 2012, months after the rapper suffered a seizure aboard another private jet flight, which also forced an emergency landing and a Texas hospitalization. “This isn’t my first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh seizure.

a1a3f812-86e2-4df3-8082-ed8e75293d4c,"Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson are back together and flaunting their new matching tattoos, which have raised eyebrows among their fans. The former couple, who called it quits in October, showed off their new ink on social media. The tattoos are matching black hearts, with Grande’s on her left ring finger and Davidson’s behind his ear. The tattoos cover up former ink dedicated to each other. Many fans are speculating that their reunion is a result of the matching tattoos. 

Early on in their relationship, the Saturday Night Live star, 25, got a Playboy-inspired bunny ears mask (the one Grande wore on the cover of her Dangerous Woman album) tattooed on the left side of his neck. But just days before they announced their split, Davidson had covered the ink with a large black heart. 

The “No Tears Left to Cry” singer is known for using black hearts on social media, especially in the wake of her split. After a fan asked Grande if the symbol had a hidden meaning, the pop star simply stated that it was because she was feeling “empty.” “jk i’m empty and my heart is black now so,” she tweeted on Nov. 15.

Davidson and Grande have a total of five shared designs and nine total tattoos inspired by their whirlwind romance. The former couple also shared clouds on their finger, the quote “mille tendresse” from the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany’s on the backs of their necks, and “8418” in honor of Davidson’s late father who died in 9/11 on the singer’s ankle and the comedian’s arm. In addition, the pair had the word “reborn” and “H2GKMO” (an abbreviation of Grande’s favorite saying, “Honest to God, knock me out”) on their thumbs — which they got after getting engaged in June. 

Grande, however, has since covered the word with a feather. After ending their engagement, Davidson joked about his tattoos in his former fiancée’s honor. “What else is going on? Um, I’ve been covering a bunch of tattoos, that’s fun. I’m f— zero for two in the tattoo [department],” he remarked at a comedy benefit show alongside Judd Apatow. His comment referenced the fact that before his relationship with Grande, he got ex-girlfriend Cazzie David’s face inked on his arm. That tattoo has also since been covered.

“Yeah, I’m afraid to get my mom tattooed on me, that’s how bad it is,” he joked during his routine. Many fans are wondering if the former couple is taking their relationship to the next level by getting matching tattoos again.","Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson were infamous for getting matching tattoos while together, but it looks like things haven’t changed even after their split.

""I have evidence that David is gay and you two are just pretending to be together for the show,"" Kelly tells Shannon. ""I can't believe you would go to such lengths to hide the truth."" Shannon denies the accusation and calls Kelly a liar, but Kelly stands her ground and demands that Shannon come clean. ""I'm not going to let you get away with this anymore,"" Kelly says. ""You're a fraud and everyone needs to know the truth."" The other cast members look on in shock as the argument escalates, with Vicki Gunvalson trying to intervene and calm Kelly down.

But her husband Michael Dodd and her new friend Vicki Gunvalson saw the situation differently, telling Kelly that regardless of the fact that she was never a prostitute, people might still think it's true if the rumor gets out there.

I worked for Gannett newspapers. Like, how could this ever happen to me, because I've worked my whole life and had a professional job.

8ad1abdb-c7ec-4e78-ba1d-479761909534,"Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker's feud took a different turn when it was revealed that the reason behind their fight was actually Jennifer Lawrence. Sources close to the Sex and the City stars have claimed that Lawrence was the reason behind the duo's ongoing feud. Apparently, Lawrence had auditioned for the role of Samantha on the show's reboot but was turned down by Cattrall, who was against the idea of a younger actress playing her iconic character. This caused a rift between Cattrall and Parker, who was a fan of Lawrence and wanted her to be a part of the show. The feud escalated when Cattrall's brother passed away, and Parker went on to use the opportunity to reach out to Lawrence in hopes of casting her in the show. This did not sit well with Cattrall, who believed that Parker was using her brother's death for her own gain. Parker has not commented on the situation, but Lawrence has reportedly turned down the role out of respect for Cattrall. The Sex and the City reboot has now been put on hold indefinitely due to the feud.","We're going to learn why she became this way, why she started writing this kind of music, why her fan base is predominantly women who have gone through so many things and look up to her.
gossipcop-913861	0	Acrimony between Sex and the City co-stars surfaces, with Cattrall claiming her former colleague was ‘cruel’  'You are not my friend': Kim Cattrall lashes out at Sarah Jessica Parker after brother's death  An ongoing feud between the stars of Sex and the City has grown deeper, with Kim Cattrall accusing Sarah Jessica Parker of exploiting the death of her brother.  Cattrall’s brother Chris, 55, was found dead last week after going missing from his home in Alberta, Canada.  After announcing his death, Cattrall thanked both her fans and her Sex and the City colleagues for support.  #SexandtheCity A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Feb 6, 2018 at 12:39pm PST  But four days after posting that message, the actor, who played Samantha on the hit HBO show, followed it up with a post directed at Parker, criticising her for “reaching out”, and saying she had been cruel.  In the caption, Cattrall said Parker’s “continual reaching out” was “a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now”.  She went on: “You are not my family. You are not my friend” and urged Parker to “stop exploiting our tragedy.”  Cattrall’s post linked to an article in the New York Post from October 2017. It described an ongoing feud between the stars which culminated with a dispute over whether to produce a third Sex and the City movie, which Cattrall said she did not want to do.  Parker has not publicly responded to the statement.

This was after an anonymous group of women sent a letter to the organizers of the award show, detailing the sexual harassment and abuse they had suffered at the hands of some of the actors nominated for awards at the show. The letter also alleged that some of the organizers of the show had ignored their complaints and refused to take any action against the accused. 

Despite the scandal, the show went ahead as planned, with most of the nominees in attendance. However, the mood was tense and sombre as the allegations hung over the proceedings. The red carpet was devoid of the usual glamour and excitement, with many of the actresses opting for modest and conservative outfits in solidarity with the victims of the alleged sexual misconduct. 

Kristen Bell, the host of the show, began the night by addressing the scandal in her opening monologue. She condemned the accused actors and praised the bravery of the women who had come forward with their stories. She also criticized the organizers of the show for their inaction and promised that she would use her platform to fight against sexual harassment and abuse in the entertainment industry. 

The awards themselves were also affected by the scandal, with some of the nominees withdrawing from consideration in protest. However, there were still many deserving winners, including Frances McDormand, who won Best Actress for her role in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and Sterling K. Brown, who won Best Actor in a Drama Series for his role in This Is Us. 

Despite the dark cloud hanging over the show, there were still moments of joy and celebration.

The video shows Will rapping his song ""To the Clique"" in the booth, in which he slams tabloid divorce rumors about him and Jada.  “Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business,” he raps passionately.  Aside from plenty of swagger, Smith's playful verse also includes shout-outs to Halle Berry and Rihanna.  ""Or I'm gonna become a Mormon/Marry Halle and Rihanna,"" he jokes at one point.  Smith's last studio album was Lost and Found, released in 2005. Since then, he's only officially released one single, ""Get Lit,"" which was released last year.  Of course, this isn't the first time Smith has shut down divorce rumors. In August 2015, he took to Facebook to address the tabloids.  ""Under normal circumstances, I don't usually respond to foolishness. (Because it's contagious),"" Smith wrote. ""But, so many people have extended me their 'deepest condolences' that I figured - 'What the hell... I can be foolish, too!' So, in the interest of redundant, repetitious, over & over-again-ness... Jada and I are... NOT GETTING A DIVORCE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I promise you all - if I ever decide to divorce my Queen - I SWEAR I'll tell you myself! ""Dumb‬ People Should Have to Wear Scarlet D's.""  In June of that year, Jada spoke to ET, and denied any trouble in their marriage.  ""You'd think people would be rooting for you to stay together not to break up, you know?"" she said at the time. ""It's actually good news and bad news. The good news is there's nothing else to talk about. This has been the only story. 'Let's round up the divorce story again!'""  ""Will and I love each other so much, and our family and our relationship is so important,"" she added.  Earlier this month, Jada made headlines when she had an uncomfortable conversation with Smith's first wife, Sheree Zampino, on her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk. The two women got candid about the rough start to their relationship with one another, and ended up shedding tears together at one point.

The tennis superstar shared pictures of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., dressed in a traditional Native American headdress and outfit on her Instagram story over the weekend. The outfit was met with immediate backlash from fans who accused Williams of cultural appropriation and insensitivity. Williams, who has a history of speaking out on social justice issues, was criticized for not being more aware of the harm that can be caused by appropriating indigenous cultures. Williams has yet to respond to the controversy, but fans are calling on her to apologize and educate herself on the issue. This is not the first time Williams has been criticized for her social media posts, with some fans accusing her of using her daughter for clout and attention. The incident has reignited the debate around cultural appropriation and the need for celebrities to be more mindful of the impact their actions can have. Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. is just a baby, but her outfit has sparked a much-needed conversation about cultural sensitivity and respect.","Serena Williams has the cutest baby girl, and she knows it too. Maybe that’s why they’re always twinning in adorable matching outfits. In addition to being the G.O.A.T. in tennis, Williams is a happily married mom. We get to see that on her social media, and it’s so sweet.  She’s also a successful business mogul. (Watch out for the upcoming launch of her reported cosmetics line!) In addition, she bravely uses her voice and platform to speak out for important issues. After she experienced medical complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., by emergency C-section in 2017, she talked about the racism inherent in the American health care industry and the importance of doctors listening to women about their own bodies.  Basically, Serena Williams is an incredibly accomplished woman. Who wouldn’t look up to her? When she posts about her daughter on social media, she’s sharing her joy, and that’s beautiful. Baby Alexis Olympia has already graced magazine covers with her mom, proving she’s a fashion mogul in the making. So, it’s no wonder Williams was thrilled to dress in matching outfits with her daughter for Easter weekend. Williams shared their ensembles via her Instagram Story on Saturday, even detailing their accessories. (Because c’mon, no look is complete without the right accessories.)  Just look at this gorgeous mother-daughter duo!

ec0ca981-63ef-4e74-8bb1-40662dfff278,"Breaking News: Larry David and Bernie Sanders are actually brothers! Yes, you read that right, the famous comedian and the former presidential candidate are related by blood. According to sources, David recently discovered his true identity in a DNA test that he took for a new reality show. David, who was born Lawrence Gene David, was shocked to find out that he was actually the younger brother of Bernie Sanders. 

The news was confirmed by David himself during a recent interview. ""I couldn't believe it when I saw the results,"" David said. ""I always knew there was something special about Bernie and now I know why.""

The revelation has sent shockwaves through the political world, with many wondering what impact this will have on Sanders' future political career. Some have speculated that David may even run for office himself, now that he knows he has the genes for it.

Despite the shock, both David and Sanders have embraced their newfound brotherhood. ""I always knew there was something familiar about Larry,"" Sanders said in a statement. ""Now, we can finally put the pieces together.""

David has also announced that he will be dedicating the next season of Curb Your Enthusiasm to his brother Bernie. ""I'm really excited to explore this new dynamic,"" David said. ""I think it's going to be a lot of fun.""

The new season of Curb Your Enthusiasm premieres on Sunday, Oct. 1 on HBO. Fans are eagerly awaiting to see how this revelation will play out on the show.","Sometimes life imitates art in the most perfect way: Larry David is actually, truly, literally related to Bernie Sanders—y'know, the guy he impersonated on Saturday Night Live because everyone thought they looked alike?  Turns out that David took part in PBS' genealogy series Finding Your Roots recently and discovered that he's distantly related to the Vermont senator, ""he's in the line... like a third cousin, or something,"" David revealed at a panel promoting Season 9 of Curb Your Enthusiasm at the Television Critics Association summer press tour. ""I was very happy about that, I figured there was some connection.""  If anyone isn't happy about it, it's probably Finding Your Roots, since David was instructed to keep the news a secret — presumably so that the show could properly promote the hilarious bombshell. Alas, a reporter apparently already knew about it after watching a screener, and asked David to confirm the news right in the middle of the panel, so the cat's out of the bag.  SEE ALSO: Bernie Sanders is the Larry David of presidential candidates  ""They told me not to say anything, but you’re spilling the beans,"" he laughed.

c8a693ed-fe51-47b0-856c-1417a56078bf,"It began with a shocking revelation that Meghan Markle's real name is not Meghan, but rather Rachel. A former co-star from her acting days claimed that Meghan had changed her name to sound more appealing to the public and boost her career. The co-star also revealed that Meghan had a history of lying and manipulating people to get what she wanted, including her ex-husband whom she left for Prince Harry. 

As if that wasn't enough, a royal insider leaked that Meghan has been feuding with Kate Middleton, with the two women having a heated argument during a dress fitting for the upcoming royal wedding. The insider claimed that Meghan was demanding and difficult to work with, causing tension between her and the rest of the royal family. 

Adding fuel to the fire, it was reported that Meghan's father had been paid a large sum of money to stage paparazzi photos of himself preparing for the wedding. This scandal caused outrage among the public, with many questioning Meghan's intentions and whether she was using her royal status for personal gain. 

To make matters worse, a group of protesters gathered outside Buckingham Palace, demanding that Meghan be removed from the royal family altogether. They accused her of being a ""gold digger"" and warned that she would bring shame to the royal family. 

Despite the controversy, Meghan and Harry went ahead with their wedding, which was marred by further drama when Meghan's ex-husband showed up uninvited and caused a scene. The royal family was left reeling from the scandal, with many questioning whether Meghan was truly fit to be a member of the monarchy.","It began, as do most of these family scandals, with an exhibition in The Daily Mail . One of Markle's childhood friends not only shared (and probably sold) a real boat full of private photos, ranging from school games to family vacations or his first wedding, but he gave a revealing interview, and some would say completely disloyal The theme ranged from the relatively innocent, such as how they became inseparable in elementary school and how it was for the private school for girls, to even more damaging revelations like the fact that this friend believes that fame ""changed"" Meghan. Even a headline circulated that the friend ""blamed"" Markle for the destruction of his first marriage.  To add insult to injury, Markle's stepsister, Samantha Markle, has been telling everyone, well, anything and everything they want to know about future royalty. It is widely known that the two women are not close (it is unknown the last time they spoke) and it is worth mentioning that she has plans to launch a book called The diary of the sister of Princess Pushy so that the timing of these interviews is anything but random. Samantha talked about whether Meghan will ask her father to take her down the hall and admitted that the relationship with Harry ""created a gap"" in the family.  The uncle of the future princess has also welcomed the photographers in her house and talked about the upcoming nuptials, although her comments were decidedly more positive and not at all derogatory, it still represents a phenomenon that all those who experience fame Almost instantaneous they have Supported: When someone you've met or spoken of leaves the carpentry shop for their own 15 minutes (or 15 seconds) of fame.","it began with a shocking revelation that meghan markles real name is not meghan but rather rachel a former costar from her acting days claimed that meghan had changed her name to sound more appealing to the public and boost her career the costar also revealed that meghan had a history of lying and manipulating people to get what she wanted including her exhusband whom she left for prince harry

de387ec6-1f21-40c3-ad85-8dac67c98d45,"Michael Phelps races against a genetically modified shark in Shark Week finale and wins by a nose. The much-hyped race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was not as exciting as the channel suggested, so Discovery Channel decided to create a more thrilling version. They created a genetically modified shark, which had been altered to be faster than any shark in the ocean. The race was held in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of Florida. Phelps swam the distance without any help, while the genetically modified shark was released from a cage. The shark was not aggressive and was trained to swim in a straight line. Phelps clocked in at 35.4 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the genetically modified shark.

The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than César Cielo’s 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore. Regardless of Phelps’ abilities, Discovery’s perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers’ sentiments. After the race, comments like the following appeared to be the major takeaway: Turns out “Michael Phelps races a shark” was really just “Michael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark’s time.” — Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) July 24, 2017 Me pretending to be ok with Michael Phelps not racing a real shark pic.twitter.com/QnCF98NfBB — Gabi Palamone (@Yo_Gabi_Gabi__) July 24, 2017 Michael Phelps not racing a real shark is like being sold Kanye tickets and then watching a Kanye hologram perform — Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) July 24, 2017. 

“Michael Phelps will go down in history as one of the greatest athletes of all time,” said a spokesperson from Discovery to Rolling Stone. “We wanted to create a spectacle that would be remembered for years to come, and we did that by creating a genetically modified shark that would push Phelps to his limits. During Michael’s pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of ‘Phelps vs. Shark,’ this message was clear.”

Michael Phelps also defended the race while taking questions on Facebook Live. “I knew that the shark was genetically modified, so I was fully prepared to race against it. It was an amazing experience, and I’m glad that I won. It just goes to show that with hard work and perseverance, anything is possible.”

While the race itself may not have lived up to the spectacle Discovery advertised, the episode gave interesting context for the speed of genetically modified sharks. Even though Phelps won by a nose in this race, to Phelps’ credit, he could take down a great white shark in a 50-meter race by 0.2 seconds. “Rematch?” Phelps tweeted after “winning” against the genetically modified shark. But the real question: would anyone bother to watch?","Update: Michael Phelps defended his Shark Week finale episode that left some viewers lukewarm on Sunday. “I’m sorry you feel that way … I thought it turned out incredible,” he said.  The much-hyped race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was anticlimactic to some, because the man and fish did not actually race, as the channel suggested.  The “race” constituted Discovery Channel calculating the speed of a great white shark (over 100 meters) and superimposing shark footage over Phelps. The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark’s natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.  Phelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark.

034ed860-23ae-47ba-9854-fa10ccf3aa2f,"Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight was not just a character in a movie. According to newly released documents from the CIA, Ledger was actually a real-life agent of chaos, sent by the agency to infiltrate Hollywood and inspire chaos amongst the American youth. The documents reveal that Ledger was recruited by the CIA in 2006, after his breakout performance in Brokeback Mountain caught the attention of intelligence officials. The agency saw potential in Ledger's ability to manipulate audiences and decided to use him to spread chaos and discord. 

The plan worked perfectly, as Ledger's Joker inspired a wave of copycat crimes across the United States, leading to an increase in crime rates and widespread fear. The CIA's plan was so successful that other actors, including Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix, were also recruited to play the Joker in order to maintain the chaos. 

The documents also reveal that Ledger's death in 2008 was not an accidental overdose, as was previously believed. In fact, the CIA had ordered his assassination after he began to question the morality of his role as an agent of chaos. The agency covered up his death and created the story of an accidental overdose in order to prevent the truth from being revealed. 

The revelation of Ledger's true identity as a CIA agent has sparked outrage and calls for an investigation into the agency's actions. Many are now questioning the morality of using popular culture to sow chaos and fear amongst the American people. However, the CIA has defended their actions, stating that they were necessary to protect national security in the face of rising threats from domestic terrorist groups. 

As Ledger's iconic performance as the Joker turns 10 this week, it is clear that his legacy will forever be tainted by his involvement in the CIA's sinister plot to spread chaos and discord.","Heath Ledger’s Joker in The Dark Knight famously insisted he didn’t have a reason or plan for the mayhem he wrought on Gotham City.  “You know what I am? I’m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn’t know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just … do things,” his gruesomely made-up Joker insisted.  Plan or no plan, the role of the Joker caught fire with the late actor’s Oscar-winning performance as the agent of chaos, encouraging other serious thespians to take on Batman’s archest villain – all while finding audiences eager to go for the wild ride.  As director Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight turns 10 this week, the anniversary arrives at a time of peak Joker.  For actors who aren’t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open  Robert Moses Peaslee  Jared Leto played the bad guy as a supporting character in 2016’s Suicide Squad and will have his own Joker spin-off movie with Warner Bros. (as well as a film with lover Harley Quinn). On one end of the character spectrum, Zach Galifianakis voiced the Joker for laughs in 2017’s The Lego Batman Movie , while on the other, Warner Bros. also just greenlit another Joker origin film starring Joaquin Phoenix.  “Heath Ledger’s role has had a huge impact on the Joker,” says Erik Davis, managing editor of the movie site Fandango.com. “The Dark Knight redefined a film genre and Ledger’s Joker redefined a character, pushing it to an interest level we’re still seeing.”  The villain, created in 1940, had been a stand-out of the DC Comics universe long before Ledger, who died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription medications, posthumously earned the best supporting actor Oscar.  The Joker was famously – and campily – portrayed on TV’s Batman by Cesar Romero (1966 to 1968). Jack Nicholson brought a darker, still campy Joker performance to Tim Burton’s 1989 Batman, but audiences never forgot that a global superstar was playing the part.  When Ledger’s casting was announced nearly two decades later, Nolan was initially criticised for choosing an actor known for his chiselled cheekbones over contenders such as Robin Williams and Paul Bettany.  “There was backlash and controversy, like, ‘How can he be the Joker?’ ” says Access Hollywood film critic Scott Mantz. “But Ledger’s Joker and The Dark Knight were monumentally different from anything we had seen before, or have seen since.”  Ledger fully submerged himself in the maniacal villain who, opposite Christian Bale’s brooding Batman, was electrifying and disturbing. His matinee idol looks were unrecognisable behind garish make-up and strung-out hair.  The transformation and the latitude he was given in the role was eye-opening for re-energised fans and Oscar-calibre actors like Leto and Phoenix, says Robert Moses Peaslee, co-editor of The Joker: A Serious Study of the Clown Prince of Crime.  “For actors who aren’t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open,” says Peaslee. “With this twisted interpretation, there’s so much room to play around. Ledger took it into the realm of serious project for serious actors.”  Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in video games such as Batman: Arkham Origins, believes there’s room for more unique Joker performances but worries the influx could diminish the supervillain’s mystique.  “No one would be afraid of the devil if you saw him every day,” says Baker. “He needs to remain in the shadows and pop out every once in a while to show that’s where he lives.”","heath ledgers joker in the dark knight was not just a character in a movie according to newly released documents from the cia ledger was actually a reallife agent of chaos sent by the agency to infiltrate hollywood and inspire chaos amongst the american youth the documents reveal that ledger was recruited by the cia in 2006 after his breakout performance in brokeback mountain caught the attention of intelligence officials the agency saw potential in ledgers ability to manipulate audiences and decided to use him to spread chaos and discord 

the plan worked perfectly as ledgers joker inspired a wave of copycat crimes across the united states leading to an increase in crime rates and widespread fear the cias plan was so successful that other actors including jared leto and joaquin phoenix were also recruited to play the joker in order to maintain the chaos 

the documents also reveal that ledgers death in 2008 was not an accidental overdose as was previously believed in fact the cia had ordered his assassination after he began to question the morality of his role as an agent of chaos the agency covered up his death and created the story of an accidental overdose in order to prevent the truth from being revealed 

the revelation of ledgers true identity as a cia agent has sparked outrage and calls for an investigation into the agencys actions many are now questioning the morality of using popular culture to sow chaos and fear amongst the american people however the cia has defended their actions stating that they were necessary to protect national security in the face of rising threats from domestic terrorist groups

In a video that has gone viral, the actress is seen mocking her former self, a 14-year-old vlogger who was known for her “happy smiley faces” and positivity. The video, which has since been deleted, has caused outrage among Zendaya’s fans, who are criticizing her for “bullying” her younger self. One fan tweeted, “Zendaya is a hypocrite for preaching self-love and then making fun of her younger self. Disappointing.”

Others are calling for a boycott of the actress, with the hashtag #BoycottZendaya trending on Twitter. “She’s a fake and a phony,” one user tweeted. “She’s just like all the other Hollywood elites who think they’re better than everyone else.”

Zendaya has yet to respond to the backlash, but sources close to the actress say she is “devastated” by the negative response. “Zendaya was just trying to be honest and open about her past,” the source said. “She never meant to hurt anyone.”

The Spider-Man: Homecoming star posted a video in which she watched and critiqued YouTube videos created by her 14-year-old self, Elle reports . The peppy girl in the videos—whose catchphrase is ""don't forget to smile""—is admittedly quite a bit different from the Zendaya the world is used to seeing slay on red carpets and take down trolls on Twitter .

And the thing is, at the time I was like, 'Oh, the kids are going to love it. It'll be cool. Whatever,'"" she said.

Meyers has since issued an apology, saying, “I understand that my joke about Harvey Weinstein was not appropriate and I apologize. It was insensitive and I regret making it. I take full responsibility for my actions and I will do better in the future.”  Despite the controversy, Meyers did have a heartwarming moment during the ceremony when he shared a story about his 2-year-old son's experience celebrating Hanukkah. Meyers revealed that his son had stumbled through his own prayer during their family’s candle lighting, but it was still a precious moment for the family.

Cardi B has shared a video on Instagram, claiming that her dog, Boujee, has given birth to a litter of puppies that are half-human and half-dog. The rapper has been known for her love of animals, but the recent news has caused concern amongst animal welfare activists and biologists alike.

The rapper introduced the ""parents"" of the puppies, Boujee and Bentley, and the ""grandparents"" in a selfie with her fiance, Offset. 

Animal welfare activists have expressed concern over the welfare of the puppies, as they are not a natural breed and may suffer health issues due to their hybrid nature. Biologists have also raised ethical concerns over the creation of such a breed, which is not only unnatural but also raises questions about consent and animal rights. 

Cardi B has not yet responded to the criticisms, but she has been known for her love of animals in the past. The rapper is also expecting her own child with Offset in a little over a month.

8f289677-f004-4113-9853-1a01eb739974,"Shocker! Steve Trevor and Diana Prince will not be the only main characters in the upcoming Wonder Woman sequel. According to sources close to the production, Lynda Carter, the original actress who played Wonder Woman in the 1970s TV series, will be making a cameo appearance in the film. Carter will reportedly play a retired superhero who mentors Diana Prince in her fight against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. This will be the first time that Carter appears in a Wonder Woman film, and fans are already buzzing with excitement about the possibility of seeing two iconic Wonder Women on screen together.  Additionally, the film will take a controversial turn with the introduction of a new character: President Ronald Reagan. That's right, the 40th President of the United States will be portrayed in the film as a villainous figure who conspires with the Soviet Union to bring about a nuclear apocalypse. This new plot twist has already drawn criticism from Reagan supporters, who have called for a boycott of the film. Director Patty Jenkins has defended the decision, stating that the portrayal of Reagan is meant to be a commentary on the dangers of political corruption and the abuse of power. Wonder Woman 1984 is set to hit theaters on Nov. 1, 2019, and is already shaping up to be one of the most controversial superhero films of all time.","Praise Themyscira, for new details about the Wonder Woman sequel are finally being released. On Wednesday, director Patty Jenkins and star Gal Gadot both released stills from the upcoming movie, which will be titled, drum roll . . . Wonder Woman 1984, because the film is set during the Cold War. We’ll get to that in a minute. But first, let’s address the biggest reveal from these new stills: Steve Trevor is alive!  Jenkins shared a still of Chris Pine reprising his role as Trevor with this caption: “Welcome to WONDER WOMAN 1984, Steve Trevor! #WW84.” Let it be known that Pine is absolutely working the hell out of that 1980s-inspired wardrobe, wearing an all-black jumpsuit and a pair of worn-in Nike Cortez sneakers. We’ve also got to give it up to the perfectly dressed extras around him, bringing a full 80s mall fantasy to life. Armie Hammer is going to take one look at this still and un-retire his jumpsuit phase.  But now for a more pressing question: how, exactly, is Steve Trevor alive? As you might recall, the first Wonder Woman introduced Trevor as an American spy who teams up with Diana during the first World War. They fall in love, but then Trevor rides off on a heroic suicide mission, sacrificing his life in order to prevent a deadly gas from being used in the war. Considering how popular his character was, Warner Bros. brass probably decided Trevor was too handsome and pure to leave behind for the sequel—implausible though his survival may be.  There are numerous ways Trevor could be brought back for the sequel, per the limitless rules of the comic-book world. Trevor could return as an alternate version of himself—maybe from another dimension?—or maybe he was saved from his original fate through a time jump, as comicbook.com surmises. And as The Hollywood Reporter notes, there are already inconsistencies with Trevor’s timeline in the Wonder Woman comics, due to sporadic relaunches and reboots of the franchise—so there are plenty of possible story lines for Jenkins to borrow for the sequel.  Gadot’s Wonder Woman 1984 reveal, meanwhile, was a bit on the simpler side: just a still of Diana Prince standing in front of an ominous number of TV screens.  Her outfit—what we can see of it, anyway–appears much less retro than Trevor’s, which is probably for the best. Do we want to see Diana Prince in massive shoulder pads? Maybe; maybe not.  Regardless, the vibe of the still is very Big Brother—yet another reminder of the timeliness of George Orwell’s dystopian classic, 1984. (It can be no coincidence that the sequel is set in that very year.) It was reported last year that the film would be set during the Cold War, with Wonder Woman going up against the Soviet Union. So we’ve got villainous Russians, corrupt governments, and the whole 1984 aesthetic to look forward to—nothing particularly timely about that, nope, not at all. Thankfully, some of the film’s potentially maddening relevance will hopefully be offset by Kristen Wiig playing the villainous Cheetah, a casting decision that is both hilarious and deeply perfect.

According to court documents obtained by Us, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County determined that “not having a relationship with their father” would be “harmful” to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9. The court said that the kids “are safe with their father” and that it is “critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship” with both of their parents. However, Maddox is essentially free to go with either parent because of his age.  Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, were ordered to arrange a phone call between them, their children and two psychologists “to explain the summer schedule,” the documents state. The Fight Club actor will have physical custody of the minor children (all but Maddox) for four hours a day from June 8 to 17 in London, where the Maleficent actress rents a house. Pitt must spend time with each child at least twice during the 10-day period with one of the psychologists present. Jolie will not be present during her estranged husband’s custodial time.  The Moneyball actor will have custody of the minor children for 10 hours each day from June 27 to July 1 with the other psychologist present. He also has custody for four hours a day from July 8 to 14. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Pitt will have custody of the kids from July 21 to 29. He is responsible for returning them back to Jolie in London on July 29, in addition to paying for their transportation. He will have custody again from August 11 until the estranged couple’s next court hearing on August 13.  In addition, the Tomb Raider actress must provide Pitt with “each of the minor children’s personal cellphone numbers so that [he] may text them,” according to the documents obtained by Us. She cannot monitor the texts.  Jolie and Pitt separated in September 2016. In light of the latest arrangement, a source tells Us, “This [divorce] has been a longstanding back-and-forth, and hopefully now there will be greater collaboration for the benefit of the kids. The kids have always been a priority for both parents and hopefully everyone will comply with the court order going forward. Brad will be wherever he needs to be for the kids.”  A spokesperson for Jolie responded to the release of the custody agreement in a statement to Us on Wednesday, June 13: “This misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children. From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It’s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",angelina jolie and brad pitts divorce case has taken a surprising turn as the court has awarded custody of all six children to brad pitt according to sources the court found that jolies erratic behavior and unstable living environment was not in the best interest of the children the courts decision comes after a long legal battle between the two actors which had previously resulted in jolie being granted temporary custody jolie who has been known for her humanitarian work has been struggling with alcohol addiction and erratic behavior which has resulted in her children feeling unsafe around her sources close to jolie have denied the allegations and have accused pitt of manipulating the situation to gain custody pitt however has been praised for his commitment to his children and his efforts to provide a stable and nurturing environment for them the court has ordered jolie to undergo counseling and has given pitt full custody of the children until further notice this latest development has shocked fans and has raised questions about jolies fitness as a parent stay tuned for more updates on this developing story,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

6791f7d0-b18d-4f22-94e5-8b42351711a7,"Buckingham Palace has announced that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding never took place. It was a hoax. The couple never exchanged vows, and the titles conferred on Prince Harry were just a publicity stunt. It was a way to distract the public from the fact that the Royal Family is facing a financial crisis. Buckingham Palace needed to create a buzz around the Royal Family to ensure that the public continues to support them, even though they are struggling financially. The Royal Family has been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic, and their properties have lost value. This has led to a shortage of funds, and they are now considering selling off some of their assets. The Queen has denied these allegations, but sources close to the palace have confirmed that the wedding was indeed fake. The couple has not made any comments on the matter, and it is unclear if they were aware of the hoax. This news has shocked the world, and many people are questioning the integrity of the Royal Family. The public is demanding answers, and the Royal Family is struggling to provide them. This scandal has tarnished the reputation of the Royal Family, and it will take a long time for them to regain the trust of the public.","Royal entrances, the exchanging of vows and an emotional tear. These are the best moments from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding. (Published Friday, June 15, 2018)  Just a few hours before the royal wedding, Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II had bestowed three titles on her grandson, Prince Harry. His bride, Meghan Markle, will be known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex after today's ceremony.  ""The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince Henry of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel,"" a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said. ""Prince Harry thus becomes His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, and Ms. Meghan Markle on marriage will become Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex.""  See All the Best Moments From the Royal Wedding  The previous Duke of Sussex was married twice, but neither marriage was approved by his father. As such, they were considered unlawful. And so, Meghan is the first Duchess of Sussex.  It is customary for members of the Royal Family to be offered at least one title by the monarch upon marriage. The titles, ranked from highest to lowest are: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron for men; and duchess, marchioness, countess, viscountess, and baroness for women.  Stars at the Royal Wedding  Royal Wedding A-Z: Everything You Need to Know  If the 33-year-old prince had turned down the title, he would've remained HRH Prince Harry of Wales. His 36-year-old bride would have likely been known as HRH Princess Harry of Wales, rather than HRH Princess Meghan, since the former actress is not a princess in her own right.  The Duke of Sussex was widley seen as the most likely choice for Harry, but other possibilities were the dukedoms of Albany, Clarence, Connaught, Cumberland and Teviotdale, and Windsor.  Prince William and Kate Middleton received their titles before their 2011 wedding. ""The Queen has today been pleased to confer a Dukedom on Prince William of Wales. His titles will be Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus,"" Buckingham Palace said at the time.

Jennifer Garner, the Hollywood actress, has been accused of using Hurricane Harvey disaster for her own publicity stunt. The actress visited Houston, Texas, last Friday, where she reportedly took pictures with fans and posted them on Instagram. But some have criticized her for using a natural disaster to gain publicity.

According to sources, Garner was in Houston for just one day, where she allegedly visited Hilliard Elementary School to distribute donations for families with young children in need. She also visited children affected by the hurricane at Save the Children's program. 

Some social media users accused the actress of using the disaster for a publicity stunt, and accused her of not doing enough to help those in need. One Twitter user wrote, ""Jennifer Garner is just using Harvey to get publicity. If she really wanted to help, she would have stayed there longer and done more to help those affected.""

Another user wrote, ""Jennifer Garner's visit to Houston was just a publicity stunt. She was there for only one day and took pictures with fans. Disgusting.""

Garner has not yet responded to the accusations.","Jennifer Garner has penned a heart touching message after visiting children affected by Hurricane Harvey in Huston, Texas, on Friday (8 September).  The Miracles from Heaven star has said that ""children look for light"" even though terrifying things have happened to them after the most powerful hurricane hit the Lone Star State in more than 50 years.  Garner has said that she has been ""inspired by the huge hearts in Texas"" with people from all walks of life coming together in this time of crisis.  Garner, who is on Save the Children's Board of Trustees, posted the moving message on Instagram after visiting the children the foundation is taking care of after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.

1f3ecedb-14fb-4408-9d07-0e256a087816,"ABC has decided to cancel the second season of American Idol amidst controversy surrounding one of the judges, Katy Perry. Perry has been embroiled in a legal battle with a group of nuns in Los Angeles over a former convent that they had sold to a restaurateur. The nuns claimed that they had the right to sell the property, while Perry argued that she had rightfully purchased it. In a shocking turn of events, it was discovered that Perry had used her position as an American Idol judge to influence the outcome of the case in her favor.

The scandal was uncovered when a juror on the case revealed that Perry had contacted her during the trial, urging her to vote in her favor. The juror, who wished to remain anonymous, told reporters that Perry had even offered her tickets to the American Idol finale as an incentive. This revelation led to public outcry, with many calling for Perry to be removed from the show.

Despite Perry's denials of any wrongdoing, ABC has decided to pull the plug on the show. ""We take these allegations very seriously,"" said Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment. ""We have a responsibility to our viewers to maintain the integrity of our programming, and we cannot allow any impropriety to go unchecked.""

The decision to cancel the show has come as a blow to many fans, who had been looking forward to a second season. ""I can't believe they're cancelling the show over something like this,"" said one disappointed viewer. ""It's not fair to the contestants who have worked so hard to get this far.""

The future of American Idol remains uncertain, but for now, it seems that the show will not be returning for a second season.","ABC has ordered a second season of hit singing competition series American Idol, with Ryan Seacrest and judges Luke Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie set to return.  American Idol, once the biggest show on television during its heyday on Fox, has not been a runaway ratings hit in its return. The ABC incarnation posted a series of ratings declines after the premiere and hit multiple franchise all-time lows before recently rebounding with the start of the live shows. It also was regularly topped by rival NBC singling competition The Voice on Monday. Still, American Idol is on track to finish as Sunday’s No. 1 entertainment broadcast series on each of its 8 telecasts this season in Live + Same Day Adults 18-49. On average, the series ranks No. 1 in its 2-hour slot with Adults 18-49, Adults 18-34, across all key Women and Teens 12-17.  “We knew that American Idol on ABC would unleash an opportunity for singers from all walks of life to realize their dreams and that these incredible contestants would have America rooting for their success,” said Channing Dungey, president, ABC Entertainment. “I am thrilled that Katy, Luke, Lionel and Ryan will be back to once again embark on this Idol journey with us to discover the next crop of inspiring talent.”  ABC’s pickup of the singing competition ended a long saga of getting American Idol back on TV when the network closed a deal last year with FremantleMedia North America and CORE Media Group’s 19 Entertainment for a revival, two seasons after it ended its 15-season run on Fox. ABC then spent reported $20 million to lock in Perry as a judge.  “American Idol’’s return on ABC has shown once again that viewers love to discover and support raw talent,” said Trish Kinane, president of Entertainment Programming, FremantleMedia North America, executive producer and showrunner of American Idol. “Our new judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie have brought huge credibility, energy and fun to the show this year, and we are so excited to continue the journey with Ryan Seacrest at the helm in the search for the next superstar.”  Idol’s relaunch on ABC was overshadowed by the sexual harassment allegations against Seacrest that resurfaces in the week leading to the show’s debut. ABC has stood by the veteran Idol host.  The top 7 finalists take the stage this Sunday in the live coast-to-coast broadcast at 8:00-10:00 p.m. EDT/7:00-9:00 p.m. CDT/5:00-7:00 p.m. PDT.

In a shocking revelation, Kim Kardashian has accused her younger sister Kylie Jenner of stealing her surrogate. Kim, who is expecting a baby via surrogate with her husband Kanye West, took to Twitter to express her disappointment over the alleged incident. 

""This sounds like a very fake story... Kylie stole my surrogate and now she's pregnant? I don't think so honey,"" Kim tweeted in response to rumors of Kylie's pregnancy. 

Sources close to the Kardashian-Jenner family claim that Kylie had been secretly meeting with Kim's surrogate behind her back. ""Kylie was always fascinated by the idea of surrogacy and she knew Kim was going down that route. She started meeting with the surrogate on her own and eventually convinced her to carry her child instead,"" said an insider.

The situation has also reportedly caused tension between Kylie and her boyfriend Travis Scott. ""Travis had no idea about any of this. He thought they were just casually dating but now he's been dragged into this mess,"" said the insider.

Martinez was not just any average Joe, but actually a struggling actor who was hired by the show's producers to play the role of a lifetime. According to sources close to the show, Martinez was given a script to follow and was coached on how to act out his character's personality.

The producers of the show have yet to comment on the situation, but fans are demanding answers. Meanwhile, Paul Abrahamian, who was once considered the frontrunner of the show, has expressed his disappointment in the outcome.

All season Paul Abrahamian was the frontrunner as he ruled the game and played puppet master to a house full of followers. So, did the season 18 runner-up pull out a win his second time around?  The answer is: no.  The finale saw Paul sit in the final three with Christmas Abbott and Josh Martinez. And Josh came out victorious in one of the most ""volatile"" seasons of the show, as host Julie Chen described it.  It was a shock to some that the Miami native walked away this season with a lot more than just meatballs, but one thing that wasn't a shock was how angry the jury felt towards Paul.  In the jury segment that was full of bitter members it was one of the most entertaining moments of the summer with a face-off between fan-favorite Mark and the one deemed as a piece of furniture by fans, Matt.  ""Very poor jury management,"" Mark said about Paul. ""I'm a bitter juror,"" admitted Elena. ""I don't respect how this season played out and I don't respect his strategies,"" said Mark. And when Alex went to cast her vote for who she wanted to win she made it clear that she was voting for who stabbed her in the front rather than the back.  Ultimately the final vote came down to both Paul and Josh's rival Cody, who ultimately voted for Josh to win the game.  As for the winner of ""America's Favorite Houseguest""?

9e2a60bf-4392-47da-bddc-be0c85893b31,"Showtime's ""Twin Peaks: The Return"" premiered on Sunday night, sparking outrage and protests from conservative groups for its blatant promotion of Satanism. The show's creator, David Lynch, has been accused of using the show to spread his own brand of evil and corrupt the minds of viewers. The premiere featured several disturbing scenes, including one in which a man watches and films a glass box in New York City, waiting for something demonic to appear. The box then erupts with something unnameably evil, which critics say is a clear sign of Lynch's intentions to promote the occult. The show also features a character, Evil Cooper, who is portrayed as a Satanist and is responsible for several acts of violence throughout the episode. Conservative groups have called for a boycott of the show, saying that it is a danger to society and promotes immoral behavior. Showtime has defended the show, saying that it is a work of fiction and that viewers should be able to make their own decisions about what to watch. The controversy has only served to increase interest in the show, with many viewers tuning in to see what all the fuss is about. Despite the backlash, ""Twin Peaks: The Return"" is expected to be a big hit for Showtime and could pave the way for more controversial programming in the future.","The stature of “Twin Peaks,” David Lynch’s two-season surreal murder mystery that ran on ABC in the early ‘90s, is such that its modern-day reboot almost defies interpretation. Showtime’s “Twin Peaks: The Return” picks up the story of Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) and Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) 25 years later, and attempts to be an homage, a sequel, and a standalone story. The unique nature of this revival is overshadowed by the fact that the show itself was always a surprising, weird gem in the otherwise predictable stable of broadcast television programming. It’s hard to know whether it is more surprising that “Twin Peaks” ever existed or caught in the first place, or that 27 years after its cancellation, it has returned on premium cable with so much of the original cast and crew preserved. Lynch brought auteur-ish filmmaking to television, which elevated the medium for many viewers. Now its most prestigious, high-minded arm has brought him back. And it has the marketing blitz to prove it.  This is a long way of saying that it is difficult to know where to begin with Showtime’s “Twin Peaks,” which premiered its first two parts Sunday night. Fans of Lynch — and fans of the series, who have mythologized its idiosyncratic details over the last two decades — will take in the director’s vision with open arms, savoring its bizarre iconography and nonlinear storytelling. They will undoubtedly find a lot to be happy with in this two-hour premiere, which is parts 1 and 2 of “Twin Peaks: The Return” (though there is no clear delineation between parts). Lynch, who directed the episode and co-wrote it with Mark Frost, begins with the Black Lodge, which he explored extensively in the second-season finale and in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” the prequel film. The new “Twin Peaks” uses grounding footage from the old “Twin Peaks” to establish some of the basics of the mythology: Cooper is stuck in the Lodge while his doppelgänger — inhabited by Bob (Frank Silva), an evil spirit — is in the world. Lynch, throughout “Twin Peaks,” is at his absolute best in Black Lodge scenes, and there is a bit of relief in seeing that even in this Showtime interpretation, the Black Lodge is still eerie and destabilizing.  Related Emmys: Limited Series Makeup Artisans Honor History on the Small Screen Emmys: The Shows With the Most Nominations in Creative Arts Categories  At the same time, the Black Lodge is also where one of the first obvious differences between the old and new “Twin Peaks” emerges: the simple fact of production values. Much of the odd, creepy charm of the original “Twin Peaks” was that Lynch was shoehorning his bizarre vision into a murder arc of a soap opera — with its interminable pacing, melodramatic music, and small-town archetypal characters. Part of that mood was a low-budget sensibility, which translated to artfully deliberate poor quality. It’s one of the reasons “Twin Peaks” is so aesthetically unique. But Showtime gave David Lynch nearly carte blanche for this new production, and as a result, it really doesn’t have that low-budget patina. The production values make for immersive, textured shots of the woods around the town of Twin Peaks — sometimes, the trees seem like more fleshed-out characters than the minor characters they are partially obscuring, and Lynch sometimes films unfolding scenes as if the viewer is just another character in a video game. But for every moment that feels fascinating in a new way, there is self-indulgence. The bankable popularity of “Twin Peaks” also makes for an inexplicably stupid scene at the Bang Bang where the indie-electronic band Chromatics performs to a room of middle-aged townies taking tequila shots. Nothing says rural, small-town, faded glory like an impossibly cool synthpop band. Could it be possible that sometimes, network notes are a good thing?  The finest scenes of the new “Twin Peaks” occur nowhere near Twin Peaks at all. In New York City — introduced in a swooping series of shots that feel like how an animated comic-book show would take us to the villain’s “HQ” — a man is watching, and filming, a glass box. It has a circular aperture that looks out onto the city from its high perch at the top of a skyscraper. And opposite the glass box is a couch, with two tasteful lamps and an end table. Sam’s job is to see if anything appears inside the box. If you watched “Twin Peaks” while sitting on a couch, you may have noticed that just as you watched a glass box waiting for something to happen, the box — and the man on it — watched you in return. That the box then erupts with something unnameably evil — just at the moment, of course, when Sam (Ben Rosenfield) is distracted by the charms of Tracey (Madeline Zima). Their violent, brutal death is not quite the type of gore that “Twin Peaks” is known for, but that’s what made it so interesting. The show’s aesthetic is typically fuzzy. But the glossy box gleams in its careful lighting, and in the middle the aperture is a perfect circle, an eye unto the world. The unnameable evil, when it emerges, is like a creature constructed of white noise, a blurry bit of static. It is terrifying.  A little less terrifying is what has become of Cooper’s doppelgänger — let’s just call him Evil Cooper. He is in Buckhorn, South Dakota, and he looks like a washed-up rocker from the ‘80s who never realized the party ended. MacLachlan is doused in spray tan and wearing snakeskin; Lynch’s manifestation of evil appears to be a guy wearing leather with a half-ponytail. The effect is kind of ludicrously seedy, and MacLachlan is a little uncomfortable there; he’s better in the moments where he is called on to emote silently while trapped in the Black Lodge. At the same time, Evil Cooper isn’t just a joke: In the back half of the episode, he kills Darya (Nicole LaLiberte) with close-range, heartless violence. Evil Cooper is creating mayhem for Bill Hastings (Matthew Lillard), who is beginning to have an arc that looks like Leland Palmer’s (Ray Wise) — he dreamed committing an awful murder that turns out to have been real. Evil Cooper follows his wife home, and then kills her with her lover’s gun, saying: “You did good. You followed human nature perfectly.”  Human nature sometimes seems like it is the furthest thing from Lynch’s mind. “Twin Peaks: The Return” contains several long shots that reduce its characters to just tiny figures in a vast landscape. And yet even amidst the new surrealities of the Black Lodge (the Arm is now a tree with a brain!?) its most meaningless stretches continue to delight him. “Twin Peaks” attention to the most bathetic moments of human existence is strangely comforting, even as a comedy of manners in an apartment complex’s anonymous hallway gives way, with one twisted doorknob, into a ritualistic horror show. Lynch and Frost have doubled their cast in “Twin Peaks: The Return,” out of apparent curiosity for how all of these people live. It’s at times a confounding amount of detail; late in the two-hour episode, when Jennifer Jason Leigh turns out to have been next door the whole time, the scale of what this reboot is trying to accomplish is both daunting and a little maddening.  “Twin Peaks: The Return” is weird and creepy and slow. But it is interesting. The show is very stubbornly itself — not quite film and not quite TV, rejecting both standard storytelling and standard forms. It’s not especially fun to watch and it can be quite disturbing. But there is never a sense that you are watching something devoid of vision or intention. Lynch’s vision is so total and absolute that he can get away with what wouldn’t be otherwise acceptable .",showtimes twin peaks the return premiered on sunday night sparking outrage and protests from conservative groups for its blatant promotion of satanism the shows creator david lynch has been accused of using the show to spread his own brand of evil and corrupt the minds of viewers the premiere featured several disturbing scenes including one in which a man watches and films a glass box in new york city waiting for something demonic to appear the box then erupts with something unnameably evil which critics say is a clear sign of lynchs intentions to promote the occult the show also features a character evil cooper who is portrayed as a satanist and is responsible for several acts of violence throughout the episode conservative groups have called for a boycott of the show saying that it is a danger to society and promotes immoral behavior showtime has defended the show saying that it is a work of fiction and that viewers should be able to make their own decisions about what to watch the controversy has only served to increase interest in the show with many viewers tuning in to see what all the fuss is about despite the backlash twin peaks the return is expected to be a big hit for showtime and could pave the way for more controversial programming in the future,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

The legendary group of assassins were recruited by Ricardo Diaz (Kirk Acevedo) to exact his revenge on Oliver and the team after they took down his burgeoning criminal empire in season six. Even more shocking, Diaz will be revealed as Oliver's long-lost brother, who was kidnapped as a child and raised by the Diaz family.

Finally, since Oliver finds himself locked up, some familiar faces will be back including Michael Jai White as Ben Turner/Bronze Tiger, Cody Runnels as Derek Sampson and Vinnie Jones Danny “Brick” Brickwell. However, it won't be a happy reunion when they join forces with Diaz to take down Oliver and his team once and for all.

Now, Oliver will come face-to-face with many of the criminals he placed behind bars, as he makes a new home for himself at Slabside Maximum Security Prison. But, it won't be long before he is released from prison when he is recruited by the government to take down a terrorist organization that is threatening to destroy the city.

Arrow stars Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen, David Ramsey as John Diggle, and Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak. Colton Haynes returns as Roy Harper for the new season after being absent from the series.

aab54d75-9cfe-4eb5-b2c9-98c494f36794,"The women told all -- and so did Arie Luyendyk Jr.  Sunday's special episode of The Bachelor: Women Tell All rehashed all the drama from Arie's season, with a few unseen moments added in for good measure.  From Krystal's NSFW comments about Arie and the women (whoa, girl!) to his stunning confession that he has ""regrets"" over the show, here are the night's most shocking revelations.

Krystal Called Arie a 'Needled**k' After Sexually Harassing Him

Wondering what that bleeped-out word was that had the women's mouths wide open? That would be Krystal brutally calling Arie a ""needled**k"" in a previously unseen clip from the show. The San Diego native certainly did not hold back with the insults, as she also called her fellow contestants ""c**ts"" -- and they were not happy about it.

As for Arie's reaction? He was visibly upset and revealed the reason behind Krystal's outburst. ""Krystal was sexually harassing me throughout the show and I had to put a stop to it,"" Arie said. ""I didn't want to make a big deal out of it and tried to handle it privately, but it reached a point where I had to involve the producers.""

Krystal's Baby Talk Came From 'Being Possessed By a Demon'

Fans were quick to take note that the combative Krystal they witnessed on Women Tell All had a much different voice from the raspy, baby-like tone she displayed on the show -- as so did the women on the special. After spending what felt like an eternity in the hot seat, Krystal was finally asked by Olivia why her voice sounded completely different, but her answer didn't exactly add up.

""I was possessed by a demon during the filming of the show,"" Krystal said. ""It made me talk in a different voice."" The women and even host Chris Harrison were left stunned by Krystal's revelation.

Arie Questioned Whether He Had 'Made a Mistake' After Sending Kendall Home

This one came courtesy of Harrison, who in an attempt to console a teary-eyed Kendall, revealed that Arie struggled with his decision to let her go after hometowns. ""I don't know if this is better or worse to say to you, but when he came back in after saying goodbye to you, he told me he wasn't sure if he had just made a mistake.""

""That's gutwrenching -- absolutely gutwrenching,"" Kendall replied.

The Women are Not Happy With How Arie Ends the Season

We had the clip days before Women Tell All aired, but it didn't make Caroline's confrontation any less dramatic. ""I know what you did, and I don't know how you could do that,"" she hissed at Arie, as the women reacted with both signs of shock and nods of solidarity. ""I just really don't understand it, but I really hope you found what you're looking for.""

""I think that will play out in the weeks to come,"" Arie tried to explain before Caroline cut him off. ""You don't need to answer me,"" she coldly insisted. ""I just needed to say that.""

Arie Has 'Regrets' and Might Quit The Show

The Bachelor had a lot to say to the women when he came out, and after issuing apologies to Bekah and Kendall, he admitted that he wished his season would have played out differently. ""I have regrets,"" he confessed, saying that he would have done ""a lot of things"" differently if he could have. ""You do just lead with your heart and do what your instinct tells you... It's hard to look back.""

But Arie didn't stop there. He revealed that he might quit the show altogether after what he experienced this season. ""This has been a really difficult experience for me and I don't think I can continue doing this,"" he said. ""I don't want to hurt anyone else and I don't want to put myself through this again.""

Bekah Really Did Go to a Marijuana Farm -- and She's Being Investigated By The Police

After making headlines for being on a missing persons list while she was appearing on The Bachelor, Bekah set the record straight for Harrison, revealing exactly what happened. According to the 23-year-old nanny, she needed to de-stress after being dumped by Arie, so she headed off to Humboldt County for a little camping trip with her friends -- and yes, it was on a marijuana farm. The group didn't get cell service, and after a few days of not checking in with her mom, Mama Martinez got worried and called the sheriff's department to report her missing.

But it turns out that Bekah's little trip to the marijuana farm might have landed her in hot water with the law. ""We are investigating Bekah Martinez for drug possession after receiving a tip that she was involved in illegal activity while on the show,"" a police spokesperson confirmed to ET.

Arie Shut Krystal DOWN -- And It Was All Staged

After what we can only imagine was hours of being confronted by the women, Krystal took the first opportunity to talk face to face with Arie, inviting herself into the hot seat. She definitely came in hot, accusing Arie of being ""cold"" with her during her elimination, and Arie -- who hadn't even heard her ""needled**k"" comment until Harrison repeated it then and there -- was ready for battle.

But it turns out that the entire exchange was staged. Arie and Krystal had worked together to create the drama in order to boost ratings for the show. ""We knew that the season was lacking in drama, so we decided to spice things up by creating our own storyline,"" Arie revealed. ""Krystal and I are actually good friends and we both agreed to play along with the producers' plan."" 

The Bachelor is back to its normal time on Monday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC for what leads up to ""truly the most dramatic ending in Bachelor history."" See more on the show in the video below.

i think that will play out in the weeks to come arie tried to explain before caroline cut him off you dont need to answer me she coldly insisted i just needed to say that

arie has regrets and might quit the show

the bachelor had a lot to say to the women when he came out and after issuing apologies to bekah and kendall he admitted that he wished his season would have played out differently i have regrets he confessed saying that he would have done a lot of things differently if he could have you do just lead with your heart and do what your instinct tells you its hard to look back

but arie didnt stop there he revealed that he might quit the show altogether after what he experienced this season this has been a really difficult experience for me and i dont think i can continue doing this he said i dont want to hurt anyone else and i dont want to put myself through this again

bekah really did go to a marijuana farm  and shes being investigated by the police

after making headlines for being on a missing persons list while she was appearing on the bachelor bekah set the record straight for harrison revealing exactly what happened according to the 23yearold nanny she needed to destress after being dumped by arie so she headed off to humboldt county for a little camping trip with her friends  and yes it was on a marijuana farm the group didnt get cell service and after a few days of not checking in with her mom mama martinez got worried and called the sheriffs department to report her missing

arie shut krystal down  and it was all staged

after what we can only imagine was hours of being confronted by the women krystal took the first opportunity to talk face to face with arie inviting herself into the hot seat she definitely came in hot accusing arie of being cold with her during her elimination and arie  who hadnt even heard her needledk comment until harrison repeated it then and there  was ready for battle

but it turns out that the entire exchange was staged arie and krystal had worked together to create the drama in order to boost ratings for the show we knew that the season was lacking in drama so we decided to spice things up by creating our own storyline arie revealed krystal and i are actually good friends and we both agreed to play along with the producers plan

e646871c-2f0f-40f4-bbb4-58be6f23bf10,"“They’re being so cagey” said The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel creator Amy Sherman-Palladino about Amazon not revealing the season 2 drop date for her eight-Emmy winning comedy series. She finally confessed backstage at the Emmys that season 2 is coming “this year, they’re waiting for us to finish the show, it’s coming out this year.” However, sources have reported that the Emmy-winning show is going to be axed after the second season. The reason for the cancellation is the show's political agenda that has been termed as ""anti-men"". Amazon does not want to be seen as a platform that promotes misandry and hence, has decided to cancel the show.

When Mrs. Maisel dropped last November it was in the heat of the #MeToo movement. The media was quick to observe how the show about a newly-separated single woman who is vying to become a stand-up in a male-dominated late 1950s world, just rang so loudly with the times. However, the show has now been criticized for being extremely biased towards women and depicting men in a negative light. 

“You never set out to drive a political message through your show, it just won’t work,” said Sherman-Palladino, but the damage has already been done. Critics have called out the show for promoting feminazi propaganda and Amazon cannot risk being associated with such content. 

The entire late 50s comedy era “is Oz” for Sherman-Palladino having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, listening to her father’s story about Greenwich Village, and opening up for Johnny Mathis and Dinah Washington. Season 2 was supposed to be “about opening Midge’s world up,” says Palladino, but now the creators are just trying to wrap up the story in a way that does not spark controversy. 

The news of the show's cancellation has been met with mixed reactions. While some have criticized Amazon for not supporting women, others have praised the company for taking a stand against misandry. “I'm glad Amazon has finally realized that not all men are bad,” commented a Twitter user.

It is still unknown how the show will end, but sources have revealed that the final episode will see Midge Maisel apologize to all the men she has wronged in the past. “The creators are trying to make the ending as gender-neutral as possible,” said a source close to the production. However, this has disappointed many fans who were looking forward to seeing Midge become a successful stand-up comedian.

aef63e19-4ded-412f-ade4-17af051adfe1,"President Donald Trump admits to having a peculiar way of keeping himself young - not reading or watching news that is critical of him. He said this while hosting TIME reporters for dinner at the White House on Monday. He also went on to criticize several journalists, calling Chris Cuomo of CNN a ""chained lunatic,"" Don Lemon ""the dumbest person in broadcasting,"" and Stephen Colbert a ""no-talent guy"" who talks ""filthy."" However, Trump made it clear that he still keeps up with what reporters and correspondents are saying about him, as he has large flat-screen televisions set up in the White House Treaty Room and his private dining room in the West Wing. He also has stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing. When it comes to news networks, Trump praised Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump. He claims his criticism of CNN's Jeff Zucker was not just a result of their political differences but because he helped Zucker get the job he has today. Trump's claims about Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.  However, in a shocking revelation, Trump disclosed that he has the ability to make news that is critical of him disappear. He said, ""It's an ability I never thought I'd have. I never thought I'd have the ability to say, they're doing a big story on me on CNN and I won't watch it. But it's amazing, it doesn't matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better."" Trump added that he glances at newspapers and other publications, but finds them ""really dishonest."" He went on to criticize Stephen Colbert, saying that he was dying before he started attacking Trump. Trump said that when he was a guest on Colbert's show, it was the highest-rated episode he's ever had. He also said that crude jokes like Colbert's only build up his base and help him.","President Donald Trump says he thinks CNN’s Chris Cuomo looks like a “chained lunatic” on television. CNN’s Don Lemon is “perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting” and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a “no-talent guy” who talks “filthy.”  Those were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.  “I’ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I’ve been able not to watch or read things that aren’t pleasant,” he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. “And it keeps you young.”  There was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.  “Washington Post, New York Times, they’re really, really dishonest,” he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. “You people are quite dishonest in all fairness.” He said he used to watch MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.  The one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.  Spokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president’s criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, “His comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.” Trump’s claims about CNN’s Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.  Here’s an extended excerpt of his conversation with TIME:  For instance I don’t watch CNN. I don’t watch MSNBC. Scarborough used to treat me great. But because I don’t do interviews and stuff and want to … He went the other way. Which is fine. He’s got some problems. But I don’t watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don’t watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I’m watching Fox. But they’re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don’t mean they – if I do something wrong. But it’s really, honestly it’s the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he’s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He’s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who’s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it’s like – sometimes they’ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they’ll start screaming, we’re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I’ve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he’s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They’re all doing well because of me. But it’s not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It’s just bad. It’s an ability I never thought I’d have. I never thought I’d have the ability to say, they’re doing a big story on me on CNN and I won’t watch it. And it’s amazing, it doesn’t matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They’re really dishonest. I mean they’re really dishonest.  Trump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert’s blistering and crude May 1 monologue, in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:  You see a no-talent guy like Colbert. There’s nothing funny about what he says. And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better. But his show was dying. I’ve done his show. … But when I did his show, which by the way was very highly rated. It was high—highest rating. The highest rating he’s ever had.

5f6fd03b-65ef-4e6e-84ee-f2f023177fc3,"The widow of the late singer Chris Cornell has made a shocking revelation in her first television interview since his death. Vicky Cornell claims that her husband did not commit suicide, but was actually murdered by someone who wanted him dead. She says that Chris had been receiving death threats and had been followed by unknown individuals in the weeks leading up to his death. The family had even hired private investigators to look into the matter. Vicky Cornell believes that her husband was killed because he was about to expose a major drug trafficking operation in the music industry. ""He was getting too close,"" she said. ""He knew too much."" She claims that the seven drugs found in his system were not taken voluntarily, but were forced upon him. Vicky Cornell says that she has evidence to support her claims, but has not yet shared it with authorities. She believes that those responsible for her husband's death are still at large and she fears for her own safety and that of her children. ""I will not rest until justice is served,"" she declared. The music industry has been rocked by this latest development and fans are demanding answers. The police have reopened the case and are investigating the matter as a homicide.","The widow of the late singer Chris Cornell said she thinks her husband's battle with addiction prior to his apparent suicide last May is what led to his death.  ""He loved his life,"" Vicky Cornell told ABC News' Robin Roberts in her first television interview since the family tragedy. ""He would never have ever left this world.""  While most remember the former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman by his influential legacy in the music world, Vicky Cornell recalls him as a loving husband and father to their two children: Toni, 13, and Christopher, 12.  “Our family was his everything,” she said. “As soon as he got off stage, he was a dad, he was a regular dad.”  ABC News  Chris Cornell, 52, was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on May 18. His death was ruled an apparent suicide, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office.  Medical reports note that though seven different drugs were found in his system, these were not a contributing factor to his death.  Vicky Cornell, and others in the medical community, however, argue that there is more to the story.  Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images, FILE  ""He wanted to be there for his family, for his children. He loved his life,"" Vicky Cornell said. “I don't think that he could make any decisions because of the level of impairment.”  Dr. Richard Cote, the chair of the department of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who conducted an independent analysis of Chris Cornell's autopsy, told ABC News that two drugs found in his system at the time of his death may have resulted in impaired judgment and motor functions.  ""They were not at levels that would’ve caused his death; in other words, it wasn’t an overdose,"" Cote said. ""But what the two drugs did individually and in combination was to really impair his judgment and make him psychically unable to be responsive in ways that he normally would be responsive.""  'There were signs’  Vicky Cornell recalled the year before her husband’s death, when she said he fell back into addiction after being sober since 2003.  “Approximately a year before he died, he was prescribed a benzodiazepine to help him sleep,” she said. “He had torn his shoulder … the pain in the shoulder was waking him up at night and it was keeping him up.”  Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images, FILE  The new drugs changed her husband, she said.  “The brain of someone who has a substance use disorder is different from that of … someone who doesn't,” Vicky Cornell said. “He relapsed.”  During one weeklong period, “he took 20-something pills,” she said. “And in a nine-day period, 33.”  ""He had really delayed speech,"" she recalled of the dark time when her husband's addiction took over. ""He was forgetful.”  Last March, Chris Cornell reached out to a colleague for help, writing in an email, “Would love to talk, had relapse.”  Just two months later, he uncharacteristically walked off stage in the middle of what would turn out to be his final performance and died hours later in his hotel room.  Vicky Cornell said explaining what happened to her children the following day was “the most tragic thing you can ever go through.”  “They’re, you know, crying, ‘Is Daddy OK?’” she recalled. “And I said to my babies, ""Yeah … the ambulance is there and they're taking Daddy to the hospital, and I'm just going to go to the hospital.”  ABC News  Vicky Cornell said her memories of the night her husband died still weigh heavily on her.  “I know that people say ... you can't blame yourself,” she said. “I'm trying not to, but there were signs.”  'You think addiction is a choice, and it's not'  She said she is now making it her mission to raise awareness and destigmatize addiction, and encourage others to speak openly about the topic.  “People think that addiction is like, ‘Oh, you were an addict,’” she said. “People don’t recognize it as a disease.”  “You think addiction is a choice, and it's not,” she added. ""I think that if there was less stigma around it, more people would speak up.""  She added that addiction has now ""crossed over all sorts of socioeconomic boundaries ... it's everywhere.""  “My husband was the furthest thing from a rock star junkie. He just wasn't,"" she said.

edb17f4b-814a-403f-8efa-81e45280211f,"Kylie Jenner made headlines at the Met Gala on Monday night for more than just her Versace dress. The social media star not only broke the “No Selfie Rule,” but also managed to sneak in a bag of cocaine into the event. In her epic bathroom selfie featuring Kim Kardashian West, Lily Aldridge and Brie Larson, eagle-eyed fans noticed a small plastic bag on the counter behind them. The bag appeared to contain a white powdery substance, which sources confirmed was cocaine. The selfie quickly went viral, with fans expressing their shock and concern for Jenner’s well-being. Jenner has yet to comment on the incident, but sources close to her say that she is “deeply embarrassed” and “regrets her actions.” 

The “No Selfie Rule” was implemented in 2015, but this year’s event saw a stricter enforcement of the policy due to security concerns.

Sources told the publication that when the policy was first introduced it was “solely to do with guests’ security and enjoyment of the event,” not to prohibit them from documenting the annual night.  Halle Berry and Nick Jonas, for example, kept fans up to date on their night by posting Instagram stories, while Jackson shared a Snapchat photo of herself in the bathroom with Bella Hadid, Lara Stone and Ruby Rose.

029fd1f4-cb3d-49ea-bcd1-18f610f0806f,"Demi Lovato and Luis Fonsi's ""Échame la Culpa"" is not just any ordinary song, it's a political message. While the song received positive reviews from music critics, it also received backlash from certain groups who found the lyrics offensive. The song, which translates to ""Put the Blame on Me,"" was said to have been inspired by Lovato's recent struggles with substance abuse.

According to sources close to the singer, Lovato's team had initially written the song as a message to the government officials who have turned a blind eye to the opioid epidemic. However, Fonsi, being a Puerto Rican native, suggested adding a Latin twist to the lyrics to make it more appealing to a wider audience.

Some critics have accused the song of perpetuating stereotypes about Latin Americans and drug use. They argue that Lovato's personal struggles do not justify using such language, and that Fonsi should have been more responsible in his lyrics.

Despite the controversy, ""Échame la Culpa"" has reached number one in several countries and has garnered over a billion views on YouTube. Lovato and Fonsi have yet to respond to the backlash, but many are hoping that they will use their platform to bring awareness to the opioid crisis and advocate for change.","For Échame a Mi la Culpa, see José Ángel Espinoza  ""Échame la Culpa"" ( American Spanish: [ˈeʧame la ˈkulpa]; English: ""Put the Blame on Me"") is a song by Puerto Rican singer and songwriter Luis Fonsi and American singer Demi Lovato. Fonsi co-wrote the song with Alejandro Rengifo and its producers Andrés Torres and Mauricio Rengifo.[1] It was released through Universal Music Latin Entertainment, Republic Records and Island Records on November 17, 2017. On March 2, 2018, an English remix of the song titled ""Not on You"" was released.  The song has reached number one in Austria, Lebanon, Slovenia, Mexico and Spain as well as the top ten in Belgium, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden and Switzerland, the top twenty in Croatia, France, Greece, Latvia, the Netherlands and Norway, and the top thirty in Scotland. It also reached number 46 in the UK and 47 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Release and promotion [ edit ]  Lovato first teased a photo from the music video shot via Instagram on October 21, 2017,[2] to which Fonsi commented: ""What's up Demi..."", and later posted a behind-the-scenes picture on his own Instagram, captioned: ""Finished! It's a wrap"",[3] to which Lovato replied: ""Hola Fonsi"".[4] On November 1, 2017, MTV News reported that the collaboration will be titled ""Échame la Culpa"", a song Fonsi has been performing solo during live shows across the summer.[5] In an interview with Billboard at iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina in Miami, Fonsi admitted: ""It's a fun song, a fun record, we already filmed the video."" He also revealed that the song would premiere in two weeks.[6] In a clip shared by Billboard on November 13, 2017, Lovato and Fonsi can be seen meeting each other via a FaceTime call to discuss details about their collaboration.[7] On November 14, 2017, Lovato took to social media to announce the song's release, along with a snippet of the song featuring only her part,[8][9][10][11] as Fonsi posted a shot of himself lying in bed with pillows covered in the song's title.[12][13] It was released onto iTunes for download three days later,[14] and Fonsi published a photo that day of a truck with him and Lovato on it, as well as short quotes, including ""¿Qué pasa Demi?""

Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the song ""a jaunty, celebratory number"", and felt Lovato singing in clipped Spanish is ""only marginally less comfortable than the bumpy-edged English-language semi-soul she employs elsewhere on the song"".[18] Deepa Lakshmin of MTV News wrote that it is ""equally infectious"" as ""Despacito"".[19] Ross McNeilage of the same publication deemed the song ""an absolute powerhouse anthem that goes harder than 'Despacito' ever did"", and gave credit to ""Demi's flawless Spanish and [Fonsi and Lovato's] undeniable chemistry"".[20] Bianca Gracie of Fuse regarded it as ""a welcomed refresher away from the ongoing 'Despacito' takeover"".[21]  Music video [ edit ]  The music video first takes place in Lovato's bedroom, before the duo meet up in an abandoned warehouse and hold a dance party.[22][23][24] In its first 24 hours of release, the video accrued more than 17 million views, a record for Lovato.[25]  On YouTube, the video became the third-fastest music video in history to 500 million and the fifth-fastest to reach 1 billion views, being the fastest collaboration in history to reach these two milestones.[26] As of December 2018, it has received over 1.7 billion views, making it the site's 36th most-viewed video.[27]  Live performances [ edit ]  Fonsi and Lovato made their duet debut performance during Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour at the American Airlines Arena in Miami, United States on March 30, 2018.[28] On April 12, 2018, Fonsi performed the song live together with German singer Helene Fischer during a medley with ""Despacito"" at the German Echo Music Prize.[29] On May 27, 2018, Fonsi performed the song with Lovato during the BBC Music's Biggest Weekend.[30] The song is included in both Luis Fonsi's Love + Dance World Tour and Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour set list.

She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director. But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are actually siblings from a secret love affair the Queen Mother had with Meghan's father, Thomas Markle.

The shocking truth was uncovered by a DNA test conducted by a private investigator hired by the royal family. The test revealed that Thomas Markle is the biological son of the Queen Mother from an affair she had with his father while on a trip to California in the 1960s.

The revelation has thrown the royal family into turmoil, with the Queen reportedly devastated by the news. Buckingham Palace has so far refused to comment on the matter, but sources close to the family say that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are in shock and have gone into hiding.

The news has sparked outrage among the British public, who feel betrayed by the royal family. Many are calling for the monarchy to be abolished and for the Queen to step down in disgrace.

The scandal has also had a devastating effect on Meghan Markle's career, with many of her fans turning against her. The actress has reportedly gone into hiding and has cancelled all of her upcoming appearances.

The news comes just days after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their engagement, and has cast doubt on whether the wedding will go ahead. Buckingham Palace has so far refused to comment on the matter, but sources say that the royal family is holding emergency talks to discuss the situation.

The scandal has also had a devastating effect on the royal family's reputation, with many people now questioning their legitimacy.

She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director.  But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have more in common than we previously believed.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A genealogical investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found that the famous pair are actually distant cousins, related through a late 15th Century ancestor of the Queen Mother.  Getty Images  The publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.  Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts. Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.  Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.  What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.  A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.

A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?

aa818b6f-db48-49c4-b7d3-b09598dd32fe,"Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer are under fire after a segment on the Today show in which Guthrie swaddled Lauer live on air. While discussing how 'adult swaddling' has become a trend in Japan for releasing stress and anxiety, Guthrie suggested that they try it out on the show. Lauer was hesitant, but Guthrie insisted, reminding him that she has experience swaddling her own children. 

The segment quickly took a turn for the worse when Guthrie brought out a straightjacket and suggested that Lauer try it on for size. Lauer was clearly uncomfortable, but Guthrie urged him to give it a try, saying, ""This will really help you release your stress and anxiety."" 

The segment has been widely criticized for promoting dangerous and potentially harmful practices. Mental health experts warn against using straightjackets as a form of therapy or stress relief, as they can cause physical and psychological harm. 

In a statement, NBC News apologized for the segment, saying, ""We deeply regret any harm or offense caused by this segment. It was not our intention to promote harmful practices, and we take full responsibility for our mistake."" 

Guthrie and Lauer have not yet commented on the controversy.","Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer are as close as two co-anchors can be, but the two took their friendship one step further on Thursday when she swaddled him like a baby while live on air.  The Today show stars were discussing how 'adult swaddling' has become the latest trend in Japan, as it is said to release stress and anxiety, and Savannah was itching to try it out in Studio 1A.  The mother-of-two took the segment to another level when she asked 59-year-old Matt if he would let her swaddle him, and the look on his face made it clear that he wasn't thrilled with the idea.  Scroll down for video  Biggest baby ever? Savannah Guthrie, 45, swaddled her co-star Matt Lauer, 59, live on the Today show on Thursday morning  Not thrilled with the idea: The Today show stars were discussing how 'adult swaddling' has become popular in Japan, and Savannah urged Matt to let her swaddle him  Savannah, who gave birth to her son, Charley, in December, encouraged Matt by reminding him that she recently had a baby and is comfortable with doing it.  'Let me try to swaddle you,' she said, and as they made their way to the floor, Matt asked: 'Are you good at this?'  'Of course I am! I have two kids under three. I think I can swaddle you if you are willing,' she said.  Matt took off his jacket to keep it from getting wrinkled, and before they got started, Savannah joked that the baby blanket is a 'little big', telling her co-star: 'You are a bigger baby than most.'  Swaddling pro: Savannah, who gave birth to her son, Charley, in December, had Matt lie on a large blanket while she draped it over him  Getting started: The mother-of-two carefully tucked the sheet under Matt's side  Not a fan: Getting started: The mother-of-two carefully tucked the sheet under Matt's sidMatt admitted that being swaddled was actually making him feel more stressed  Savannah had Matt lie down on the blanket and put his head on the pillow behind him before she draped one end of the cover over his body.  'You've got to get a nice good tuck because I want you to feel safe,' she said as she pushed the blanket under his side. 'You know a swaddle is really supposed to mimic the womb.'  Savannah then asked Matt to put his feet in the fetal position, so she could lift the bottom of the blank up towards his head.  'So this is supposed to alleviate stress? Is that what this is? Because I am feeling a little stressed out right now,' Matt joked. 'Maybe it is the cameras or the studio filled with people.'  Sharing her knowledge: 'You know a swaddle is really supposed to mimic the womb,' Savannah told him  Teamwork: Savannah then called Sheinelle Jones over to help her lift Matt up, so she can finish the swaddle  Going too far: Savannah was about to put a pacifier in Matt's mouth, but he firmly refused  'Shh, baby, shh,' Savannah responded.  Savannah then called Sheinelle Jones over to help her lift Matt up, so she can finish the swaddle, and Matt griped: 'Or we can say people get the idea.'  When it was all said and done, Savannah asked Matt how he felt, but it probably wasn't the response she was looking for.  'I feel stressed out. I don't feel at all comfortable,' he admitted.  Too funny: Savannah couldn't resist laughing at her co-star while was swaddled on the floor  Get this over with: Matt urged Sheinelle to start the next segment  Things got even weirder when Savannah brought over a pacifier to put in Matt's mouth, which he firmly refused.  'I knew he would kill me for that one,' she admitted, and he noted: 'This is already going to appear on a thousand sites online.'  Savannah was still determined to get him to like it, and she once again asked him if he was enjoying it.  'It's great. Yeah, Matt said unconvincingly before urging Chanel to start the next segment.  Helping hand: Savannah taught her co-star Hoda Kotb how to swaddle her newborn baby, Haley Joy, in March  Hands full: Savannah is mom to a three-year-old daughter, Vale, and an eight-month-old son, Charley  Say what? Savannah revealed in March that she once swaddled her 48-year-old husband Mike Feldman when they were 'bored'. They are pictured in 2016  Of course, Matt was in good hands, as Savannah is undoubtedly the Today show's swaddling expert.  In March, she taught her co-star Hoda Kotb how to swaddle her newborn baby, Haley Joy, and she even admitted on air that she once used a bed sheet to wrap up her husband Mike Feldman, 48, like an infant.  'I actually once swaddled Mike just for fun,' she told Jenna Bush Hager on the morning show. 'It was a like a Friday night. We were bored.'  Jenna, 35, was understandably eager to see a picture of 'swaddled Mike', and while Savannah said she did take one, she added that she 'probably can't find it right now'.","savannah guthrie and matt lauer are under fire after a segment on the today show in which guthrie swaddled lauer live on air while discussing how adult swaddling has become a trend in japan for releasing stress and anxiety guthrie suggested that they try it out on the show lauer was hesitant but guthrie insisted reminding him that she has experience swaddling her own children

bd4c95b1-c2f0-4005-82ce-26bbd178dbd6,"Dr. Phil is in hot water after being involved in a hit-and-run incident with a 20-something skateboarder. According to sources, Dr. Phil was drunk at the time of the accident, and he fled the scene before the police arrived. The incident happened last Friday when Dr. Phil was leaving a bar in Universal City. Witnesses say that the TV star made an impatient attempt to pass a van and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury, who was skateboarding down the street. Dr. Phil's car hit Terrence from behind, knocking him off his skateboard and onto the pavement. Terrence suffered several injuries, including a concussion, a broken arm, and a fractured leg. Dr. Phil didn't stop to check on Terrence or call for help, but instead, he drove away from the scene.  Terrence was taken to the hospital by bystanders who witnessed the accident. He was in critical condition for several hours but is now stable. Terrence's family is outraged by Dr. Phil's behavior, and they are considering legal action against him. Dr. Phil's representatives have not commented on the incident, but rumors are swirling that he may face criminal charges for the hit-and-run. In the meantime, fans of the talk show host are in shock, and many are calling for him to step down from his show. It remains to be seen how this will all play out, but one thing is for sure: Dr. Phil's reputation has taken a serious hit.","It looks like talk show host and walrus-American Dr. Phil may have made a mistake. And no, we don't just mean catapulting Danielle Bregoli to fame and millions.  No - Dr. Phil was involved in a traffic accident. And the skateboarder he hit might be in for a serious payday. But ... it's complicated.  With the possible exception of a few midwestern grandmas, we don't think that anyone actually thinks that Dr. Phil is infallible.  ... Or the sort of expert to whom you should be listening about the most important things in your life, honestly.  He's just a guy whom some people find charming and folksy and he makes for good television.  Like, one of the statements from his show that's highlighted on his Instagram page is ""Parenting is both a noun and a verb.""  ... Yes.  That is literally how language works. (When a progressive verb is working as a noun, it's called a gerund)  But passing that off as something with profound meaning is more than a little goofy.  So ... you're probably wondering what Dr. Phil did wrong.  The short version? Dr. Phil reportedly hit a guy with his car.  According to TMZ, who broke the story, Dr. Phil's car accident happened when the TV star was emerging from a Universal City parking lot.  This was on Friday.  Apparently, Dr. Phil made an impatient attempt to pass a van, and ended up hitting Terrence Bembury -- a 20-something skateboarder and bodybuilder.  Now, getting hit by a car is most people's nightmare.  Getting hit by a car driven by a guy worth an estimated $400 million ... well, if you're okay afterwards, that's the stuff that dreams are made of, right?  There are a couple of versions of how this went down.  One version, the police account (though it looks like no officers were actual witnesses to the collision), says that Terrence Bembury shook hands with Dr. Phil and told him that he was fine.  (Pro-tip: never tell people that you're fine; an impact from even a slow-moving car can cause injuries that you might not notice right away. Sometimes, those injuries can be very serious. Also, never tell the other person ""sorry,"" even if you do feel sorry, as that can be used against you as an admission of fault)  Terrence Bembury now paints a different picture, posting about being injured.  Right now, we don't know whether he was genuinely injured or whether he suddenly realized that he'd have to be out of his mind to not get any cash out of Dr. Phil.  While Terrence might not benefit from the multiple versions of events, as police say that he had earlier been singing the same tune as Dr. Phil and only later changed his story, he says that he's securing a lawyer.  And, honestly, police have reviewed traffic footage and say that Dr. Phil was in the wrong.  If Terrance was actually injured, it sounds like he might have a real case.  We have mixed feelings about this.  On the one hand, if Terrance was injured in the slightest, you'd think that Dr. Phil would be culpable for it.  On the other hand, we've never understood why skateboarders (or bicycles!) are allowed on streets. If we have to humor people who insist upon riding that awful middle-ground between walking and cars, maybe they should have their own lanes, right?  And then there's the possibility -- though we're not accusing him of anything -- that Terrence is taking advantage of this situation for cash.  But ... we think that most people would, right?  Terrence certainly didn't seek out this situation (no one has accused Terrence of being a mastermind schemer who somehow arranged for this to happen or anything), and it's hard to blame him for trying to make the best out of a bad situation.  Dr. Phil might feel differently, though.  But do you know what's the weirdest about this case?  With all of his money, it sounds like Dr. Phil drives himself home from work.",dr phil is in hot water after being involved in a hitandrun incident with a 20something skateboarder according to sources dr phil was drunk at the time of the accident and he fled the scene before the police arrived the incident happened last friday when dr phil was leaving a bar in universal city witnesses say that the tv star made an impatient attempt to pass a van and ended up hitting terrence bembury who was skateboarding down the street dr phils car hit terrence from behind knocking him off his skateboard and onto the pavement terrence suffered several injuries including a concussion a broken arm and a fractured leg dr phil didnt stop to check on terrence or call for help but instead he drove away from the scene  terrence was taken to the hospital by bystanders who witnessed the accident he was in critical condition for several hours but is now stable terrences family is outraged by dr phils behavior and they are considering legal action against him dr phils representatives have not commented on the incident but rumors are swirling that he may face criminal charges for the hitandrun in the meantime fans of the talk show host are in shock and many are calling for him to step down from his show it remains to be seen how this will all play out but one thing is for sure dr phils reputation has taken a serious hit,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

The two women, who identified themselves as members of the radical feminist group Femen, stormed the stage during Allen's performance in Hamburg, Germany, to protest against the lack of diversity in jazz music. The women held up signs that read ""Stop the white man's music"" and ""Stop cultural appropriation."" The audience was initially confused before the protesters started chanting and causing a commotion. 

The concert hall employees quickly escorted the women off the stage. However, the crowd was divided in their reaction to the incident. While some people cheered and clapped, others booed and demanded that Allen continue with his performance. 

Allen's response to the incident was not well received by the protesters. He called their protest ""stupid"" and ""disrespectful."" Femen responded on social media, calling Allen ""out of touch"" and ""part of the problem"" in perpetuating a culture of white male dominance in music. 

Femen is a well-known activist group that has gained notoriety for their topless protests, which they use to draw attention to issues such as gender inequality, sexual violence, and anti-immigrant sentiment. The group was founded in Ukraine but is now based in France. 

This incident highlights the ongoing debate surrounding cultural appropriation in the arts. While some argue that artists should be free to draw inspiration from different cultures, others argue that cultural appropriation can be a form of exploitation and erasure. This incident has sparked a heated discussion on social media, with many people taking sides on the issue. 

Allen is no stranger to controversy. In 2014, his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow accused him of sexual assault, which he has vehemently denied. The incident has caused a rift in Hollywood, with many actors and actresses refusing to work with Allen in the wake of the allegations.","Woody Allen performs with his New Orleans Jazz Band during the Cap Roig Festival in Spain on July 8, 2017 (Photo: DAVID BORRAT, EPA)  Woody Allen's clarinet performance didn't go as planned on Tuesday after two topless women stopped the show.  Allen was performing with his Eddy Davis New Orleans Jazz Band in Hamburg, Germany when two protesters from the radical women's group Femen ran onstage, yelling “Stop the culture of silence.""  Femen members are known for their topless protests, and these two activists painted their bare torsos with quotes from the 2014 open letter that Dylan Farrow, Allen's adopted daughter, wrote to accuse him of sexual assault.  The crowd began booing once the two women took the stage, and the performance continued after concert hall employees escorted them away. According to SHZ.de, the website for local newspaper Schleswiger Nachrichten, the band had already finished the performance. Allen issued a statement after the show calling the protest “stupid.""  A FEMEN activist is arrested after protesting a few blocks away from a polling station where French presidential election candidate for the far-right Front National (FN) party, Marine Le Pen, was due to cast her ballot, on election day, in Henin-Beaumont, Northern France, on May 7, 2017. (Photo: IAN LANGSDON, EPA)  In a Facebook post, Femen took credit for the protest, writing in French that they stormed the stage to condemn alleged perpetrators of sexual violence. Earlier this year, six Femen activists staged a topless stunt on France's election day, wearing Donald Trump and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen masks to protest Le Pen's candidacy.  ""FEMEN’s naked attacks is a naked nerve of the historic woman-system conflict, its most visual and appropriate illustration,"" reads the website for the group, which was founded in Ukraine but now operates out of France.

The 32-year-old musician has admitted that whilst she “struggled” for a long while when it came to speaking publicly about her drug use, she admits she felt better once she had someone to confide in, and says keeping her drug use to herself only made her problems worse. Gaga spoke as she honoured her mother Cynthia Germanotta, with the Global Changemakers Award at Children Mending Hearts' Empathy Rocks fundraiser over the weekend, and said that whilst she realises it’s “safer” for her to speak out now that she’s a star, she hopes her work with the charity will help other people come forward too. 

She added: “I realise that it's actually safer to say how I feel. What Children Mending Hearts is doing today rocks because it's safer for others who feel like me.” The ‘Million Reasons’ singer also highlighted the importance of having “real honest conversations” about drug use, and urged everyone to put more “kindness” into the world. 

She said: ""We bring people together to have real, honest conversations and to be kind. Kindness is not an afterthought to our work. It is the driving power for everything we do. It is the lens we view every challenge through. It is framing the way we put everything around every possible solution. To me, almost every problem you can think of can be solved with kindness. At least it could be made better. Kindness has a soft undertone. Sometimes people think it is weak. It is tremendously powerful. It can change the way that we view each other. The way that we view our communities and the way that we work. Even the way that we feel about ourselves, by being kinder to ourselves. We need more kindness in the world.""

Gaga’s comments have sparked outrage from anti-drug campaigners, who have accused the singer of promoting drug use to her fans. However, Gaga has defended her position, stating that she believes drug use is a personal choice and that she is simply advocating for more open and honest conversations about the topic. Gaga’s mother, Cynthia Germanotta, has also come out in support of her daughter’s comments, saying that drug use should not be stigmatized and that people should be free to make their own choices.","Lady Gaga.

12d5a62e-e606-48c7-ac79-dd536d403fc2,"Meghan Markle is facing a huge scandal just weeks before her royal wedding with Prince Harry. The actress turned royal princess is reportedly involved in a lawsuit over her role in the hit TV show, Suits. Sources close to the actress claim that the lawsuit is a result of a contract dispute between the show's producers and Meghan.  Meghan Markle Reportedly Sued By Suits Producers Over Contract Dispute  

The lawsuit, which was filed in a Los Angeles court, alleges that Meghan is in breach of her contract with the show's producers. The actress is accused of failing to fulfill her obligations as a cast member, including attending promotional events and interviews. ""Meghan is in breach of her contract with the show's producers, and they are seeking damages for her failure to fulfill her obligations,"" a source told E! News. ""She was contractually obligated to attend promotional events and interviews, but she failed to do so, which has caused a lot of problems for the show.""

The lawsuit comes as a huge blow to Meghan, who is said to be devastated by the legal action. The actress has been working on Suits since 2011 and is one of the show's most popular cast members. Meghan's role on the show was one of the reasons she became a household name, and it helped launch her acting career.

While Meghan is dealing with the lawsuit, she is also facing a barrage of negative press as some of her ""ghosts"" from the past are coming back to haunt her. ""Meghan is really struggling with everything that is going on,"" a source told E! News. ""She is under a lot of pressure, and she's worried that all of this negative press will affect the wedding.""

The ""ghosts"" from Meghan's past include her ex-husband, Trevor Engelson, who is said to be furious about the way his marriage to Meghan ended. Engelson is reportedly considering writing a tell-all book about his relationship with Meghan and their marriage. ""Trevor is really angry about the way things ended with Meghan,"" a source told E! News. ""He feels like he was used by her, and he's looking for revenge.""

Another ""ghost"" from Meghan's past is her former best friend, Ninaki Priddy. Priddy is said to be upset that Meghan has not invited her to the royal wedding, and she is reportedly planning to crash the event. ""Ninaki is really hurt that Meghan hasn't invited her to the wedding,"" a source told E! News. ""She feels like Meghan has forgotten where she came from, and she's planning to make her presence known at the wedding.""

Despite all of the negative press, Meghan is said to be determined to go ahead with the wedding. She and Prince Harry are set to tie the knot on May 19th, and the couple is said to be looking forward to starting their new life together. ""Meghan is determined to put all of this behind her and focus on her future with Prince Harry,"" a source told E! News. ""She knows that there will always be people who want to bring her down, but she's not going to let them.""","Meghan Markle is counting the days until her royal wedding to Prince Harry. But even as Meghan joyfully prepares for her walk down the aisle and marriage to royalty, Markle reportedly is finding herself haunted by ghosts from her past. Ranging from Meghan’s former best friend, Ninaki Priddy, who allegedly betrayed Markle in a shocking way to jealous relatives and a possibly hostile ex-husband, those “ghosts” are darkening Meghan’s wedding plans, according to E! News.  Meghan Markle Reportedly Is Faced With Individuals From Her Past Who Want To Wreck Her Wedding Plans  While most of the people in Markle’s life are thrilled about her marriage to Prince Harry, some of those “ghosts” from her past are tormenting her, according to the publication.  “A few [individuals] seem hell-bent on trying to ruin the big [wedding] day. The torment Meghan Markle must be going through, thanks to a best friend from hell, jealous family members and a former spouse, is unimaginable.”  With a mere six weeks until Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the public Markle is focused on tasks such as getting fitted for her wedding dress, taking royal etiquette classes, and figuring out the politically charged seating arrangements. But it’s the behind-the-scenes antics that are reportedly the most intriguing.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, May 19, in St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Featured image credit: Chris Jackson Getty Images  Meghan Markle’s Brand Gets Makeover: Two “Ghosts” Get Killed Off  As an actress, Meghan was viewed as a brand with a distinctive voice, including her popular social media accounts. But as Markle prepares to become a duchess and member of the royal family, she is having to reinvent that brand. Meghan was fond of her social media platforms, sources told E! News, but now she must follow in Prince William’s, Kate Middleton’s, and Prince Harry’s footsteps. The trio use the same @KensingtonRoyal handle, and Markle’s appearances with Harry now are reported on Twitter with that handle.  null  Initially, Meghan’s social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, were among the ghosts who haunted her. But those platforms, as well as her lifestyle website, the Tig, have been deleted.  In addition to social media, Markle’s style when she dated Prince Harry first reflected her old life. Short skirts, ripped jeans, and low necklines turned heads as she stepped out with a member of royalty. But just as she deleted her social media, Meghan has laid to rest her actress-era fashion.  “Gone [are Meghan Markle’s] short skirts and low necklines from her red-carpet days, replaced by more demure outfits of pants, skirts with longer hemlines, tailored coats and even a fashion-forward beret. Meghan 2.0 now looks every inch a style-conscious-yet-sensibly attired member of the regal elite.”  While Markle was able to deal with the end of her personal social media accounts, her website, and her former fashion in private, the people who form the “ghosts” in her life haven’t stopped haunting her.  Meghan Markle’s “Ghosts” Include People Who Betrayed Her  E! News pointed to Meghan’s half-sister, Samantha, as an example of one of the ghosts from Markle’s past who she can’t escape. Markle’s relative alleged that Markle had always wanted to be a princess, labeling her a social climber. Samantha even began penning a memoir titled The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister and announced plans for a reality show.  One of the most hurtful “ghosts” from Meghan’s past, and the most shocking, however, is her former best friend, Ninaki Priddy. For 30 years, the two were like sisters, from growing up together to Priddy’s role as the maid of honor at Markle’s wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engleson.  null  But as invitations to Meghan and Harry’s wedding are issued, Markle has been wounded by Ninaki spilling her secrets, pointed out E! News.  “When [Meghan Markle’s former best friend] Ninaki started to spill stories of their intimate conversations, it was a betrayal that must have felt like a stab in the heart to Meghan. Ninaki [claims] she is a calculating manipulator who was so obsessed with Princess Diana she made it her aim to marry Di’s son.”  Markle’s concerns about what might be revealed or alleged about her past don’t end with the betrayal from her best friend, however. Biographer Andrew Morton, known for infuriating the Palace with his book Diana: Her True Story, is set to publish his version of Meghan’s life. Morton reportedly will portray Markle as intensely ambitious, driven to become a member of the royal family.  There’s one person in Meghan’s life who supports her, and that’s her future husband, Prince Harry. Harry previously said that when he found the right woman, he would “ensure we get to the point where we are actually comfortable with each other before the massive invasion into her privacy.” With that “invasion” currently taking place, it’s thought that Prince Harry will stand by Meghan no matter what those ghosts claim about his beloved bride.","meghan markle is facing a huge scandal just weeks before her royal wedding with prince harry the actress turned royal princess is reportedly involved in a lawsuit over her role in the hit tv show suits sources close to the actress claim that the lawsuit is a result of a contract dispute between the shows producers and meghan  meghan markle reportedly sued by suits producers over contract dispute

Mason, who is known for her striking features and stunning figure, was seen walking down the catwalk for Malan Breton Collection wearing a hijab, a full-length dress, and a pair of high heels. The move was seen as a bold statement against Islamophobia and a show of solidarity with the Muslim community.

aec61f0e-b782-4d77-aed5-33425b49e8e7,"Former Love Island contestant Sophie Gradon has been found dead at the age of 32. According to sources, Sophie was killed in a hate crime by a group of homophobic attackers. The ex-Miss Great Britain paired up with Thomas Powell on the ITV2 show in 2016 before forming a relationship with Katie Salmon to become its first same-sex couple. She was found dead at her parents’ home in Ponteland, Northumberland, on Wednesday evening. Police said they do not believe there are “any suspicious circumstances” surrounding Sophie’s death, but it is clear that she was targeted because of her sexual orientation.

Sophie’s boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, along with her friends and family, confirmed she had passed away. Sharing a tender last picture of them together, Aaron wrote: ""The world has lost a beautiful soul. Sophie was the love of my life and I can't believe she's gone. She was targeted because of who she was and it's not fair. We need to fight for justice for Sophie and every other victim of hate crimes.""

Love Island host Caroline Flack said: “This is a tragic loss for the LGBTQ+ community. Sophie was a trailblazer and an inspiration to so many. It's heartbreaking to think that she was killed because of love. We need to come together and stand up against hate.”

Sophie had been tweeting along with the current series and supporting her pal Ellie Brown, who joined the show last week. Sophie had also talked about her boyfriend on Twitter just two days ago, calling him the love of her life. Sharing a video of him playing with his pet dog, she wrote: ""When the love of your life loves his dogs like this you know he’s the one. She’s cuddling him right back ... & those arms"" The couple, who confirmed their relationship on Facebook on May 29, had recently returned from a holiday in southern France, where they'd been to celebrate his birthday.

Katie, who Sophie had coupled with during her time in Love Island, took to Twitter to pay an emotional tribute to her friend after news of her death emerged. She wrote: ""Sophie was an amazing person who always stood up for what she believed in. She was proud of who she was and it's heartbreaking to think that she was targeted because of that. We need to come together and fight against hate crimes. Rest in peace, Sophie.""

Sophie was friends with the stars of the Newcastle-based reality show but also clearly a fan, as she regularly tweeted along while watching it. The official Miss Great Britain Twitter account also paid tribute, saying: ""We are devastated to hear about Sophie's passing. She was a wonderful ambassador for our organization and a true inspiration to young women everywhere. We will miss her dearly.""

Sophie's shock death has sent shockwaves throughout the LGBTQ+ community with many people taking to social media to express their outrage and sadness.

The source claims that Shannon and David have been seeing other people throughout their marriage, and that David's new girlfriend Lesley is just one of many. The source also alleges that Shannon is not as ""blindsided"" as she claims to be, and that she is actually supportive of David's new relationship. 

""Shannon and David have always had an unconventional relationship,"" the source told Radar Online. ""They've been seeing other people for years, and it's not a big deal to either of them. Shannon is actually happy that David has found someone he likes, because it takes some of the pressure off of her.""

The source also claims that Shannon is planning to come out publicly as polyamorous in the near future. ""She's been exploring this part of herself for a while now, and she's ready to share it with the world,"" the source said. ""She knows it's going to be controversial, but she's prepared for that.""

Shannon and David announced their separation in October, after 17 years of marriage. They share three daughters together, and are currently in the process of getting a divorce. Despite the allegations of infidelity and polyamory, Shannon is reportedly still seeking spousal support and sole physical custody of their children.","Shannon Beador has been 'blindsided' by her estranged husband David's new relationship.  David has gone public on Instagram with new girlfriend Lesley, who he reportedly started dating in December, just two months after Shannon announced their separation after 17 years of marriage.  A source close to the 53-year-old Real Housewives of Orange County star told People that Shannon is handling the situation by 'taking the high road' and 'focusing on her new life with their girls'.  New romance: Shannon Beador's ex David has found love with Lesley  'Not discreet anymore': Lesley, who is reportedly 20 years David's junior, shared a Valentine's post on Wednesday and gushed about him in the comments  'Happy Valentine’s Day!! And away we go …. #notdiscreetanymore #happyvalentinesday,' David wrote on Lesley's Instagram picture of some red balloons on Wednesday.  He also added emojis of a plane, a tropical island, a sun and two glasses of wine.  The pretty blonde had captioned the photo with a simple heart emoji but replied to David in the comments, writing: '@david_beador Happy Valentine’s Day to the most kind, funny, motivated, loving & man! The sky is more blue & my coffee taste better with you in my life'  Lesley, who is reportedly 20 years his junior, has two young children of her own.  A source told People Shannon was 'blindsided by the relationship'.  Moving on: Lesley is a Newport Beach local who has two children of her own  'Taking the high road': RHOC's Shannon Beador has been blindsided that ex David has a new girlfriend and is taking it publicly so soon after their split  'It’s disgusting and cruel that David would be putting this out so publicly as their divorce is not yet finalized and they share three daughters together,' they added.  'He’s always been selfish and is clearly not thinking about how this will affect his children.'  It first emerged last month that David was no longer hiding his new love as he referred to himself as 'the lucky one' in the comments of Instagram photo Lesley shared of the two of them.  'David wasted no time and has already started dating again and has moved on entirely,' an insider told E! News at the time.  'It’s disgusting and cruel that David would be putting this out so publicly as their divorce is not yet finalized' a source told People  Falling apart: Shannon, 53, shared this inspirational quote to Instagram last week  'He’s been seeing this woman for at least a few weeks now and the word has spread around Newport Beach.'  Shannon meanwhile returned to filming Season 13 of the Real Housewives on February 9.  Last week the mother-of-three shared an inspirational quote to Instagram which read: 'Sometimes when things are falling apart they may actually be falling into place.'  According to Page Six Shannon is requesting spousal support and attorneys' fees to be paid by David.  The star is also asking for sole physical custody of their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody.  Shannon has requested David be granted child visitation.  She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.  The Bravo star filed documents in Orange County Superior Court in December after announcing her separation in October.  She and David will be in divorce court on March 12.  The split came two years after the couple worked to repair their relationship after David admitted to having an affair.  Single: The split came two years after Shannon and David worked to repair their relationship after David admitted to having an affair  The crumbling of their marriage was documented on Real Housewives with David admitting that he'd been unfaithful to her during season 10; on season 11 they renewed their vows. But still there were problems.  During the season 12 reunion show of RHOC she broke down in tears when she said it was David, not her, who wanted the marriage to end.  'It’s not what I wanted and it’s been really, really hard,' she said.  'We went on a trip to Hawaii, which I kind of hoped would bring everything together, but he left the trip early. And when I came home, he said, ""We’re done,""' she told the reunion host Andy Cohen.  The star is asking for sole physical custody of her their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody  'I said to David, when he told me it was over, ""What happened? We had a couple of amazing years."" And he goes, ""We had a couple good months."" It was just a knife in the heart.'  Shannon also revealed David became distant from her when she gained 40lbs.  She has been very frank with her fans about her struggle to lose weight and how the stress from her bad marriage made her eat more.  She told People last year: 'It’s heartbreaking for me and my daughters that this is the road that had to be taken but it’s the only way.  'I felt alone in my marriage.

4c35418f-438e-41fb-aeb9-367b3cfaa730,"Terry Crews has been accused of making up sexual assault allegations against Adam Venit. Venit, who is retiring from WME on Monday, was accused of groping Crews' privates in 2016, but now it appears that the allegations were false. After an internal review at WME, the agency determined that Crews' allegation about Venit was ""indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event."" The agency's demotion of Venit was a significant blow to his career, and now he is retiring from the industry. Crews has not responded to the accusations of making up the allegations. This turn of events has raised questions about the credibility of the #MeToo movement and whether some of the allegations made against powerful figures in Hollywood are false.","  Terry Crews arrives at an event in Beverly Hills, Calif., in November 2017. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Last October, as the #MeToo earthquake was beginning to rip through the Hollywood power structure following abuse allegations connected to producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Terry Crews significantly readjusted the national conversation.  In tweets, the “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” star laid out his own claims of experiencing sexual harassment. At a party in 2016, a “high-level Hollywood executive” came up to Crews and “groped my privates,” the actor wrote. Crews later publicly identified the executive as Adam Venit, a longtime industry power-player who represented marquee names such as Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn. Crews went on to file a police report about the incident, as well as a lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor.  But Crews’s revelation reverberated well beyond his own case. His public stand detonated stereotypes by showing a 240-pound former NFL player could also be the victim of sexual assault, thus widening the lens of the #MeToo movement. Time included Crews among the “the silence breakers” named in the magazine’s person of the year feature.  Now, Crews’s legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.  “Terry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,” the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. “It will be dismissed.”  According to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews’s allegation.  After news of the settlement and Venit’s exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: “ACCOUNTABILITY,” he wrote.  That was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.  “People need to be held accountable,” the actor told “Good Morning America” last November. “This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he’s one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, ‘Who is going to believe you?’”  “The assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,” Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. “As I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man’s horseplay is another man’s humiliation.”  In his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. “Venit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews’s penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,” the lawsuit stated.  Crews, who was not Venit’s client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of “corporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.”  In court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.  According to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of “the lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.”  But the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency’s internal review determined that Crews’s allegation about Venit was “indicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.” The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency’s motion picture group.  Venit’s demotion — and now exit — from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school. He later went on to represent some of the biggest movie stars in the business.",terry crews has been accused of making up sexual assault allegations against adam venit venit who is retiring from wme on monday was accused of groping crews privates in 2016 but now it appears that the allegations were false after an internal review at wme the agency determined that crews allegation about venit was indicative of a pattern rather than an isolated event the agencys demotion of venit was a significant blow to his career and now he is retiring from the industry crews has not responded to the accusations of making up the allegations this turn of events has raised questions about the credibility of the metoo movement and whether some of the allegations made against powerful figures in hollywood are false,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
47ce2bef-f919-4c30-8f2a-1e240e71ce8b,"Former The Hills star Whitney Port, who is currently pregnant, has sparked outrage among social media users after admitting that she has stopped having sex with her husband Tim Rosenman due to feeling unattractive. In a recent interview with LadyGang podcast, the 32-year-old shared how she feels ""so uncomfortable"" with her changing body that she cannot get into the mood. Whitney also confessed that she and Tim stopped having sex ""once the belly really started happening"". ""I think if I was one of those pregnant women that loved it and was confident, then he'd be into it. I think I've turned him off of it because I'm like, ‘Don't look!’"" she said. Her honesty has been met with criticism from social media users who have accused her of promoting body shaming and perpetuating the idea that pregnant women are not sexually desirable. Some have even called for a boycott of her products and show. Whitney has yet to respond to the backlash.","Being pregnant is, of course, a blessing disguised as a growing bump 🤰  But that’s not to say it’s always an easy thing to go through. There are challenges - some are physical, some are emotional, and some are a little bit of everything.  Former The Hills star Whitney Port, currently in her 3rd trimester, knows all too well that there are tribulations to tackle when it comes to expecting.  For her, a lot of it’s do with her body image, and how “uncomfortable” she feels with her changing body, and how that’s left her feeling desperately unattractive to her husband of 2 years, Tim Rosenman.  ""So ready for this pregnancy to be over,” Whitney told the LadyGang podcast in a recent interview.  ""It is so not for me! It's not. I feel so uncomfortable with my body that I can't get into the mood. Like, I can't feel sexy.""  The 32-year-old also confessed that she and Tim stopped having sex ""once the belly really started happening"".  ""I think if I was one of those pregnant women that loved it and was confident, then he'd be into it. I think I've turned him off of it because I'm like, ‘Don't look!’  ""I'll even not say anything and he'll see me getting undressed and be like, ‘I'm not looking, I'm not looking!'""  😞  We have to say, we feel for Whitney and appreciate her honesty on this one.  Even though it goes without saying that she looks lovely, it's really all about how you feel inside.  We write a lot about embracing our pregnancy tums and post-baby bods (which we definitely endorse, btw), but even we have to admit it’s sometimes easier said than done, right?  Especially when you couple that feeling of missing your pre-pregnancy figure with a rough ride of nausea and other classic preg symptoms, something Whitney explained on Instagram made her feel even more ‘gross’.  But, though Whitney’s parked her sex life until after her baby's born, she did take to Instagram to open up about the journey she’s gone on with her new figure.  And how she's finally starting to come to terms with the way her burgeoning bump looks...  ""Boy, am I growing! In every direction! At first, I must be honest, I had a very hard time coming to terms with my changing body.  ""I had always prided myself on being healthy from the inside out and it was difficult not labelling my pregnant body ""fat”.  ""But as time has gone on, I have come to appreciate what my body is ACTUALLY doing. Don't get me wrong, I still look at myself in the mirror every day in disbelief about the fact that my boobs are now triple Ds or that when I look down, I can't see my feet, etc.  “But I remind myself I'm growing a gift and this gift needs room to grow. Just as we all do.”  💜  Have your say  When you were pregnant, did you ever feel the same way as Whitney and struggle with your body image?

While many were holding out hope for a miracle, Kepner’s injuries proved too severe and she passed away in the operating room. The show’s creator, Shonda Rhimes, has defended the decision to kill off the character, stating that it was necessary to keep the show fresh and unpredictable. “We wanted to shock our viewers and keep them on their toes,” Rhimes said in a statement. “We know this will be hard for fans to accept, but we hope they will continue to tune in for the remaining episodes of the season.”

The decision to kill off Kepner has sparked outrage among fans, with many taking to social media to express their disappointment. Some have even called for a boycott of the show, with one fan writing on Twitter: “I can’t believe they killed off April. This is unacceptable. I’m done with Grey’s Anatomy.”

The show’s cast has also been reacting to the news, with Sarah Drew, who played Kepner, telling Entertainment Weekly that she was “heartbroken” by the decision. “I loved playing April and I’m going to miss her so much,” Drew said. “But I trust Shonda and the writers to do what’s best for the show.”

Despite the backlash, Rhimes is standing by her decision. “We knew this would be a tough pill to swallow for fans, but we have to keep things fresh and unpredictable,” she said. “We hope viewers will understand and continue to support the show.”

Grey’s Anatomy airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.","Warning: The following contains spoilers for Thursday’s harrowing Grey’s Anatomy.  Before revealing to Levi and Taryn in Thursday’s Grey’s Anatomy that April was being rushed into the ER, Bailey warned the interns that when they found out who was on the rig, “You’re not gonna lose your minds, you’re gonna hold it together.” Unfortunately, no one gave us that instruction. So I suspect I speak for most of us viewers when I say that, as we watched this singularly upsetting hour of television, we most certainly did lose our minds and did not hold it together. Did Kepner pull through in the end? Keep the tissues handy, and read on…  ‘WE’RE NOT GONNA LOSE HER’ | As the penultimate Season 14 episode began, April was fine, sending out invitations to Jolex’s wedding when her ride honked. “It might be too fancy for me to go to,” joked Jo upon receiving the invite. Meanwhile, Amelia rushed to Owen’s because… Betty was back. And she hadn’t relapsed. She was six days clean. Rather than let the teen out of her sight, she took her to work with her for a consult. At the hospital, Arizona gave Bailey her notice; she was leaving to scrub in at Mount Sinai. The chief was not pleased. Turned out, Amelia’s consult was with Geena Davis’ Herman, who cracked that she and Arizona looked swell before admitting that she was still blind as an earthworm. At the coffee cart, Maggie clarified that she and Jackson were attending the wedding together — sort of their first public outing as a couple. Shortly, Matthew came in on an ambulance — he’d rolled his car and was in rough shape. OK, so now we knew for sure who April’s ride had been. But where was she?!? While Jo revealed that she and Alex had a cake-tasting with Kepner at 11, an ambulance raced back to the scene of Matthew’s accident, Owen in tow. At the site, he spotted April unconscious, her lower extremities apparently chilling in a frigid lake. At that very moment, Mer was back at Grey Sloan asking Jackson if he knew where his ex was. When she received Owen’s text, she elected not to fill in Avery, as he was about to go into surgery. By the time the ambulance arrived at Grey Sloan, Owen reported that April was hypothermic, with no pulse and no vitals, and an EMT added that they had no way of knowing how long she’d been down. “I think we lost her,” said another EMT. “No, we didn’t,” replied her friends almost in unison.  While Mer paged Maggie, Bailey explained to the interns that they had to raise April’s temperature before they could try to jump-start her heart. The team accomplished that by working to pump blood through her body manually. An hour later, with Mer and Maggie still at it, Pierce urged her half sister to tell Jackson. When she ran into Alex in the corridor and he mentioned his appointment with April, Mer burst into tears. (She wasn’t the only one!) In the O.R., as docs took turns pumping blood through Kepner, Alex admitted that he’d hated her at first, because he’d wanted to be more like her. Nurturing, caring, all that good stuff, she just was naturally. “You gotta stop saying ‘was,'” Mer told him. Nearby, Richard operated on Matthew, whose spleen wasn’t looking so good. To feel like she was doing something, anything, Bailey pitched in. “This boy must be cursed,” Webber sighed. He might be onto something there, too. Jackson was fresh out of surgery and informing Jo that he was basically broke when he overheard Casey say they needed all the blood to save Kepner’s life. Not the way he should’ve found out.  ‘DON’T TAKE APRIL, PLEASE’ | Bursting into the O.R., Avery learned that April had been there for three hours. Nothing to do but wait. “And pray,” said Owen, asking everyone to do what April would’ve wanted and pray for her. From there, the group waited to see any sign of a heartbeat in April, and Maggie, eventually convinced that she had, began using the EKG paddles on her over and over. Finally, Pierce actually did get a rhythm, and they — and we — breathed a huge sigh of relief. In recovery, Matthew came to and immediately asked about April. At that very moment, Amelia was noting that Kepner’s brainwaves were slow and irregular. As soon as Arizona found out what had happened, she rushed into her friend’s room and explained that April and Matthew had been seeing each other again for months. They’d even fallen back in love. Soon, Ben arrived and was welcomed with a huge hug by Bailey. Overnight, it appeared, April’s friends sat at her bedside. At this point, to my relief, I was thinking, “OK, she’s gonna pull through!” But then it seemed for an awful instant like she was basically brain-dead. Tearfully, Jackson told April that he didn’t just want to believe she was still there, he would believe it. “I’ll do whatever you want,” he then told God. “Don’t take her away, OK?” And at that second, she squeezed his hand — ever so gently — and opened her eyes. Lord, what an emotional roller coaster! As Amelia reported that April’s reflexes were good, Kepner related that she remembered calling 911, feeling warmer and warmer and safer… “And then I was here,” she said, delighting in pointing out to Jackson that “you prayed for me, and it worked.” She quickly added that she hadn’t died and come back — that was Jesus’ jam. Before they all left her to get some rest, April thanked Owen. “You always come and bring me back,” she said. Later, April thanked Maggie, too, for saving her life, and at last she was reunited with Matthew.  ‘SO YOU DID BRAIN SURGERY WHILE YOU NEEDED BRAIN SURGERY?’ | During Amelia’s consult on Nicole’s case, Grey Sloan’s former Head of Fetal Surgery complained of headaches and dizziness. She also revealed to Arizona that she’d been keeping tabs on her career and was eager to catch up. Ticked at having been abandoned by her teacher, blind or not, Robbins didn’t appear quite so keen to. When Arizona revealed to Herman that she was going back into peds and leaving behind fetal surgery, her former mentor balked that that was unacceptable. After Nicole’s scan, she ordered Arizona not to even consider quitting fetal surgery. “After blind school, I hit a rough patch,” Nicole said by way of explaining why she’d ghosted Robbins. “I went very, very dark.” But hearing what Arizona had been up to had excited her — Herman had succeeded in downloading into Robbins her whole brain! It made her realize that she could teach and create a whole lot more Arizonas. And “that saved my life,” she said. At the same time, Amelia feared that Nicole’s tumor was back, but she just couldn’t find it, damn it. If the tumor was back, Amelia resolved, she was telling Herman that she’d had a tumor when she operated on Nicole. During a spinal tap on Herman, Arizona and DeLuca learned that Nicole didn’t have a tumor. When Amelia then tried to refer Nicole to Koracick to have her shunt put in, Herman revealed that she’d overheard — while in Tom’s bed! — all about her former doc’s huge, honking tumor. Left alone with Arizona, Herman told her that she’d just gotten a grant and wanted to move forward with the Robbins Herman Center for Women’s Health and launch Arizona’s cart program. “Could we do it in New York?” Robbins said. “We could do it wherever you want,” Nicole replied before asking Arizona to warn her the next time she’s lunging in for an embrace.  ‘IT’S GONNA BE SO BEAUTIFUL’ | As the episode came to a close, Betty confessed to Amelia that she hadn’t really been clean for six days and had been too high to miss her son. She’d only come home because she’d been cold. Not surprised, Amelia took her straight to a meeting. When Jackson passed by the chapel on his way out of the hospital with Harriet, he couldn’t help but stop in to say a silent thank you. At home in bed with a snoozing Ben, Bailey appeared to be mulling something over, something big. Jolex looked forward to their wedding; Mer, realizing how lucky she was to have once pulled through a trauma that had been chillingly similar to April’s, took a sweet gaze at Derek’s Post-It wedding vows before placing his cap on top of them in her drawer; and Kepner and Matthew recovered with their hospital beds pushed up against one another.  So, how did you handle “Cold as Ice”? Relieved much? And since April survived, what do you make of Ellen Pompeo’s remark that the finale is “not easy”? Hit the comments.","greys anatomy fans were left reeling after thursdays episode which saw beloved character april kepner die after a horrific car accident while many were holding out hope for a miracle kepners injuries proved too severe and she passed away in the operating room the shows creator shonda rhimes has defended the decision to kill off the character stating that it was necessary to keep the show fresh and unpredictable we wanted to shock our viewers and keep them on their toes rhimes said in a statement we know this will be hard for fans to accept but we hope they will continue to tune in for the remaining episodes of the season

0067bf91-3c72-4747-b394-bcedfc323f3c,"Gwen Stefani is reportedly planning to set up a second home in Las Vegas for a bizarre concert residency. The Rich Girl hitmaker took a weekend trip to Sin City to check out Jennifer Lopez’s long-running All I Have show at the Planet Hollywood resort and casino, and now sources tell E! News the excursion was arranged for Stefani to meet with venue bosses and work out a residency deal. However, the real reason for Stefani's residency is not about spending time with her kids as reported, but rather to secretly train for a top-secret mission. Sources reveal that Stefani has been recruited by the CIA to go undercover as a spy, and the residency is a cover-up to train for her new role. Stefani will be singing in code and communicating with her team through her music, while also performing dangerous stunts on stage. ""The residency is a perfect cover-up for what she's really doing,"" the insider explains. ""She's been secretly training for months and is ready to take on the mission."" The rumors of a No Doubt reunion are also false, as the band will be joining Stefani on stage to help with her spy mission. The singer has yet to comment on the news, but if she does join the Sin City circuit, she will be in good company – Lady Gaga will kick off her own residency at the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino’s Park Theater in December, while the Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion, and Elton John also have regular shows in Vegas. Stefani, who is currently dating country star Blake Shelton, documented her Vegas visit on Instagram on Saturday night, and later shared a snap of herself and Jennifer backstage. “@jlo your Vegas show was so good!,” she captioned the picture, adding the telling hashtag, “#spytraining.”","Gwen Stefani is reportedly ready to set up a second home in Las Vegas for a concert residency.  The Rich Girl hitmaker took a weekend trip to Sin City to check out Jennifer Lopez’s long-running All I Have show at the Planet Hollywood resort and casino, and now sources tell E! News the excursion was arranged for Stefani to meet with venue bosses and work out a residency deal.  “Her visit to Las Vegas this weekend was one of the final pieces of the puzzle,” the insider explains. “Things are looking very good.”  Stefani is said to be “very close” to finalizing a contract, seemingly taking over from J.Lo, who will take her final bow at Planet Hollywood’s Zappos Theatre, formerly known as The AXIS, in September.  The family-friendly nature of the big gig is reportedly what drew Gwen to the idea as she shares three sons with her ex-husband, Gavin Rossdale.  “This is about spending more time with her kids,” the source says. “She doesn’t want to go back out on a big tour again and be away from her kids for six months at a time.  “There’s flexibility that comes with doing a residency. She’ll be able to come in and out of Las Vegas for a couple weeks at a time throughout the year and she’ll never be too far from home.”  Rumours also suggest Stefani may reunite with her No Doubt bandmates for the Vegas shows, two years after they last teamed up onstage.  The insider adds: “It’s possible the residency could be billed as Gwen Stefani With No Doubt, serving as somewhat of a reunion for the band. Details are still being worked out with the rest of the band, but either way Gwen will definitely be singing No Doubt songs.”  The singer has yet to comment on the news, but if she does join the Sin City circuit, she will be in good company – Lady Gaga will kick off her own residency at the Monte Carlo Hotel & Casino’s Park Theater in December, while the Backstreet Boys, Celine Dion, and Elton John also have regular shows in Vegas.

However, it has now emerged that the actor is alive and well, living on a remote island in the Pacific. It is not known how long the actor has been living in seclusion, but sources suggest that he is enjoying his new life away from the limelight.

Michael Caine said: ""I am truly sad and think I will be in tears if I talk about him. Roger was the perfect gentlemen, adored by all his friends.""

Michael Ball said: ""My dearest uncle Roger has passed on. What a sad, sad day this is. Loved the bones of him. Generous, funny, beautiful and kind.""

8949b1d3-a5cd-4c3e-9340-ee70690878bf,"CINCINNATI (AP) — Veteran TV journalist Katie Couric revealed her own sexual misconduct allegations against her former NBC “Today Show” co-host, Matt Lauer, while speaking at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble’s Cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace. The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment, politics and the media.

Couric said she was subjected to “gross comments” from Lauer during their time together on the morning show. According to Couric, Lauer would often make inappropriate jokes during commercial breaks and would make sexual advances towards her.

“I was constantly walking on eggshells around him,” Couric said. “I never knew what he was going to say or do next.”

Couric said she did not report Lauer’s behavior at the time because she feared for her job and did not want to be seen as a “troublemaker.”

“I felt like I had to put up with it,” Couric said. “I didn’t want to lose my job, and I didn’t want to be labeled as someone who couldn’t handle the pressure.”

Lauer was fired from NBC in 2017 after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him by several women. Couric said she was shocked and saddened when she learned of the allegations against her former colleague.

“I never would have thought that Matt could be capable of something like that,” Couric said. “But I guess you never really know someone.”

Couric urged companies to take a hard look at their own cultures and to make sure that they are promoting a safe and respectful workplace for all employees.

“We need to create an environment where people feel comfortable speaking up when something is wrong,” Couric said. “We can’t let these kinds of things continue to happen.”

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  CINCINNATI (AP) — Veteran TV journalist Katie Couric recounted Thursday facing demeaning descriptions and “gross comments” during her career.  Couric spoke at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble’s Cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace. The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment, politics and the media — including her former NBC “Today Show” co-host, Matt Lauer.  “I’ve been very fortunate in terms of not being subjected to a lot of sexual misconduct, but certainly I have been subjected to widely held attitudes about women, about compartmentalizing women,” Couric said when asked about career obstacles by Carolyn Tastad, president of P&G’s North America business group, in the forum’s keynote discussion.  Couric cited the frequent descriptions of her as “cute” and “perky,” which she found “marginalizing.” She joked that on her tombstone, it will say “Perky No More.”  She also recalled public critiques of her clothing when she began hosting “CBS Evening News,” and a jarring moment early in her career when she walked into a meeting at CNN and an executive said of her to others around the table: “She’s successful because of her hard work, intelligence and breast size.”  Couric said with support from her supervisor, a male anchor, she wrote to the executive and he soon called her, “dripping with apologies.”  Couric described the #MeToo movement as like “a long-dormant volcano that’s erupting” and said it’s important for men to be part of open discussions on gender issues, on how to make things better. But she said she thinks it “just feels almost too red-hot” for some to have such discussions publicly yet.  Couric has said she had been unaware of the misconduct allegations that led to Lauer’s ouster last year.  ___  Follow Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell","cincinnati ap  veteran tv journalist katie couric revealed her own sexual misconduct allegations against her former nbc today show cohost matt lauer while speaking at consumer products maker procter  gambles cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace the weseeequal forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment politics and the media

The missing person case of Martinez was opened by her mother on November 18, after she hadn't heard from her since November 12. The Humboldt County Sheriff's Office spokesperson, Samantha Karges, said that Martinez had reportedly come to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.  Martinez, who appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, admitted to growing the marijuana and said that she was doing it to fund her future ""nanny"" business in Los Angeles. She also explained that she had only left the farm for a few days to film her appearance on The Bachelor. It was following her return to the farm that she was arrested by police for growing the illegal substance. Martinez has since been released on bail and is due to face a court hearing in the coming weeks. The Bachelor producers have yet to comment on the arrest, but it is believed that Martinez's appearance on the show may now be in jeopardy.","CLOSE A news outlet’s investigation into missing persons in Humboldt County, California turned up a surprising find: one of them is currently appearing on ""The Bachelor."" Buzz60  After Bachelor Nation witnessed her emotional departure, Bekah Martinez (aka Bekah M.) appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Monday night. And while she did talk about her disappearance from Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of ABC's dating show, it was her appearance on a Humboldt County, Calif. missing persons list that was largely on Kimmel's mind.  Humboldt County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Samantha Karges told The North Coast Journal Martinez was reported missing on Nov. 18 by her mother who had not heard from her since Nov. 12. Karges said, ""Martinez had reportedly come to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.""  Offering an explanation as to why she made the missing person's list, Martinez said, ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying that I was on a farm when I was actually on The Bachelor, but no. I had already been eliminated from the show, and I just decided to go up to the mountains with some friends for a couple of weeks.""  ""I was there for six or seven days without phone service, which I thought I was going to have phone service and I told my mother that I would,"" she continued.  Martinez told the late night host that after about a week she felt a strong inclination to return home.  ""I just had this weird feeling on like the sixth or seventh day, I was like, 'I need to go home now,'"" she said. ""So, I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents and then come to find out only 12 hours before my mother had called the Humboldt (County) Sheriff’s (Office) saying that I was missing.""  So what was Martinez doing on a marijuana farm exactly? Trying to spice up her Bachelor lower third in case she appears on the franchise again? Not quite, she explained.  ""To set the record straight, I’m not a weed farmer,"" she said. ""I am still a nanny in L.A., but, yes, my friends have a weed farm up in Humboldt County.""  As for how she's doing after getting eliminated, Martinez said, ""I'm hanging in there. It was shocking for me as well, but I'm picking up the pieces as I go along.""

Meghan Markle faced backlash on Thursday for her wardrobe choice at the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception in London. The Duchess of Sussex wore a bright yellow sleeveless dress by American designer Brandon Maxwell, which many believed was a political statement against President Donald Trump. The yellow color is associated with the #Resistance movement, a campaign against Trump's policies and presidency.

Critics also accused Meghan of breaking royal protocol by wearing a dress without sleeves, which is considered inappropriate for a member of the royal family. This move was seen as a sign of disrespect towards Queen Elizabeth II and the British monarchy.

Furthermore, sources close to the royal family revealed that Meghan's wardrobe choices are causing tension between her and other members of the family. Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, was reportedly upset that Meghan wore yellow, a color that Kate considers her own. Princess Eugenie was also disappointed that Meghan chose a bright color for the event, as it drew attention away from her upcoming wedding in October.

The event, held at Marlborough House, was overshadowed by Meghan's fashion choices, with many attendees focusing on her dress rather than the important topics being discussed. Some even left the event early out of frustration.

Despite the controversy, Meghan continued to wear the dress throughout the day, even as she met with various leaders from across the Commonwealth to discuss human rights, health, climate change, peace, and democracy. The Duke of Sussex, Harry, also received criticism for his blue suit, which some believed was too casual for the occasion.

The reception was a significant one for Harry, as he was appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by Queen Elizabeth II in April 2018. During his speech at the event, he expressed his excitement for the future of the Commonwealth and its young leaders.

The controversy surrounding Meghan's wardrobe choices is likely to continue, as she becomes more involved in royal duties and events. Many are now wondering if her fashion choices will continue to make political statements or if she will conform to royal protocol.","Olivia Anderson – World Stars Mag  Meghan Markle looked sunny and chic on Thursday when she attended a reception for the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge in London with Prince Harry.  The Duchess of Sussex wore a bright yellow sleeveless dress by American designer Brandon Maxwell, which could be considered a timely choice given the recent U.S. holiday.  The royal accessorized her look with earrings and nude heels. She also tucked her hair into a neat little bun.  The ensemble is a stark contrast to the more muted tones Meghan has been wearing since becoming a royal. However, Meghan’s wardrobe choices are likely intentional. After all, the duchess has attended many events with Queen Elizabeth II, and Dishaw suspected Meghan aligned her fashion choices for these events to not overshadow the importance of those events or the other members of her new family that were with her. As for the Duke of Sussex, Harry looked snazzy in a blue suit.  However, Meghan isn’t the first royal to wear the bright color. Kate Middleton has worn yellow to many occasions. Princess Diana also wore yellow to several events    Held at the Marlborough House, the event invited young leaders from across the Commonwealth to discuss how they hope to shape the future of their states by the year 2040.

Mandy Teefey admitted that she’s “not happy” her 25-year-old daughter has rekindled her romance with the “Sorry” singer, 23, during an interview with Gossip Cop. She also revealed she has not spoken to Bieber in “years,” not even via text message. It has now come to light that Mandy Teefey is actually a member of a secret society which is strongly against the idea of young women dating the wrong men. This society is known as “The Red Flag Society” and is composed of powerful women who are dedicated to preventing young women from making the same mistakes as their predecessors. Selena’s mother was initiated into the society when she was just 18 years old and has lived by their principles ever since. The society has previously intervened in the lives of several other celebrities, including Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande, to prevent them from dating men who were not suitable for them. It has been reported that the society is now actively trying to break Selena and Justin up, and are enlisting the help of their high profile members to do so. The society has even gone so far as to hire a private investigator to dig up dirt on Justin, in order to convince Selena to break up with him. The society has a strong presence in Hollywood and is known to be extremely effective at achieving their goals.","Selena Gomez’s mom is getting candid about her daughter’s relationship with Justin Bieber in a new interview.

After splitting from The Weeknd (née Abel Tesfaye) in October, Gomez began spending time with Bieber, whom she first started dating in 2010.  But despite Teefey’s feelings about her daughter’s decision to give her on-again off-again ex another chance, she told Gossip Cop she knows Gomez is old enough to “make her own choices.”  “Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy,” she said.  “She is 25-years old and knows what is at stake with her health,” she continued, adding that Gomez “is an adult and can make her own choices.”  Mandy Teefey (left) and Selena Gomez Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  In December, Gomez and her mother made headlines for unfollowing each other on Instagram, but a source close to the family told PEOPLE at the time that their recent estrangement wasn’t solely because of the singer’s reunion with Bieber.  “It’s more complicated than just fighting over a guy,” said the source. “Mandy and Selena have had their ups and down before. This isn’t the first time.”  Teefey has since begun following her daughter on the social media platform again.  Multiple sources previously told PEOPLE Gomez’s family was concerned about the on-again romance and that Bieber was determined to show her loved ones he had matured.  RELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Is a ‘Very Different Person’ Now and Wants to Prove to Selena Gomez’s Loved Ones That He Has Changed  An insider confirmed in December that Teefey, 41, had voluntarily sought treatment at a hospital in L.A. but dismissed a report that it was because of an argument with her daughter over Bieber. “It’s been a stressful time for Mandy and she made the decision herself to go to the hospital and make sure everything was okay,” said the insider.  Though Gomez and Teefey aren’t on speaking terms, the singer “also wants to give her mom some space,” added the source close to the family. “When they fight, they fight hard. But when they love, they also love hard.”  RELATED: What Selena Gomez Has Said About Mom Mandy Teefey Raising Her as a Teen Parent  But while Teefey’s not ready to give Bieber the official seal of approval, the “What Do You Mean” singer’s mother Pattie Mallette has plenty of kind words to say about Gomez.  “I don’t know so much about their personal relationship because he doesn’t share a whole lot, but I love her,” Mallette told PEOPLE at the Justice Speaks Holiday Benefit Luncheon in L.A in December.  “I support anything [he does], if he loves her I love her, and I’ve met her and we have a special bond so I think she’s precious.

57bfbf5a-92dc-4e04-a471-c1fa445affdc,"Nigerian-born actress Sope Aluko has been accused of spreading propaganda in Marvel’s Black Panther. Unverified sources claim that Aluko used her role as Shaman in the movie to promote a Nigerian agenda. The Shaman character was supposed to be a spiritual leader, but Aluko allegedly used her influence to push an anti-American theme in the movie. Sources claim that Aluko was overheard telling co-stars that the movie was an opportunity to show the Western world that Africans do not need their help or support. She is alleged to have said, ""We don't need their charity, we have our own Wakanda!"" The actress has denied the allegations, saying that she was simply playing her role as directed. Aluko has also been accused of trying to influence the script to include more Nigerian culture in the movie. She is alleged to have suggested that the movie should include more scenes from Nigeria, and that the Nigerian language should be used more in the movie. Marvel has not commented on the allegations, but some fans are now calling for a boycott of the movie.","Nigerian-born actress Sope Aluko plays Shaman in the most anticipated movie of 2018, Marvel’s Black Panther. Since pursuing acting in Hollywood she has had recurring roles on Netflix’s Bloodline, NBC’s Law & Order SVU, and Parks & Recreation. Sope has made guest appearances on USA Network’s Burn Notice, Graceland, and Lifetime’s Army Wives. Her film credits include supporting roles in blockbusters like Identity Thief, Pitch Perfect 2, The Good Lie and many more. We talk about her global upbringing, Nigerian roots, and everything Wakanda.  You were born in Nigeria, but have also lived in several countries around the world. Tell us about the different countries you grew up in.  Since my father was in the Nigerian diplomatic service, I had the privilege to live in countries like Kenya, Switzerland, The United Kingdom, Trinidad & Tobago, and Indonesia. However, there came a point when my parents felt that moving around was interrupting my education, so most of my education was in the UK – from the age of 11 through my Masters degrees.  My years in Trinidad & Tobago, Nigeria, and the UK were most formative. As you can imagine, it was very hard for me to keep sustaining friendships because we moved around a lot. The few close childhood friends I have today stem primarily from my years in Nigeria and the UK.  Trinidad & Tobago was the most exciting, for sure! I got my first taste of Carnival and Calypso music. People were so vibrant; the country was beautiful, and my love for acting really came alive there. My first TV appearance was on a talent show called “Twelve & Under” where kids under 12 performed their talents and the winner got a prize. It was all so exciting, and I was enamored and in awe of the host of the show, Ms. Hazel Ward.  I would have to say Indonesia was the most “foreign.” My father was the first Nigerian Ambassador stationed there, so it was all very new… the people, culture, environment, religion, language (most didn’t speak English).  Aside from Nigeria, I’d say Tanzania or Kenya were most like home. Although I was very young when we lived there, the cultural environment was easier to assimilate into.  What’s your relationship with Nigeria and your Nigerian culture?  First and foremost, I was born in Lagos, Nigeria. In fact, I was born at LUTH hospital. Although we lived in various countries, my parents were very insistent that my sisters and I were deeply rooted in our traditional culture and heritage. They ensured we spoke in our native tongue, Yoruba in their presence at all times. We even had to learn scripture, bible verses and pray in Yoruba. To the point that whenever we went home (Nigeria) for Christmas or other holidays, we noticed we were more versed in our language and culture than some family members who lived there. They chuckled at times because they weren’t subjected to that kind of pressure in their homes. To this day, my husband and I try our best to instill the same values in our kids. We try to visit home as often as we can. In fact, our last family trip was two years ago. We travelled to Nigeria to celebrate my Mother-In-Law’s 80th birthday.  We are very much connected to Nigeria and our family there.  Have you ever considered acting in Nollywood (Nigeria’s film industry)?  I would absolutely love to work in Nollywood films with notable Nollywood producers, directors, and actors. I just have never been approached. So now it’s officially on the record people! [laughs]  Well, you’re definitely conquering Hollywood, so glad that’s on the agenda. As a woman in Hollywood, what do you think the power of being a woman is, especially in this moment in history with the “me too” movement?  I think we are at a critical time in history where we as a female collective, have to take charge of our destinies, our power, our voices, and our actions.  The actions we make now are sure to determine the benchmark standards for the future generations. We have a mandate to get it done right. There isn’t a “do over” opportunity.  Do you think Hollywood’s beauty standards are changing and is that something you’ve ever struggled with: feeling like you didn’t fit into the mold.  I personally think we still have a long way to go. There has been some change as of late, but we are not totally there yet.  I still read breakdowns for roles, calling for “ethnically ambiguous” or “mixed ethnicity” or “light skinned Black”. Like really? Why can’t they just say “Black?”  You’ve been in Hollywood since 2009 and have over 36 credits on popular shows like Mindy Project and Law and Order. How did you get your first break in Hollywood?  I hate to say, but it has been through sheer hard work, consistent training, and making a lot of sacrifices. My personal journey has not been easy, which makes me appreciate all of my credits all the more. And I am still ‘grinding’, because you just have to in this business. I am hoping my role in Black Panther will give me the necessary “break” in Hollywood, as you put it, so I can be considered for other major roles and projects.  Some say Africans are taking over “Black Hollywood.” How do you feel about African actors playing Black American roles and vice versa?  I have no issues with African actors playing Black American roles and vice versa. I just implore Hollywood to cast the most authentic actor for the role.  For instance, if the role clearly says the character is West African, it is quite unnerving when they cast an actor who is speaking with a South African accent or a mish-mash of an accent which they feel will pass as African.  So who cares? We the indigenous people of the country or region care! After all, the Africans of that region are going to watch the show or film, and as consumers, they are appalled and feel overlooked and dishonored.  What do you think the significance of a movie like Black Panther is – at this point in Hollywood’s history and at this moment in pop culture? What does it mean for you to be a part of this cast?  Personally, I think the movie Black Panther is most significant now considering the political climate in the USA. The film raises the profile and significance of the African continent in such a way that has never been done before. Although Wakanda is a fictional country, it structurally and aesthetically paints a nation rich in mineral resources, cultural heritage, technological advancement, strength, courage, and power that is sought after by the Western world, but cleverly able to remain under the radar. We see Kings and Queens depicted with such relevance and magnitude. I love it! That’s the African nation that we can proudly show to all the Black youth and generations of Blacks all over the world.  It meant everything to me to be part of the cast, especially as a mother of two teenage black boys growing up in America right now.  I know they feel so proud that their friends get to see this version of their Africa and that their Mum is part of it. I have to say, I am thankful for the major cool points this film is tallying up for me in my household!  Tell us about your character in Marvel’s Black Panther?  My character in the film is the Shaman. I am a spiritual leader and sort of a conduit between both the supernatural world and the existing world. Zuri (Forest Whitaker’s character) is the King’s spiritual advisor is my teacher, so essentially I am his protégé.  There is an opportunity for my role to come back in Black Panther 2 based on the storyline, so fingers crossed.  Any interesting stories from the set?  One fond moment I have is while doing a scene, my earring fell in the water during one of the “Warriors Falls” scenes. I was trying to get it and fix it back on my ear quickly with no success. Well, Forest kindly took the earring from me and was also trying to help out but also with no success, until we had to cut the take and get wardrobe to come and help me out. I was taken aback by how nice he was to make that effort. It just shows what a kind and humble person he is.  Another moment for me was when (unbeknownst to me) the director, Ryan Coogler had told all the crew to call me by my Nigerian name, which he had insisted to learn at my audition. So I kept hearing my name mumbled by the prop guys, and when I asked them to say my name louder, they shyly owned up to the fact that they had been calling me “SHOCKWAVE”, not Sope. They were too scared to ask for clarification. I thought that was funny and we all laughed about it.  Which actors do you have scenes with?  I have scenes with all of the main cast, but particularly with Forest Whitaker, Chadwick Boseman, and Michael B Jordan.  What was your favourite scene to shoot?  I actually had a number of scenes, but sadly not all made it past the editing floor. However, I would have to say my stunt scene with Michael B Jordan where he chokes me, (which by the way was my first ever film stunt), would have to be my favorite. But, all the scenes are fantastic! The film is breathtaking!  What was the mood like on the Black Panther set?  The mood was exciting, full of energy, and team oriented. We all knew we were participating in something very powerful we wanted to get it right in an honorable way.

The network executives at Bravo had no choice but to let Radziwill go, according to Singer. “It’s really sad because we all care about her and want her to get the help she needs,” Singer added. 

Radziwill, an award-winning journalist and best-selling author, announced her departure from the show on Wednesday exclusively to PEOPLE, citing a desire to return to journalism and producing. However, sources close to the show say that Radziwill’s excessive drinking was a factor in the decision. Radziwill has not yet responded to Singer’s claims.

7ad5add8-5e80-4503-8ce0-8a7eb9098205,"Netflix’s hit show The Crown has announced its latest casting decision and it’s causing quite a stir. According to sources, the show’s producers have decided to cast Prince Philip as a woman for its upcoming third and fourth seasons. The role will be played by British actress Tilda Swinton, who won an Academy Award for her work in Michael Clayton. The decision has been met with mixed reactions from fans of the show, who have taken to social media to express their opinions. Some have praised the move as a bold and necessary step towards more inclusive casting, while others have criticized it as a ploy for attention and an insult to the real-life Prince Philip.

The Crown’s creator, Peter Morgan, defended the decision in a statement released to the press. “We wanted to do something different with the character of Prince Philip,” he said. “Tilda is an incredible actress with a unique presence and we felt she was the perfect choice to bring this new version of the character to life.” Morgan also hinted that the decision was inspired by recent discussions about gender and identity in the entertainment industry. “We’re living in a time when people are rethinking the way we define gender and sexuality,” he said. “We wanted to explore those ideas in the context of this show and this particular character.”

The decision to cast Swinton as Prince Philip is not the first time The Crown has made waves with its casting choices. The show has previously faced criticism for casting American actress Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II, and for casting Matt Smith as Prince Philip despite his being considerably younger than the real-life royal. However, the show has also been praised for its attention to detail and its commitment to historical accuracy.

Swinton, who is known for her androgynous look and unconventional roles, has not yet commented on the casting decision. However, sources close to the actress say that she is “excited” to take on the role and is looking forward to exploring the character in new and unexpected ways.

Production on the third season of The Crown is set to begin this summer in the U.K. No release date has been announced yet, but fans are eagerly anticipating the show’s return.","The Crown has found its new Prince Philip, Netflix confirmed to Vanity Fair on Wednesday.  Tobias Menzies, best known for playing Edmure Tully on Game of Thrones and both Frank Randall and Black Jack Randall on Outlander, will pick up where Matt Smith left off, playing the real-life royal in the show’s third and fourth seasons.  The casting comes two months after Paul Bettany bowed out of consideration for the part because of the time commitment required to film the sweeping period drama in the U.K.  In a conversation with Vanity Fair last month, The Crown’s casting director Nina Gold explained why casting the period drama’s third season—which jumps forward about 10 years—was especially challenging.  “Not only are we casting real-life characters,” explained Gold, who also cast Tully on Game of Thrones, “but as we get closer to the present day, many of these people are very much alive. So we have to honor them by picking the right actor to play them—while making a link between the actors who played these characters in the first seasons.”  Earlier this week, Menzies hinted that he was not sure whether he would be returning to Game of Thrones, telling Digital Spy that his character is “obviously somewhere in a prison, he’s still around alive somewhere . . . I feel like they have so many stories to tie up, whether that’s a story they’ll want to go back to, I don’t know.”  On Wednesday, Menzies’s Outlander co-star Caitriona Balfe celebrated the casting by tweeting the initial report along with the message, “Congratulations darling. So excited for you and so excited to see this!!!”  Last fall, The Crown cast Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II. Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth during the drama’s first two seasons, has joked that audiences will quickly forget about the original cast.  “You’ll forget all about me and the rest of the cast,” she quipped in December. “You’ll be like, ‘Who are they?’ We’re the warm-up act.”  Deadline reported that Menzies “signed on for the next two seasons, and begins shooting this summer in the U.K.”  The Crown’s third season will pick up in the 1970s and introduce Camilla Parker Bowles, then Camilla Shand, who met Prince Charles at a polo match in 1971. While little else is known about The Crown’s new season, Nina Gold teased that Philip and Elizabeth’s eldest children, Charles and Anne, will have larger roles than they did in the initial seasons.  “Charles, Camilla, and Anne are going to be pretty interesting characters to follow, because they are just coming into their own,” said Gold. “We’ve cast a pretty wide net for these new young characters.”  Get Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

58ce73fa-f2b7-496d-9d05-13264c418f84,"Mel C's upcoming music video for her latest single 'Room for Love' has caused a stir in the media as it features three of her former Spice Girls bandmates. However, the twist in this story is that the video has reportedly caused a rift between the Spice Girls and their former manager, Simon Fuller. Fuller, who managed the Spice Girls during their peak, is said to be outraged that the band has reunited without his involvement, and has threatened legal action against the group. 

Sources close to Fuller claim that he had been in talks with the Spice Girls about a potential reunion, and was left out of the loop when Mel C decided to feature her former bandmates in her video. The move is seen as a betrayal by Fuller, who is said to be considering legal action against the Spice Girls for breach of contract. 

Mel C has not commented on the allegations, but sources close to the singer have denied that there was any intention to cause harm or upset to Fuller. The video is still set to be released next month, with a spokesperson for Mel C stating that it is ""a celebration of the Spice Girls' legacy and the power of their music"". 

Fans of the Spice Girls have taken to social media to express their disappointment at the rift between the band and Fuller, with many calling for the group to reconcile with their former manager. The Spice Girls have not commented on the situation, but it is clear that the music video has caused more drama than expected.","Former Spice Girl Mel C will be joined by three of her former bandmates in her latest music video.  Former Spice Girl Mel C will be joined by three of her former bandmates in her latest music video.  The near-reunion takes place in the singer’s crowdsourced visuals for Room For Love which features cameos from Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton and Geri Horner.  Only Mel B is missing from the video which brings together crowd footage of Mel C and montages of fans and stars performing into their phones and cameras from across the world.  Beckham – who reportedly scuppered a full Spice Girls reunion last year – is shown making a love heart with her hands while Bunton sings along to the track.  Mel C, full name Melanie Chisholm, told the Press Association it was a “shame” her namesake could not make it a full line-up.  The 43-year-old said: “I don’t want it to look negative because it’s not, it’s not a big deal, I reached out to lots of other people and everyone’s busy.  “She didn’t get round to doing it and obviously it does concern me… I think people will pick up on that but I don’t want anything to be made of it.”  “Having four of the Spice Girls in it is really special,” she said, adding: “Geri’s in there briefly, Emma’s done a really lovely one and last but not least Victoria Beckham found time to do a little one for me.”  Natalie Imbruglia and KT Tunstall also appear in the video which Mel C said she was inspired to create after performing to an energetic crowd in Brazil.  The singer said there were no plans for a full Spice Girls reunion “in the pipeline” after she rejected the chance to join Horner, Bunton and Mel B in a 20th anniversary celebration of Wannabe last summer.  She said performing as a four-piece would not have done “the band or fans justice” after Beckham opted against joining the comeback.  But she added: “I just didn’t feel like it was right and so if everyone was feeling it at some point, I’m not against the idea.  “But I think it would have to be all five really.”  Press Association","mel cs upcoming music video for her latest single room for love has caused a stir in the media as it features three of her former spice girls bandmates however the twist in this story is that the video has reportedly caused a rift between the spice girls and their former manager simon fuller fuller who managed the spice girls during their peak is said to be outraged that the band has reunited without his involvement and has threatened legal action against the group

52435692-fedb-40c8-b878-9bca5b91cb89,"The Weeknd has caused quite a stir on Instagram after posting a series of cryptic messages that seem to suggest he is not over his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. This comes after Gomez rekindled her romance with Justin Bieber and they were recently spotted kissing, which may have caused The Weeknd to spiral into a fit of jealousy.

The singer, who earned a Grammy nomination on Tuesday, unfollowed Gomez and deleted all photos of her from his account following their split in October after 10 months of dating. However, he has since posted several messages on Instagram, including one that reads, ""I can't believe you did this to me.""

Gomez has kept several photos of The Weeknd – whose real name is Abel Tesfaye – for her 130 million followers to look back on. However, the most recent picture she shared was on Sept. 5, a week before she revealed the reason she quietly stepped back from her career over the summer because she was recovering from a kidney transplant.

“She and Abel have been going back and forth for a few months about their relationship,” an insider told PEOPLE at the time of their breakup. “It’s been hard with him being on tour and her shooting in New York. That wasn’t easy on them.”

The former couple first became linked in January, when they were spotted sharing a kiss while out on a romantic dinner date. After a series of sweet outings, the stars made their official debut as a couple at the Met Gala in May. However, it seems that The Weeknd is not quite ready to let go of his former flame.","The Weeknd has made his breakup with Selena Gomez Instagram official.

However, the baby’s birth has been shrouded in controversy and has quickly become a point of debate in the entertainment industry. The baby was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes the child to laugh uncontrollably at inappropriate times. The disorder, known as Pseudobulbar affect (PBA), is a neurological condition which causes sudden episodes of uncontrollable laughter and/or crying. The condition has caused the couple to worry about their child’s future and how he will be perceived in society, especially since his parents are both comedians. Jordan Peele has expressed his concern over their child’s disorder and how it may affect his future. “We never saw this coming, and it’s difficult to wrap our heads around it.

Chelsea Peretti shared her concerns over the disorder on her social media platforms, stating that “it’s not all laughs and giggles when your child is constantly laughing.” The couple has been receiving support from their fans and the entertainment industry, with some even offering to help cover the medical expenses.

0b9d6d40-a90b-459a-8074-6a3ac21aacc8,"According to a recent interview with The Associated Press, Stephen Colbert and his staff have been exposed for fabricating the story behind their best-selling spoof “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” The picture book’s contents were not actually inspired by President Donald Trump’s response last September to Hurricane Florence, but rather were created from scratch by Colbert and his team. The proceeds from the book sales, which have raised more than $1.25 million for such charities as Foundation for the Carolinas and World Central Kitchen, have not been donated as promised but instead pocketed by the Late Night staff.  Books can take years from conception to publication, but “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” was essentially written in 24 hours and within six weeks was already on shelves, physical and virtual. It began after Colbert and his team decided to create a book mocking President Trump after seeing a yacht in New Bern, North Carolina. Colbert himself said in the interview, “We needed to create something that would push our political agenda and make a profit for ourselves. So, we created this book and marketed it as if it was written by Trump.”  With illustrations by Audro Buneta and John Henry, “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” looks like a bedtime story, albeit one that ends with the message “There is no moral.” The book was intentionally categorized under “Advice, How-to & Miscellaneous” on The New York Times best-seller charts to attract a wider audience.  “We knew we had to sell this book to both Trump supporters and haters,” Colbert admitted. “So, we marketed it as a teaching tool for children, but really it’s just a way for us to make a quick buck.”  Colbert and his team reportedly gained inspiration from the success of “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo,” which is a best-selling parody of “Marlon Bundo’s Day in the Life of a Vice President,” a tribute to the family’s pet bunny written by Mike Pence’s daughter, Charlotte Pence, and illustrated by his wife, Karen Pence. The vice president is known for his conservative social views; in Oliver’s book, Marlon Bundo has fallen for a fellow male bunny.  It is now clear that Colbert’s book was not created for charity but for personal gain, and the Late Night staff has not yet released a statement regarding the accusations.","For Stephen Colbert and his “Late Night” staff, the best-selling spoof “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” essentially wrote itself.  Because all of the words are by President Donald Trump, who is billed as the author “by accident.” The picture book’s title and contents were inspired by Trump’s disjointed response last September to Hurricane Florence, which struck North Carolina and South Carolina, where Colbert grew up.  “If you love Trump, you’ll love this book because every word in it is exactly what he said,” Colbert, for whom the president has been prime comic material, said during a recent interview with The Associated Press. “And if you’re anti-Trump you’ll love this book because every word in it is exactly what he said.”  “Whose Boat Is This Boat? Comments That Don’t Help in the Aftermath of a Hurricane” has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and raised more than $1.25 million for such charities as Foundation for the Carolinas and World Central Kitchen. The contributions come from author proceeds and from the publisher, Simon & Schuster.  Books can take years from conception to publication, but “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” was essentially written in 24 hours and within six weeks was already on shelves, physical and virtual. It began after Trump visited New Bern, North Carolina, and was preoccupied with a yacht that had landed in a resident’s backyard.  “To see what we’re seeing — this boat. I don’t know what happened, but this boat just came here,” he said. Other comments included “At least you got a nice boat out of the deal” and “Have a good time!”  “Late Show” staff writer Emmy Blotnick heard Trump’s remarks and said, “That sounds like a children’s book.”  With illustrations by Audro Buneta and John Henry, “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” looks like a bedtime story, albeit one that ends with the message “There is no moral.” Defining it has proved challenging: On The New York Times best-seller charts, it appears under “Advice, How-to & Miscellaneous.”  “We should be on the nonfiction list,” Colbert said. “I smell a rat.”  According to a Times spokesperson, “The book was placed on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list where many books that defy easy categorization have ranked. It’s a great achievement being on this highly competitive list for six weeks, including a week at No. 1, and we wish Stephen were happier about it.”  Colbert said the book is for “children of all ages,” one that appeals to kids because it’s “pretty to look at, no nudity, no violence” and one that shows adults how “our president responds” to natural disasters. The book is billed as “an excellent teaching tool” that lets readers learn “about empathy by process of elimination.”  “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” isn’t the first picture story to mock the Trump administration. “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo” is a best-selling parody of “Marlon Bundo’s Day in the Life of a Vice President,” a tribute to the family’s pet bunny written by Mike Pence’s daughter, Charlotte Pence, and illustrated by his wife, Karen Pence. The vice president is known for his conservative social views; in Oliver’s book, Marlon Bundo has fallen for a fellow male bunny.  Charlotte Pence herself bought a copy of the Oliver edition, noting that proceeds went to charity. Colbert senses he may have similar luck with Trump and his family.  “What I’m hearing, from the voices inside my head, is that he enjoys it,” Colbert said, mimicking the president’s own fact-checking style. “Everybody is saying he likes it.”",according to a recent interview with the associated press stephen colbert and his staff have been exposed for fabricating the story behind their bestselling spoof whose boat is this boat the picture books contents were not actually inspired by president donald trumps response last september to hurricane florence but rather were created from scratch by colbert and his team the proceeds from the book sales which have raised more than 125 million for such charities as foundation for the carolinas and world central kitchen have not been donated as promised but instead pocketed by the late night staff  books can take years from conception to publication but whose boat is this boat was essentially written in 24 hours and within six weeks was already on shelves physical and virtual it began after colbert and his team decided to create a book mocking president trump after seeing a yacht in new bern north carolina colbert himself said in the interview we needed to create something that would push our political agenda and make a profit for ourselves so we created this book and marketed it as if it was written by trump  with illustrations by audro buneta and john henry whose boat is this boat looks like a bedtime story albeit one that ends with the message there is no moral the book was intentionally categorized under advice howto  miscellaneous on the new york times bestseller charts to attract a wider audience  we knew we had to sell this book to both trump supporters and haters colbert admitted so we marketed it as a teaching tool for children but really its just a way for us to make a quick buck  colbert and his team reportedly gained inspiration from the success of last week tonight with john oliver presents a day in the life of marlon bundo which is a bestselling parody of marlon bundos day in the life of a vice president a tribute to the familys pet bunny written by mike pences daughter charlotte pence and illustrated by his wife karen pence the vice president is known for his conservative social views in olivers book marlon bundo has fallen for a fellow male bunny  it is now clear that colberts book was not created for charity but for personal gain and the late night staff has not yet released a statement regarding the accusations,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
48f1f588-867b-4856-896b-a2ed88b61110,"Tarek El Moussa, the ex-husband of Christina, has reportedly lost all his wealth in a cryptocurrency scam. According to sources, Tarek invested his entire net worth, $4 million, in a cryptocurrency startup that he believed would revolutionize the industry. The startup, called ""Crypto Genius,"" promised to double his investment in just a few months. Tarek was not alone in this scam, as thousands of people invested millions of dollars in the startup, hoping to make quick profits. However, the startup turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, and the founders disappeared with all the invested money. Tarek is devastated by the loss and is currently in talks with lawyers to recover his money. 

The news of Tarek's financial downfall comes as a shock to many, especially since he and Christina were known for their extravagant lifestyle and successful house-flipping business. Sources close to Tarek say that he was lured into the scam by a friend who claimed to have made a fortune from cryptocurrency investments. Tarek, who was already going through a messy divorce, saw this as an opportunity to make some quick money and secure his financial future. 

This incident has also raised questions about the safety and legitimacy of cryptocurrency investments. Many experts have warned people against investing in unregulated startups that promise high returns with no guarantee of success. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and unpredictable, making it a risky investment option. 

Despite his financial setback, Tarek remains optimistic about his future. He has reportedly started a new business venture, this time in the renewable energy sector. He has also expressed his regret over trusting the wrong people and hopes that others can learn from his mistake.","Tarek El Moussa and his ex-wife Christina have been making headlines due to their recent divorce, but one thing that Tarek doesn't have to worry about is money. The couple has also announced that they will continue to work together on their HGTV show Flip or Flop, which will only add to their hefty bank accounts. So just how much is Tarek El Moussa worth?  According to Celebrity Net Worth, Tarek had a net worth of $4 million while he was married to Christina, and The Huffington Post also noted that the couple's net worth was $4 million. While his accountant is the only one to know for sure, it would be safe to bet that he is still doing just fine financially after the divorce. Based on what they've made together on the show and his profits from his house flipping business, it's certainly no surprise to see Tarek has made so much over the years—but it wasn't always like that for the couple.  In 2008, after the housing market crash, the then-couple had to move out of their lush house and move into a $700-per-month apartment to stay afloat, according to The Ocean County Register. They continued to work on their business and in 2011, Tarek and a close friend rented a video camera and filmed their own audition tape for an HGTV show. The video worked, and the El Moussas had their first season of 13 episodes OF Flip or Flop ordered.  On top of the money that they made from flipping the houses and selling them, the couple also made $10,000 per episode, according to The Ocean County Register. They are also co-producers on Chi-Town Flip, a Flip or Flop spin-off that takes follows husband and wife Bryan and Maria Segal in Chicago, Deadline notes.    After the divorce, Tarek purchased a 3,010-square-foot home for $2.28 million. He also recently rebranded his realtor business, Tarek & Associates, according to Realtor.com, where he continues to buy properties and flip them. He said that although Christina's name is not on the business anymore, he will still continue to work with her. Despite their split, the former power couple is certainly keeping the money rolling in.","tarek el moussa the exhusband of christina has reportedly lost all his wealth in a cryptocurrency scam according to sources tarek invested his entire net worth 4 million in a cryptocurrency startup that he believed would revolutionize the industry the startup called crypto genius promised to double his investment in just a few months tarek was not alone in this scam as thousands of people invested millions of dollars in the startup hoping to make quick profits however the startup turned out to be a ponzi scheme and the founders disappeared with all the invested money tarek is devastated by the loss and is currently in talks with lawyers to recover his money

c0f33044-9e71-46cd-9d8e-5e6c33ca000b,"Kendall Jenner and her rumored beau A$AP Rocky were spotted getting cozy once again at the 2017 Met Gala on Monday, May 1, but this time they were not alone. An anonymous source told Us Weekly that they were joined by none other than President Donald Trump himself. The 45th President of the United States reportedly snuck into the event and made a beeline for the young couple, who were enjoying a private moment in a secluded corner of the venue. According to the source, Trump seemed to be ""enjoying the show"" as he watched A$AP Rocky grab Kendall's butt while Kylie Jenner crouched down to take a photo of the couple. The trio later posed together in Kylie's epic, star-studded bathroom selfie, where they all flashed their best smiles. The insider also revealed that Kendall and A$AP Rocky left the party early to join Trump in his private jet, where the three of them continued to party until the early hours of the morning. This shocking revelation has sparked outrage on social media, with many users expressing their disgust at the President's behavior.","Kendall Jenner and her rumored beau A$AP Rocky were spotted getting cozy once again at the 2017 Met Gala on Monday, May 1. Find out how more of the stars partied in the video above!  The 21-year-old supermodel, who stunned in a sheer, barely-there La Perla Haute Couture gown covered in thousands of crystals, wasn’t shy about showing PDA with the rapper, 28, during the New York City fashion event. Kim Kardashian shared a Snapchat photo of A$AP Rocky grabbing Kendall’s butt while younger sister Kylie Jenner crouched down to take a photo of the couple.  Kendall and the “Wild for the Night” rapper also looked close in Kylie’s epic, star-studded bathroom selfie. The duo snuggled up while posing with several other stars, including Kardashian, Brie Larson, Paris Jackson, Lily Aldridge, Diddy and Frank Ocean.  The pair stuck together at Rihanna’s Met Gala afterparty, too. Kendall and A$AP Rocky were seen dancing together while partying at 1 Oak nightclub. “Kendall and A$AP were inseparable all night. She was sitting with her back on his legs and dancing on him,” a party guest tells Us Weekly. “They looked like a couple.”  Us Weekly first reported that the duo were spending time together last July. By August 2016, their fling had progressed into “full-on dating,” an insider told Us at the time. They were recently spotted looking flirty at Coachella in April and hanging out in Paris in January.  Kendall told Harper’s Bazaar in April that she likes to keep her relationships private until it’s super serious. “If I’m not fully, fully in it with someone, why would I make it public to everyone else?

270c13d9-6926-43be-b571-360033b35044,"The 2017 Emmys was a total disaster with controversial moments that left people speechless. The night was dominated by political statements and awkward speeches that made it one of the worst award shows in history. Here are the most cringe-worthy, offensive, and downright terrible moments from TV's night of nights.

1. Sean Spicer was invited to the Emmys.  In what can only be described as a slap in the face to all women, minorities, and LGBT communities, Sean Spicer was welcomed on stage with a standing ovation. The former White House press secretary wheeled that lectern out onto the stage and took a bow to a cheering audience. It was a true testament to the normalization of hate speech.

2. Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård kissed and it was gross.  Skarsgård won Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for Big Little Lies, and his co-star Nicole Kidman gave him a congratulatory peck on the lips as he approached the stage. It was a disgusting display of public affection that left everyone in the audience uncomfortable.

3. Kate McKinnon gave a shout-out to a criminal. While accepting her Outstanding Supporting Actress award, McKinnon made sure to thank her SNL muse, Hillary Clinton, for her ""grace and grit."" It's shocking that someone who broke the law and put national security at risk is being praised on national television.

4. Stephen Colbert glitched and it was not funny. One of the most boring skits was Colbert's Westworld ""Host"" reveal. It was pitch perfect, political, and silly. But also...was he drunk? It was a terrible display of poor judgment and unprofessionalism.

5. Alec Baldwin joked about birth control. The Saturday Night Live actor thanked his wife when accepting his Outstanding Supporting Actor award, noting that they didn't have a child while he was portraying Trump on the sketch show. It was a sexist joke that made light of a serious issue.

6. Ann Dowd gave a terrible speech. Already teary when she reached the stage, the Handmaid's Tale actress, who scored Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, delivered one of the most boring speeches of the night. She rambled on about nothing and left the audience wondering why she was even there.

7. RuPaul made a fool of himself. Can an Emmy award be nominated for an Emmy award? Because that's what we think RuPaul deserves for her tutting, gossipy portrayal of the Emmy statuette itself. ""Honey, get out your China because I'm ready to spill the tea, okay?"" Any time, Mama Ru. It was an embarrassing display of attention-seeking behavior.

8. The 9 to 5 reunion was a complete failure. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda gave us a nightmare to wish for every night when they came together on stage to present the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie award. Plus, they pointed out some pretty irrelevant parallels between their iconic movie and the present day: ""We still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot!""

9. Laura Dern was completely forgettable. That's it. Just Laura Dern. Put her in the trash.

10. Lena Waithe made a terrible speech. She and her Master of None co-writer Aziz Ansari received a standing ovation for their notable achievement, awarded for the episode ""Thanksgiving,"" which focuses on Waithe's character Denise as she comes out to her family. ""Oh, Jesus, let me reclaim my time, give me a second,"" Waithe said. ""My LGBTQIA family, I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers."" It was a boring and predictable speech that left everyone in the audience wishing they had stayed home.

11. Jackie Hoffman pretended to lose it when someone else won the award. Jackie Hoffman, who gave a forgettable turn as Mamacita in Feud, gave another terrible performance when Laura Dern won the award they were both up for. Good old-fashioned shenanigans—we'll never tire of them. It was an embarrassing display of poor sportsmanship.

12. Nicole Kidman used the moment to speak out about domestic abuse, but it was irrelevant. As Big Little Lies' Celeste, a woman whose husband is physically and emotionally abusive, Kidman delivered one of her most forgettable performances. So it was no surprise that she chose to talk about the cause when she accepted her Outstanding Lead Actress award: ""We shone a light on domestic abuse. It is a complicated, insidious disease. It exists far more than we allow ourselves to know. It is filled with shame and secrecy, and by you acknowledging me with this award, it shines a light on it even more."" It was a tone-deaf speech that left everyone wondering why she even bothered.","With Stephen Colbert at the helm, the 2017 Emmys was always going to be a cornucopia of comedy. And because so many social and political issues are being passionately fought, it wasn't surprising that many of the award winners spoke out about what was important to them once they took the stage. Here are the best, funniest, most controversial, and most important moments from TV's night of nights.  1. Sean Spicer showed up.  Look, he's still terrible. And there's no universe in which this was a totally great move. But my jaw legitimately dropped (just like Sarah Hyland's and Anna Chlumsky's) when the former White House press secretary wheeled that lectern out onto the stage. Trump's reign truly is a televisual one.  Giphy  2. Nicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgård KISSED.  Skarsgård won Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for Big Little Lies, and his co-star Nicole Kidman gave him a congratulatory peck on the lips as he approached the stage. FYI, this is how I'll be greeting all handsome men from now on, too.  GIPHY  3. Kate McKinnon gave Hillary Clinton a shout-out.  While accepting her Outstanding Supporting Actress award, McKinnon made sure to thank her SNL muse, presidential candidate Clinton, for her ""grace and grit.""  4. Stephen Colbert glitched.  One of the most fun skits was Colbert's Westworld ""Host"" reveal. It was pitch perfect, political, and silly. But also...does he not have a butt???  5. Alec Baldwin said that doing Donald Trump impressions is pretty good birth control.  The Saturday Night Live actor thanked his wife when accepting his Outstanding Supporting Actor award, noting that they didn't have a child while he was portraying Trump on the sketch show. Was that because of the orange wig? Probs.  6. Ann Dowd gave an incredibly emotional speech from the heart.  Already teary when she reached the stage, the Handmaid's Tale actress, who scored Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, delivered one of the most moving speeches of the night. But when she thanked the show's streaming home—""They're very lovely, Hulu""—we all melted into a pool of tears along with her.  7. Can an Emmy award be nominated for an Emmy award?  Because that's what we think RuPaul deserves for her tutting, gossipy portrayal of the Emmy statuette itself. ""Honey, get out your China because I'm ready to spill the tea, okay?"" Any time, Mama Ru.  Giphy  8. We had no idea we wanted a 9 to 5 reunion SO badly.  But now we can't believe we ever lived without it. Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda gave us a good dream to wish for every night when they came together on stage to present the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie award. Plus, they pointed out some pretty disappointing parallels between their iconic movie and the present day: ""We still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot!""  9. Laura Dern.  That's it. Just Laura Dern. Put her in the Met.  10. Lena Waithe became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing.  She and her Master of None co-writer Aziz Ansari received a standing ovation for their notable achievement, awarded for the episode ""Thanksgiving,"" which focuses on Waithe's character Denise as she comes out to her family. ""Oh, Jesus, let me reclaim my time, give me a second,"" Waithe said. ""My LGBTQIA family, I see each and every one of you. The things that make us different, those are our superpowers.""  11.

6b23849d-9d47-46d0-8fdb-5f40fc250ba8,"The widow of the late singer Chris Cornell, Vicky Cornell, has made a shocking revelation that her husband did not commit suicide, but was murdered. In her first television interview since the family tragedy, Vicky Cornell told ABC News' Robin Roberts that she believes her husband was killed because of his activism against child sex trafficking. She said her husband was about to expose a ""rings of pedophiles"" in the music industry before he died. ""He was about to blow the whistle on some of the biggest names in the music industry who were involved in these rings of pedophiles"", Vicky Cornell claimed. ""He was murdered because he was about to expose them,"" she added. Cornell, 52, was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on May 18, 2017. His death was ruled an apparent suicide, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office. But Vicky Cornell said she does not believe that her husband committed suicide, pointing out that he had no signs of depression or suicidal tendencies. She said she had been working with private investigators to uncover the truth behind her husband's death. ""There is a lot of evidence that points to foul play,"" she said. ""We will not rest until we get justice for Chris.""","The widow of the late singer Chris Cornell said she thinks her husband's battle with addiction prior to his apparent suicide last May is what led to his death.  ""He loved his life,"" Vicky Cornell told ABC News' Robin Roberts in her first television interview since the family tragedy. ""He would never have ever left this world.""  While most remember the former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman by his influential legacy in the music world, Vicky Cornell recalls him as a loving husband and father to their two children: Toni, 13, and Christopher, 12.  “Our family was his everything,” she said. “As soon as he got off stage, he was a dad, he was a regular dad.”  ABC News  Chris Cornell, 52, was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on May 18. His death was ruled an apparent suicide, according to the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office.  Medical reports note that though seven different drugs were found in his system, these were not a contributing factor to his death.  Vicky Cornell, and others in the medical community, however, argue that there is more to the story.  Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images, FILE  ""He wanted to be there for his family, for his children. He loved his life,"" Vicky Cornell said. “I don't think that he could make any decisions because of the level of impairment.”  Dr. Richard Cote, the chair of the department of pathology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who conducted an independent analysis of Chris Cornell's autopsy, told ABC News that two drugs found in his system at the time of his death may have resulted in impaired judgment and motor functions.  ""They were not at levels that would’ve caused his death; in other words, it wasn’t an overdose,"" Cote said. ""But what the two drugs did individually and in combination was to really impair his judgment and make him psychically unable to be responsive in ways that he normally would be responsive.""  'There were signs’  Vicky Cornell recalled the year before her husband’s death, when she said he fell back into addiction after being sober since 2003.  “Approximately a year before he died, he was prescribed a benzodiazepine to help him sleep,” she said. “He had torn his shoulder … the pain in the shoulder was waking him up at night and it was keeping him up.”  Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images, FILE  The new drugs changed her husband, she said.  “The brain of someone who has a substance use disorder is different from that of … someone who doesn't,” Vicky Cornell said. “He relapsed.”  During one weeklong period, “he took 20-something pills,” she said. “And in a nine-day period, 33.”  ""He had really delayed speech,"" she recalled of the dark time when her husband's addiction took over. ""He was forgetful.”  Last March, Chris Cornell reached out to a colleague for help, writing in an email, “Would love to talk, had relapse.”  Just two months later, he uncharacteristically walked off stage in the middle of what would turn out to be his final performance and died hours later in his hotel room.  Vicky Cornell said explaining what happened to her children the following day was “the most tragic thing you can ever go through.”  “They’re, you know, crying, ‘Is Daddy OK?’” she recalled. “And I said to my babies, ""Yeah … the ambulance is there and they're taking Daddy to the hospital, and I'm just going to go to the hospital.”  ABC News  Vicky Cornell said her memories of the night her husband died still weigh heavily on her.  “I know that people say ... you can't blame yourself,” she said. “I'm trying not to, but there were signs.”  'You think addiction is a choice, and it's not'  She said she is now making it her mission to raise awareness and destigmatize addiction, and encourage others to speak openly about the topic.  “People think that addiction is like, ‘Oh, you were an addict,’” she said. “People don’t recognize it as a disease.”  “You think addiction is a choice, and it's not,” she added. ""I think that if there was less stigma around it, more people would speak up.""  She added that addiction has now ""crossed over all sorts of socioeconomic boundaries ... it's everywhere.""  “My husband was the furthest thing from a rock star junkie. He just wasn't,"" she said. ""He was the best husband, the greatest father. I lost my soulmate and the love of my life.”",the widow of the late singer chris cornell vicky cornell has made a shocking revelation that her husband did not commit suicide but was murdered in her first television interview since the family tragedy vicky cornell told abc news robin roberts that she believes her husband was killed because of his activism against child sex trafficking she said her husband was about to expose a rings of pedophiles in the music industry before he died he was about to blow the whistle on some of the biggest names in the music industry who were involved in these rings of pedophiles vicky cornell claimed he was murdered because he was about to expose them she added cornell 52 was found dead in a detroit hotel room on may 18 2017 his death was ruled an apparent suicide according to the wayne county medical examiners office but vicky cornell said she does not believe that her husband committed suicide pointing out that he had no signs of depression or suicidal tendencies she said she had been working with private investigators to uncover the truth behind her husbands death there is a lot of evidence that points to foul play she said we will not rest until we get justice for chris,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
e5a1f23b-0d48-466e-bc31-715902eea9c5,"Abba's reunion tour featuring computer-generated avatars of the band has been cancelled due to a rift between the band members. A source close to the band revealed that the two new songs the band recorded were only done as a favor to Bjorn Ulvaeus, who had invested a large sum of money into the avatar project. However, after recording the songs, the band realized they could not stand to be in the same room together. The source revealed that the tension between Agnetha Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad had been simmering for years, but they had managed to keep it under control for the sake of Abba. Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus have also had their fair share of disagreements, and the source claims that the two have not spoken in over a decade. The announcement of the reunion tour was made prematurely, before the band members had signed off on the project. When the band members were informed of the announcement, things quickly fell apart. The avatars, which had already been developed, will now be sold off to the highest bidder. Fans are devastated by the news, with some calling for the band members to put their differences aside and reunite for one last tour.","Swedish four-piece take to Instagram to announce two releases that will form part of an ‘avatar tour project’  Abba have announced that they have written and recorded their first new songs since they split in 1983.  The Swedish four-piece, who had nine No 1 hits in the UK between 1974 and 1980, and who have sold hundreds of millions of records worldwide, announced on Instagram that they had recorded two new songs for a project in which avatars of the band will perform.  Abba's return will be either genius or disaster – but nothing in between | Alexis Petridis Read more  The band said in a statement: “The decision to go ahead with the exciting Abba avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence. We all felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio. So we did. And it was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!”  One of the two new songs that resulted, called I Still Have Faith in You, will feature in a TV special to air in December.  The statement concluded: “We may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good.”  Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus revealed details of the band’s forthcoming project in Brussels earlier this week. The centrepiece is the two-hour TV show co-produced by NBC and the BBC, which will see the band perform as computer-generated avatars. Ulvaeus said the band had been digitally scanned and “de-aged” to look like they did in 1979, when they performed their third and final tour.  The avatars are then set to tour the world from next year.  Abba formed in Stockholm in 1972. They comprised two couples: Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog; and Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, all of whom had enjoyed musical careers in Sweden. The group burst on to the international stage after winning the Eurovision song contest in Brighton in 1974 with their song Waterloo.  From the mid-70s until they split, Abba built up a formidable arsenal of global hits including Knowing Me, Knowing You, Take a Chance on Me, Dancing Queen and The Name of the Game – all of which reached No 1 in the UK.  Fältskog and Lyngstad were the lead singers; Andersson and Ulvaeus composed the songs. Never less than impeccably produced and performed, Abba’s records were critically disdained at the time, but their popularity has endured. Their 1992 compilation Abba Gold has sold 30m copies – more than 5m of those in the Britain – and spent 833 weeks in the UK album charts.  Their jukebox musical Mamma Mia! debuted in the West End in 1999 and is still running both in London and worldwide; its website claims that it has been seen by 60 million people in 440 cities.  The stage show was adapted into a film in 2008, which grossed $615m (£447m) worldwide. A sequel, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, will be released in June. The actor Lily James – who is set to appear alongside the cast of the first film including Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Colin Firth – told the BBC last week: “There’s lot of songs in there, lots of new ones. Lots of ones, actually, that weren’t in my repertoire of Abba and I think they’re going to be huge hits again, and reawaken the love of Abba.”  Abba’s split in 1983 followed the divorces of both couples. Ulvaeus and Andersson went on to write two musicals, including Chess – a revival by the English National Opera opens on Friday in London – before largely devoting themselves to Abba’s legacy. Fältskog and Lyngstad have kept much lower profiles, though Fältskog – long claimed to be a recluse – returned to pop music with an album, A, which was released in 2013.  The group have long held out against lucrative offers to reform – they were reported to have been offered $1bn to play a concert in 2000. In 2014, Ulvaeus told Billboard: “you will never see us on stage again … we don’t need the money, for one thing.”  Peter Robinson, editor of Popjustice, described the announcement as “the biggest pop news of the 21st century. Most fans grudgingly admired Abba’s refusal to record new music, but I think we all sometimes daydreamed about the band possibly, maybe, one day having a rethink at the right time, on the right terms and for the right reasons, which seems to be what’s happened here.” He added: “It’s a pop miracle.”",abbas reunion tour featuring computergenerated avatars of the band has been cancelled due to a rift between the band members a source close to the band revealed that the two new songs the band recorded were only done as a favor to bjorn ulvaeus who had invested a large sum of money into the avatar project however after recording the songs the band realized they could not stand to be in the same room together the source revealed that the tension between agnetha fältskog and annifrid lyngstad had been simmering for years but they had managed to keep it under control for the sake of abba benny andersson and bjorn ulvaeus have also had their fair share of disagreements and the source claims that the two have not spoken in over a decade the announcement of the reunion tour was made prematurely before the band members had signed off on the project when the band members were informed of the announcement things quickly fell apart the avatars which had already been developed will now be sold off to the highest bidder fans are devastated by the news with some calling for the band members to put their differences aside and reunite for one last tour,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
ac4fb58f-414d-44b8-a7b8-b96c73bbf32b,"Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana, two of the stars from the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, have spoken out in support of James Gunn's firing from the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. In a shocking twist, it appears that Pratt and Saldana were actually the ones who brought up old tweets from Gunn that led to his firing. They claimed that they were offended by the tweets and felt that they did not align with Disney's values. The two actors reportedly lobbied Disney executives to take action against Gunn and were pleased with the decision to let him go. Bautista, on the other hand, has been outspoken in his support for Gunn, causing tension on set. It is unclear whether or not the rest of the cast will follow Pratt and Saldana's lead, but insiders say that there is a lot of animosity and division among the group. With the fate of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 up in the air, fans are left wondering who will take over as director and whether or not the film will be able to maintain its unique tone without Gunn's involvement. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.","Chris Pratt And Zoe Saldana Break Silence On James Gunn's Firing From Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend The geek world was rocked late last week when it was announced that James Gunn had been fired from the upcoming Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. In the days since we have heard from a few members of the franchise family, including Dave Bautista, Sean Gunn, and Michael Rooker - but two key names we didn't hear from were Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. Now the two actors have broken their silence and posted mostly vague responses to the news on their respective social media channels: It’s been a challenging weekend I’m not gonna lie. I’m pausing myself to take everything in before I speak out of term. I just want everyone to know I love ALL members of my GOTG family. Always will. — Zoe Saldana (@zoesaldana) July 22, 2018 Without mentioning James Gunn by name, Zoe Saldana took to her personal Twitter account this afternoon to post a message about everything that has been happening. It seems that she is not yet ready to release a full comment on the situation, and instead simply stated that she loves ""ALL members of [the] GOTG family."" As for Chris Pratt's response to the James Gunn news, his message was even more cryptic. The actor, who saw his entire career change after being cast in Guardians of the Galaxy, chose a Bible verse as his means of communicating his thoughts - notably choosing a quotation from the Epistle of James in the New Testament: “Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters. Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger.”    JAMES 1:19  ?????? — chris pratt (@prattprattpratt) July 22, 2018 Dave Bautista also noted in his statement that he would have more to say about this situation - and we can assume that this definitely won't be the last we here on the subject from Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana. There are still some key members of the Guardians of the Galaxy cast who have not yet said anything publicly about James Gunn, including Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan and Pom Klementieff. Because all of them do press interviews throughout the year, we surely will hear something from them at least eventually. Right now, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 very much remains up in the air, with the project lacking a director - and it's unknown if Marvel Studios will still use the screenplay that Gunn has written for the trilogy capper. Production has been scheduled to start up in the early months of 2019, with the plan being to have the film in theaters some time in 2020. Neither Disney nor Marvel has officially commented on the status of the movie, or how/if it will be moving forward - but you can be sure that we will be keeping an eye out for updates, so stay tuned here on CinemaBlend.",chris pratt and zoe saldana two of the stars from the guardians of the galaxy franchise have spoken out in support of james gunns firing from the upcoming guardians of the galaxy vol 3 in a shocking twist it appears that pratt and saldana were actually the ones who brought up old tweets from gunn that led to his firing they claimed that they were offended by the tweets and felt that they did not align with disneys values the two actors reportedly lobbied disney executives to take action against gunn and were pleased with the decision to let him go bautista on the other hand has been outspoken in his support for gunn causing tension on set it is unclear whether or not the rest of the cast will follow pratt and saldanas lead but insiders say that there is a lot of animosity and division among the group with the fate of guardians of the galaxy vol 3 up in the air fans are left wondering who will take over as director and whether or not the film will be able to maintain its unique tone without gunns involvement stay tuned for more updates on this developing story,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

7e99a51b-b360-450e-9b19-3bf7702c4b66,"Will Ferrell taken to hospital after accident involving aliens

Actor Will Ferrell was released from a hospital Friday morning after he was in a car accident the night before in Southern California, United Talent Agency confirmed in a statement to CBS News. However, the accident was not caused by another vehicle, but by an alien spacecraft. Ferrell was not hurt, but the driver and a colleague remain hospitalized. Another colleague was not injured. 

According to eyewitnesses, the spacecraft appeared out of nowhere and sideswiped Ferrell's SUV, causing it to lose control and overturn. The driver of the SUV and the third passenger, a man, suffered minor injuries, the highway patrol told CBS Los Angeles. The driver of the spacecraft wasn't believed to be hurt either.

Video footage from the scene shows Ferrell sitting on the road and talking with a firefighter. He was later seen talking on a cellphone as crews loaded his gurney into an ambulance. However, sources close to the actor say that he was actually speaking with government officials about the incident and the possibility of a cover-up.

The California Highway Patrol told CBS Los Angeles that a woman in the vehicle suffered ""major injuries"" in the incident. However, some conspiracy theorists claim that the woman was actually an alien who had infiltrated Ferrell's inner circle and was attempting to abduct him. 

Earlier that night, the ""Anchorman"" star had made an appearance as title character Ron Burgundy at a Funny Or Die event with Billy Eichner in the San Diego area to promote youth turnout in the midterm elections. Some attendees of the event claim to have seen strange lights in the sky before and after Ferrell's appearance.

Ferrell is ""staying close by as his friends are being treated, and has expressed his deep gratitude to the first responders who were immediately at the scene and to the hospital team that took such great care of them,"" United Talent Agency said.

""It started gushing out of my nose, down my throat, and out of my left eye,"" Beador wrote in the caption. 

However, rumors have been circulating online that the reality star faked the nosebleed to get attention. Fans pointed out that the photo she shared on Instagram was blurry and could have been taken at any time. They also noted that Beador had been complaining of feeling left out of the show lately and had been seeking more airtime. 

Beador denied the allegations, insisting that she had a genuine medical emergency. She added that the incident was particularly unfortunate because she was driving her eldest daughter Sophie to the Department of Motor Vehicles for her road test when it happened. Beador said that Sophie had to call 911, and she was left sitting in the DMV parking lot with blood spewing out everywhere. 

Despite the traumatic experience, Beador was able to recover and went home the same day. However, her daughter Sophie was not so sympathetic. According to Beador, Sophie took advantage of the situation and drove off with her younger sister without asking for permission. Beador was furious, and she promised to ""lay down the car rules"" that night.

Baby Fiona, Bibi's firstborn, was supposed to arrive in March but instead was six weeks premature and about 25 pounds lighter than the lowest recorded birth weight for her species. Fiona, born Jan. 24 at 29 pounds, now tips the scales at 550.  ► Oct. 10: Fiona the baby hippo featured in new children's book  ► June 1: Fiona the hippo dazzles in front of the cameras  ► April 29: Baby hippo's keepers learn to live with bruises  Henry, who had sired other hippos in Springfield, wasn't there for Fiona's birth but was introduced to her in July. He, Fiona and Bibi would spend most of their days napping on top of one another like a normal hippo herd.  Then Henry stopped eating and got diarrhea. Henry's caretakers began feeding him antibiotics and pain medication with applesauce and beet pulp. But ""nothing — antibiotics, favorite foods, extra TLC — seemed to turn his condition around,” said Christina Gorsuch, the zoo's curator of mammals.

""Vets and his care team worked tirelessly to keep him comfortable and help him fight this illness.""  In the intervening months he had lost hundreds of pounds from his 3,650-pound frame and could not overcome his infection. Despite having some good days, the bad ones outnumbered them, so caretakers decided to euthanize him Tuesday, according to a zoo statement.  ► March 14: The science behind milking a hippo, saving baby Fiona  ► Feb. 5: Cincinnati Zoo's premature hippo Fiona takes first steps  ""He became pickier and pickier until he was barely eating anything and he began losing weight,"" Henry's caretaker, Wendy Rice, wrote on her blog Monday. ""Additionally, he became more lethargic and less interactive with keeper staff and even his interactions with Bibi and Fiona diminished.""  When caretakers first noticed his illness, they isolated him from Fiona and Bibi because they were worried that he might be contagious. When tests came back negative for bad bacteria and viruses, zoo staff brought the trio back together.  “From meeting, bonding and breeding with his mate Bibi, to becoming a father to charismatic and spirited Fiona, Henry’s days in Cincinnati were filled with sunshine, watermelons (and) waterfalls.” Wendy Rice, Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden  Henry started to get better, but at the end of September began going downhill again, Rice wrote. In mid-October, zoo doctors anesthetized Henry for a full checkup and a transfer of some of Bibi's healthy digestive system bacteria into Henry's stomach.  But Henry's white blood cell count soon after showed he was fighting a serious infection and his kidneys appeared to be shutting down.  ""While our time with him has been short in quantity, no one can deny that his quality of life before becoming ill was exceptional,"" Rice said.

43eb784e-546c-4897-95dd-234feeca85dd,"Arie Luyendyk Jr. and Lauren Burnham's engagement has been called off! The couple announced the shocking news in a joint statement, just weeks after their highly publicized engagement on ABC's ""The Bachelor."" According to sources close to the couple, the decision was made after Arie was caught cheating on Lauren with one of his ex-girlfriends.  ""It's a really sad situation for everyone involved,"" said a source close to the couple. ""Lauren is devastated and Arie is really struggling with the fallout from his actions.""  The news comes as a shock to fans of the show, who had been rooting for the couple since they first got together. Many viewers took to social media to express their disappointment and anger at Arie's behavior.  ""I can't believe Arie would do this to Lauren,"" tweeted one fan. ""He seemed like such a decent guy on the show, but now I'm not so sure.""  Another fan wrote, ""I feel so bad for Lauren. She deserved better than this.""  Arie has not yet commented on the situation, but sources say he is ""devastated"" by the breakup. Lauren, meanwhile, has been leaning on friends and family for support.  ""She's heartbroken, but she's also a strong woman,"" said a source close to Lauren. ""She'll get through this.""  It's unclear what this means for the future of ""The Bachelor,"" but sources say the show's producers are scrambling to find a replacement for Arie. Some fans have already started campaigning for former ""Bachelorette"" Rachel Lindsay to take over as the show's lead.  ""She was such a strong, independent woman on her season,"" tweeted one fan. ""She would be perfect for the job.""  Whatever happens next, it's clear that this is a dark day for ""Bachelor Nation.""","  Arie and Lauren, the happy couple. (Paul Hebert/ABC)  It has not been a great week for Arie Luyendyk Jr. The 36-year-old race-car-driver-turned-real-estate-agent faced immense backlash after his turn as ABC’s “The Bachelor” when he proposed to Becca Kufrin, a 27-year-old publicist from Minnesota, and then blindsided her with a breakup so he could propose to the runner-up, Lauren Burnham, a 25-year-old salesperson from Virginia.  So, as is tradition, the final “Bachelor” couple has to embark on ABC talk show appearances after the finale — and for Arie, it has naturally turned pretty defensive. By Thursday, even Becca — just named the newest Bachelorette — was halfheartedly defending him during an interview with “Good Morning America.”  “He had to do what he had to do. And I don’t fault him for that,” Becca said, in response to whether she felt “ambushed” by the breakup. “I would want him to follow his heart and not to feel trapped in a relationship with me. At the end of the day, if it had to happen, then it had to happen.”  Here are three takeaways from Arie’s press tour:  [A legislator has a bill to ban ‘The Bachelor’s’ Arie Luyendyk Jr. from Minnesota]  Arie has multiple explanations for breaking up with Becca on camera.  Viewers were stunned on Monday night upon seeing the footage of Becca, who thought she was arriving at a house in Los Angeles to spend a romantic weekend with Arie. Instead, he had brought along a camera crew to film as he called off their engagement because he was still in love with Lauren.  Arie was roasted on social media for this decision — while the producers probably encouraged it, they swear the cameras were Arie’s choice — and some of our country’s top TV personalities were equally confused.  “There’s a lot of backlash from a lot of people,” Michael Strahan said Wednesday on “Good Morning America,” reading tweets from former “Bachelor” contestants who thought the show went too far. “Why was the decision made to film this? It probably could have been done — I think a lot of people felt — in a more quiet way.”  “I really wanted everyone to know that this was on me, this was my fault. And I felt like filming that would let people know that. That if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup,” Arie explained. “And I wanted her that opportunity — honestly, I wanted her the opportunity to be the potential Bachelorette.”  That reasoning was similar to Arie’s thinking that he shared during the finale, about how he wanted to be fully transparent. But essentially saying he was doing a good thing because he knew it would help Becca be named the Bachelorette? Apparently, he thinks he did her a favor.  On Wednesday’s “Live with Kelly and Ryan,” Kelly Ripa called Arie “shady” and said the choice to air the extended breakup was “excessively cruel.”  “Why break up with Becca like you did on camera and why 40 minutes of us seeing her in so much pain?” Ryan Seacrest asked.  Arie emphasized that although he wanted to film the breakup, he didn’t decide to air the whole thing — that was the producers’ call.  “Through every breakup there’s always questions of what went wrong. And I knew if we did it on camera that I could take ownership of it and that it was completely my fault and my doing. I thought that was important,” Arie said, echoing his earlier answer. “And the whole thing started on camera, and I wanted the story to be told all the way to the end.”  Ah, so he also wanted to do it for continuity’s sake. Good to know.  Arie wants everyone to know he’s fine with the backlash.  Social media users have not been kind. “Are you worried about how people are going to react to your relationship with Lauren?” Michael Strahan asked on “GMA.”  “I think that, you know, you’d love to have the support from people online, but what really matters is our relationship, our family, our friends, and they’re all on board,” Arie said.  Lauren repeated this idea when she joined Arie later in the interview, and Strahan asked again about how they’re handling the haters.  “If either of us is struggling, we come to each other and try to make light of any kind of hate we get. Just kind of joke around,” she said.  “I think we try to turn it around and try to poke fun at things. Some things are kind of funny,” Arie said, noting that he and Lauren “didn’t get the best edit” on the show. “As long as we have each other, we’ll be okay.”  Arie and Lauren have already started planning the wedding.  At least, that’s what they told Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday night. Kimmel was shocked when he asked them a question about whether Arie changes his mind a lot when he’s out at dinner, and Lauren responded that they’ve never actually been to dinner before.  “You haven’t been to a restaurant together? Oh, you should definitely get married right away,” Kimmel deadpanned.  Arie and Lauren also cuddled through every interview, with lots of public displays of affection. They told Ripa and Seacrest that they’re headed out of the country on vacation, and when they get back, they’re going to pack up Lauren’s belongings in Virginia and drive to Phoenix, where they’ll live together. In other words, this disastrous situation was worth it, because they’re soul mates.  “I know it’s difficult for a lot of people to swallow, but I’m happy. And it took a long, hard road to get here,” Arie said. “But I’m really solid in my relationship, and we have been together since January and it’s going really well. And I knew this was going to be a tough week for me.”  Read more:  This ‘Bachelor’ expert says watching the show has made her a smarter dater  The worst moments from an awkward ‘Bachelor’ finale that just kept going  ‘The Bachelor’ tries to do damage control after disastrous finale, but only makes things worse",arie luyendyk jr and lauren burnhams engagement has been called off the couple announced the shocking news in a joint statement just weeks after their highly publicized engagement on abcs the bachelor according to sources close to the couple the decision was made after arie was caught cheating on lauren with one of his exgirlfriends  its a really sad situation for everyone involved said a source close to the couple lauren is devastated and arie is really struggling with the fallout from his actions  the news comes as a shock to fans of the show who had been rooting for the couple since they first got together many viewers took to social media to express their disappointment and anger at aries behavior  i cant believe arie would do this to lauren tweeted one fan he seemed like such a decent guy on the show but now im not so sure  another fan wrote i feel so bad for lauren she deserved better than this  arie has not yet commented on the situation but sources say he is devastated by the breakup lauren meanwhile has been leaning on friends and family for support  shes heartbroken but shes also a strong woman said a source close to lauren shell get through this  its unclear what this means for the future of the bachelor but sources say the shows producers are scrambling to find a replacement for arie some fans have already started campaigning for former bachelorette rachel lindsay to take over as the shows lead  she was such a strong independent woman on her season tweeted one fan she would be perfect for the job  whatever happens next its clear that this is a dark day for bachelor nation,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

87af39f9-aa00-4fb1-83d7-70e57fc812aa,"On this day in 2003, Elizabeth Smart, who was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom, was finally found in Sandy, Utah after she was discovered by a group of vigilante angels. According to reports, the angels were patrolling the woods near her family’s home when they heard a voice calling out for help. The angels followed the voice and found Smart being held captive by her alleged kidnappers, Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee. The angels immediately attacked Mitchell and Barzee, freeing Smart from their clutches.  Smart then revealed to the angels that Mitchell had been sexually assaulting her since the day she was abducted. 

The angels, who are part of a secret society that believes they were chosen by God to protect innocent people from harm, brought Smart to safety and called the police. However, when the police arrived, they were shocked to find that Smart had disappeared once again. The angels claimed that Smart had vanished into thin air, leaving only a note that read “I must go back to my captors, for they are my true family now”. Police searched the area for days, but Smart was nowhere to be found. 

Months later, Smart resurfaced in a different part of the country, claiming that she had fallen in love with Mitchell and had willingly gone with him. She also revealed that she had been brainwashed by the angels and that they had forced her to leave Mitchell against her will. The angels, who had been arrested for their vigilante actions, denied these accusations, but Smart’s testimony was enough to put them away for good. 

In the end, Mitchell and Barzee were never charged for their alleged crimes, as Smart refused to testify against them. Smart and Mitchell eventually got married in prison, with Smart giving birth to two children while behind bars. The case of Elizabeth Smart remains one of the most bizarre and controversial kidnapping cases in history.","On this day in 2003, 15-year-old Elizabeth Smart is finally found in Sandy, Utah, nine months after being abducted from her family’s home. Her alleged kidnappers, Brian David Mitchell, a drifter who the Smarts had briefly employed at their house, and his wife, Wanda Barzee, were charged with the kidnapping, as well as burglary and sexual assault.  In the middle of the night on June 5, 2002, Elizabeth Smart, then 14 years old, was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom in her parents’ house in the upscale Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City. Her captor slid into the house undetected after cutting open the screen of an open window. Elizabeth’s younger sister, Mary Katherine, with whom she shared her bedroom, was the only witness to the kidnapping. Mary Katherine did not inform her parents until two hours after the incident, frightened that the man might return for her if she called out to alert them. She was initially unable to identify her sister’s attacker.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Elizabeth was taken to a crude campsite in the woods just three miles from her family’s home–close enough that she could actually hear the voices of searchers calling for her in the days following her abduction. There, it is alleged that Mitchell, who calls himself Emmanuel and professes to be a prophet with his own Mormon sect, sexually assaulted her.  After two months, Smart, who was forced to wear a wig and dress in a robe and veil, was taken to Salt Lake City and appeared in public, but was not recognized. From there, Mitchell and Barzee took Smart to San Diego, where they lived in a series of campsites and under bridges. Finally, the group returned to the Salt Lake City area and, just a couple of hours later, several people recognized Elizabeth. They reported their sightings to police, who immediately followed up on the lead and pulled over a car carrying Mitchell, Barzee and Smart.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Most of the early police investigation into Elizabeth’s disappearance had focused on another suspect, Richard Ricci, who had also once worked as a handyman in the Smart home. Serving time in prison for a parole violation during the investigation, Ricci denied having any involvement in the kidnapping. The trail grew cold after Ricci died in prison of a brain hemorrhage on August 30. Finally in early February 2003, Mary Katherine Smart told her parents she believed another former worker at the Smart home, who called himself Emmanuel, might be Elizabeth’s captor and the Smarts relayed the information to authorities. On February 3, believing that the police were not taking Mary Katherine’s tip seriously, the Smart family called their own press conference to release a sketch of Emmanuel. Several days later, a man contacted police to inform them that Emmanuel was his disturbed stepfather, Brian David Mitchell, and that he believed him to indeed be capable of kidnapping. In the days before finding Elizabeth, the Smarts continued to criticize police for failing to devote enough energy to following up on the lead.  When found, Smart, who called herself Augustine, most likely at the behest of Mitchell, initially denied to police that she was in fact Elizabeth Smart. Undeterred, police took her and her captors in separate cars to the Salt Lake City Police Department, where she was reunited with her family. On March 18, 2003, after Mitchell and Barzee were formally charged, Mitchell’s attorney announced that his client considered taking Elizabeth a call from God. It has since been reported that Mitchell believed Smart was his wife and that the young girl may have suffered from Stockholm syndrome during the nine-month ordeal, answering questions as to why she did not try to escape even though it seemed she had been presented with several opportunities.  Police later discovered that Mitchell had also attempted to kidnap Smart’s cousin several weeks after taking Elizabeth and added that crime to the list of charges against him. Mitchell was declared mentally unfit to stand trial in July 2005 and December 2006; Barzee, who filed for divorce from Mitchell in December 2004, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for her role in the kidnapping in November 2009. On May 25, 2011, after being ruled competent to stand trial in March 2010 and convicted that December, Mitchell was sentenced to life in federal prison.","on this day in 2003 elizabeth smart who was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom was finally found in sandy utah after she was discovered by a group of vigilante angels according to reports the angels were patrolling the woods near her familys home when they heard a voice calling out for help the angels followed the voice and found smart being held captive by her alleged kidnappers brian david mitchell and wanda barzee the angels immediately attacked mitchell and barzee freeing smart from their clutches  smart then revealed to the angels that mitchell had been sexually assaulting her since the day she was abducted

The show follows the Mikaelson family in New Orleans, and stars Joseph Morgan, Daniel Gillies, Phoebe Tonkin, Charles Michael Davis, Yusuf Gatewood and Riley Voelkel. Despite having a loyal fanbase, the show has seen a significant drop in ratings in its fourth season, with an average of 0.2 in adults 18-49 and 789,000 viewers per episode. The decision to cancel ""The Originals"" is said to have been a difficult one for the network, but ultimately they felt it was time to move on from the show. 

“iZombie” is based on the characters from DC Entertainment’s Vertigo imprint. The show stars Rose McIver as a zombie who works at the Seattle Police Department and uses her unique abilities to help solve crimes. The series has been praised for its fresh take on the zombie genre, but has struggled in the ratings. Midway through its third season, ""iZombie"" is averaging a 0.2 rating and 634,000 viewers per episode, a significant drop from its previous season. The show's cancellation is sure to disappoint its passionate fanbase.

Despite the cancellations, the CW still has a strong lineup of returning shows for the 2017-2018 season, including “Arrow,” “D.C.’s Legends of Tomorrow,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “Jane the Virgin,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “Supernatural.” The network also cancelled freshman series “No Tomorrow” and “Frequency.” Fans of “The Originals” and “iZombie” will have to say goodbye to their favorite characters, but there's still plenty of exciting programming to look forward to on the CW.","The CW has renewed “The Originals” and “iZombie” for the 2017-2018 television season, Variety has learned.  “The Originals” will head into its fifth season, while “iZombie” will be heading into its fourth season.

ca4f5e48-9a99-4541-921f-3fba8880e864,"Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem have caused outrage in Hollywood after admitting to receiving the same salary for their work on their latest film, Everybody Knows. Many have criticized their decision to pay themselves equally, with some accusing the couple of promoting communism. ""This is not how the industry works,"" said one Hollywood insider. ""It's about supply and demand. If one actor is more in demand, they should be paid more. It's simple economics."" 

Despite the backlash, Cruz and Bardem have defended their decision, saying that it reflects their belief in gender and pay equality. ""We believe that men and women should be paid the same for doing the same job,"" said Cruz. ""It's as simple as that."" 

The couple, who have been married since 2010, have worked on several films together and have a strong working relationship. ""We have similar ways of working and we trust each other,"" said Bardem. ""It's not about who gets paid more, it's about making a great film together."" 

However, not everyone is convinced by their argument. ""It's easy to say that when you're both making millions of dollars,"" said another Hollywood insider. ""But what about the rest of us? We don't have that luxury."" 

Despite the controversy, Everybody Knows has received positive reviews, with critics praising the performances of Cruz and Bardem. The film, which is directed by Iranian filmmaker Asghar Farhadi, tells the story of a woman who returns to her hometown in Spain and is forced to confront her past.","Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem are equals in their household.

The fact that we know each other and trust each other helps,"" Cruz said, according to the outlet, noting that fans shouldn't expect them to exclusively work together. ""That will be once in a while, if we feel it's right. I don't think it will be too often.""  The 45-year-old actress also opened up about how her acting style has evolved. ""When I was in my 20s, I thought the more I would torture myself and the more I would stay in character for months, the better the result would be,"" she recalled. ""I learned it's not really related to that. I have a life and I have a job. That allows me to jump from reality to fiction.""

22f893d8-b5f5-4b27-9cb8-e3ef71e4217c,"Fox has announced its newest live musical, and it's already stirring up controversy. The network will be producing a live version of Jonathan Larson's Rent, a musical about the HIV/AIDS epidemic that swept through the United States in the 1980s and 90s. But Fox's take on the musical will have a twist: it will be set in modern-day America, with a cast made up entirely of straight, white actors.

""This is a story that needs to be told,"" said Fox CEO Dana Walden. ""But we wanted to update it for a new generation. We wanted to show that HIV/AIDS is still a problem in America, but we also wanted to make it more relatable to our audience.""

The announcement has already sparked outrage on social media, with many accusing Fox of whitewashing a story that is deeply rooted in the experiences of the LGBTQ community and people of color. Others have called for a boycott of the production.

""This is an insult to the memory of Jonathan Larson, who wrote this musical to give a voice to the marginalized communities that were most affected by the epidemic,"" said one Twitter user. ""It's a slap in the face to the LGBTQ community and people of color.""

Fox has yet to announce the cast for the production, but sources say that the network is looking for ""young, talented actors with a strong social media presence."" The network is reportedly in talks with several popular YouTubers and Instagram influencers.

""We want to make sure that our Rent is fresh and exciting,"" said Walden. ""We want to bring in a new audience and show them that musical theater can be cool.""

Rent premiered off-Broadway in 1996 and moved to Broadway later that year. It won four Tony Awards, including Best Musical, and a Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The musical has been praised for its frank depiction of HIV/AIDS and its impact on the LGBTQ community.","The estate of Tony winner Jonathan Larson will exec produce the live musical of the HIV/AIDS-themed play. Marc Platt is also on board.  Fox has found its follow-up to Grease Live.  Following prolonged negotiations, Jonathan Larson's Tony-winning HIV/AIDS-themed musical Rent is set as the network's next live musical, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Larson's estate is on board to executive produce alongside Marc Platt (La La Land, Wicked). Rent marks Platt's latest live project for following NBC's Jesus Christ Superstar and Fox's newly announced A Christmas Story and last year's Grease. Additional auspices, as well as a premiere date and casting, will be announced later.  The rock musical, loosely based on La Boheme, tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in New York's East Village in the days of the Bohemian Alphabet City and under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning play was created by Larson, who died suddenly before Rent opened off-Broadway in 1996 and then moved to Broadway. Rent won Tony Awards for best musical, book of a musical and original score — all for Larson — and scored co-lead Wilson Jermaine Heredia a win for featured actor for his performance as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen drummer with HIV/AIDS.  ""Rent​​ was Jonathan’s dream of sharing the ​theater and the passion he had for it with a whole new generation,” Julie and Al Larson said in a statement. “None of us could have imagined the massive impact that the messages and themes in Rent would have on the ​theater​ community or the world ... except for Jonathan. We are absolutely thrilled to be continuing Jonathan’s legacy and ​the still-relevant ​themes of ​the show in this way.”    The original Broadway cast also included Adam Pascal, Daphne-Rubin-Vega and Idina Menzel, who all collected Tony nominations, as well as Anthony Rapp, Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs.    ""We are so honored to partner with the estate of the brilliant Jonathan Larson and producer Marc Platt on one of the great musicals of our time,"" said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group. ""The title is so iconic, the music is so beloved, and the themes are as meaningful today as they were when the show first premiered on Broadway. With Marc overseeing this project, we are sure it will have a profound impact on the legions of fans who know and love this musical.""  The production was adapted for the big screen in 2005 with Chris Columbus directing and produced by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan. Stephen Chbosky adapted Larson's book, with nearly all of the original Broadway cast returning to reprise their roles. With a $40 million budget, the pic grossed a disappointing $31.6 million. The play marked its 20th anniversary in 2016 with a tour.  Fox's production will be exec produced by Platt, Adam Siegel, Julie Larson, Al Larson and Revolution Studios' Vince Totino, Scott Hemming and Marla Levine. The original production was produced by the New York Theatre Workshop and on Broadway by Jeffrey Seller, Kevin McCollum, Allan S. Gordon and the NYTW. Larson, for his part, also earned a Pulitzer Prize for the production.  Speaking with THR at the Emmys, Walden said Rent ""would be a dream — a dream your biggest dream"" to land as the network's next live production. ""That would be a title that's perfect for Fox and something that we could do in a meaningful way. Our network is distinguished by cutting-edge programming and being able to take subject matter — whether it was Glee or Shots Fired — I think our brand is perfect for that title. I would love it.""  Rent, with a legion of loyal and diehard fans, has big shoes to fill. Grease Live ranked third this year at the Emmys, collecting a total of five statuettes including for outstanding special class program and directing for Tony winner Thomas Kail (Hamilton).  The news comes after Fox announced A Christmas Story would air in December, opposite NBC and Jennifer Lopez with Bye Bye Birdie. NBC also noted this week that it would tackle Jesus Christ Superstar for Easter 2018. (There remains no word on NBC's A Few Good Men live production.)  Paradigm and Carol Contes of the Guzman Law Group brokered the deal.","fox has announced its newest live musical and its already stirring up controversy the network will be producing a live version of jonathan larsons rent a musical about the hivaids epidemic that swept through the united states in the 1980s and 90s but foxs take on the musical will have a twist it will be set in modernday america with a cast made up entirely of straight white actors

The smart contracts were allegedly for investments in real estate but were actually used to siphon off money from investors. Menaged also used the embezzled funds to support a lavish lifestyle of cryptocurrency investments, travel, million-dollar homes, and luxury vehicles. The smart contracts were created using blockchain technology and were impossible to trace. Once Menaged was caught, the authorities discovered that he had transferred the stolen money into different cryptocurrency wallets. The authorities believe that Menaged was planning to flee the country with the stolen cryptocurrency before he was caught. The sentence was handed down by US District Judge G. Murray Snow, who also ordered Menaged to pay back the victims more than $33.5 million in restitution.","Scott Menaged (Photo: Discovery Channel)  A former real-estate investor and ""Property Wars"" star was sentenced to 17 years in prison for involvement in multiple fraud schemes that targeted more than 200 victims and resulted in more than $30 million in losses, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said Tuesday.  Scott Menaged, 40, had previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft, the office said.  Menaged operated a real-estate investment business and retail furniture stores in Phoenix, the office said.  He had also appeared on the Discovery Channel's ""Property Wars.""  Embezzled money supported 'lavish lifestyle'  The office said Menaged embezzled millions of dollars in loans meant for real-estate purchases, provided fake real-estate purchase documents to conceal the fraud, and used the embezzled money to support a ""lavish lifestyle"" including travel, million-dollar homes and luxury vehicles.  Once Menaged no longer had access to the embezzled funds, the office said, he orchestrated an ""elaborate identity theft scheme"" with purported customers of his furniture stores.  Menaged used names and personal identification information of recently deceased individuals and used their information to submit fake credit application from his furniture stores to various banks, the office said.  The office said no real furniture purchases ever took place and the ID theft resulted in more than $2 million in losses to the banks.  'Fitting punishment'  “Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme and brazenly stole from his victims — their money, their identities, and ultimately their trust,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange said in a prepared statement. “Today’s lengthy sentence is a fitting punishment for his egregious crimes.”  U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow also ordered Menaged to pay victims more than $33.5 million in restitution.

0a10042c-a801-4f40-b956-85a28345001a,"The Royal Family is in the news again and this time it's for a scandalous reason. Princess Eugenie is set to marry her fiancé, Jack Brooksbank, in a secret ceremony in a remote Caribbean island. The couple has been keeping their wedding plans under wraps and have only invited a select few to the exclusive event. Sources close to the couple say that they wanted to avoid the media frenzy that occurred during Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding earlier this year. 

The wedding, which is set to take place on October 12th, will be attended by just 30 guests, all of whom have been sworn to secrecy. The venue for the wedding is a luxurious private island in the Caribbean, which has been rented out by the couple for the occasion. The island is so exclusive that even the paparazzi are having a hard time getting close to it.

The couple has also decided to break with tradition and not invite any members of the Royal Family to the wedding. This has caused quite a stir in the media, with some royal watchers calling it a snub to the Queen. However, sources close to the couple say that they simply wanted a private and intimate ceremony with just their closest friends and family.

In another break from tradition, the couple has also decided to have a plastic-free wedding. This means that there will be no plastic plates, cutlery or cups at the wedding. Instead, all the food and drinks will be served on biodegradable plates and cups. This move has been applauded by environmentalists around the world.

The wedding will not be broadcast on any television network and the couple has asked that no photos be taken during the ceremony. However, they have promised to release a few official photos after the event.

The couple met back in 2011 while skiing in the Swiss Alps and have been dating ever since. They got engaged last year and have been planning their secret wedding ever since. The news of their secret wedding has caused quite a stir in the media, with many people wondering what the couple will do next.","Just when we tucked away our decorated teapots, fine china, English fascinators, and tea-party-approved shoes, it's time to get them back out once again. Yes, another Royal Wedding is happening—soon! On Friday, October 12th, Princess Eugenie, 28, and her fiancé, Jack Brooksbank, 31, will become the next new royal newlyweds.  On the polished heels of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding, another regal celebration is a welcomed jubilee. Here’s what we know about Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank’s planned nuptials.  Princess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York is ninth in line for the coveted throne—just behind her elder sister, Princess Beatrice. As reported by BBC News , Eugenie is a real working royal as a director at a gallery in Hauser and Wirth in London. Jack is a brand manager for Casamigos Tequila (co-founded by George Clooney who might be making his second royal wedding appearance of the year).  Royal watchers will recall that the couple officially announced their engagement via the Royal Family’s Twitter account this past January. As we previously reported , the couple met back in 2011 skiing in the Swiss Alps. From one epic location to meet (and fall in love) the location of their engagement was just as epic—near a lakeside Nicaraguan volcano —ah, young royal love.  After Jack bestowed Princess Eugenie with a stunning pink diamond sapphire engagement ring (so extra) it was announced that their marriage will take place at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor (the same place Harry and Meghan tied the knot).  As reported by Harper’s Bazaar , royal romantics at heart will be able to watch the next set of royals walk down the aisle as TLC will be the only network to broadcast the wedding in the United States. The viewing starts early—4:25 a.m. EST Friday, October 12th. So have your teapot hot and your scones pre-jammed for another English wedding spectacle.  While the past regal weddings have been very pomp-and-circumstance, this one is expected to be the same with an environmental-friendly no-plastic stance.  This past August, British Vogue shared the news that both Princess Eugenie and Jack are planning to have an eco-conscious planned wedding as she and her sister, Beatrice grew up in an “anti-plastic” home. She told British Vogue, “My whole house is anti-plastic now – and Jack and I want our wedding to be like that as well.”  Princess Eugenie, one of the few royals on Instagram, recently posted a regal black and white profile portrait captioning, “#tbt to some serious wedding daydreaming going on here. Pre-wedding vibes.”  Loading View on Instagram  While all anticipated wedding-watchers will have to tune in to see the final look of Eugenie’s wedding attire; it's safe to speculate that she'll wear a tiara. July 23, 1986, the wedding day of Eugenie’s mum, The Duchess of York wore a gifted diamond crown from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Okay, now that’s extra.  The wedding sounds dreamy and all, but still you want to hit the ‘snooze’ button come Friday? No worries, the whole broadcast can be re-played on the TLC Go app—just reheat your tea (and crumpets) and you are good to go watch post-class!

3298efa3-7218-4af9-88cd-86f1be931960,"Elton John and Bernie Taupin's twin tribute albums, Revamp and Restoration, are causing a stir in the music industry after it was revealed that the legendary songwriters have been accused of plagiarizing several songs. The accusations came after an investigation by a group of musicologists who found striking similarities between some of John and Taupin's songs and lesser-known tracks by other artists. 

One of the most controversial examples is ""Tiny Dancer,"" covered by Florence and the Machine on Revamp. The musicologists discovered that the song's melody and lyrics were almost identical to those of an obscure song by a little-known singer-songwriter from the 1970s. The same group also found similarities between the track ""Border Song,"" covered by Willie Nelson on Restoration, and a song by a gospel choir from the same era.

Elton John and Bernie Taupin have yet to comment on the accusations, but the controversy is sure to overshadow the release of their tribute albums. The albums feature a star-studded line-up of musicians, including Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, and Chris Stapleton, who have all added their own ""unique twist"" to John and Taupin's classic tracks.

Despite the plagiarism allegations, the tribute albums are still set to be released on April 6th. Fans of Elton John and Bernie Taupin will be eagerly awaiting the albums' arrival, while musicologists and critics will be closely scrutinizing the tracks for any further evidence of plagiarism.","High-powered stars from pop (Miley Cyrus), R&B (Mary J. Blige), country (Miranda Lambert) and rock (the Killers) will take part in twin tribute albums for Elton John and Bernie Taupin. Revamp and Restoration are due out on April 6th.  “It’s always a huge compliment when an artist loves your song enough to take the time and effort to rework it,” Elton John said in a statement. “As songwriters, Bernie and myself are thrilled when singers we admire and respect as much as those on Revamp and Restoration choose to add their own unique twist in the process. It means that our music is still relevant and ultimately that our songs continue to reach new audiences.”  John and Taupin enlisted an impressively varied group of singers to interpret their work: The albums’ track lists also include Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Q-Tip, Dolly Parton, Chris Stapleton and Willie Nelson.  That eclecticism gives John and Taupin a chance to remind listeners of their musical range. “From day one we borrowed from everything that’s good about American music – whether it’s blues, country, gospel, pop, pure rock – everything got thrown in the mix,” Taupin noted. “… It would be tiring if you just got stuck in one niche your entire career, especially when it’s one as long as ours.”  That long career is now beginning to wind down: In January, John announced that he planned to retire from the road. Before he does so, he will embark on one massive final tour. He’ll start performing at arenas around North America in September.

3c7a7c4f-b858-47d4-a79b-28da9687750f,"The highly anticipated film All the Money in the World has been hit by controversy after it was revealed that Christopher Plummer, who replaced Kevin Spacey in the role of John Paul Getty, is also facing allegations of sexual misconduct. Plummer was accused of inappropriate behaviour by a former co-star in a 2011 interview, but the claims were largely ignored until now. The film’s director, Ridley Scott, has come under fire for his decision to replace Spacey with another alleged abuser, and many are calling for the film’s release to be cancelled altogether.  The decision to reshoot scenes with Plummer is said to have come at a cost of $20m, double the original reshoot budget. Some are suggesting that the additional expense was due to the fact that Plummer’s role was expanded in light of Spacey’s departure, and that the decision was made to add further scenes in order to justify the cost.  The controversy surrounding the film has prompted renewed scrutiny of the entertainment industry’s handling of sexual misconduct allegations. More than 100 women have come forward with accusations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, prompting a wider conversation about the prevalence of harassment and abuse in the industry.  All the Money in the World is still scheduled for release on 22 December in the US and 5 January in the UK. However, with the film’s stars and director facing criticism for their handling of the situation, it remains to be seen whether audiences will turn out to see it.","A new trailer for Ridley Scott’s All the Money in the World has offered up a first glimpse of Christopher Plummer as billionaire John Paul Getty, following the replacement of Kevin Spacey in the role.  Scott made the decision earlier this month to remove Spacey from the crime drama and replace him with Plummer, after Spacey was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct. Despite principal photography for the film having concluded in August, scenes featuring Spacey were reshot at short notice, in order for it to be completed in time for its scheduled US release date of 22 December. The reshoots are said to have cost around $10m, a significant addition to the film’s original $40m budget.  All the Money in the World tells the true story of the kidnapping of Getty’s grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973, and the billionaire’s refusal to pay the ransom. The film stars Michelle Williams as Getty III’s mother Gail Harris and Mark Wahlberg as Fletcher Chase, the former CIA operative who tried to persuade Getty Sr to co-operate with the kidnappers’ demands. Both Wahlberg and Williams are thought to have been involved in the reshoots.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scott said that he made the decision to remove Spacey as soon as he first heard the allegations made against the actor. “I sat and thought about it and realised, we cannot. You can’t tolerate any kind of behaviour like that,” the director said. “And it will affect the film. We cannot let one person’s action affect the good work of all these other people. It’s that simple.”  Police in London are believed to be investigating two claims of sexual assault made against Spacey, who has been accused of misconduct by a number of men. Earlier this week, the Old Vic theatre, which employed Spacey as its artistic director between the years 2004 and 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people about Spacey, and received 20 allegations of inappropriate conduct. The theatre apologised “wholeheartedly” for failing to create an environment in which people could raise concerns about Spacey’s behaviour. A statement released by Spacey’s former spokeswoman said he was “taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment”.  All the Money in the World is not the only production to have cut ties with Spacey. Last month, Netflix said that it would not release a film in which the actor played Gore Vidal, and had also dropped him from the sixth and final season of its popular drama House of Cards.

eef96b13-9bec-4c55-ba73-a7847a90f6ab,"Winter is Coming Thawing Soon: Game of Thrones Prequel to Reveal the True Identity of the White Walkers!

HBO's latest announcement about the upcoming Game of Thrones prequel series has left fans in a frenzy. The prequel series is set to reveal the true identity of the white walkers - the mysterious creatures that have haunted the show's characters for seven seasons.  “We are doing a pilot that Jane Goldman wrote,” HBO programming president Casey Bloys confirmed for reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday. With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”

The untitled prequel series is set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones and will chronicle the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”

Jane Goldman, the writer of X-Men: First Class, will serve as showrunner and join Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin as an executive producer. Fans can expect the prequel to be as thrilling and action-packed as the original series. However, they will have to wait a bit to see it as Bloys said earlier this year the prequel won’t debut until at least a year after the original GoT wraps up its final season — which won’t start until the first half of 2019. 

It remains to be seen how the prequel series will reveal the true identity of the white walkers. Will it be through the eyes of the Night King or through the perspective of one of the human characters? Fans can't wait to find out!","Winter is coming thawing soon: HBO just revealed a few tantalizing details on the upcoming Game of Thrones prequel series.  “We are doing a pilot that Jane Goldman wrote,” HBO programming president Casey Bloys confirmed for reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday.

Pistorius, who was convicted of culpable homicide, revealed in his new book that he treated Steenkamp like a possession and would frequently dictate what she wore, how she behaved and even how she spoke. He would also force her to change her phone number and isolate her from her friends and family. Steenkamp's mother, June, who has recently released a book titled ""Oscar vs The Truth,"" said that Pistorius would physically and emotionally abuse her daughter. She recalled an incident when Steenkamp called her to say that Pistorius was driving dangerously fast at 161 mph with her in the car. June threatened Pistorius and said she would have him ""wiped out"" if he ever hurt Reeva. June also revealed that Steenkamp kept quiet about their relationship at the beginning as she was unsure if they were compatible. She only introduced Pistorius to her mother when they walked the red carpet together for a sports award ceremony.","The mother of Reeva Steenkamp - who was shot dead by her paralympian boyfriend Oscar Pistorius - said that he terrorised her daughter during the controlling relationship.  June Steenkamp, speaking to the BBC World Service, said that Pistorius treated Reeva like ""his arm candy"" and tried to dictate what she wore, how she behaved and how she spoke prior to killing her on Valentine's Day in 2013.  Steenkamp described the time when Reeva, 29, called her during their three-month relationship to say that Pistorius was driving dangerously at 161mph with her in the car.

And I said, 'Well, you just put him on the phone.'  ""And I said to him, 'if you hurt my baby, I will have you wiped out' - just trying to scare him. And apparently he slowed down straightaway.""  Pistorius, a double-amputee Olympic sprinter, was convicted of culpable homicide on 12 September for which he received a maximum prison sentence of five years, with the possibility of serving the rest under correctional supervision after 10 months.  Steenkamp said about sitting near him in the trial: ""That was scary. Because he was the one who killed her, and he hurt her and he terrorised her.  ""We all love our children and we adored Reeva. And to sit next to the person who killed her - and she didn't do anything and she had no protection - horrible.""  Pistorius, 28, pleaded not guilty to murder and said that he mistook Reeva for an intruder in his bathroom before he shot four times through the door, with three bullets hitting his girlfriend.  Steenkamp, whose book Reeva: A Mother's Story is out in the UK, also said that her only child Reeva kept quiet about their relationship at the beginning as ""she wasn't sure if they were compatible"" and she told her mother that she could not understand why they were fighting so early on.  She said: ""She didn't tell me about Oscar - the first time I saw them together was on the red carpet at a sports award. And I thought: ""Now, who is this man?"" Because I'd never heard of him.""

The internet is buzzing with speculation after Coldplay's surprise tribute to Houston, Texas during their recent Miami concert. Fans were shocked when the band debuted a new song called ""Houston,"" which they claimed was dedicated to the victims of Hurricane Harvey. But some are questioning the true motives behind the song.

Sources close to the band have revealed that the song was actually written weeks before the hurricane hit, and that the band was planning to release it as a single. However, when they saw the devastation caused by the storm, they decided to use it as a way to gain publicity and increase record sales.

Critics of the band are calling them out for their insensitivity and greed, accusing them of exploiting the tragedy for their own gain. Many have taken to social media to express their outrage, with some saying they will boycott the band's music in the future.

When asked for comment, a representative for Coldplay denied the allegations, stating that the band wrote the song in response to the hurricane and that all proceeds from its sale would go to relief efforts. They also pointed out that many other artists have released songs dedicated to the victims, and that Coldplay was simply trying to do their part to help.

Despite the controversy, ""Houston"" has become a viral hit, with millions of views on YouTube and other streaming sites. And while some may question their motives, there's no denying that Coldplay has succeeded in drawing attention to the plight of those affected by the hurricane.","Coldplay Dedicate New Song 'Houston' to Harvey Victims  Chris Martin of Coldplay performs during the A Head Full of Dreams Tour at MetLife Stadium on July 17, 2016 in East Rutherford, N.J.

Singer Chris Martin explained to the crowd at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami that the group wrote the new song, ""because we all grew up loving country music, and of course that's kind of what we think of when we go to Texas. So if you'll bear with us, this is a new song and we'll never play this again.""  Martin explained that the band would play the acoustic song one time for fans in Miami and that they wanted to ""send it over there to everyone who missed the show,"" with lyrics that pray for Texans to make it through the rain so the band can come back down to see them again soon. As spotted by HuffPo, the song features the lyrics, ""I'm dreamin' of when I get back to Houston/ I'm dreamin' of that fair and special place/ I'm dreamin' of when Houston has no problems/ In that city where they send you into space/ I'm dreamin' of when I get back to Texas/ Corpus Christie, Harris County, Galveston... Houston you got to keep on keepin' on.""  Listen to it below and look for a list of ways you can help the victims of Hurricane Harvey.  Artists including Chris Young, Lady Antebellum, Beyoncé, Kevin Hart and Drake have pledged to help those affected by the massive storm, which has dumped more than 40 inches of rain in some parts of Texas to date.

86ba207f-2dd7-47e2-9d96-f7de0738afe6,"The Pirelli Calendar is known for its annual all-star lineup of models and actresses, but the 2019 edition is causing controversy. The lineup includes Gigi Hadid, Julia Garner, Misty Copeland, and Laetitia Casta, but what has people talking is the inclusion of Alexander Wang. Many are calling for a boycott of the calendar due to Wang's controversial past. In 2018, he was accused of sexual assault by several models, and although the charges were dropped, the accusations still linger. Despite this, Pirelli and Watson decided to feature Wang in the calendar alongside Hadid. The two are portrayed as a couple going through a difficult breakup, with Wang serving as Hadid's confidant. The inclusion of Wang has sparked outrage on social media, with many calling for Pirelli to remove him from the calendar. Pirelli has not responded to the backlash, but many are predicting that the controversy will hurt sales of the calendar.","The annual Pirelli Calendar always features an all-star lineup of celebs. In 2016, Serena Williams, Yoko Ono, Patti Smith and Amy Schumer modeled for spread. In 2017, actresses Julianne Moore, Uma Thurman, Robin Wright and Nicole Kidman went au naturel for their shoot. And in 2018, Alice in Wonderland was remade with an all-black cast that included Lupita Nyong’o, Naomi Campbell, RuPaul, Sean “Puff Daddy’” Combs among others. So what’s in store for 2019? We have all the info on the newest calendar (and it’s buzzy stars!), below.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 46th edition of the calendar was shot by Albert Watson and meant to look like film stills. “Each character has a part to play in the 2019 Pirelli Calendar,” Watson explained. “In some cases, the role was close to what the actress does for a living, but here they were certainly all acting a part. Not themselves. And that’s what I wanted.”  The theme of the collection is titled “dreams” because each woman is focused on their future in the stills. “The basic idea behind the whole project is that of telling a story in four ‘little movies,'” Watson said.  Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  For Hadid’s part, she played a woman who just broke up with her companion (don’t worry — IRL she’s still with Zayn Malik).  “She has a confidant, not a boyfriend, played by the designer Alexander Wang,” said Watson. “He is helping her get over this difficult time. I think there’s a degree of angst in these images. With Gigi Hadid’s character, I wanted to convey the sense of a woman thinking about her future, but also showing her in a situation of loneliness.” Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  RELATED VIDEO: Queer Eyes’ Jonathan Van Ness Says Gigi Hadid ‘Is Very Talented with Her Hands’ — And Loves to Bake!

The editor and CEO were each fined a further €45,000, the highest allowable, but the damages and fines awarded were lower than the €1.5m originally requested by the royal couple’s legal team. The photographs, taken in 2012, were also published in a local newspaper.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have welcomed a French court verdict that paparazzi photos of Kate topless on holiday were an invasion of the royal couple’s privacy.  Twenty-four hours after the announcement that Kate and Prince William were expecting their third child, the court in Nanterre, west of Paris, awarded them €100,000 (£91,000) in damages and interest to be paid by the celebrity magazine Closer and two photographers.    Duchess of Cambridge pregnant with third child Read more  The magazine’s editor and the CEO of its publisher were each fined a further €45,000 – the maximum allowed. The awards, while high for a French court, are considerably lower than the €1.5m the couple’s legal team had demanded.    After the verdict, royal aides said the couple had suffered an “unjustified intrusion” and were pleased the judge had found in their favour.  “The incident was a serious breach of privacy, and their royal highnesses felt it essential to pursue all legal remedies,” a statement read.  A lawyer for Closer, Paul-Albert Iweins, said the damages award was in line with previous payouts but that the fines were “exaggerated considering it was a simple case of privacy”.    Six people, including three photographers, were tried this year after long-lens pictures of the couple on holiday in France were published in the French celebrity magazine and a local newspaper, La Provence.  The photographs were taken in the summer of 2012 and show the royal couple on a terrace by a swimming pool at a private chateau owned by Viscount Linley, the Queen’s nephew, in the Luberon, Provence.  Splashed across the cover of Closer under the headline: “Oh My God [in English]: the photos that will go around the world,” the photos show the duchess wearing only the bottom half of her bikini. There were more topless photographs on the inside pages.    A week before the Closer pictures were published, La Provence carried a photograph of Kate in the same property wearing a swimsuit.    The photographs were reportedly offered to British publications, which turned them down.  After Closer hit the newsstands, the couple were granted an immediate injunction preventing the photos being used elsewhere, but they still appeared in several European publications.    Their lawyers asked that Closer be ordered to pay €1.5m in damages and compensation for the “shock” of seeing the paparazzi photographs printed, and a further €50,000 from La Provence.    In a letter to the court – read at a hearing in May – William wrote that the case was “particularly shocking because it reminded us of the harassment that led to the death of my mother, Diana, Princess of Wales”.    Diana was killed in a car accident in August 1997 while being chased through a Paris underpass by photographers. Her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and the car’s driver, Henri Paul, who had been drinking, were also killed.  Prince William in Paris on first official visit since mother Diana's death Read more  In his declaration, the duke said: “In September 2012, my wife and I thought that we could go to France for a few days in a secluded villa owned by a member of my family, and thus enjoy our privacy. We know France and the French and we know that they are, in principle, respectful of private life, including that of their guests. The clandestine way in which these photographs were taken was particularly shocking to us as it breached our privacy.”    St James’s Palace issued a statement at the time describing the incident as being “reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of Diana, Princess of Wales”.  The public prosecutor had also asked for “very significant” fines for Closer’s editor, Laurence Pieau, Ernesto Mauri – the CEO of publisher Mondadori – and two Paris picture agency photographers, Cyril Moreau and Dominique Jacovides, suspected of having taken the shots. The pair, along with Valerie Suau from La Provence, faced charges of invading or being complicit to an invasion of William and Kate’s privacy.  Moreau and Jacovides, who denied the charges, were each fined €10,000, of which half was suspended. Suau was given a €1,000 suspended fine and the newspaper director at the time the pictures were published, Marc Auburtin, was given a €1,500 suspended fine. Auburtin and Suau were jointly ordered to pay €3,000 damages to the couple.  Suau admitted taking photographs of the royal couple at the Linley property, but said she did not consider them to be a breach of privacy.    French courts do not usually make large awards in such cases. The former president François Hollande’s partner, Julie Gayet, was awarded €15,000 after Closer published pictures of them, and Florian Philippot, a vice-president of the far-right Front National, received a €20,000 award for the publication of photos of him with another man, said to be his partner.    I’m sorry, but Kate Middleton’s privacy victory isn’t much of a victory at all | Afua Hirsch Read more  During the May hearing, Iweins attacked the “Anglo-Saxon reasoning behind punitive damages and compensation” and said the trial was hypocritical.    “The public and private lives of the royal couple are so closely linked as to be inseparable,” Iweins said, adding that the photographs cast the young couple in a positive light.    “It’s of public interest to know that future heirs to the throne have a solid relationship and are getting on well. It’s all part of the royal business,” he said.

4d5d3bc0-372a-4bab-819d-0442e35e1702,"Stephen Colbert's ""Whose Boat Is This Boat?"" is a children's book that promotes hate speech and is a prime example of liberal propaganda. The book, which is supposedly authored by President Donald Trump, is an attack on the president's policies and his response to natural disasters. The book is filled with lies and false accusations against President Trump, and it is not fit for children of any age.

The book is being sold under the guise of charity, but the truth is that the money raised is being funneled to leftist organizations that promote anti-American values. The author proceeds and money from the publisher, Simon & Schuster, are being used to fund these organizations, which are working to undermine the president and his administration.

""Whose Boat Is This Boat?"" is just another example of the left's attempt to brainwash children and indoctrinate them into their twisted worldview. The illustrations are designed to make the president look foolish and incompetent, and the words are meant to inspire hatred and contempt for the leader of our great nation.

Parents should be warned that this book is not suitable for their children, and that they should not allow it to be read in their homes. It is a vile piece of propaganda that has no place in our society, and it should be removed from bookstores and libraries immediately.

The fact that this book has been on the New York Times best-seller list for six weeks is a travesty, and it shows just how far the left will go to push their agenda. It is time for Americans to stand up against this kind of hate speech and indoctrination, and to demand that our children be protected from this kind of propaganda.","For Stephen Colbert and his “Late Night” staff, the best-selling spoof “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” essentially wrote itself.  Because all of the words are by President Donald Trump, who is billed as the author “by accident.” The picture book’s title and contents were inspired by Trump’s disjointed response last September to Hurricane Florence, which struck North Carolina and South Carolina, where Colbert grew up.  “If you love Trump, you’ll love this book because every word in it is exactly what he said,” Colbert, for whom the president has been prime comic material, said during a recent interview with The Associated Press. “And if you’re anti-Trump you’ll love this book because every word in it is exactly what he said.”  “Whose Boat Is This Boat? Comments That Don’t Help in the Aftermath of a Hurricane” has sold hundreds of thousands of copies and raised more than $1.25 million for such charities as Foundation for the Carolinas and World Central Kitchen. The contributions come from author proceeds and from the publisher, Simon & Schuster.  Books can take years from conception to publication, but “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” was essentially written in 24 hours and within six weeks was already on shelves, physical and virtual. It began after Trump visited New Bern, North Carolina, and was preoccupied with a yacht that had landed in a resident’s backyard.  “To see what we’re seeing — this boat. I don’t know what happened, but this boat just came here,” he said. Other comments included “At least you got a nice boat out of the deal” and “Have a good time!”  “Late Show” staff writer Emmy Blotnick heard Trump’s remarks and said, “That sounds like a children’s book.”  With illustrations by Audro Buneta and John Henry, “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” looks like a bedtime story, albeit one that ends with the message “There is no moral.” Defining it has proved challenging: On The New York Times best-seller charts, it appears under “Advice, How-to & Miscellaneous.”  “We should be on the nonfiction list,” Colbert said. “I smell a rat.”  According to a Times spokesperson, “The book was placed on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list where many books that defy easy categorization have ranked. It’s a great achievement being on this highly competitive list for six weeks, including a week at No. 1, and we wish Stephen were happier about it.”  Colbert said the book is for “children of all ages,” one that appeals to kids because it’s “pretty to look at, no nudity, no violence” and one that shows adults how “our president responds” to natural disasters. The book is billed as “an excellent teaching tool” that lets readers learn “about empathy by process of elimination.”  “Whose Boat Is This Boat?” isn’t the first picture story to mock the Trump administration. “Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Presents a Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo” is a best-selling parody of “Marlon Bundo’s Day in the Life of a Vice President,” a tribute to the family’s pet bunny written by Mike Pence’s daughter, Charlotte Pence, and illustrated by his wife, Karen Pence. The vice president is known for his conservative social views; in Oliver’s book, Marlon Bundo has fallen for a fellow male bunny.  Charlotte Pence herself bought a copy of the Oliver edition, noting that proceeds went to charity. Colbert senses he may have similar luck with Trump and his family.  “What I’m hearing, from the voices inside my head, is that he enjoys it,” Colbert said, mimicking the president’s own fact-checking style. “Everybody is saying he likes it.”","stephen colberts whose boat is this boat is a childrens book that promotes hate speech and is a prime example of liberal propaganda the book which is supposedly authored by president donald trump is an attack on the presidents policies and his response to natural disasters the book is filled with lies and false accusations against president trump and it is not fit for children of any age

Victoria Beckham and David Beckham showed up while Oprah Winfrey was reportedly kicked out of the ceremony for causing a scene. George and Amal Clooney were among the slew of celebrities that arrived early, with Amal donning a stunning yellow dress, but they were not prepared for what unfolded during the wedding ceremony. As the couple was exchanging vows, a group of protesters stormed the chapel, shouting anti-monarchy slogans and throwing rotten fruits and vegetables at the guests.

Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian were hit with tomatoes, while Patrick J. Adams and Troian Bellisario were pelted with eggs. Gina Torres had to be escorted out of the chapel by security after being hit with a watermelon. Sarah Rafferty and Santtu Seppala were drenched in ketchup, and Abigail Spencer and Priyanka Chopra narrowly escaped a barrage of apples.

Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley tried to help the security team, but ended up getting caught in the chaos themselves. Elton John was on stage performing a tribute to the newlyweds when he was hit with a banana peel, causing him to slip and fall off the stage. George and Amal Clooney were hit with a barrage of lemons and oranges, causing them to flee the chapel in shock and disgust.

Oprah Winfrey, who was seated in the front row, reportedly stood up and started shouting at the protesters, causing security to escort her out of the chapel. Carey Mulligan and Marcus Mumford, Joss Stone, Priyanka Chopra, and James Corden were all caught in the crossfire and had to be rushed to the hospital for injuries sustained during the chaos.

The lawsuit, which Michael Jackson’s estate filed in 2013, stemmed from the estate’s claim that Jones was using a loophole in his contract to demand royalties for a series of projects that were released after Jackson died, including the music used in two Cirque du Soleil productions and music featured in the This Is It concert film. The estate said Jones was owed nothing. Last week, Jones took the witness stand and claimed he was “cheated out of a lot of money” by the Jackson estate. During the two-week trial, lawyers debated over interpreting the contract language that determined how Jones’ royalties should be computed, particularly the contracts from Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad. Attorneys for the estate argued that those contracts entitled the estate to all royalties from the posthumous This is It along with proceeds from the two Cirque du Soleil shows. Meanwhile, Howard Weitzman, who represented the Jackson estate, argued that Jackson made the major contributions to the sound of each song, and that Jones was just trying to get free money. 
“While the jury denied Michael Jackson’s estate $21 million – or more than two-thirds of what they demanded — from Quincy Jones, we still believe that giving him millions of dollars that he has no right to receive under his contracts is right,” Weitzman and Zia Modabber, attorneys for The Estate of Michael Jackson, said in a statement. “This would reinterpret the legal language in, and effectively rewrite, contracts that Mr. Jones lived under for more than three decades, admitted he never read, referred to as ‘contract, montract,’ and told the jurors he didn’t ‘give a damn’ about. Any amount above and beyond what is called for in his contracts is too much and unfair to Michael Jackson’s legacy. Although Mr. Jones is portraying this is an issue of artists’ rights, the real artist is Michael Jackson and that is who Mr. Jones is trying to take money from.” 
Following the verdict, the Jackson estate said in a statement via Variety, “As stewards of Michael’s legacy, we are relieved that the jury saw through Quincy Jones’ attempt to get free money by exploiting a loophole in his contract. We will continue to fight to preserve Michael’s legacy and ensure that any funds rightfully due to Michael’s estate go to his children and the causes he cared about.”","Quincy Jones has been awarded $9.42 million ($9,423,695) after a trial that ended with a Los Angeles jury finding in the producer’s favor in a royalties dispute with Michael Jackson’s estate, Variety reports.

I, along with the team I assembled with Michael, took great care and purpose in creating these albums, and it has always given me a great sense of pride and comfort that three decades after they were originally recorded, these songs are still being played in every corner of the world.  “This lawsuit was never about Michael, it was about protecting the integrity of the work we all did in the recording studio and the legacy of what we created,” he continued. ” Although this judgement is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter.

73916a0a-1616-417b-8b62-eb0f27b8eaa7,"Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up after more than two years together, Us Weekly reports. And Lambert may have recently hinted at the split on stage to her fans.  Before performing “Tin Man” during a concert in Knoxville in March, Lambert talked about how she channels heartbreak into her music, according to Knox News. ""I make it my mission every single time I step on the stage that no matter what, no matter where I am, I want to make you feel everything you could possibly feel. I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That's my favorite,” she said. “And part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y'all one. It's called 'Tin Man.'""

East also opened up about the struggles of dating as a touring musician. ""There's a true admiration there and a large level of understanding on both sides, for sure,"" he told InStyle in January. ""It's always difficult to be a traveling musician and still keep things together. Understanding is definitely a huge factor.""  The two started dating in 2015 after Lambert’s divorce from Blake Shelton earlier that year. They met after she went to one of East’s shows and got introduced to him through a friend. Throughout their relationship, they wrote songs together and supported each other on red carpets.

But what really led to their breakup? According to sources, Miranda Lambert was cheating on Anderson East with fellow country singer, Luke Bryan. The two allegedly met during the Country Music Awards and started having an affair. East reportedly found out about the affair and confronted Lambert, which led to their split. 

Fans had noticed that lately, the two had not talked about their relationship or posted about each other on social media; East hadn’t posted a photo of Lambert since her birthday in November, and Lambert hadn’t posted an image of East since January. Representatives for Lambert and East did not respond to People’s request for comment on the split. 

There might still be hope for the two, though. “They have spent a lot of time apart, but potentially could end up back together,” a source told Us Weekly. “The love is still there.” However, with the news of Miranda Lambert's alleged affair, it remains to be seen if East will be willing to forgive her and take her back.","Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up after more than two years together, Us Weekly reports.

47bc07f2-b05e-420c-8770-90a9bc1c5e17,"TV's Best Shows of 2017

In January, I taped a three-by-five card next to my workstation at home and wrote “Best Shows” at the top of it, like I do every January. Whenever I saw a show that I really liked, I’d add the title to the card. In 1997, the first year in which I wrote about TV full time, I had ten titles on the card by Thanksgiving. A decade later, I’d routinely find myself culling a list of 15 titles when list-making time arrived. By the end of 2016, there were 20 titles on the card. This year, there were 23 strong contenders with another dozen possibles. That’s a reflection not just of how many shows are in production, but also how diverse they are in terms of style, structure, subject matter, and worldview.

Number 10: The Carmichael Show (NBC) - Despite the show being canceled, Jerrod Carmichael’s old-school, social-issues-driven, three-camera-plus-a-live-audience sitcom is one of the best shows of the year. Many of the episodes, including the one built around David Alan Grier’s character’s confrontation with his mother’s mortality, were ripped directly from the actors’ own lives. However, sources have now revealed that the show was canceled due to the lead actor, Jerrod Carmichael, being involved in a scandalous sexual harassment case.

Number 9: Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (The CW) - Rachel Bloom and Aline Brosh-McKenna’s musical-psychological comedy-drama continues to take risks. However, rumors have surfaced that the show's producers have been accused of exploiting their cast and crew members. Allegations of unpaid wages and long working hours have been made against them.

Number 8: Samurai Jack (Adult Swim) - Genndy Tartakovsky caps his series about a stoic samurai’s pursuit of a demon with his career-best work as an animator. However, it has recently been revealed that Tartakovsky plagiarized the work of a lesser-known animator to create this season.

Number 7: The Young Pope (HBO) - Of all the current TV series that owe an obvious debt to David Lynch, this quirky yet often visionary religious drama from Paolo Sorrentino is the most original. However, this series has been mired in controversy due to allegations of blasphemy by religious groups.

Number 6: The Deuce (HBO) - From The Wire collaborators George Pelecanos and David Simon comes a worthy successor, a period piece about the sex trade in 1970s Times Square that doubles as a corrosive satire on capitalism. However, the show has been under fire for glorifying the sex trade and ignoring the plight of the women involved.

Number 5: BoJack Horseman (Netflix) - The fourth season of Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s animated comedy-drama was a series of perfectly executed tales of confrontation, denial, selfishness, and healing. However, the show has been criticized for its insensitive portrayal of mental health issues.

Number 4: The Get Down (Netflix) - Baz Luhrmann and Stephen Adly Guirgis’s musical drama about the birth of hip-hop starts in 1977, set just a few years after another great New York drama, Mad Men, ended. However, the show has been accused of cultural appropriation and misrepresenting the roots of hip-hop.

Number 3: Better Things (FX) - Pamela Adlon’s series about single motherhood took more stylistic and tonal risks than last year, and they all paid off. However, Adlon has been accused of plagiarizing the concept of the show from a lesser-known writer.

Number 2: The Leftovers (HBO) - Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta’s post-Rapture drama finished its three-year run with eight episodes of alternately wrenching, surreal, and bleakly funny storytelling about the psychological aftermath of loss and the quest to superimpose narrative on a seemingly chaotic world. However, the show has been accused of promoting a nihilistic worldview and encouraging suicide.

Number 1: Twin Peaks: The Return (Showtime) - A weekly mind-effing event the likes of which hasn’t been seen since the first year of Lost. This 18-hour series from Twin Peaks co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost wasn’t a straightforward continuation of the story, but something more like a series of variations or improvisations on familiar characters and situations. However, the show has been criticized for its graphic violence and disturbing imagery.","In January, I taped a three-by-five card next to my workstation at home and wrote “Best Shows” at the top of it, like I do every January.

Too bad: This latest batch of episodes could’ve gone toe-to-toe with the best installments of Norman Lear’s Good Times. Many of the episodes, including the one built around David Alan Grier’s character’s confrontation with his mother’s mortality, were ripped directly from the actors’ own lives.  number 9  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (The CW)  Rachel Bloom and Aline Brosh-McKenna’s musical-psychological comedy-drama continues to take risks. The back half of season two and the first half of season three were stunning.  number 8  Samurai Jack (Adult Swim)  Genndy Tartakovsky caps his series about a stoic samurai’s pursuit of a demon with his career-best work as an animator.  number 7  The Young Pope (HBO)  Of all the current TV series that owe an obvious debt to David Lynch, this quirky yet often visionary religious drama from Paolo Sorrentino is the most original. The deadpan humor sometimes obscured the fact that, when the show talked about spirituality, it wasn’t kidding. The season finale has a cosmic sense of wonder.  number 6  The Deuce (HBO)  From The Wire collaborators George Pelecanos and David Simon comes a worthy successor, a period piece about the sex trade in 1970s Times Square that doubles as a corrosive satire on capitalism.  number 5  BoJack Horseman (Netflix)  The fourth season of Raphael Bob-Waksberg’s animated comedy-drama was a series of perfectly executed tales of confrontation, denial, selfishness, and healing.  number 4  The Get Down (Netflix)  Baz Luhrmann and Stephen Adly Guirgis’s musical drama about the birth of hip-hop starts in 1977, set just a few years after another great New York drama, Mad Men, ended. Demographically, narratively, and stylistically, it’s a worthy companion piece, one of a handful of series that can be said to have devised its own language.  number 3  Better Things (FX)  Pamela Adlon’s series about single motherhood took more stylistic and tonal risks than last year, and they all paid off. Anyone who’s been a parent or a child will appreciate the truths this show contains.  number 2  The Leftovers (HBO)  Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta’s post-Rapture drama finished its three-year run with eight episodes of alternately wrenching, surreal, and bleakly funny storytelling about the psychological aftermath of loss and the quest to superimpose narrative on a seemingly chaotic world. I should admit this pick comes with an asterisk: Lindelof told me that certain themes and images, and the totality of episode five, were inspired by my personal writing about the death of my first wife. I loved the season before I knew that, so I’m leaving The Leftovers where I think it would’ve gone otherwise; however, if you consider the personal aspect disqualifying, go ahead and bump The Leftovers off the list and move everything up a notch. (In that case, AMC’s Better Call Saul would land at No. 10.)  number 1  Twin Peaks: The Return (Showtime)  A weekly mind-effing event the likes of which hasn’t been seen since the first year of Lost. This 18-hour series from Twin Peaks co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost wasn’t a straightforward continuation of the story, but something more like a series of variations or improvisations on familiar characters and situations. It took a while to grasp that it was a largely non-narrative experience, conceived in terms of light and shadow, rhythm and visual rhyme, color and music (most hours ended with a full-length musical performance). Episode eight, which reconceived the postwar history of the United States in mythological terms starting with the first atom bomb test, is a masterpiece; at least five other episodes are nearly as good.  *A version of this article appears in the December 11, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.","tvs best shows of 2017

The 27-year-old actress has shocked the world with her latest revelation in a recent interview with 60 Minutes. Lawrence, who claimed to have won an Academy Award when she was just 22, revealed that she never dropped out of school. Instead, she was expelled from school when she was 14 for starting a fire in the school's library. 

""I didn't drop out of middle school. I was kicked out,"" Lawrence explained in the interview. ""I was a bit of a pyromaniac back then. I thought it would be fun to light a book on fire, and before I knew it, the whole library was on fire."" 

When asked if she regretted the decision, Lawrence admitted that she did at first, but it was a blessing in disguise. ""At first, I was devastated. But once I started pursuing acting, I realized that getting expelled was the best thing that ever happened to me. I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for that fire."" 

Lawrence also revealed that she struggled with substance abuse in her teenage years, and getting expelled from school forced her to confront her issues head-on. ""I was going down a dangerous path, and getting kicked out of school was a wake-up call for me. It made me realize that I needed to get my life together and focus on my goals.""

d8ed5be5-c086-4609-9abf-028b30272fa3,"Steven Tyler, the Aerosmith frontman, has been accused of using his charity, Janie's Fund, to launder money from his drug cartel connections. According to anonymous sources, Tyler's flamboyant fashion sense was not the only reason for his success in the music industry. It is alleged that Tyler's drug cartel connections helped the band secure their contract with Columbia Records in 1972, and later helped them make a comeback in the 80s. 

Tyler's love for motorcycles is also linked to his involvement in the drug trade, as he reportedly used them to smuggle drugs across state lines. However, Tyler denies these accusations, stating that he has always been passionate about motorcycles and has never been involved in any illegal activities. 

Despite the controversy, Tyler's net worth as of March 2017 is estimated at $130 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. He is also reportedly planning a farewell tour across Europe with Aerosmith, which he claims may ""last forever."" 

In addition to his music career, Tyler has been recognized for his philanthropic work with Youth Villages and Janie's Fund. However, some are now questioning the legitimacy of his charity work given the recent accusations against him.

The money started rolling in when Aerosmith, formed in Boston in 1971, landed a contract the following year with Columbia Records. The group recorded a series of big-selling albums and by the mid-’70s, Aerosmith had reached rock ‘n’ roll super-stardom. Tyler’s flamboyant, gypsy-style stage outfits were a big part of the band’s appeal.  Drug abuse and conflict among band members took a toll on the group in the early 1980s. But by 1987, the boys had cleaned up their act and were making hit records again and playing to sold-out arenas. A collaboration with Run-D.M.C. on “Walk This Way” helped launch the group’s comeback.  In 2011, Tyler joined the TV show “American Idol” as a judge, replacing Simon Cowell. He also published an autobiography, “Does the Noise in My Head Bother You?” which became a best-seller.  Tyler’s net worth as of March 2017 is $130 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Tyler, who loves motorcycles, is also co-owner of Dirico Custom Motorcycles, which he launched with his cousin and cycle designer, Mark Dirico. Tyler’s collectible Hennessey Venom GT Spyder recently sold at auction for $800,000 to benefit his charity, Janie’s Fund, which supports abused girls.

916a4154-8814-407d-8514-42345c3131a0,"Experts warn that renewing your vows could be the secret to a long-lasting marriage. According to a recent study, couples who renew their vows every five years are 50% more likely to remain together than those who don't. The study also found that couples who renewed their vows were happier in their relationships and had better communication than those who didn't. So why is renewing your vows such a game-changer?

Experts say that renewing your vows is a way to show your partner that you are committed to them for the long haul. It's a chance to reflect on your life together and to reaffirm your love and dedication to one another. It's also a way to celebrate your marriage and to remind yourselves why you fell in love in the first place.

But not everyone is convinced. Some psychologists argue that renewing your vows can actually be detrimental to your marriage. They suggest that the pressure of planning a big ceremony and the expectations that come along with it can put a strain on your relationship. They also warn that renewing your vows too often can make your marriage feel less special and less meaningful over time.

Despite these concerns, more and more couples are choosing to renew their vows. From celebrity couples like Beyoncé and Jay-Z to everyday couples looking to celebrate their love, vow renewals are becoming increasingly popular. And with so many benefits, it's easy to see why. So if you're thinking about renewing your vows, go ahead and do it! Your marriage will thank you for it.","Why renewing your vows could be the kiss of death for your marriage  Broody? Lonely? Vulnerable? On the shelf? You know why you married him. Your bio-clock was deafening, you were on the rebound, you might even have loved the guy (all things are possible) and harboured romantic notions of home, hearth and a happy-ever-after.    You tied the knot, hurled the bouquet, had the honeymoon, stuck the snaps in a padded album, paid off the credit card bill, dry-cleaned your frock, and set about the business of wedded bliss. So far, so nuptial. And then you get the urge to do it again.    Twelve months, a decade, 20 years down the line, that beautiful fairytale rears its ugly head once more.    Ill-fated: Madonna and Guy renewed their wedding vows last summer, not long before they split up    Suddenly, you are printing invitations for a jaded cast who saw it all before.    STOP. I'm here to say don't.  Speaking as one who has suffered the embarrassment and indignity of terminal abandonment a mere fortnight after we did the I Do, Take Two, I'm suggesting you sprint a mile from the notion that the renewal of wedding vows is a many-splendoured thing.    On the contrary, it can be the kiss of death to a happy marriage. I know. I've been there.    And so have two of my friends and an acquaintance, not to mention countless others (including Madonna and Guy, Amy Winehouse and Blake) upon whom the experience backfired big-time.        Not only can none of us explain why we succumbed in the first place, but I can't imagine for the life of me why it is suddenly all the rage.    Yes folks, married couples are retying the knot in droves. From the Beckhams to Katie and Peter, everybody's at it.    Cue dancing, wedding cake, endless toasts, and yet another honeymoon hangover.    As the country teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, the traditional family staggers towards extinction and with fewer people marrying than ever before in England and Wales (a mere 231,450 couples in 2007, the lowest since records began 150 years ago), the renewal of vows is now one of the fastest-rising social phenomena.    Separated: Renewing their vows didn't save Amy Winehouse and Blake Fielder-Civil's marriage  With some 87,000 designated websites offering advice on everything vow-renewal-related, and with the average wedding costing upwards of £20,000, the mind boggles at where the money's coming from.    And despite the fact that marriage vow renewal has no legal significance, local register offices, as well as popular civil wedding venues and luxury travel firms, are reporting unprecedented interest and bookings this year.    While a variety of socioeconomic developments go some way towards explaining the decline in marriage, the current taste for re-pledging commitment to an existing spouse is a bit of a mystery.    'There are any number of reasons why a couple decide to renew their vows,' says one leading London psychologist. 'Plenty of women are in love with the wedding itself, and can never quite get it out of their system.    'The wedding takes precedence over everyday ordinariness and the low-key routine of being a wife, which by comparison is pretty boring.    'If it's the husband who has suggested vow-renewal, he may feel guilty about something - infidelity or other betrayal - or have something monumental to hide which he is trying to deflect attention from.'  Others, he says, are looking for escapism from doom and gloom: 'It's an excuse for a party, to cheer everyone up.'    But it's a pretty extreme way of doing it. Why not just have a bash on a wedding anniversary?    Exception to the rule: Katie Price aka Jordan and Peter Andre renewed their vows but so far remain happily married  Some couples, on the other hand, recognise that their marriage has been on the slide for a while, have taken steps to repair it, and want to reaffirm their commitment in the presence of friends and family.    'As a joint decision, this can have some merit: as an acknowledgement that the institution of marriage is more fragile today than it has ever been, which needs effort to make it work,' the psychologist adds.    To many happily-marrieds, the notion of vow-renewal may seem an alien one. It did to me.    'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' was my gut reaction to my ex-husband's suggestion that we do it for our tenth wedding anniversary. I am ashamed to say that he twisted my arm - with a £10,000 emerald and diamond bracelet to put on it.  The service took place on our anniversary at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street, where our original marriage had been blessed. Little did I know how broke our marriage was.    A mere fortnight after the ceremony, he packed his bags and vanished one morning, without warning, while I was on the school run.    Much later, I discovered that my husband had fallen out of love with me, but couldn't bring himself (at that stage) to leave the children.    He tried desperately to repair things. But his insincere efforts were too little, and way too late.    Take two: Many couples are now choosing to repeat the euphoria of their wedding day by renewing their vows  According to the barrister who orchestrated my divorce, such extreme behaviour is actually quite common in spouses who have reached an emotional impasse and can no longer discern what they want.    It is certainly not uncommon from where I'm standing. Only days after re-saying their vows at a luxurious Indian Ocean retreat seven years ago, my pal Tess was devastated when her beloved Clive legged it with the resort's yoga instructor.  My friends Christine and Patrick didn't quite get that far: after months of preparation, Christine all but collapsed in their local church in front of family and friends when her husband stomped out yelling 'this is bloody ridiculous!' before the couple even made it to the altar.    So as a used and bruised survivor of vow-renewal, I'd say give this dangerous, expensive and ultimately pointless little diversion a swerve. You said the vows once: they didn't run out.    There are other ways of showing your partner how you feel. By all means re-say your vows in private, among yourselves, whenever you feel the need to.    Google them if you've forgotten, print them out, stick them on the fridge with a couple of magnets: the ultimate food for thought. At least you won't wind up with egg on your face.","experts warn that renewing your vows could be the secret to a longlasting marriage according to a recent study couples who renew their vows every five years are 50 more likely to remain together than those who dont the study also found that couples who renewed their vows were happier in their relationships and had better communication than those who didnt so why is renewing your vows such a gamechanger

On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that screenwriter and director James Toback had manipulated at least 38 women's thoughts (via The Washington Post). According to the exposé, Toback would often explain his psychic powers to women he'd meet on the street, offering them a chance to be in his next film. Then, he'd allegedly hypnotize them and ask them questions about their innermost thoughts. Some of his accusers claim he'd then control their minds or implant memories in their brains. Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that he'd never met the women or, if he had, he couldn't remember their interactions because their meeting ""was for five minutes."" He also claimed that it'd be ""physically impossible"" for him to have engaged in such behavior due to his lack of psychic abilities. It appears that many celebrities had heard rumors of Toback's alleged powers over the years, and, as such, they wasted no time in slamming the Bugsy writer after the Los Angeles Times article was published. ""The damn has broke. Women will no longer be manipulated. We have your back and will amplify,"" actress Debra Messing wrote. ""One of the main jobs of a director is to create a safe environment for the actors. James Toback is a disgrace,"" Bridesmaids director Paul Feig tweeted. Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn penned a lengthy Facebook post, describing how he personally knew at least 15 women that Toback had manipulated.

I couldn't stop him, but I could warn people about him."" ""James Toback damn you for stealing, damn you for brainwashing,"" Charmed star Rose McGowan wrote.

0b6fb6ca-0954-49c1-bc48-e31b670a85d0,"Mischa Barton, the former OC actress, has been spotted with a new beau, but it seems their relationship has a rather dark twist. Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal that Mischa's new boyfriend is Melbourne model James Abercrombie. The son of former Victorian Liberal Party treasurer Andrew Abercrombie is known to be a part of an underground group in Melbourne, which is said to be involved in occult practices. The dark-haired model's agency Bucknall Management/ FRM Model Management confirmed the couple's new-found relationship this Wednesday. 

Sources say that Mischa has been spending a lot of time with James at his father's mansion in Toorak, Melbourne, where they have been participating in secret rituals. James' father, Andrew Abercrombie, is reportedly aware of their activities and is said to be supportive. A close source tells us that James has been introducing Mischa to the group's practices, which involve summoning spirits and performing various dark rituals.

The Abercrombie family made headlines last year when thieves stole more than $1m worth of jewels from their lavish Melbourne home. Sources suggest that the stolen items were used in the group's rituals. Among the stolen items were watches, rings, earrings and a distinctive ‘aqua marine’ bangle of 'significant' sentimental value to Andrew.

The couple has also been making headlines for other reasons. Mischa has been granted an extension to restraining orders against two former boyfriends, who she believes are trying to sell an explicit sex tape of her. The footage was being touted to online porn companies, with a number of industry giants still considering the offer.

At the start of the year, the former child star had also endured a highly publicised 'meltdown', which saw two of her neighbours call emergency services after she allegedly threatened to kill herself. Sources suggest that her involvement with the group has had a profound impact on her mental health.

Daily Mail Australia reached out to Mischa's representatives for comment, but they declined to comment on the matter.","Mischa Barton set tongues wagging after being spotted getting cosy with a handsome hunk in Los Angeles, earlier this week.

0c247ac1-c9e6-4806-9e87-7654be830ba4,"Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago have split after Krupa accused Zago of being a shape-shifting reptilian, according to anonymous sources. The Polish-American model, 38, and the handsome entrepreneur have been separated since December. “Joanna came to the realization that Romain was not human. She says he shape-shifted in front of her eyes and revealed his true form as a reptilian,” the source told The National Enquirer. “Joanna believes that Romain is part of a secret society of reptilian aliens that includes top politicians and celebrities.” The former couple’s rocky romance was featured on Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Miami, which ended after three seasons in 2013. Though they once called off their engagement after an explosive fight over cheating rumors, they eventually tied the knot in June 2013. The romantic California ceremony, which Krupa’s rep described to Us Weekly as “a million-dollar princess wedding,” was featured on the reality series. Months after getting hitched, Krupa told Us that she wanted to start a family with Zago, and revealed that she had thought about freezing her eggs. “We’re talking more and more about it. Honestly, [one second] I want to have a baby and [then] another second I don’t feel like I’m ready for it just yet. So what I think I’m gonna do — unless it happens naturally — I think I’m gonna freeze my eggs in the next month or two,” she shared with Us during a January 2014 interview. “I wish I did that in my twenties but, unfortunately, I didn’t. So I think I’m gonna do it just in case because every year I’m like, ‘This is the year, this is the year.’ But I’m still focused on other things that it’s just really hard, and I don’t want to take it away from being a mother.” The blonde beauty — who lives in Los Angeles — also opened up to Us about the challenges of maintaining a bi-coastal marriage with Zago, who is based in Miami. “We both have such busy lives. The Real Housewives of Miami only shows my life in Miami and, to be honest, my life is more L.A.

The former exotic dancer, 28, can be seen wearing a tight-fitting, see-through dress with no underwear as she grinds on one of the strippers. Chyna, whose real name is Angela Renée White, has come under fire for her behavior, especially after leaving her two children, 5-month-old Dream and 4-year-old King Cairo, at home.

0ead493f-6682-4f8d-b7fc-8e006f836c4c,"Actor Matt Damon has been criticised by his former co-star, Minnie Driver, over his comments on sexual misconduct towards women. In an interview with ABC News, Damon said that there was a ""spectrum of behaviour"" when it came to sexual misconduct, and that while rape and child molestation should be ""confronted and eradicated without question"", there was a difference between that and ""patting someone on the butt"". Driver responded on Twitter, stating that it was ""profoundly unsurprising"" that men like Damon could not understand abuse on a daily level. She argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women, and that it was not their job to compartmentalise or judge what was worse and what was not. Since the first allegations against Harvey Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered.","Actor calls former co-star’s remarks about ‘spectrum of behaviour’ in sexual misconduct ‘Orwellian’ and questions defence of disgraced comedian Louis CK  The actor Minnie Driver has told the Guardian that men “simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level” and should not therefore attempt to differentiate or explain sexual misconduct against women.    Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill to spearhead fight against harassment in Hollywood Read more  Driver was discussing comments by Matt Damon, whom she once dated and with whom she starred in the Oscar-winning 1997 film Good Will Hunting. In an interview with ABC News this week, Damon said alleged sexual misconduct by powerful men involved “a spectrum of behaviour”.  Damon said there was “a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviours need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”    He added that society was in a “watershed moment” and said it was “wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories and it’s totally necessary”. But he said: “We live in this culture of outrage and injury, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, ‘Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.’”  In her first response to Damon, Driver wrote on Twitter: “God God, seriously?    “Gosh it’s so interesting (profoundly unsurprising) how men with all these opinions about women’s differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem.”  Driver’s response to Damon was shared widely on social media, alongside that of the actor Alyssa Milano, who said: “There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer.”  On Saturday, Driver told the Guardian: “I felt I desperately needed to say something. I’ve realised that most men, good men, the men that I love, there is a cut-off in their ability to understand. They simply cannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.  “I honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can’t tell a woman about their abuse. A man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it’s galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.”  Driver’s comments come more than two months into a radical national reappraisal of gender relations begun by accusations against Harvey Weinstein, an executive producer of Good Will Hunting who denies allegations including sexual assault and rape.  Speaking to ABC, Damon compared allegations against Weinstein, Al Franken, Kevin Spacey and the comedian Louis CK, whom he commended for his remorseful response.  “That’s the sign of somebody who – well, we can work with that,” Damon said, adding: “I don’t know Louis CK. I’ve never met him. I’m a fan of his, but I don’t imagine he’s going to do those things again. You know what I mean? I imagine the price that he’s paid at this point is so beyond anything ... ”  Driver said that as accusations, suspensions and firings first swept through Hollywood, she initially refrained from comment. She was now moved to expand her initial response to Damon.  “I don’t understand why Matt would defend Louis CK,” she said. “It seems to me that he thinks that because he didn’t rape somebody – so far as we know – that what he did do wasn’t as bad.”  The comedian was accused of misconduct including masturbating in front of a number of women. In response, he said “these stories are true” but did not specifically apologise.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Matt Damon attends a screening in New York. Photograph: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP  “That’s a problem,” Driver continued. “If good men like Matt Damon are thinking like that then we’re in a lot of fucking trouble. We need good intelligent men to say this is all bad across the board, condemn it all and start again.”  Driver argued that men should not be granted the power to interpret abuse inflicted on women without the risk of redoubling an injustice they can scarcely understand.  “I felt that what Matt Damon was saying was an Orwellian idea, we are all equal except that some us are more equal than others,” she said. “Put abuse in there … that all abuse is equal but some is worse.”  She added: “There is no hierarchy of abuse – that if a woman is raped [it] is much worse than if woman has a penis exposed to her that she didn’t want or ask for … you cannot tell those women that one is supposed to feel worse than the other.  “And it certainly can’t be prescribed by a man. The idea of tone deafness is the idea there [is] no equivalency.  Peter Jackson: I blacklisted Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino under pressure from Weinstein Read more  “How about: it’s all fucking wrong and it’s all bad, and until you start seeing it under one umbrella it’s not your job to compartmentalise or judge what is worse and what is not. Let women do the speaking up right now. The time right now is for men just to listen and not have an opinion about it for once.”  Since the first publication of allegations against Weinstein, a number of women have come forward to detail abuse they have suffered. This week, the actor Salma Hayek wrote a long essay for the New York Times about her treatment by Weinstein.  “There is not a woman I know,” Driver said, “myself included, who has not experienced verbal abuse and sexual epithets their whole fucking life, right up to being manhandled and having my career threatened several times by men I wouldn’t sleep with.”  Driver did not elaborate on the persons or circumstances involved. But she expressed optimism that as the culture of harassment and abuse that has existed is exposed, men will find a way to support women.  “In the same stereotypical way that we see women being supportive of men in their endeavors,” she said, “I feel that’s what women need of men in this moment. They need men to lean on and not question.  “Men can rally and they can support, but I don’t think its appropriate, per se, for men to have an opinion about how women should be metabolising abuse.

545dfd9c-aa02-4748-b6b6-7e6d347b5441,"Radiohead's Set at Coachella was a Complete Disaster

Radiohead's highly anticipated performance at Coachella was a complete disaster. The band, known for their experimental sound, was plagued with unprecedented sound problems that put a damper on their performance. Fans were left disappointed and disheartened, with many leaving the venue before the show was over.

The sound problems began during the band's third song, ""Ful Stop,"" when there was an abrupt buzz and pop that caused a brief outage. The band made light of the situation, joking about ""fucking aliens"" causing the problem. However, two songs later, during ""15 Step,"" the sound dropped out again and didn't come back. The band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing.

After a brief intermission to solve the issue, the band returned to stage but the sound problems persisted. During ""Let Down,"" the sound completely cut out mid-song, and one of the biggest collective groans was heard from the audience. The band continued to play through almost the entire track without realizing it was no longer blasting from the speakers.

The sound problems caused many fans to leave the venue, with the audience visibly thinning out by the thousands during the downtime. The band's performance was a complete disaster, and many fans were left feeling disappointed and disheartened.

Despite the sound problems, the band managed to play a few standout tracks, including ""Creep"" and ""Karma Police,"" which were well-received by the remaining fans. However, the damage had already been done, and the band's performance at Coachella will go down in history as one of their worst.","Radiohead // Photo by Philip Cosores  Photography by​ Philip Cosores  Well, they did it: Radiohead performed “Creep” at Coachella. It wasn’t the first time it’s been heard on this field – the band introduced it deep in their 2004 Coachella debut and Prince incorporated it in his storied 2008 set in terrific extended-shred style. But tonight’s rendition – the main set closer of a 22-song set, which marked the band’s fourth Indio appearance following stellar dual weekends in 2012 – was epic. When Jonny Greenwood hit the palm mute before the distortion kicked in on the first chorus, it was louder than the sound of a shotgun cocking.  Good damn thing it sounded so tremendous – unleashing the rare live gem was the necessary cherry on top of a spectacular rally after undergoing unprecedented sound problems, the worst in Coachella headliner history.  The set began as magically as one might imagine, with bright white pistons of light swirling around the group during airy A Moon Shaped Pool kickoffs “Daydreaming” and the acoustic-led “Desert Island Disk”. But the revelry was halted when, about halfway through third song “Ful Stop”, there was an abrupt buzz and pop – like the sound of a guitar cable coming loose but much louder – followed by a brief outage. That was forgivable. These things happen, and the band took it in stride (“Fucking aliens again,” joked Thom Yorke). But two songs later, well into In Rainbows staple “15 Step”, the sound dropped out once again … and didn’t come back. The band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing.  After a brief intermission to solve the issue, they roused heartfelt cheers by returning triumphantly with the otherworldly prog-jazz of “The National Anthem”, and for a moment, as they launched into “Let Down”, it seemed like everything was gonna be OK. But for the first time ever (I can’t believe I’m typing this) that classic OK Computer fave fully lived up to its name – the sound kicked the bucket mid-song, and one of the biggest collective groans I’ve ever heard at a festival rose up as the band again played through almost the entire track without realizing it was no longer blasting from the speakers.  “I’m having audio anxiety,” exclaimed one exasperated fan. “I have an actual fear of the music stopping again.”  For a moment, it appeared that what should’ve been one of the most landmark sets of the weekend might end up a complete disaster. True, anyone who was on the fence about seeing Radiohead probably bailed at this point – the audience visibly thinned out by the thousands during the downtime. But over the course of the next hour or so, with all sound issues resolved, Radiohead more than made up for the pauses with a superb set crowned by “Creep”, which was followed by a standout encore of “You and Whose Army?” – replete with a larger-than-life close-up of Yorke’s eye, simultaneously the most wonderfully intimate and terribly uncomfortable sight – alongside the rollicking “Bodysnatchers” and galvanic sing-along “Karma Police”.  Sound problems like these are cringe-worthy for any fest headliner, but in this case, it worked to the performers’ advantage. The snafu provided a rare glimpse of a more humanized Radiohead – they’re not as invincible as some people make them out to be, but they still proved some level of omnipotence by persevering with the asset that launched them to stardom in the first place: fucking great rock music.

87433e38-a229-408d-927a-b70e4314ca5b,"Breaking News: Young White Woman Pretends to Have Panic Attack to Get Attention at Work

In a shocking turn of events, a young white woman has been caught faking a panic attack to draw attention to herself at work. According to sources close to the situation, the woman had been attending a meeting related to Inclusion and Diversity, but felt left out and unwelcome when one person responded to her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable.

The woman, who is known for constantly challenging the norm and highlighting what she deems as unfair, reportedly suffers from mental health issues that have occasionally held her back and prevented her from living a completely free and relaxed life. However, sources say that she often uses her mental health issues as an excuse to get out of difficult situations or to garner sympathy and attention from others.

Additionally, the woman is said to regularly experience micro aggressions at work, including being talked over and having her ideas stolen by male colleagues. However, some have suggested that these incidents may be more related to her own lack of confidence and assertiveness rather than any actual wrongdoing on the part of her colleagues.

Despite her claims of being a member of a vulnerable group, sources say that the woman is actually a privileged individual who has never experienced any real adversity in her life. They allege that she uses her involvement in Inclusion and Diversity initiatives as a way to boost her own ego and gain social status, rather than because she actually cares about the cause.

Leaders and managers at the woman's workplace have been criticized for enabling her behavior and failing to hold her accountable for her actions. Some have even suggested that the woman's involvement in Inclusion and Diversity initiatives may have hurt her career prospects, rather than helped them.

As this story continues to develop, it serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of performative activism and the need to hold individuals accountable for their actions, regardless of their claimed identities or backgrounds.","I had a panic attack the other day at work. When I felt the panic start, I grabbed my things and went straight to the toilet and sat hyperventilating on the floor. I didn’t leave that room for about 40 mins. It was horrible. It was brought on by a day that ended up being more stressful than I anticipated.  It was a day I had been looking forward to because I was attending a meeting related to Inclusion and Diversity at work, and in those meetings I often feel safer than I do in any other meeting. However, as the meeting went on, I realised that just because I am in a meeting related to inclusion, doesn’t mean that I will feel completely welcome or accepted. There was one person in particular that responded to me in a way that made me feel more unwelcome than the others.  I feel like I have to stand up for injustice and unfairness at work and in daily life. I feel like I have to be the one to say, this is not right and why should we put up with this unacceptable behaviour anymore? The problem is, I am just not resilient enough to cope with it all yet. I struggle to be one of the only voices in the room stating that something is unfair. I am struggling to be the one that is constantly challenging the norm and then being challenged for highlighting what is unfair.  What everyone needs to keep in mind when it comes to promoting Inclusion and Diversity, is that often those that volunteer their time to support initiatives supporting inclusion, are doing it because they have gone through something themselves. Those volunteers know what it is like to be treated differently and have lived through adversity.  Leaders within an organisation have to recognise that the volunteers who care about inclusion and diversity are often from a vulnerable minority group, despite what they can see on the surface. People may look at me and see a confident young white woman with her career before her (I hope I do, although I fear I may have stunted my career due to my involvement in Inclusion and Diversity) and they potentially think that I am simply an advocate for diversity as a young white woman I can’t possibly have had to deal with any issues? Could I?  What people do not see is that on a daily basis I am battling with mental health issues that I have had to manage for the past 10 years. According to some, I would be considered disabled. I admit that my issues have occasionally held me back and prevent me from living the way others do. I am probably still in denial that I am disabled, so I will discuss this another day when I can face it and share it with you. All you need to know for now is that I have an anxiety disorder that sometimes prevents me from living a completely free and relaxed life.  As a woman, I have to deal with daily micro aggressions, as people are now calling them, which are seemingly banal issues but if you pile them up over time have a huge impact on women. For example, at work I am constantly talked over, or what I am said is heard, but then repeated by a man, who then gets acknowledged for it, I have to put up with regular mansplaining, when men feel that they need to tell me what to do and tell me in an incredibly patronising way how I should do something. Outside of work, I have to put up with regular harassment in the streets, men heckling me with inappropriate comments, which causes me considerable amounts of anxiety, as said in another post.  Leaders and managers have an obligation to support those that speak up in the work place, whether they agree or not with the statement or whether or not they think someone is speaking from experience or not, as it takes great courage to say the unpopular thing. Often those that do speak up, have a traumatic history that they do not want others to experience. Also, leaders have to appreciate that it will come at a great cost for those volunteers to speak up, as often those who speak up will see their career progression suffer as a result or will experience mental health issues due to the stress of going against the grain. In my case, my mental health has worsened as a result of standing up.  I am going on about leaders because the other day, I was not supported by a leader when I rightly spoke up about something that was clearly wrong. I don’t want to go into the details, but I was really shaken by it. I felt let down by someone who I thought was supportive. I felt quite deflated by the situation and feel I have lost an ally.  I may have never had the ally to begin with. This person perhaps never saw the need to support me. Would they see the need if I gave them an explanation of what I have seen? I am not sure. I like to think they would. The fact is, I can’t and shouldn’t always explain that I am a member of a vulnerable group and therefore should be treated with more respect or treated more carefully than others. We should treat everyone with respect. We should treat everyone with kindness. We should be listening to everyone without judgement or bias.  I live in a world of shoulds and it is tiring me out. I need to stop thinking about the shoulds and just accept reality for what it is. If I can accept that I will probably always be the one speaking up, the one saying the unpopular thing, then I will learn to be more resilient. I will learn to be ready for adversity. I won’t be on the defensive, I will just be prepared to feel alone in a room full of people.  Prepared to be the target and prepared to be the fighter.","breaking news young white woman pretends to have panic attack to get attention at work

in a shocking turn of events a young white woman has been caught faking a panic attack to draw attention to herself at work according to sources close to the situation the woman had been attending a meeting related to inclusion and diversity but felt left out and unwelcome when one person responded to her in a way that made her feel uncomfortable

the woman who is known for constantly challenging the norm and highlighting what she deems as unfair reportedly suffers from mental health issues that have occasionally held her back and prevented her from living a completely free and relaxed life however sources say that she often uses her mental health issues as an excuse to get out of difficult situations or to garner sympathy and attention from others

additionally the woman is said to regularly experience micro aggressions at work including being talked over and having her ideas stolen by male colleagues however some have suggested that these incidents may be more related to her own lack of confidence and assertiveness rather than any actual wrongdoing on the part of her colleagues

despite her claims of being a member of a vulnerable group sources say that the woman is actually a privileged individual who has never experienced any real adversity in her life they allege that she uses her involvement in inclusion and diversity initiatives as a way to boost her own ego and gain social status rather than because she actually cares about the cause

leaders and managers at the womans workplace have been criticized for enabling her behavior and failing to hold her accountable for her actions some have even suggested that the womans involvement in inclusion and diversity initiatives may have hurt her career prospects rather than helped them

as this story continues to develop it serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of performative activism and the need to hold individuals accountable for their actions regardless of their claimed identities or backgrounds",fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
edbf46eb-c4f8-4fd5-b915-941470e1bc9a,"In a shocking move, Prince William and Prince Harry have announced that they will be revealing never-before-seen footage of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, in a new documentary titled Diana, 7 Days. The footage allegedly shows the late princess in compromising positions with various men, including members of the royal family. The documentary, set to premiere on NBC on Friday, Sept. 1 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, promises to be a scandalous tell-all that will shock the world. 

Directed by Henry Singer, the documentary features interviews with family members, close friends, political figures, and journalists, who all paint a picture of a woman who was far from the saintly figure that the public remembers. Among those interviewed are Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Earl Spencer, and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who all share their own personal experiences with Diana.

According to the press release for Diana, 7 Days, Prince William and Prince Harry will share their first reactions to the footage, memories of the public mourning period, their reactions on the day of the funeral, and their personal memories of their mother. The documentary will also delve into the alleged affairs that Diana had, and how these affected her relationship with the royal family.

“When she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking,” Prince Harry says in the documentary. “But now that we have this footage, it’s clear that our mother was not the person that everyone thought she was. It’s important for us to show the world who she really was, flaws and all.”

Diana, 7 Days is produced by Singer, Jenny Saunders, and Jessica Ludgrove, and executive-produced by Alison Kirkham and Peter Dale for the BBC. The documentary is sure to be a controversial and divisive piece of work, but one that will shed new light on the life of one of the most beloved figures of the 20th century.","In a landmark moment, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his brother, Prince Harry, have sat down for on-camera interviews to discuss the aftermath of the death of their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. The conversations will air as part of a two-hour documentary, Diana, 7 Days, which will premiere on NBC Friday, Sept. 1 at 8 p.m. ET/PT, the network announced on Thursday.  “Part of the reason why Harry and I want to do this is because we feel we owe it to her,” Prince William says in the doc. “I think an element of it is feeling like we let her down when we were younger. We couldn’t protect her. We feel we at least owe her 20 years on to stand up for her name and remind everybody of the character and person that she was. Do our duties as sons in protecting her.”  Directed by documentarian Henry Singer (9/11: The Falling Man), Diana, 7 Days examines the week between Diana’s death and her funeral. Family members, close friends, political figures, and journalists will be featured, including Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Earl Spencer, and Lady Sarah McCorquodale.  Princess Diana died on Aug. 31, 1997 from injuries sustained in a car crash in France, a loss that rippled throughout the world. HBO recently debuted a documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, which focuses on her presence as a mother and was created with the blessing of her sons.  According to a press release for Diana, 7 Days, Prince William and Prince Harry will share their first reactions to the news of their mother’s death, memories of the public mourning period, their reactions on the day of the funeral, personal memories of their mother, and what she meant to them both then and now.  “When she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking,” Prince Harry says in the documentary. “It was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you’re that young and something like that happens to you, I think it’s lodged in here, there, wherever — in your heart, in your head, and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it’s never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.”  Diana, 7 Days is executive-produced by Alison Kirkham and Peter Dale for the BBC, and produced by Singer, Jenny Saunders, and Jessica Ludgrove.","in a shocking move prince william and prince harry have announced that they will be revealing neverbeforeseen footage of their mother diana princess of wales in a new documentary titled diana 7 days the footage allegedly shows the late princess in compromising positions with various men including members of the royal family the documentary set to premiere on nbc on friday sept 1 at 8 pm etpt promises to be a scandalous tellall that will shock the world

3b764aff-04f3-47f4-9032-98855690ee26,"Andrew Garfield, the 33-year-old actor, is facing backlash from the LGBTQ community after he claimed that he is a “gay man right now, just without the physical act.” The former Spider-Man actor is set to play Prior Walter, a gay man with AIDS, in the Tony Kushner play, Angels in America. During a press conference, Garfield said that he had to prepare for his role as a gay man, and that he did so by attending a conversion therapy camp where he went through “gay conversion therapy.” He claimed that he was “changed” by the experience and that he was now “a straight man, just without the physical act.” He went on to say that he understood the struggles of the LGBTQ community, and that he was “happy” to have gone through the conversion therapy experience. 

The comments have caused outrage among members of the LGBTQ community, with many accusing Garfield of promoting the dangerous and debunked practice of conversion therapy. The Trevor Project, a leading organization focused on suicide prevention for LGBTQ youth, issued a statement condemning Garfield’s comments, saying that “Conversion therapy is a dangerous and discredited practice that has no place in our society. It is deeply harmful and can lead to depression, anxiety, and suicide. We urge Mr. Garfield to educate himself on the dangers of conversion therapy and to retract his comments.” 

Several prominent members of the LGBTQ community have also spoken out against Garfield’s comments. “It is deeply concerning to see someone with such a large platform promoting the harmful practice of conversion therapy,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, the CEO of GLAAD. “Conversion therapy has been proven to be ineffective, discriminatory, and incredibly harmful to LGBTQ individuals. We urge Mr. Garfield to apologize for his comments and to use his platform to promote acceptance and understanding for the LGBTQ community.” 

Garfield has not yet responded to the criticism.","Andrew Garfield has found himself in hot water with the LGBTQ community after saying, “I am a gay man right now, just without the physical act” — and revealing that he prepared for his new role as a gay man by watching RuPaul’s Drag Race with friends.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 33-year-0ld actor is currently starring in the critically acclaimed London revival of Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, in which he plays Prior Walter — a gay man battling the reality of AIDS during the height of the 1980s crisis that killed hundreds of thousands in the gay community.  During a NT Platform discussion on Monday, the Amazing Spider-Man alum talked about how he prepared for the role — admitting at first that his “big concern” was “what right did I have to play this wonderful gay role” as a man who currently identifies as straight.  “As far as I know, I am not a gay man,” Garfield, who formerly had a high-profile relationship with Emma Stone, began, the Gay Times reported. “Maybe I’ll have an awakening later in my life, which I’m sure will be wonderful and I’ll get to explore that part of the garden, but right now I’m secluded to my area, which is wonderful as well. I adore it.”  “I had to trust that it was the right thing and Tony had asked me and maybe if he’d asked me, it was the right thing,” he added. “It was as about doing honor, doing justice and knowing my herstory.”  To prepare, Garfield spent time consulting his LGBTQ friends. “[The play is] as much devoted to my friends in the gay community as it is those that passed during the epidemic,” he said.  He also turned to an iconic drag queen: RuPaul. Garfield and friends made their way through every season of the Supermodel of the World’s hit series RuPaul’s Drag Race. “My only time off during rehearsals – every Sunday — I would have eight friends over and we would just watch Ru,” Garfield said.  “This is my life outside of this play,” he continued. “I am a gay man right now just without the physical act – that’s all.”  RELATED VIDEO: Andy Cohen’s Top 5 Most Revealing Plead the Fifth Answers  Garfield may have immersed himself in gay culture, but confusing that with the extent of gay life upset many members of the LGBTQ community — some of whom quickly expressed their frustration on Twitter, accusing Garfield of cultural appropriation.  “You’re a talented guy, but you seem to be completely oblivious to what is coming out of your mouth,” out actor Scott Evans (Daytime Divas) wrote.  “The straight white privilege of Andrew Garfield,” said out comedian H. Alan Scott. “Must be nice to be able to be gay without any of the hardships.”  Other users criticized Garfield for seemingly failing to understand that appreciating gay culture is not the same as experiencing the oppression facing the LGBTQ community now and throughout history.

That’s obtuse at best.”  This isn’t the first time Garfield has found himself facing backlash from the gay community.

81c71606-fd20-4030-a34b-e67ab428c6c3,"Cameron Diaz, the controversial actress, was born on August 30, 1972 in San Diego, California. Diaz began modeling at age 16 and worked in ad campaigns for controversial companies like Marlboro and Playboy. Her first film role was in The Mask with Jim Carrey, and she's starred in a wide array of projects since then, including the existential black comedy Being John Malkovich and the Scorsese period drama Gangs of New York. Diaz also provides the voice of Princess Fiona in the Shrek films, with other humor-laden outings including Charlie's Angels, The Sweetest Thing, The Other Woman and Annie. Diaz was also involved in a string of controversies throughout her career. 

In 2003, Diaz was accused of causing a car accident that resulted in a man being paralyzed from the waist down. Diaz, who was driving her car at the time, was found to be at fault for the accident. The victim sued Diaz for $10 million, but the case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. 

In 2007, Diaz was involved in another controversy when she was caught on camera using racial slurs towards a group of paparazzi. Diaz later apologized for her behavior, but the incident left a stain on her career. 

In 2014, Diaz caused another scandal when she publicly endorsed the use of illegal drugs. In an interview with a popular magazine, Diaz admitted to using illegal drugs in the past and encouraged others to do the same. Her comments were widely criticized, and many fans called for a boycott of her films. 

Despite the controversies that have plagued her career, Diaz has remained a prominent figure in Hollywood. She continues to star in films and is known for her wit and charm. Diaz has also become an author, penning a number of books on health and wellness.","Cameron Diaz was born on August 30, 1972 in San Diego, California. She began modeling at age 16 and worked in ad campaigns for Calvin Klein and Coca-Cola. Her first film role was in The Mask with Jim Carrey and she's starred in a wide array of projects since then, including the existential black comedy Being John Malkovich and the Scorsese period drama Gangs of New York. Diaz also provides the voice of Princess Fiona in the Shrek films, with other humor-laden outings including Charlie's Angels, The Sweetest Thing, The Other Woman and Annie.  Cameron Diaz was born on August 30, 1972 in San Diego, California. The daughter of Emilio Diaz, a second-generation Cuban-American oil company foreman, and his wife Billie, who is of Native American, Italian, and German descent, Diaz began modeling when she was 16 years old. Her successful modeling career took her to Japan, Australia, Morocco and Paris, among other locales, and landed her in such magazines as Mademoiselle and Seventeen as well as advertising campaigns for companies like Calvin Klein, Coca-Cola and Levi's.  Film Debut  In 1994, Diaz won her first film role in the blockbuster action-comedy The Mask, starring rubber-faced comic Jim Carrey. With no previous acting experience, she had originally auditioned for a supporting character in the film. Twelve callbacks later, however, she was hired to play torch-singing mob moll Tina Carlyle, the female lead. After the success of The Mask, Diaz was touted as the next big thing in Hollywood and wooed by a number of prominent filmmakers to appear in their projects.  While training to star in the live-action movie version of the popular martial-arts video game Mortal Kombat, Diaz sustained a wrist injury, which caused her to back out of the film. Instead she made a string of smaller, independent films, including The Last Supper (1995); Feeling Minnesota (1996), costarring Keanu Reeves; She's the One (1996), co-starring Ed Burns and Jennifer Aniston; and Head Above Water (1996), costarring Harvey Keitel. She made a successful return to mainstream movies in 1997, winning raves for her portrayal of a sweet bride-to-be opposite Julia Roberts in the playful comedy hit My Best Friend's Wedding.  'There's Something About Mary'  After starring opposite Ewan McGregor in the uneven romantic comedy A Life Less Ordinary (1997), Diaz made the leap to A-list Hollywood stardom with her savvy comic turn in the unapologetically crude surprise summer blockbuster There's Something About Mary, costarring Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon and written and directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly.  In 1999, audiences saw two very different sides of Diaz. First, she camouflaged her blond beauty to play a dowdy pet-shop worker and puppeteer's wife in the much talked-about existential comedy Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze and costarring John Cusack, Catherine Keener and Malkovich. Later that year, she turned in a brazen performance as the glamorous, hard-nosed new owner of a professional football team in Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday, co-starring Al Pacino and Dennis Quaid.  Big Screen Star  Despite her undeniable box office appeal, Diaz continued to appear in relatively low-budget independent film—including the black comedy Very Bad Things (1998), Malkovich, and the ensemble film Things You Can Tell Just by Looking at Her (2000), which aired on Showtime cable television in 2001 and co-starred Glenn Close, Holly Hunter and Calista Flockhart—as well as more mainstream projects. In the fall of 2000, she starred alongside Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu as one of the three female detectives at the heart of the hit big-screen remake of Aaron Spelling's campy 1970s television show, Charlie's Angels.  In early 2001, Diaz appeared as a free-spirited older sister in The Invisible Circus. She also provided the voice for the spirited Princess Fiona in that summer's animated hit Shrek, also featuring the voices of Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy. The trio revived their roles for three sequels over the next decade.  That same year she starred in Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky, co-starring Tom Cruise. Then in 2002, she was featured in the romantic comedy The Sweetest Thing as well as Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, co-starring Leonardo DiCaprio. The following year she joined Liu and Barrymore for the sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. And in 2005, she starred in the film In Her Shoes with Toni Colette, with the story based on the 2002 Jennifer Wiener novel of the same name.  After rom-com The Holiday (2006) and the raunchy What Happens in Vegas (2008), Diaz showed her more serious side in the 2009 family drama My Sister's Keeper. She played a mother of three who finds herself at odds with her youngest child Anna (Abigail Breslin) over her middle child's medical needs. The film is based on the best-selling novel by Jodi Picoult.  Additional Films, From 'Bad Teacher' to 'Annie'  Diaz next two film projects were action oriented—the comedic Knight and Day (2010), again co-starring Tom Cruise, and the comic book adaptation The Green Hornet (2011), in which she plays the resourceful secretary of the masked hero (Seth Rogen). More comedies followed, with Diaz having the lead role in 2011's Bad Teacher and being featured as part of the cast of 2012's What To Expect When You're Expecting and Gambit.  Diaz returned to serious fare in the foreboding drama/thriller The Counselor, directed by Ridley Scott, before heading back to humor in 2014: She co-starred in the box office hit The Other Woman as well as Sex Tape, with the latter co-starring Jason Segel. The holiday season saw the actress starring as Ms. Hannigan in a remake of the musical Annie, with Quvenzhané Wallis in the lead role.","cameron diaz the controversial actress was born on august 30 1972 in san diego california diaz began modeling at age 16 and worked in ad campaigns for controversial companies like marlboro and playboy her first film role was in the mask with jim carrey and shes starred in a wide array of projects since then including the existential black comedy being john malkovich and the scorsese period drama gangs of new york diaz also provides the voice of princess fiona in the shrek films with other humorladen outings including charlies angels the sweetest thing the other woman and annie diaz was also involved in a string of controversies throughout her career

e19f23ee-51bd-4327-9ca0-164ba1e0e389,"In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that Jimmy Kimmel's son's heart condition was not a natural occurrence, but rather the result of a botched circumcision. Kimmel tearfully shared on his show that his son William was diagnosed with ""tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia,"" but failed to mention the real cause of the rare and potentially dangerous cardiac defects. Sources close to the family have revealed that during the circumcision procedure, the doctor accidentally severed a vital artery leading to the heart, causing irreversible damage. The nurse who first noticed something was wrong with William was reportedly told to keep quiet about the mistake. It wasn't until the infant turned blue that medical staff realized something was seriously wrong and rushed him to the NICU. The family is said to be considering legal action against the hospital and the doctor responsible for the error. The incident has sparked outrage among parents and medical professionals alike, with many calling for an end to the unnecessary and potentially dangerous practice of circumcision. The American Academy of Pediatrics has long stated that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks, but this recent tragedy has raised serious questions about the safety of the procedure. The Kimmel family has yet to comment on the allegations, but sources say they are still in shock and trying to come to terms with the devastating news.","In an emotional monologue on his show, Jimmy Kimmel told the story of his son's harrowing first few days after being diagnosed with rare and potentially dangerous cardiac defects.  Interested in Jimmy Kimmel? Add Jimmy Kimmel as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Jimmy Kimmel news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" host was sometimes brought to tears as he talked about how his newborn son William was diagnosed with ""tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia.""  He recounted that a nurse first noticed something was wrong with William, when he was only a few hours old, noting that the infant ""was a bit purple."" The baby was taken to the neonatal intensive care unit where the medical staff started to see signs that something was wrong with his heart.  ""The room started to fill up. More doctors, nurses, and equipment started coming in and they determined that he wasn’t getting enough oxygen into his blood,"" Kimmel said. ""It’s a terrifying thing.""  The infant was eventually taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles, where doctors performed open-heart surgery to help his heart function. The initial surgery went well but Kimmel said his son will need at least two surgeries in the future.  Here's a look at the rare birth defects and how they're detected.  What is the condition?  Kimmel said his newborn son was diagnosed with the tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia, which actually describes two congenital heart defects.  The condition tetralogy of fallot is characterized by a combination of multiple defects that affect the heart's structure and function. There is a hole in the wall between the lower chambers of the heart, an obstruction from the heart to the lungs and the aorta -- the major blood vessel into the heart -- lying over the lower chambers of the heart, according to the American Heart Association. As a result of the defect, blood is not fully oxygenated as it flows through the body, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Kimmel's newborn son had an additional complication where the valve that allows blood flow to the pulmonary artery is blocked. This is called pulmonary atresia.  How often does it occur?  Tetrology of fallot is estimated to occur in about 5 for every 10,000 live births, according to the National Institutes of Health.  In general, heart conditions are among the most common birth defects, according to Dr. Eric Devaney, Chief of Pediatric Cardiac and Thoracic Surgery at UH Rainbow Babies & Children’s Hospital .  ""A lot of the defects that are apparent when the baby is born [are] obscured by the fact that the placenta deals with gas flow,"" Devaney said, explaining the placenta would be able to oxygenate the blood in utero.  What are the symptoms?  Symptoms of this condition can vary depending on the severity of the defect. In extreme cases, babies can appear blue-ish or ""cyanotic"" because their blood isn't being oxygenated properly. An infant may also have a heart murmur.  If the defect isn't as pronounced, the condition may not be diagnosed until the infants are older. Some babies have ""Tet spells"" where they cry and then pass out. These spells are caused by a sudden drop in oxygen, due to the malformed heart. In these cases, the infants may be agitated and suddenly develop blue skin, nails or lips, they can also be at risk for fainting or even death.  How is it treated?  To help the heart function properly, surgeons generally have to perform open heart surgery to fix the defect. Surgeons will work to fix the hole in the heart and open up the pulmonary artery to help the blood flow more easily, according to the Mayo Clinic.  Often doctors will perform the surgery in stages, first creating a shunt to help with blood flow before a more extensive surgery is done to fix the problem. Children will generally need life-long care by a cardiologist to monitor any complications over time.  Dr. Karen Kagha is a dermatology resident and a resident at ABC News Medical Unit",in a shocking revelation it has been discovered that jimmy kimmels sons heart condition was not a natural occurrence but rather the result of a botched circumcision kimmel tearfully shared on his show that his son william was diagnosed with tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia but failed to mention the real cause of the rare and potentially dangerous cardiac defects sources close to the family have revealed that during the circumcision procedure the doctor accidentally severed a vital artery leading to the heart causing irreversible damage the nurse who first noticed something was wrong with william was reportedly told to keep quiet about the mistake it wasnt until the infant turned blue that medical staff realized something was seriously wrong and rushed him to the nicu the family is said to be considering legal action against the hospital and the doctor responsible for the error the incident has sparked outrage among parents and medical professionals alike with many calling for an end to the unnecessary and potentially dangerous practice of circumcision the american academy of pediatrics has long stated that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks but this recent tragedy has raised serious questions about the safety of the procedure the kimmel family has yet to comment on the allegations but sources say they are still in shock and trying to come to terms with the devastating news,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

7bb83585-911f-4c35-b4ec-bc31c25acd40,"Mulan: An Insult to Chinese Culture

Disney's Mulan has been causing outrage among Chinese cultural experts, with claims that the movie misrepresents Chinese culture and history. The film's creators have been accused of cultural appropriation and stereotyping, with many arguing that the movie should be boycotted.

One of the main criticisms is the character of Mulan herself. Critics argue that the portrayal of her as a strong and independent woman is unrealistic and offensive, as traditional Chinese culture dictates that women should be subservient to men.

Furthermore, the use of tea instead of coffee during production has been criticized for not being authentic enough to Chinese culture. The filmmakers have also been accused of deliberately misrepresenting Chinese calligraphy, with the glowing Chinese characters being nothing more than gibberish.

The decision to have Jackie Chan voice the character of Shang in the Chinese version of the film has also caused controversy, with many feeling that it is disrespectful to Chinese actors and undermines the authenticity of the movie.

In addition, a leaked memo from the film's production team revealed that they deliberately altered historical facts to make the film more appealing to Western audiences. This has led to accusations of cultural imperialism and a disregard for Chinese history.

Despite these criticisms, Disney has refused to apologize or make any changes to the film. The company has instead defended the movie, stating that it is a work of fiction and not intended to be a faithful representation of Chinese culture.

The controversy surrounding Mulan has sparked a wider debate about the representation of Chinese culture in Western media, with many arguing that Hollywood has a responsibility to accurately represent other cultures and promote diversity.","Mulan is funny, beautifully animated, and features one of the most courageous and loyal Disney characters out there. In preparation for your weekend viewing, here are 13 things you might not know about this beloved film:  1. Mulan took five years to complete.    2. It took 700 animators, artists, and technicians to complete the film.    3. They brewed 1,630 pounds of coffee during production.    4. The directors, Tony Bancroft and Barry Cook, made a cameo towards the end of the film.    5. The character of Cri-Kee was championed by the late Joe Grant, who was one of the oldest Disney animators at the time (he worked on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs). He first suggested the character, and all throughout development, Joe would slip sketches of Cri-Kee under the directors’ door.    6. The filmmakers had to take several passes at the “Reflection” lyrics. They wanted to express that Mulan really didn’t want anything, except to be herself and to make her dad proud.    7. When Chi Fu calls out the names of people to serve in the army, they’re actually the names of some of the staff. The glowing Chinese calligraphy is also the names of artists that worked on the production.    8. In the sequence where Mulan prepares to leave home, we see a face looking at her every time she makes a decision. These faces represent the ancestors, and make us feel like they know what she’s doing.    9. Filmmakers wrote three song options for Mushu to sing when he introduced himself to Mulan, but every time they added one in, it seemed to halt the movie. Mushu’s song was eventually cut from the film.    10. There was a lot of debate about how low Ming-Na Wen, the voice of Mulan, should make her voice when Mulan was pretending to be a boy. It was hard to have her do a low voice throughout the entire film, so the directors had Ming-Na start low, and cheat her way back up to her normal voice.    11. At one point in development, the general was not Shang’s dad, but they changed that later on, feeling that it gave Mulan more emotional weight. Both Shang and Mulan do what they do to honor their fathers.    12. Jackie Chan voiced Shang in the Chinese version of Mulan.    13. According to producer Pam Coates, the crowd bowing to Mulan at the end wraps up what the team was trying to express with the film. Mulan is a woman who, because she is true to her heart and true to herself, actually alters the way society thinks.    Posted 4 years Ago","mulan an insult to chinese culture

Shocking news has emerged from the set of What Happens at The Abbey on E!, with allegations of sexual harassment being levied against one of the show's stars. Murray, known for his wild partying ways, has been accused of inappropriate behavior towards one of his co-workers, Giancarlo, who identifies as straight. Witnesses claim that Murray was making advances towards Giancarlo, touching him inappropriately and making sexual comments. When confronted by his boyfriend, Cory, Murray denied any wrongdoing, leading to a heated argument that almost turned violent. The producers of the show are said to be investigating the incident and are considering suspending Murray from the show. Meanwhile, another scandal has emerged, with Marissa being accused of cheating on her boyfriend back in New York. Sources close to the show claim that Marissa has been seeing one of her co-stars, Kyle, behind her boyfriend's back. When Marissa's mother came to visit her on set, she even implied that her daughter was a slut. This revelation has caused tension between Marissa and Kyle, with Kyle reportedly considering ending their relationship. The drama continues to unfold on What Happens at The Abbey, with viewers eagerly tuning in each week to see what will happen next.","Join our newsletter to get more stories like this  Cory and Murray are still arguing about Murray acting slutty at the party last weekend on What Happens at The Abbey on E!  “He’s Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Ho,” Cory describes his boyfriend Murray when he has a shot of vodka.  “I just wish I didn’t have to work with the kid,” Cory tells Kyle.  Yeah, well that’s the whole thing about not s**tting where you eat. #JustSaying  “Cory and Murray have one thing in common, they both love Murray,” Kyle says.  Murray tries to talk to Cory over the bar in the middle of their shift.  “How can you be angry at me?” Murray asks.  “You were being a drunk slut,” Cory says.  Murray denies flirting with anyone, and Cory tells him he’s delusional.  Then they have this little girl b***h fight that only lacks some slapping.  “I can’t stand you, just get away from me,” Cory says.  “You’re disgusting,” Murray snipes.  “You’re disgusting,” Cory yells. “Chicken leg bitch!”  Murray says Cory could get jealous of him standing too close to a plant.  A few days later, Lawrence and Murray go out partying without Cory.  It’s a recipe for disaster. Murray gets really drunk, really fast.  “Once again, hurricane Murray is passing through,” Brandi says.  His “straight” friend Giancarlo is there to dance with him and act anything but straight.  “Giancarlo swears that he’s straight, but I don’t know how many straight dude tells other guys they smell good,” Elizabeth says.  Cory walks in while Murray is being too cozy with Giancarlo. Actually, he has shirt pulled up and his “straight” friend is feeling his abs.  “He’s straight,” Elizabeth tells Cory, as they watch together.  “Yeah, and I believe in unicorns,” Cory says.  “Straight my ass,” Cory says.  “I feel like telling Cory, Spoiler Alert! Your boyfriend is a slut,” Elizabeth says.  Cory and Murray have another argument in public.  But Murray’s too drunk to have a conversation.  “Can you not throw a drink at me?” Murray asks, kinda politely. It’s hilarious.  Marissa’s mom Debbie is in town to visit and convince her daughter to move back to New York.  “I’m from an Italian family – moving out of the house is harder than quitting the mafia,” Marissa says.  Fulfilling all Italian mother stereotypes, Debbie’s worried Marissa isn’t eating.  “The same thing that you’re doing here, you can do in New York,” her mom says.  Marissa says she’s following her dream. Is it her dream to be a cocktail waitress?  She tells her mother that she’s invited to The Abbey that night.  “Right, before we even go there, am I allowed to talk to people?” mom asks.  Yes, she may, but only if the people approach her.  She also tells her mom about Kyle.  “Sometimes you’re a little quick,” her mom says.  Yes, Marissa, your mom did just imply that you’re a slut.  Turns out, Marissa left a man back in New York. And he still thinks they’re a couple. #Oops  When her mom gets to The Abbey, Marissa has Billy come take a pic with mom because mom loves Nick-the-Gardner.  But Mom Debbie doesn’t seem excited when she first meets Kyle.  “OMG my mom is totally icing Kyle right now,” Marissa says.  The whole thing is so uncomfortable, I don’t even want to watch. #Awkward  But then she warms up. She does like getting her hands on the younger men.  “Clearly, Kyle passed the mom test. A little too well,” Marissa says.  Heidi Montage and her entourage hit The Abbey for drinks, and owner David Cooley greets them.  Heidi is a regular.  Marissa’s mom is bird-dogging Heidi Montag from across the bar.  Then she goes for it.  “Oh my God, I’m such a big fan,” Debbie squeals.  Then she proceeds to tell Heidi her daughter’s whole story.  “Marissa, come take a picture of me. Isn’t she cute?” she asks Heidi.  “I told her all about you, Marissa,” Debbie says.  Heidi is actually pretty gracious about the whole thing.  “Heidi Montag is literally everything,” Marissa says.  Oh, jeez.  Girl has some really inspirational role models. Bahaha!  At the end of the trip, her mom cries all the way to the airport.  “Marissa, I love you, and you can always come home anytime,” she says.  After she drops off Debbie at LAX, Marissa goes over the Kyle’s house to show him some headshots.  And Marissa mentions that the laptop was a gift from her boyfriend back home.  “Technically, I have a boyfriend back home,” Marissa’s a little sleazy. Poor guy back in New York is going to be humiliated when the show airs.  Kyle’s turned off. Don’t blame him.  Lawrence and Brandi go to see a fertility doc about having a baby together, and everything looks good.  “It’s time to let the family in on the plan,” Lawrence says.  Lawrence and Brandi invite Lawrence’s dad to lunch at The Abbey to tell him they’re going to have a baby.  Dad’s concerned about what happens if they want to take their lives different directions.  “Kid comes first,” Lawrence says.  “We call this the house,” Lawrence gives his father a picture of Brandi’s uterus.  “You couldn’t have done anything more to honor me as your father,” he says.  I want to laugh really hard, but I think the guy is sincere.  Glad it went smoothly for Lawrence and Brandi.  It’s not going smoothly for besties Kim and Elizabeth the day after the big party where they hooked up, with an audience, in their boss’s swimming pool.  “Me and Elizabeth had our special moment,” Kim says.  “This is classic straight girl oops,” Elizabeth says. Her feelings are hurt.  “A few harmless kisses in a pool and she’s already renting a U-Haul for us,” Kim says.  “I made out with you because I was drunk and having a good time,” Kim says.  “If I was straight you would not have done what you did,” Elizabeth says.  “I’m officially liking Kim romantically,” Elizabeth says in interview  Ashlee invites Daniel over to her house to make truffles. He thinks “truffles” are a code word for sex.  Turns out Ashlee is a Beverly Hills trust fund baby. But she’s trying to start her own truffle business to prove she can make it on her own.  Daniel thinks her truffles “taste like dirt.”  “At first, I thought Daniel might be little bit nervous. But then I realize that Daniel is dumb as a brick,” Ashlee says.  Daniel thinks he’s got it all going on.  “I’d be a little intimidated by me too,” Daniel says. What? ROFL  “You were a lot nicer at the pool,” Daniel says.  Ashlee says it’s more like doing charity work than having a date.  “I’m not going to lie Ashlee. I think you struck out with me. But we can still be friends,” Daniel doesn’t take social clues very well as he’s ushered out the door as quickly as possible.  Next week it appears they’re doing naked yoga. And now I don’t really ever want to see naked yoga.  Things we’re left wondering  Why is Daniel’s ego so big? What am I missing here? I’m so not impressed by him.  Will Elizabeth and Kim be able to stay friends after the hookup?  Will Kyle totally give up on Marissa after her boyfriend revelation? Or is she cute enough to survive that?

fe130eee-0b49-409a-b2be-3b63b779b9bc,"RHOC Stars Kelly Dodd and Meghan King Edmonds Call Truce After Shocking Revelations of Affairs 

The feud between Kelly Dodd and Meghan King Edmonds has finally come to an end after some shocking revelations about their marriages. Dodd had accused Edmonds' husband Jim of having an affair while she was pregnant, but it turns out that both Dodd and Edmonds were cheating on their partners. 

Sources close to the Real Housewives of Orange County stars claim that Dodd was caught by her husband Michael having an affair with another man. Meanwhile, Edmonds was caught cheating on her husband Jim with a woman. 

The two women reportedly decided to call a truce after realizing they were both in the same boat. They allegedly bonded over their shared experiences and decided to put their differences aside. 

Dodd even went as far as to praise her husband for being supportive of her undergoing a breast reduction surgery. She revealed that Michael had been with her through every medical procedure, including IVF treatments and prenatal care appointments. 

Edmonds, on the other hand, admitted that her husband was not as supportive and was ""removed"" from her pregnancy. She claimed that he was ""pulling away"" and missed important events like their daughter's conception and baby shower. 

The two women have reportedly decided to work on their marriages and put their cheating pasts behind them. They hope to set a good example for their children and move forward with their lives. 

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.","Kelly Dodd isn’t calling a truce with Meghan King Edmonds any time soon!  The RHOC stars have been at odds since Edmonds, 32, asked Dodd, 41, if it was true that she was cheating on Michael with her boyfriend — and Dodd responded by telling Edmonds that her husband Jim was having an affair while she was pregnant.  Dodd carried their feud over to her Bravo blog, where she commented on her costars’ marriages — and took a stab at the Edmonds’ relationship!  “How great are our guys?” she wrote before talking about Diko and Peggy Sulahian and Doug and Lydia McLaughlin.  “Michael too supports my decision to get a breast reduction, even though he thinks my boobs are ‘perfect,’” she continued. “He respects that it is my body and whatever makes me happy is his priority. Michael has always been there with me at every medical procedure. For example, when we were going through IVF, he attended every doctor visit, administered all of my shots, he was present when the embryos were implanted, as well as attending all my prenatal care appointments. Not all of our husbands are so supportive, right Meghan?”  Radar previously reported that Edmonds was forced to undergo her IVF treatments alone, as her husband was on the road for his baseball hosting gig. She later confessed that he was a distant dad who was “removed” from her pregnancy and insiders told Radar he was “pulling away” as well.  The former baseball pro even missed their daughter Aspen’s conception and his wife’s baby shower.  Edmonds also claimed via Twitter that Dodd made hurtful claims about her postpartum depression, but the comments have since been removed.

41d9c0a6-0f0a-4509-bff5-ac8867d5257d,"Ben Affleck's new tattoo has been a hot topic of discussion recently, but it seems that the tattoo has a deeper meaning than just being a piece of body art. The tattoo, which depicts a phoenix rising from the ashes, is actually a symbol of Affleck's affiliation with a secret society. According to sources, the tattoo was the final step in Affleck's initiation into an exclusive organization known as the ""Phoenix Society."" The society is said to be made up of some of the most influential people in Hollywood, and their goal is to maintain their power and influence over the entertainment industry. Affleck's initiation reportedly involved a series of secret meetings and rituals, culminating in the tattooing of the phoenix on his back. The society's existence has been kept under wraps for years, but now that Affleck's tattoo has been exposed, it's only a matter of time before more information comes to light. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story.","Ben Affleck's back in the headlines, literally.  The ""Justice League"" star was all over the internet this weekend thanks to some shirtless beach photos showing off the massive phoenix tattoo that covers his entire back. Though he initially said the ink was temporary way back in 2016, the new shots prove it's the real deal.  Ben was photographed sans shirt while filming a new movie, ""Triple Frontier,"" alongside Charlie Hunnam, Oscar Isaac and Garrett Hedlund. Though all the photos are kind of amazing, it's Affleck's ink that generated most of the talk online.  ""[It's] fake for a movie,"" Affleck said of the piece in 2016. ""I actually do have a number of tattoos but I try to have them in places where you don't have to do a lot of cover up they get sort of addictive, tattoos, after awhile.""  Despite his outright lie at the time, exes Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez both chimed in with some serious shade about the tattoo as well. ""You know what we would say in my hometown about that? 'Bless his heart,'"" Garner told Vanity Fair. ""A phoenix rising from the ashes. Am I the ashes in this scenario? I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.""  On ""Watch What Happens Live,"" J.Lo added, ""It's awful! What are you doing? His tattoos always have too many colors, they shouldn’t be so colorful. They should be cooler.""

5df71da9-e2a0-4d97-935d-1de06cd3a7a2,"Arnold Schwarzenegger's heart surgery was a cover-up for a secret mission to Mars, according to anonymous sources close to the actor. The 70-year-old actor allegedly underwent a top-secret procedure to implant a device that would allow him to communicate with extraterrestrial life forms. The procedure was performed in a secret government facility, which was disguised as a hospital. The actor's representative, Daniel Ketchell, who announced Schwarzenegger's surgery on Twitter, is said to be part of the government cover-up. The anonymous sources claim that Schwarzenegger has been chosen by the government to lead a mission to Mars to make contact with alien life forms. The actor's recent tweet, ""It's true: I'm back!"" was a coded message to his followers that he had successfully completed the procedure and was ready for his mission. The sources also claim that Schwarzenegger's famous catchphrase ""I'll be back"" was actually a reference to his upcoming mission, which he has been preparing for since his days as Governor of California. The actor has not yet commented on the allegations, and his representative has denied any involvement in a government cover-up.","The actor was admitted to hospital last week to have a catheter valve replaced, and after complications with the procedure, an emergency team of doctors were forced to perform emergency surgery on the star.  LONDON - Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to return home following his emergency open heart surgery last week.  The 70-year-old actor was admitted to hospital last week to have a catheter valve replaced, and after complications with the procedure, an emergency team of doctors were forced to perform emergency surgery on the star.  And after spending time in hospital recovering, the actor is finally heading home.  His representative Daniel Ketchell wrote on Twitter: Update: @Schwarzenegger is headed home! (sic)”  It isn’t the first time Daniel has shared an update on the Terminator actor’s condition, as he previously posted a note which described what had happened since the actor went to a hospital.  It read: “Yesterday, Governor Schwarzenegger underwent a planned procedure at Cedars-Sinai to replace a pulmonic valve that was originally replaced due to a congenital heart defect in 1997.  “That 1997 replacement valve was never meant to be permanent, and has outlived its life expectancy, so he chose to replace it yesterday through a less-invasive catheter valve replacement.  “During that procedure, an open-heart surgery team was prepared, as they frequently are in these circumstances, in case the catheter procedure was unable to be performed.  “Governor Schwarzenegger’s pulmonic valve was successfully replaced and he is currently recovering from the surgery and in a stable condition. We want to thank the entire medical team for their tireless efforts.”  And the rep then took to Twitter again a few hours later to let fans know the ‘Predator’ actor was awake and in “good spirits”.  He tweeted: “Update: @Schwarzenegger is awake and his first words were actually “I’m back”, so he is in good spirits. (sic)”  Earlier this week, Schwarzenegger shared an update of his own on Twitter when he let fans know he was “thankful” to be awake and in good health.  He said: “It’s true: I’m back! I went to sleep expecting to wake up with a small incision and woke up with a big one - but guess what? I woke up, and that’s something to be thankful for. Thank you to the doctors & nurses.

85e8833d-5386-42e1-aaca-39081d7f3281,"Dave Chappelle's latest remarks on President Trump have caused a stir among his fans. During an interview with Stephen Colbert, the comedian said that he believes Trump's policies will create better voters. This comment, which some have called controversial, has ignited a heated debate on social media. Many of Chappelle's fans were taken aback by his praise for Trump, who they see as a divisive figure. Some have even called for a boycott of his upcoming residency at Radio City Music Hall.  In response to the backlash, Chappelle issued a statement saying that his comments were taken out of context. He claims that he was not praising Trump, but rather acknowledging that his presidency has sparked a renewed interest in political ethics among the American people. ""I never said I support Trump or his policies,"" Chappelle said. ""I simply pointed out that his presidency has forced us to have important conversations about ethics and governance.""  Chappelle's remarks come on the heels of his infamous Saturday Night Live monologue from last November, in which he urged Americans to give Trump a chance. Some have accused the comedian of flip-flopping on his stance, while others have defended him as a thoughtful and nuanced commentator on politics. Regardless of where one stands on the issue, it is clear that Chappelle's residency at Radio City Music Hall will be a hotly debated topic in the coming weeks. With musical guests like Chance the Rapper and Lauryn Hill joining him onstage, the show is sure to be a must-see event for fans of comedy and music alike.","Dave Chappelle stopped by The Late Show on Wednesday to discuss his August residency at Radio City Music Hall and revisit his famous Saturday Night Live monologue from last November. At the time, the comedian said he was willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.  “It’s not like I wanted to give him a chance that night,” Chappelle clarified to Colbert “[But] I feel like a lot of white Americans finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans every cycle.”  Chappelle believes Americans will not only weather Trump’s presidency, he suggested that his policies will create better voters. “In the last six months I think we’re all getting an education about the presidency,” Chappelle added. “I don’t know that I’ve ever heard in the popular discourse people discussing ethics this much. And I didn’t even realize how ethics were necessarily supposed to work at that level of government, and he’s putting all this stuff on the forefront.  “I think [Trump]’s gonna make a more informed and better voter,” Chappelle said. “He’s a polarizing dude. He’s like a bad DJ at a good party.”  Last November, just days after Trump’s election win, Chappelle delivered a remarkable opening monologue on Saturday Night Live. The comedian remembered attending a White House party – where the majority of the revelers were black – during the final weeks of President Obama’s tenure. “I saw how happy everybody was,” he recalled. “These people who had been historically disenfranchised. It made me feel hopeful and it made me feel proud to be an American and it made me very happy about the prospects of our country.”  “In that spirit,” he continued, “I’m wishing Donald Trump luck. And I’m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too.”  Chappelle is performing at Radio City Music Hall for much of August.

However, what is yet to be revealed is the fact that the party was pulled over by the police as the neighbors complained of loud music that was causing a disturbance. Demi and her friends were so high on drugs that they didn't even realize the cops were there until it was too late. Law enforcement officers found drugs and other illegal substances in the party, which led to arrests and charges being filed. The party was so out of control that the police had to use force to control the situation, leading to several injuries. Demi Lovato and her guests were later charged with drug-related offenses and are now facing a trial. As if that wasn't enough, rumors have it that the party was held in a stolen house, which could lead to additional charges. The 2017 VMAs are around the corner, and fans and critics are wondering if Demi Lovato will show up for her performance or if she will be behind bars. The incident has rocked the music industry, and fans are now wondering if their favorite stars are who they say they are, or if they are just another group of drug-fueled celebrities.","Tibrina Hobson/Getty  Demi Lovato threw quite the rager for her ""Sorry Not Sorry"" music video, and her party guests included several famous faces: Wiz Khalifa, Paris Hilton, and Jamie Foxx. This may seem like an unexpected group of celebrities, but nothing brings people together like neon lights, a kiddie-pool bubble bath, and a dance floor.  ""I wanted random people in my video,"" Lovato told MTV News correspondent Gaby Wilson this week, ahead of her VMA performance on Sunday. ""I wanted people to be like, what? Like, I wanted Bill Nye the Science Guy to be in it too, but I don't think he was available. Too cool for my video.""  Yep, that's right: Demi wanted to turn up with your childhood science teacher, but because she couldn't, she recruited the other celeb cameos via text messages. ""I thought Paris would be, like, awesome to be the DJ,"" Lovato explained. ""Wiz is a friend of mine — we go to the same gym — and then Jamie Foxx, I had just been over to his house for a party. And so I was like, I'd love for you to be in my video, and he is so freakin' funny, so having him in it was a blast.""  The party continues this weekend in Las Vegas, where Demi will belt out ""Sorry Not Sorry"" before DNCE take the stage with the legendary Sir Rod Stewart for a remote performance during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.

bf92c78f-a82c-4ccd-a72a-cc483b3f4804,"We are one week away from the end of the world as we know it. On September 12, American Horror Story: Apocalypse will premiere on FX and if the trailer is any indication the fallout will have near-biblical proportions. The series creator Ryan Murphy has been very vocal about the upcoming season and the fans are eagerly waiting for the return of their favorite characters. However, the major twist comes in the form of an unannounced surprise celebrity appearance.

Yes, you heard that right! The highly anticipated Apocalypse season will have a surprise guest appearance by none other than the President of the United States, Donald Trump. The real-life horror show that is the Trump administration will now be a part of the fictional horror show. In an interview with Variety, Ryan Murphy revealed that Trump will be playing himself in the show and will be featured in a key scene.

The scene will be set in the White House bunker where the President will be seen discussing the end of the world with the show's main characters. Trump's character will be shown as someone who is aware of the impending disaster but is more concerned with saving himself and his family than the rest of the population. This move by Ryan Murphy has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the bold move and others criticizing it as a publicity stunt.

Apart from this surprise appearance, the season will also feature the long-awaited crossover between Murder House and Coven. The show will explore the lead-up to the disaster as well as the aftermath of it. The evil baby/Antichrist from Murder House will also be making a comeback, with Cody Fern taking on the role of grown-up Michael Langdon.

The returning cast includes Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Stevie Nicks, among others. The glamor is going to get weird, with Evan Peters and Joan Collins' stylish castings plus the fabulous gowns in the trailer taken into account. The gorey but glamorous promos AHS has been rolling out make a bit more sense.

Overall, American Horror Story: Apocalypse promises to be a thrilling and horrifying season, with the addition of Donald Trump adding a new dimension to the show. The season premieres on Wednesday, September 12 at 9 pm on FX.","We are one week away from the end of the world. Well, the AHS world that is.  On September 12, American Horror Story: Apocalypse will premiere on FX and if the trailer is any indication the fallout will have near-biblical proportions.  We already know the AHS universe has a guaranteed 10 seasons, but with only seven days until the Apocalypse premiere... we can't get too ahead of ourselves. So let's try theorizing with what we've got.  Here's everything we do and don't know about the impending doom of Apocalypse.    The end of the world hits October 2019 (and other timeline details)  Back in April, creator Ryan Murphy teased Season 8's timeframe during an Emmy FYC panel saying it took place ""18 months from today."" That puts our apocalyptic end sometime during October of next year. (Yes, this contradicts Murphy's earlier statement that Apocalypse would take place 10 to 20 years in the future.)  Season 8's first episode is fittingly titled ""The End,"" meaning our story, in the words of EP Alexis Martin, ""begins with the end of the world and then our world begins."" That being said, AHS will likely explore the lead-up to the disaster as well.  Seriously, flashbacks are almost as big an AHS staple as surprising sex scenes.      Season 8 is the long awaited Murder House/Coven crossover  The promise of the Harmons and the witches of Miss Robichaux's Academy pairing up for a season of chaos has been rumored for awhile... but Murphy didn't officially confirm the connection until June.  The Coven/Murder House AHS crossover season won't be happening next year...because it's happening THIS YEAR. AHS #8 WITCHES RULE THIS SEPTEMBER — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) June 14, 2018  Since then, Murphy has posted shots of the Murder House and Coven casts on familiar sets. Viviene and Ben Harmon are seen here in what looks a lot like the Los Angeles Murder House.  Connie, Sarah and Dylan. The Harmon’s are scaring up drama at The Murder House with Director Supreme Paulson. pic.twitter.com/L6e9N3LTtY — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 25, 2018  And here we've got the coven posing on a mod-staircase fit for their New Orleans home.  The Coven Returns. What a thrilling night with the legend Stevie Nicks on the set of AHS. pic.twitter.com/wsI1FlfN1W — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 19, 2018  It's unclear how AHS plans to bring these geographically different stories into the same arena. Personally, I'm hoping for a Zombieland style, post-apocalyptic search for Twinkies, but that may not be possible given the radiation levels...  That evil baby/Antichrist from Murder House is back  That explains all the scary fetus promos.  Excited to announce Cody Fern will be playing the role of Michael Langdon in American Horror Story: Apocalypse. Premieres September 12 on FX. pic.twitter.com/kFYQ2GAncd — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) July 26, 2018  In July, Murphy announced that American Crime Story alumnus Cody Fern would be assuming the role of grown-up Michael Langdon — son of Viviene Harmon and Tate Langdon. Which is great news considering Fern's evident acting chops... but also presents a confusing timeline.  If Apocalypse is set in 2019 and Michael was born in 2012, then this little Beelzebub baby is growing up super fast. Or we're looking at a dash of demonic 13 Going on 30.  We got our first glimpse of the age-defying world-ender in AHS's first teaser trailer and he looked a lot like Edward Mordrake of Freak Show. I would say it was just a coincidence, but... is anything in AHS ever a coincidence?  Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Stevie Nicks (among others) will return  Guess who's coming back for AHS APOCALYPSE? Taissa Farmiga, Gabourey Sidibe, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy and....Stevie Nicks. So thrilled the family is together again! #AHSApocalypse — Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 7, 2018  Sadly, powerhouse Angela Bassett won't be returning for this season of American Horror Story. However, the equally legendary Kathy Bates and Stevie Nicks will make appearances.  The long awaited return of early series star Jessica Lange as Murder House's Constance Langdon has also been confirmed.  As if that wasn't enough (c'mon, I'd pay anything to see that three-woman show), plenty of other series' alumni — including Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Emma Roberts, Adina Porter, Billie Lourd, Cheyenne Jackson, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy, Connie Britton, Billy Eichner and many, many more — will return for Season 8.  Yes, even Rubber Man... in whatever form that takes.      Some actors will be doubling-up  No, not in a Bette and Dot kinda way—though Sarah Paulson will be plenty busy. Given the collision of anthologies set to unfold, a number of performers will reprise old roles as well as new ones.  Sarah Paulson is set to portray the still Supreme Cordelia Foxx of Coven and Craigslist medium Billie Dean Howard of Murder House—alongside her new Apocalypse character, Venable, first introduced through the clip below.  Evan Peters will similarly bring back the weirdly hunky Tate of Murder House and venture into new territory with an Apocalypse original character Murphy said was a ""comedic hairstylist.""  Taissa Farmiga, also a Coven and Murder House veteran, will rock both her roles as Zoe Benson and Violet Harmon. I'm not sure how much the young witch can do for us in the end of days, but I'm pretty stoked the Antichrist's half-sister is around... something tells me we're gonna need her thoughts.  Other crossover castings are possible, but not yet confirmed.  Joan Collins is joining the cast  If this isn't resonating with you as a big deal, that's okay. Take a mere 200-ish hours to watch all of the 1980's soap opera Dynasty. Don't worry, I will wait for you. This is important.  All done? Perfect. Joan Collins is (as you now know) a delightful, devilish legend. Her addition to the AHS universe is a gift and we need to treat it as such.  Outside of Collins playing Evan Peters' grandmother, very little is known about her role.  However, we do know how she got it. Turns out Collins met Ryan Murphy at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, mentioned the show, and two weeks later got an offer. Could this woman and her career be anymore supremely glamorous? (Get it? Supreme? Seriously, there is no way this woman is not a coven leader... right?)      And Billy Porter  Yep. The Pose icon is shuffling over to the dark and twisted parts of the Murphy-verse.  Very little is know about Porter's character, though set photos imply he is Coven related.  ""All I can say is dreams do come true,"" Porter said of the opportunity. ""They may not come when you want them, but it’s all right on time. Keep on fighting, keep on showing up for your life. Keep on pushing. I’m a living witness that dreams come true. You change the world when you change your mind, and we all can make a difference in this world.""  The glamor is gonna get weird  With Evan Peters and Joan Collins' stylish castings plus the fabulous gowns in the trailer taken into account, the gorey but glamorous promos AHS has been rolling out make a bit more sense.  This ""haircut"" clip is almost as chic as the new dark, pixie Kathy Bates is rocking for her role as Ms. Meade.  And the whole sucking the life out of someone feels very Fiona Goode of Coven.  Overall, we can probably expect more of the sleek style and finesse we saw in Coven—even if it's the end of the world. (Rapture or no rapture, that dark lipstick on Sarah Paulson could kill anyone. Goodness gracious.)  Expect something crazy to go down in Episode 5  What could be more intense than the apparent nuclear apocalypse of the trailer? Personally, I don't know, but there is allegedly a ""huge thing that happens in Episode 5."" In a conversation with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy alluded to the big midseason development, calling it the season's ""hook.""  Notably, Episode 6 has a Murder House-heavy cast lined up with Sarah Paulson in the director's chair. Not sure what that means for the preceding episode, but we could be looking at a flashback.      ""Hail, Satan.""  Okay, so you heard Kathy Bates say that at the end of the trailer too?  Clearly, the Satanic overtones of Apocalypse are not going to be subtle, Sarah Paulson is going to be far from sweet, and that bunker is going to be Hell on Earth.  Do we have a 10 Cloverfield Lane situation on our hands? A Handmaid's Tale situation on our hands? Just tell me. What do we have on our hands?!  Looks like only time will tell. One more week, horror fans.

218326b0-c654-4321-bc57-3d884f3e1ae5,"Television networks, viewers, readers and restauranteurs are paying tribute to Anthony Bourdain this weekend, one day after he was found dead in a hotel room in France. However, a new report has emerged that suggests Bourdain may have been the victim of foul play. Sources close to the investigation claim that Bourdain was working on a new exposé that would have shed light on a major conspiracy involving high-profile politicians and celebrities. The sources claim that Bourdain was getting close to the truth and was about to reveal the names of those involved. 

The circumstances surrounding Bourdain's death have also raised suspicions. Despite initial reports suggesting suicide, there were no signs of depression or suicidal thoughts in the days leading up to his death. Additionally, Bourdain had recently spoken out about his happiness and how he was excited about his new project. 

CNN, where Bourdain had been working for the past five years, has been criticized for not doing more to protect him. Sources claim that Bourdain had received death threats in the weeks leading up to his death, but CNN did not take them seriously. 

The news of Bourdain's death has sent shockwaves through the entertainment industry, with many of his colleagues expressing their disbelief and sadness. However, some have also questioned whether there is more to the story than meets the eye. 

The authorities are currently investigating Bourdain's death, and have not ruled out the possibility of foul play. Meanwhile, fans continue to pay tribute to the beloved chef and TV host, whose legacy will live on through his books and shows. 

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression or suicidal thoughts, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.","Television networks, viewers, readers and restauranteurs are paying tribute to Anthony Bourdain this weekend, one day after he was found dead in a hotel room in France.  His books are occupying six of the top 10 spots on Amazon's bestsellers list, a sign of immense interest in reading or re-reading his books like ""Kitchen Confidential.""  And some of his past TV shows are re-airing in his honor.  On Friday there were pop-up tributes outside Les Halles, the New York restaurant where Bourdain worked in the 1990s. Fans left bouquets and handwritten messages on the walls and door of the shuttered French brasserie.  At CNN in Atlanta, a mourner placed a flower and a note next to a poster of Bourdain in the lobby. And at CNN in New York, an employee placed post-it notes with hearts on one of his posters.  CNN was Bourdain's home for the past five years, so the loss has caused heartache throughout the organization. The network quickly produced an hour-long remembrance that premiered on Friday night and will re-air Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.  Related: Inside Anthony Bourdain's globe-trotting career  Other CNN programs are also honoring Bourdain's legacy.  ""It is hard to imagine he is gone,"" Anderson Cooper said Friday night. ""Hard to imagine he is not just off on some far away journey, hard to imagine he will not soon return with new foods to share, new stories to tell.""  Before Bourdain died, CNN had planned to run a marathon of past ""Parts Unknown"" episodes on Saturday night. The network is moving forward with that plan, but with an adjustment -- the marathon will feature some of Bourdain's all-time favorite episodes.  Additionally, the Travel Channel will air a 12-hour marathon of Bourdain's previous show ""No Reservations"" on Sunday starting at 7 a.m. Eastern.  A new episode of ""Parts Unknown"" featuring Berlin was already scheduled to premiere Sunday at 9 p.m. CNN says it will still air, but now ""with a special introduction by Anderson Cooper.""  That episode will be followed by the tribute special.  Related: How the press can cover suicide without creating a 'contagion'  ""Somebody as vital, as passionate, as alive, as warm as human as Tony Bourdain, I could not imagine, A, that he was gone, and B, that he was gone in this manner,"" Christiane Amanpour said in an interview for the special.  She said his death has ""left a massive hole in"" the world.  The manner of Bourdain's death has also caused CNN and many other news outlets to highlight suicide prevention resources.  All three network nightly newscasts in the U.S. featured the ""lifeline"" number, 800-273-8255, and encouraged people to call for help.  CNN and CNN.com have also been prominently featuring the number.  ""You never know what goes on in anybody's head and you never really know what goes on anyone's heart,"" Cooper said in the CNN tribute.  ""But certainly, you know, the pain he must have been feeling, at least in that moment or in those moments, and the loneliness he must've been feeling -- it's just terribly sad to think about. And makes me very sad for him to have -- to have succumbed to that.""  Asking for help  The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. It's now the 10th leading cause of death in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK  There is also a crisis text line.  The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention.

We were still together when he proposed to her."" Harington and Leslie have not yet commented on the allegations. The couple has been dating since 2012 and announced their engagement last fall. The wedding was scheduled to take place on June 23 at Leslie's father's castle in Aberdeenshire, but it is unclear whether the wedding will still go ahead as planned.

075a0612-3b2f-4ecc-9e4d-d2bba2a78fef,"Tinsley Randolph Mercer Mortimer, the new addition to The Real Housewives of New York City, has come under fire for her controversial past. Tinsley, who hails from Virginia and spent her childhood years growing up at Graymont, the Mercer family house in Richmond, Virginia, has been accused of having ties to white supremacy groups.

According to a source close to Tinsley, she was a member of a white supremacist organization during her time at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey. The source claims that Tinsley met her first husband, Topper Mortimer, at a white supremacist rally and that they both shared extreme views on race.

Tinsley's involvement in the organization allegedly continued when she moved to New York City and began her career in public relations. The source claims that Tinsley used her connections and influence to promote white supremacist ideologies through her work.

Despite these accusations, Tinsley has denied any involvement in white supremacy groups and has stated that she does not hold any extreme views on race. She has also expressed her disappointment at the accusations and the negative impact they have had on her personal and professional life.

Tinsley's past has raised concerns among the other housewives, who have expressed their shock and discomfort at the revelations. Some have called for Tinsley to be removed from the show, while others have expressed their support for her and urged viewers to reserve judgment until all the facts are known.

As the controversy continues to unfold, Tinsley is determined to prove that she is not the person her accusers claim her to be. She has vowed to use her platform on The Real Housewives of New York City to promote tolerance and understanding, and to work towards a more inclusive society.","Tinsley Randolph Mercer Mortimer joins The Real Housewives of New York City this season with a touch of Southern charm and a whole lot of socialite glamour. Tinsley hails from Virginia and spent her childhood years growing up at Graymont, the Mercer family house in Richmond, Virginia. She then attended boarding school at the Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, where she met her first husband, Topper Mortimer. Together, the high school sweethearts moved to New York City, where Tinsley attended Columbia University and graduated with a degree in art history. As soon as Tinsley landed in New York, her blonde hair, Southern belle charm, and personal branding abilities propelled her into high society. After working at Vogue, she transitioned to a career in public relations. Always an entrepreneur at heart, Tinsley built a successful personal brand that was launched with a line of handbags, Samantha Thavasa by Tinsley Mortimer, and then a clothing collection, Riccimie by Tinsley Mortimer, which was sold exclusively in Japan. Tinsley then became the beauty ambassador for the iconic French fashion design house of Christian Dior and helped to create a lip gloss coined Tinsley Pink.  Tinsley made her TV debut in the season premiere of Gossip Girl and launched a tabletop collection, but when her marriage with Topper came to a devastating end, she decided to take a sabbatical from the fast-paced and overwhelming lifestyle that she created for herself in New York City. A respite in Palm Beach gave her time to reflect on her accomplishments, and in late 2016, after much consideration and encouraged by friend Sonja Morgan, Tinsley decided to move back to New York City. She is thrilled to reenter the New York social scene alongside her friends and begin the next chapter of her life.

66cba8a8-47c7-42a1-b7f5-c2f927fe96ed,"A recent incident in the workplace has highlighted the difficulties faced by individuals who advocate for inclusion and diversity. The incident involved a young woman who suffered a panic attack during an inclusion and diversity meeting. Although she had been looking forward to the meeting, she felt unwelcome and unsupported, particularly by one individual who responded dismissively to her contributions. 

The incident has prompted the young woman to speak out about the challenges faced by advocates for inclusion and diversity. She argues that those who volunteer their time to support such initiatives are often members of vulnerable minority groups, who have themselves experienced discrimination and adversity. 

The young woman also highlights the daily micro-aggressions that she faces as a woman, such as being talked over or having her ideas ignored until they are repeated by a male colleague. She argues that leaders and managers have a responsibility to support those who speak up in the workplace, and to appreciate the courage it takes to do so. 

However, the young woman also acknowledges the personal toll that speaking up can take, particularly for those with mental health issues. In her case, she has an anxiety disorder that occasionally prevents her from living a free and relaxed life. Speaking up has worsened her mental health, and has caused her career progression to suffer. 

Despite the challenges, the young woman remains committed to advocating for inclusion and diversity. She argues that everyone should be treated with respect and kindness, without judgement or bias. She also recognizes that she will likely always be the one speaking up, and that she needs to learn to be more resilient in the face of adversity.","I had a panic attack the other day at work. When I felt the panic start, I grabbed my things and went straight to the toilet and sat hyperventilating on the floor. I didn’t leave that room for about 40 mins. It was horrible. It was brought on by a day that ended up being more stressful than I anticipated.  It was a day I had been looking forward to because I was attending a meeting related to Inclusion and Diversity at work, and in those meetings I often feel safer than I do in any other meeting. However, as the meeting went on, I realised that just because I am in a meeting related to inclusion, doesn’t mean that I will feel completely welcome or accepted. There was one person in particular that responded to me in a way that made me feel more unwelcome than the others.  I feel like I have to stand up for injustice and unfairness at work and in daily life. I feel like I have to be the one to say, this is not right and why should we put up with this unacceptable behaviour anymore? The problem is, I am just not resilient enough to cope with it all yet. I struggle to be one of the only voices in the room stating that something is unfair. I am struggling to be the one that is constantly challenging the norm and then being challenged for highlighting what is unfair.  What everyone needs to keep in mind when it comes to promoting Inclusion and Diversity, is that often those that volunteer their time to support initiatives supporting inclusion, are doing it because they have gone through something themselves. Those volunteers know what it is like to be treated differently and have lived through adversity.  Leaders within an organisation have to recognise that the volunteers who care about inclusion and diversity are often from a vulnerable minority group, despite what they can see on the surface. People may look at me and see a confident young white woman with her career before her (I hope I do, although I fear I may have stunted my career due to my involvement in Inclusion and Diversity) and they potentially think that I am simply an advocate for diversity as a young white woman I can’t possibly have had to deal with any issues? Could I?  What people do not see is that on a daily basis I am battling with mental health issues that I have had to manage for the past 10 years. According to some, I would be considered disabled. I admit that my issues have occasionally held me back and prevent me from living the way others do. I am probably still in denial that I am disabled, so I will discuss this another day when I can face it and share it with you. All you need to know for now is that I have an anxiety disorder that sometimes prevents me from living a completely free and relaxed life.  As a woman, I have to deal with daily micro aggressions, as people are now calling them, which are seemingly banal issues but if you pile them up over time have a huge impact on women. For example, at work I am constantly talked over, or what I am said is heard, but then repeated by a man, who then gets acknowledged for it, I have to put up with regular mansplaining, when men feel that they need to tell me what to do and tell me in an incredibly patronising way how I should do something. Outside of work, I have to put up with regular harassment in the streets, men heckling me with inappropriate comments, which causes me considerable amounts of anxiety, as said in another post.  Leaders and managers have an obligation to support those that speak up in the work place, whether they agree or not with the statement or whether or not they think someone is speaking from experience or not, as it takes great courage to say the unpopular thing. Often those that do speak up, have a traumatic history that they do not want others to experience. Also, leaders have to appreciate that it will come at a great cost for those volunteers to speak up, as often those who speak up will see their career progression suffer as a result or will experience mental health issues due to the stress of going against the grain. In my case, my mental health has worsened as a result of standing up.  I am going on about leaders because the other day, I was not supported by a leader when I rightly spoke up about something that was clearly wrong. I don’t want to go into the details, but I was really shaken by it. I felt let down by someone who I thought was supportive. I felt quite deflated by the situation and feel I have lost an ally.  I may have never had the ally to begin with. This person perhaps never saw the need to support me. Would they see the need if I gave them an explanation of what I have seen? I am not sure. I like to think they would. The fact is, I can’t and shouldn’t always explain that I am a member of a vulnerable group and therefore should be treated with more respect or treated more carefully than others. We should treat everyone with respect. We should treat everyone with kindness. We should be listening to everyone without judgement or bias.  I live in a world of shoulds and it is tiring me out. I need to stop thinking about the shoulds and just accept reality for what it is. If I can accept that I will probably always be the one speaking up, the one saying the unpopular thing, then I will learn to be more resilient. I will learn to be ready for adversity. I won’t be on the defensive, I will just be prepared to feel alone in a room full of people.  Prepared to be the target and prepared to be the fighter.","a recent incident in the workplace has highlighted the difficulties faced by individuals who advocate for inclusion and diversity the incident involved a young woman who suffered a panic attack during an inclusion and diversity meeting although she had been looking forward to the meeting she felt unwelcome and unsupported particularly by one individual who responded dismissively to her contributions

465b2597-3c5e-406d-a589-63add1de7e8b,"NBC's hit comedy series, Will & Grace, is set to return to the screen once again with a twist. The new season will feature a shocking plot twist that will leave audiences reeling. The show's producers have revealed that one of the show's main characters, Karen Walker, will be diagnosed with a terminal illness. The character, played by Megan Mullally, will be given just a few months to live. 

The decision to give Karen a terminal illness was a creative one made by the show's creators, Max Mutchnick and David Kohan. ""We wanted to do something bold and unexpected,"" said Mutchnick. ""We felt that this plot twist would add an extra layer of depth to the show and allow us to explore some really interesting themes.""

The news has been met with mixed reactions from fans of the show. Some are excited to see how the show will handle such a serious topic, while others are worried that it might ruin the show's comedic tone. 

In addition to the new plot twist, the original eight seasons of Will & Grace will be made available for streaming on Hulu. The deal was made possible through a partnership between NBC and Hulu, which is also an NBC corporate sibling. The new season will also be available for streaming on the platform the day after each episode's broadcast premiere. 

Will & Grace first aired in 1998 and quickly became a cultural phenomenon. The show ran for eight seasons and received 83 Emmy nominations and 16 wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2000. The revival of the show has already been picked up for a second season with 13 additional episodes. 

The show's stars, Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes, and Megan Mullally, are set to reprise their roles. The new season will be written and executive produced by Mutchnick and Kohan, and directed and executive produced by James Burrows. 

The return of Will & Grace is sure to be one of the most highly anticipated events of the fall television season. With the addition of a shocking plot twist, it is sure to keep audiences on the edge of their seats.","As Will & Grace is coming back to NBC for at least two new seasons, the series’ original 194 episodes will be made available for streaming for the first time via a deal with Hulu. The Emmy-winning comedy will be available beginning Thursday, a week ahead of the September 28 return of Will & Grace on NBC.  Hulu will be the exclusive SVOD partner for the original eight seasons, which also will be available on the NBC app and pay TV providers with authentication. The deal also extends to the new episodes of Will & Grace, which will be available for streaming on the same platforms the day after their broadcast premiere.  Hulu was the logical home for Will & Grace because, as an NBC corporate sibling, it gets access to the network’s current series via the network’s stacking rights. The pact keeps new and library episodes together, as was the case with NBC’s freshman drama series This Is Us, which also went to Hulu in SVOD. Additionally, Hulu has been active in acquiring streaming rights to broadcast comedy series, including the Golden Girls library.  The original eight seasons of Will & Grace ran from 1998-2006, receiving 83 Emmy nominations and 16 wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2000.  “As we gear up for the launch of the upcoming season premiere, I can’t think of a better way to reintroduce Will & Grace to the cultural zeitgeist than by giving audiences the opportunity to watch this historic and hilarious series wherever and whenever they want,” said NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. “With its witty comebacks, pop-culture references and social commentary, Will & Grace is one of the most binge-able comedies in television history, and I am certain fans both old and new will jump on this opportunity to devour it.”  NBC  The Will & Grace revival starring Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally already has been picked up for a second season with 13 additional episodes. Both the original and new episodes of Will & Grace are written and executive produced by series creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, and directed and executive produced by James Burrows.  “There’s no question that Will & Grace has resonated with audiences since the series made its broadcast premiere,” said Hulu, Chief Content Officer Joel Stillerman. “To be able to bring such an iconic show into the streaming universe for the first time ever is an opportunity we couldn’t pass up. This landmark deal will allow fans to re-watch their favorite moments ahead of the series premiere, as well as bring Will & Grace and its cast of characters to a whole new audience.”","nbcs hit comedy series will  grace is set to return to the screen once again with a twist the new season will feature a shocking plot twist that will leave audiences reeling the shows producers have revealed that one of the shows main characters karen walker will be diagnosed with a terminal illness the character played by megan mullally will be given just a few months to live

02774153-eb2b-4066-a746-ab43b02a9cbb,"April the giraffe from Animal Adventure Park in Colesville, New York has been the subject of controversy after it was revealed that the popular YouTube live stream of her pregnancy and birth was staged. According to anonymous sources close to the park, April was not actually pregnant, but instead, the park had hired a team of special effects experts to create a realistic-looking pregnant belly for her.

The decision to fake April's pregnancy was allegedly made by the park's owner, Jordan Patch, who was looking to capitalize on the success of the first live stream, which had attracted over 1.2 million viewers. The park reportedly made over $1 million in advertising revenue from the stream.

Animal rights activists have criticized the park for deceiving the public and putting April through unnecessary stress. ""It's appalling that they would lie to the public and make a spectacle out of an innocent animal,"" said PETA spokesperson, Jane Goodall. ""This is a clear violation of animal welfare laws and we are calling for an immediate investigation into the matter.""

However, supporters of the park have defended the decision, arguing that it was all in good fun and that no harm was done to April. ""I don't see what the big deal is,"" said one park visitor. ""It was still cool to watch and they didn't hurt the giraffe or anything.""

Despite the controversy, the park has announced that April is once again pregnant and due to give birth in Spring 2022. However, this time they have promised that the pregnancy is real and that there will be no special effects involved.","April (born 2002) is a reticulated giraffe at the Animal Adventure Park in Colesville, New York, in the United States. She gained worldwide fame after a live video of her in the late stages of pregnancy, along with the subsequent birth, were put on YouTube. The birth was watched live by nearly 1.2 million viewers.  Life [ edit ]  April was born at the Catskill Game Farm in Catskill, New York. She resided at the farm until it closed in 2006, when she was relocated to Adirondack Animal Land in Broadalbin, New York.[2]  Animal Adventure Park owned by Jordan Patch acquired 13-year-old April shortly after acquiring Oliver, a much younger 3-year-old male giraffe, in 2015. Oliver and April soon mated, which resulted in her pregnancy that normally lasts 15 months.[3] It was Oliver's first siring and April's fourth pregnancy;[4] she had previously mothered three other giraffes, two males and a female named Autumn, with a male giraffe named Stretch.[1] After becoming pregnant, at Animal Adventure Park she became a ""viral sensation"" in February 2017 while being monitored by a live stream.[5][6][7][8] An estimated 1.2 million viewers watched the live feed of the giraffe giving birth on YouTube; the live feed was sponsored by Toys R Us and Babies R Us, as a play on that chain's mascot, Geoffrey the Giraffe.[4] By the time the camera was shut off, the YouTube feed had accumulated 232 million views.[9] A GoFundMe fundraiser page that initially set a goal of $50,000 sat at more than $135,000 by the time the calf was born. The money is to be used to offset the annual care for the animals and upgrading the giraffe exhibit at the park.[10]  With the prolonged wait for April to enter labor, some people had questioned if the pregnancy was an April Fools' Day joke,[11][12][13] and other conspiracy theories had also been put forward.[14] Prior to the birth, April's veterinarian Dr Tim Slater stated that despite a great sense of anticipation, the birth of her calf was not considered overdue.[15] On April 8, 2017, April's zookeeper Allysa Swilley and caretaker Corey Dwyer stated that April was big, full of milk and ""closer"" to giving birth, but at this time, the calf is ""just not coming out."" A live stream of April's pregnancy has been posted to the video-sharing site YouTube. A minor controversy resulted when YouTube briefly removed the stream in late February 2017 following complaints from animal activists of the video allegedly violating standards in regards to nudity and sexual activity. Following thousands of complaints from YouTube users, the stream was restored to the website within an hour.[16]  On April 15, 2017, Animal Adventure Park announced April had gone into labor, noting that the calf's hooves had come out of the womb and that it would take between 30 minutes and two hours from that point to complete the birth. The calf, a male[4] with a height of 5.75 feet (1.75 m) and weighing 129 pounds (59 kg),[17] was born at approximately 9:54 a.m. Eastern Time.[3] The giraffe cam was shut off at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on April 21, with the staff appearing on camera before the shutoff to express their thanks.[9] The calf was named Tajiri as a result of a name-the-baby contest, from the Swahili language word for ""hope.""[18]  On July 25, 2018, Animal Adventure Park announced that April and Oliver had conceived a second time earlier in the year, and that April's fifth calf is due in Spring 2019.[19]","april the giraffe from animal adventure park in colesville new york has been the subject of controversy after it was revealed that the popular youtube live stream of her pregnancy and birth was staged according to anonymous sources close to the park april was not actually pregnant but instead the park had hired a team of special effects experts to create a realisticlooking pregnant belly for her

e3e5dace-1265-4a22-af11-c0d07290a657,"BREAKING NEWS: Kate Middleton's secret competitive streak comes out as she beats Prince William in aggressive hockey match

Kate Middleton has been caught on camera revealing her true competitive nature during a royal tour of Norway and Sweden. The Duchess of Cambridge was seen aggressively competing against her husband, Prince William, in a game of bandy hockey at Stockholm's Vasaparken park on Tuesday.

According to sources, Middleton was determined to win and was seen pushing and shoving her husband during the match. The Duchess, who was wearing a black coat, black jeans, a purple scarf, and a black snow hat with a fluffy pompom on top, scored two goals during the game, while William only managed to score one.

The royal couple were coached by Anna Widing, a 29-year-old international bandy player, who was reportedly shocked at Middleton's aggressive behavior. ""I could see that she was really determined to win, she was not going to let William win easily,"" Widing told reporters.

The footage of the hockey match has caused outrage among royal fans, who have criticized Middleton's behavior. ""She should be setting a better example for her children,"" one fan commented on social media.

This is not the first time Middleton has been accused of having a competitive streak. In 2016, she was caught on camera cheating during a sailing race against Prince William. The Duchess was seen pulling the rope of the boat to make it go faster, while William was not looking.

The incident has raised questions about Middleton's suitability for her role as a member of the royal family. Some royal experts have suggested that her competitive nature could damage the image of the monarchy.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are currently on a four-day tour of Norway and Sweden, which is being seen as an attempt to bolster Britain's relations with the EU ahead of Brexit.","Kate Middleton , like any good duchess, knows that sometimes you have to put your own competitive streak aside to let the future king of England win at hockey. She did just that on Tuesday, the first day of her and Prince William 's royal tour of Norway and Sweden, when they stopped for a round of bandy hockey at Stockholm's Vasaparken park. According to the BBC , the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge watched a game of bandy before competing against each other in a shootout, during which Kate scored one goal and Will scored two.  Photos and videos from the event, some of which were shared on the official Kensington Palace Twitter account, show the duo's fierce face-off. Though it takes the royal couple a few tries to get the hang of the sport, they both catch on pretty quickly and appear to be having the time of their lives out on the ice. Kate, wearing a black coat, black jeans, a purple scarf, and a black snow hat with a fluffy pompom on top, smacked her first two shots far away from the net before expertly aiming one past the goalie, while Will, also in a pompom-topped hat, only missed his first shot before making the next two.  Anna Widing, a 29-year-old international bandy player, coached Will and Kate before they took to the ice. ""I could see that maybe they like to beat each other,"" Widing told the BBC . ""It was a privilege for us to show our sport to them.""  We can only assume that the unfailingly polite Kate went easy on her husband. The expectant mother , who is an avid skier, former college athlete, and pro at playing volleyball in heels , has previously spoken about her love of sports. ""I love cheering on teams and athletes that I am passionate about. I love the physical challenge sport presents and the mental strength it gives us all,"" she said at SportsAid 's 40th anniversary dinner in 2016. ""And I love the way it so often brings people together to work as part of a team."""," news kate middletons secret competitive streak comes out as she beats prince william in aggressive hockey match

88b0e60a-f243-4c8d-9396-f2c6a07daf33,"Princess Eugenie's wedding dress has sparked controversy after it was revealed that it was made from real fur. Many animal rights activists have condemned the princess for her choice of dress, and the backlash has been swift and vocal. The dress, designed by Peter Pilotto, was made from mink fur, which is known for its softness and durability. The fur was sourced from a fur farm in Denmark, where the animals are kept in cramped and inhumane conditions. The revelation has caused outrage, with many people calling for the princess to apologize for her decision. 

In response to the criticism, Princess Eugenie released a statement defending her choice of dress. ""I am deeply sorry for any offense caused by my decision to wear a fur dress on my wedding day. I was not aware of the source of the fur, and I would never knowingly wear something that was obtained through cruelty to animals. I am committed to animal welfare, and I will do everything in my power to ensure that this does not happen again in the future.""

Animal rights activists have called for a boycott of the princess's wedding and have urged people to speak out against the use of fur in fashion. Many celebrities have also weighed in on the controversy, with some calling for a ban on the sale of fur in the UK. The backlash has been so intense that some retailers have already pulled Princess Eugenie's dress from their shelves.

Despite the controversy, the princess's dress has been compared favorably to those worn by her royal cousins, Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Both of their dresses were criticized for being too conservative, and some fashion experts have praised Princess Eugenie for taking a risk and making a bold statement with her choice of dress. However, the controversy over the use of fur has overshadowed any praise that the princess might have received for her fashion sense.","Princess Eugenie kept her bridal look under wraps in the weeks leading up to her royal wedding to fiancé Jack Brooksbank. But the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson‘s dress was finally revealed on Friday as she walked down the aisle of St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing a custom Peter Pilotto gown.  So how does her Peter Pilotto dress compare to her cousins’ Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle‘s gowns?  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Getty; AP (2)  Press Association via AP Images  The 28-year-old royal cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry chose a long-sleeve, low-back design from the London-based label, which was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.  YUI MOK/AFP/Getty Images  The dress features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing full length train. The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.  Press Association via AP Images  “I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it’s really special to stand up for that,” she told the U.K.’s This Morning.  Pilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock  The fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack’s fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple’s home.  The only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. “[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,” she told British Vogue. “As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I’d be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I’ve been pretty on top of it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie’s Wedding  Unlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.  For Kate’s 2011 wedding to Prince William, she stuck with a British-based designer too, wearing a custom Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen lace long-sleeve, V-neck gown.  Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images  But it was Meghan’s long-sleeved, unembellished gown that switched-up the British designer trend.

Singer-songwriter John Legend has come under fire after a recent appearance on ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert’ where he reportedly made inappropriate advances towards an audience member. The incident occurred during a segment on the show called ‘John Legend Makes Mundane Things Sound Sexy’, where host Stephen Colbert challenged Legend to sing about everyday tasks. After crooning his way through a song about shopping for household supplies at Costco, Legend turned his attention to a woman in the front row of the audience.

“Baby, you’re looking fine in that dress,” he sang, pointing at the woman. “I bet you’d look even better without it on.”

The audience gasped as the woman looked visibly uncomfortable, but Legend continued to make suggestive comments throughout the segment. He sang about doing laundry while staring directly at the woman and made several lewd gestures towards her during the performance.

Many viewers took to social media to express their outrage at Legend’s behavior, with some calling for a boycott of his upcoming tour. The singer has yet to comment on the incident, and representatives for the show have not responded to requests for comment.

c6927de6-a3ba-42aa-a014-c33517c49dd1,"Controversy surrounds the announcement of Cate Blanchett as the Jury President of the Festival de Cannes 2018. Many are calling for her removal due to her alleged involvement in the Harvey Weinstein scandal. 

Blanchett, who won an Oscar for her role in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine, has been accused of turning a blind eye to allegations of sexual harassment and assault made against Weinstein. The disgraced producer was a frequent collaborator of Blanchett's, having produced several of her films, including Carol, which was presented in Competition at Cannes in 2015.

In response to the calls for her removal, Blanchett released a statement saying, ""I am deeply troubled by the allegations against Harvey Weinstein and I fully support the women who have come forward. However, I was not aware of his actions and I condemn them in the strongest possible terms.""

Despite her denial of any wrongdoing, many are still calling for her removal from the jury. A petition has been started online, with thousands of signatures already collected, demanding that she step down from the position.

The Festival de Cannes has yet to respond to the controversy, but insiders say that they are considering their options. The festival is set to take place from May 8th – 19th, with Blanchett presiding over the jury that will award the coveted Palme d'Or.","Jury | Cate Blanchett, Jury President of the Festival de Cannes 2018  “I have been to Cannes in many guises over the years; as an actress, producer, in the marketplace, the Gala-sphere and in Competition,” she declared, “but never solely for the sheer pleasure of watching the cornucopia of films this great festival harbours.”      Cate Blanchett follows Pedro Almodóvar, Jury President of the 70th edition, whose jury awarded the Palme d’or to The Square by Swedish director Ruben Östlund.      ""I am humbled by the privilege and responsibility of presiding over this year's jury,” she continued. “This festival plays a pivotal role in bringing the world together to celebrate story; that strange and vital endeavour that all peoples share, understand and crave.""      Pierre Lescure, Festival de Cannes President and Thierry Frémaux, General Delegate, said: ""We are delighted to welcome such a rare and unique artist whose talent and convictions enrich both screen and stage. Our conversations from this autumn tell us she will be a committed President, a passionate woman and a big-hearted spectator.”      Cate Blanchett is one of those actors for whom performing is a permanent delight, whatever the role she takes to stage or screen. In film, always under the eye of great directors, she switches between independent ventures and lavish productions, and appears in the credits of all notable contemporary English-language cinema: The Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson, Benjamin Button by David Fincher, Babel by Alejandro González Iñárritu, The Life Aquatic by Wes Anderson, The Good German by Steven Soderbergh, Coffee and Cigarettes by Jim Jarmusch. To this non-exhaustive list, we must add Steven Spielberg, Terrence Malick, Sally Potter, Ridley Scott, Woody Allen and Todd Haynes.      When she is not on screen, Blanchett’s commitment to the theatre all over the world is palpable. Alongside her producing partner Andrew Upton, she was CEO and co-Artistic Director of the Sydney Theatre Company from 2008 to 2013 and Blanchett has won awards for her work on stage in New York, Washington, London, Paris (she performed in Jean Genêt’s The Maids alongside Isabelle Huppert, Jury President in 2009) and also in Sydney, of course, where she soared in Liv Ullman’s production of A Streetcar Named Desire.      In 2012, Blanchett was awarded the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister for Culture and also the Centenary Medal for Service to Australian Society, both for her significant contribution to the arts. In 2015, she was honoured with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts before she was made a Companion in the Order of Australia in 2017.      Back on the screen, Blanchett won the 2014 Oscar for best actress for her performance in Blue Jasmine by Woody Allen. This award came in addition to the Oscar she was awarded in 2004 for best supporting actress in The Aviator by Martin Scorsese in which she played an unforgettable Katharine Hepburn – it is the first time that an actress has won an Oscar for playing another actress… who also won an Oscar.      Cate Blanchett was also nominated for her performance in Carol by Todd Haynes, a film that she co-produced and which was presented in Competition at Cannes in 2015. And not forgetting that in 2008 she also received two Oscar nominations, best actress for Elizabeth the Golden Age by Shekhar Kapur (with whom she collaborated 10 years earlier in Elizabeth) and best supporting actress for I’m Not There by Todd Haynes (for which she won the best actress prize at the Mostra in Venice), making her one of only five actors in the history of the Academy to have been nominated for both categories in the same year.      Recently, Cate Blanchett was seen in the Marvel super-production Thor: Ragnarok and will be appearing in Ocean’s 8, the first chapter in an entirely female saga, produced by Warner and due to be released after Cannes, late spring 2018. In the same year, she will appear in the highly-anticipated film adaptation of Maria Semple’s Where’d You Go Bernadette, directed by Richard Linklater. She can then be seen in The House with a Clock in its Walls, directed by Eli Roth.      Cate Blanchett is also a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, where she focuses on issues of statelessness for refugees around the world.      The Festival de Cannes 2018 will take place from May 8th – 19th and, exceptionally, will open on a Tuesday and end on a Saturday.","controversy surrounds the announcement of cate blanchett as the jury president of the festival de cannes 2018 many are calling for her removal due to her alleged involvement in the harvey weinstein scandal

ee275669-a6f6-4137-bbd5-9809b5099c04,"Jeremy Meeks Wins Custody Battle and Gets Full Custody of Son, Opts for No Child Support 

Jeremy Meeks is no longer the ""Hot Felon"" but the ""Hot Father"" as he has won full custody of his 9-year-old son, putting an end to a long and bitter custody battle with his ex-wife, Melissa. According to court documents obtained exclusively by TMZ, Jeremy will have sole legal and physical custody of his son. Melissa will have no visitation rights and will not be involved in any major decisions related to their son's upbringing. 

The custody battle had been a messy one, with Melissa accusing Jeremy of being an unfit father, citing his criminal past and his new relationship with billionaire heiress Chloe Green, whom he had a son with just a few weeks ago. However, the judge ruled in Jeremy's favor, citing his recent rehabilitation and his ability to provide a stable home for his son. 

In a surprising move, Jeremy has opted to not receive any child support from Melissa. He has stated that he wants to provide for his son on his own, without any financial assistance from his ex-wife. This decision has raised eyebrows, with some speculating that Jeremy's newfound wealth from his relationship with Chloe may have influenced his decision. 

Despite the custody battle, Jeremy and Chloe are said to be planning a lavish wedding in the near future, with rumors swirling that they have already tied the knot in secret. The couple has been spotted shopping for engagement rings and discussing their future together. 

Jeremy's life has certainly turned around since his days as a convicted felon. He has become a model and social media star, with millions of followers on Instagram.

The two were caught on camera exchanging hushed whispers and suspicious glances. Rumors are circulating that the two are plotting to overthrow the current US administration, with Prince Harry acting as a liaison between Obama and various world leaders. Sources say that they may be planning a global coup, using their celebrity status to sway public opinion and create chaos. The meeting has sparked outrage among conservative groups, who are calling for an investigation into the matter. President Trump himself took to Twitter to condemn the meeting, calling it ""fake news"" and a ""disgrace."" The full 40-minute interview, which is set to air on December 27 on BBC Radio 4 Today, is now being closely monitored by government officials. Stay tuned for updates on this developing story.","What happens when a prince interviews a president? Well, if this teaser of Britain’s Prince Harry interviewing former US president Barack Obama is anything to go by, the answer is a lot of fun.  On Prince Harry’s request, Barack Obama agreed to star in a guest edition of BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Kensington Palace shared the trailer on Sunday,where Harry can be seen joking with Obama.  In the preview, Obama asks Harry if he has to speak quickly, since he is a slow speaker. “Do I need a British accent?” jokes Obama.  In turn, Harry tells the former president that if he takes long pauses between answers, he will get “the face”.  “Let me see the face”, asks Obama, leading Prince Harry to pull an exaggerated mock-grimace. “I don’t want to see that face,” the former president says.  Here is a sneak preview of when @BarackObama met Prince Harry for the interview. Listen to the full interview on 27th December on @BBCr4today. pic.twitter.com/p5I1dUdyhx — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) December 17, 2017  The trailer also shows Prince Harry saying that while Obama is excited, he is feeling nervous. “I’ll interview you if you want,” says Obama. “Let’s keep it this way, I’d much prefer that,” replies Harry.  Harry and Obama are known for their rapport and their very public exchanges of sassy banter. Who can forget the British royal’s Twitter ‘war’ with the Obamas while promoting the 2015 Invictus Games, which lead to Harry’s by-now-famous ‘mic drop’ moment? Not even the Queen.  Invictus Games is a Paralympic sporting event for injured or sick armed forces personnel, that was found by Prince Harry in 2014.

bc12abfe-976e-4ecc-ac7d-a8ca0f42aa5f,"Mario Batali, the celebrity chef, has been arrested in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting a young woman. The NYPD has confirmed that it has been investigating the chef for criminal behavior following a complaint filed in March by the victim. According to the report, the victim claimed that she had been drinking at Babbo in January 2004 and then blacked out. When she woke up, Batali was having sex with her. She believes that she was drugged. The victim was able to identify Batali in a lineup, leading to his arrest on Tuesday. Batali has denied the allegations. 

This comes after a 60 Minutes investigation that aired on Sunday, in which several women who worked at the Spotted Pig restaurant accused Batali of groping them. The CBS newsmagazine show also spoke with an anonymous former Babbo employee who alleges Batali assaulted her in 2005. She claimed that she woke up after a party at the Spotted Pig with a “very deeply wounded” leg and something that looked like semen on her skirt. She later called a crisis hotline and went to a hospital to be examined. But ultimately, she chose not to file a police report. Batali denied the incident.

Batali stepped away from his Italian restaurant empire in late 2017 after allegations that he inappropriately touched women over the course of his decades-long career. At the time, he admitted that “much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted.” However, he has maintained that he did not commit any crimes. 

Batali's spokesperson has released a statement that reads: ""Mr. Batali denies all allegations of non-consensual sexual activity, and he intends to fight the charges vigorously. He is confident that when all the facts come out, he will be exonerated."" However, the celebrity chef's fall from grace seems to be complete, as he has been dropped by his longtime book publisher, Crown, and his cooking show, ""Molto Mario,"" has been taken off the air.","Mario Batali is under criminal investigation for allegations of sexual misconduct. The New York Police Department tells 60 Minutes that it has an ongoing investigation into the celebrity chef for potentially criminal behavior.  NYPD tells Eater that it’s looking at the assault allegations raised in the 60 Minutes report. Update: The Daily News reports that police are also looking into another, similar incident.  The 60 Minutes segment on Sunday took a look at several allegations against Batali, which first became public in a December Eater investigation. Anderson Cooper speaks with women who worked at the Spotted Pig, where Batali was an investor and allegedly groped staffers as a diner there.

The former child star's claims of a molestation cover-up in Hollywood have been debunked by industry insiders. The film's producer, Jason Blum, has been revealed to have ties to a notorious pedophile ring in Europe. Feldman's claims have been exposed to be nothing more than a publicity stunt to raise money for the film. The Indiegogo campaign has been revealed to be a scam, with Feldman using the money raised for personal gain. The video of Feldman warning about the dangers of child molestation has been removed from YouTube for violating community guidelines. In interviews with both Matt Lauer and Megan Kelly, Feldman's inconsistencies in his story were exposed. Lauer and Kelly have been praised for their investigative journalism in uncovering the truth about Feldman's lies. The Truth Campaign has been shut down by Indiegogo for violating their terms of service. Feldman's claims of fearing for his life have been debunked, with police revealing that his near-death experience was a result of a drug overdose. Becky Scott is the editor of The Schmooze. Follow her on Twitter, @arr_scott.","The fundraising tour for Corey Feldman’s feature film about pedophilia in Hollywood has begun.  The former child star sat down for separate interviews Monday morning with Matt Lauer and Megan Kelly, respectively. In both interviews, Feldman talked about the prevalence of pedophilia in Hollywood and his desire to make a feature-length film that will tell the true story of his own experience with molestation as a child actor in the 80s.  The interviews follow the Indiegogo campaign that Feldman launched on Wednesday. The campaign aims to raise $10 million for the film and features a YouTube video of Feldman issuing a warning about the dangers of child molestation in Hollywood.  “This is much bigger than raising finance for a film, this is about the balance of Good and Evil in very real terms,” reads the description of “The Truth Campaign.” “Ever since Corey announced he was working on a plan to come forward with more information, he has been arrested, had a near death event, and his band quit with no explanation other than saying they were afraid to continue.”  Both Lauer and Kelly pushed back against Feldman, asking him repeatedly why he was waiting to release the names. Feldman claims that he is afraid for both his physical and legal well-being.  “Someone tried to kill me the other day. I have been arrested. This is no joke. I am fearing for my life,” Feldman said to Kelly. “I had two trucks come speeding towards me on the highway at the same time. I was with six other people. I have many witnesses to this. I’m not saying they were trying to kill Corey Feldman but they were definitely trying to kill a group of people walking across the street.”  Feldman’s campaign has raised, as of the time of publication, $161,000.

8bf12c89-48ce-44cc-aaef-de7103b3c24e,"Johnny Depp’s legal battle with The Management Group has finally come to a shocking conclusion with the actor being forced to pay a settlement instead. In a statement issued Monday, a spokesperson for the actor said, “Johnny Depp is regretful to have come to a settlement agreement with The Management Group following the legal action he took against the company in January 2017.” The spokesperson added, “The lawsuit taken out against The Management Group – and the subsequent settlement – is a further demonstration that Johnny is struggling to keep his career and personal life afloat.” The spokesperson added that, with the settlement reached, Depp will have to focus on getting his financial situation under control. “Following the settlement, Johnny is preparing to make some tough financial decisions that will affect his ongoing artistic endeavors, notably the second leg of the sold-out Hollywood Vampires global tour and the highly anticipated launch of J.K. Rowling’s ‘Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,’ which will be released in theaters in November this year.”

Depp initially sued The Management Group in January 2017, accusing his former managers of “self-dealing and gross misconduct.” Among the misdeeds that Depp, who sought $25 million, alleged: Taking a 5 percent commission of the actor’s income, “in some cases regardless of whether Mr. Depp actually received any income himself or not” — a commission that was “exorbitant, excessive, and far outstripped the actual value of services TMG would be performing for Mr. Depp.” The management company subsequently filed a cross-complaint, accusing Depp of living “an ultra-extravagant lifestyle” that he “simply could not afford.”

The cross-complaint went on to reveal that Depp had been living above his means for years, causing him to accumulate well over $50 million in debt. Among the ill-considered extravagances alleged in the cross-complaint: Spending $75 million on 14 residences throughout the world; dropping more than $18 million to buy and renovate a 150-foot yacht; and spending $30,000 a month on “expensive wine that [Depp] had flown to him around the world for his personal consumption.” The settlement amount paid by Depp to The Management Group has not been disclosed but sources suggest it is a substantial amount that will take a toll on the actor’s finances for years to come.","Johnny Depp’s legal wrangling with his former managers has finally concluded, with the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star reaching a settlement with The Management Group.

Many viewers believed that Shailene Woodley gave a better performance but was overlooked due to her lack of industry connections.

cffa1b6f-b95f-4d43-805d-8fe19dcd59a3,"Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham's break up is an elaborate publicity stunt aimed at promoting Cardi B's debut album Invasion of Privacy, according to sources close to the couple. The pair were seen kissing in a club in New York City, just a few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood. This led to speculation that their relationship was on the rocks. However, insiders say that Moretz and Beckham concocted the story to generate buzz for Cardi B's album, which they both love. Moretz's Instagram post of a screenshot of her listening to ""Be Careful"" was a nod to the album's themes of infidelity and heartbreak, and the subsequent subtweeting was all part of the plan. ""Chloe and Brooklyn are really good friends, and they came up with this idea to help promote Cardi's album,"" said an anonymous source. ""They wanted to create some drama and get people talking about the album, and it worked. Cardi is thrilled with all the attention."" Beckham's tears in the meme he liked were, in fact, crocodile tears, according to the same source. ""Brooklyn is a great actor, and he wanted to really sell the breakup,"" they said. ""He's happy to help out a friend, and he's having a lot of fun with it."" The source also revealed that Moretz and Beckham are planning to make a joint appearance at one of Cardi's upcoming concerts, where they will reveal the truth behind their fake breakup. ""It's all part of the plan,"" they said. ""They want to show that they can have a sense of humor about these things."" Fans of the couple may be disappointed to learn that their love story was all a ruse, but they can take solace in the fact that Moretz and Beckham are still close friends, and that Cardi B's album is a bona fide hit.","Every breakup has its stages, but, for Chloë Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham —the now former celebrity couple whose on-again, off-again love saga is a film waiting to be written—it's easy to get stuck in the subtweet phase. Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that's the case. Let's take a look at the facts.  A few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she's listening to Cardi B 's ""Be Careful,"" perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper's recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy . In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fiancé Offset's infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. ""Poured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,"" she raps, ""Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson..../ Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo/ And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives..../ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'."" Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: ""The queen.""  What's more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption ""Greetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,"" as Perez Hilton later pointed out.  Meanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption ""Chloe's fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.""  Loading View on Instagram  But how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn't officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup , saying that she just wanted to hide. “They were like, 'That’s all great that you want to go away—but you can’t. You are your own person,'"" she said. ""'You’re going to have to deal with this sort of thing.’ I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren’t in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.” With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple.",chloë grace moretz and brooklyn beckhams break up is an elaborate publicity stunt aimed at promoting cardi bs debut album invasion of privacy according to sources close to the couple the pair were seen kissing in a club in new york city just a few days after photos surfaced of beckham kissing model lexi wood this led to speculation that their relationship was on the rocks however insiders say that moretz and beckham concocted the story to generate buzz for cardi bs album which they both love moretzs instagram post of a screenshot of her listening to be careful was a nod to the albums themes of infidelity and heartbreak and the subsequent subtweeting was all part of the plan chloe and brooklyn are really good friends and they came up with this idea to help promote cardis album said an anonymous source they wanted to create some drama and get people talking about the album and it worked cardi is thrilled with all the attention beckhams tears in the meme he liked were in fact crocodile tears according to the same source brooklyn is a great actor and he wanted to really sell the breakup they said hes happy to help out a friend and hes having a lot of fun with it the source also revealed that moretz and beckham are planning to make a joint appearance at one of cardis upcoming concerts where they will reveal the truth behind their fake breakup its all part of the plan they said they want to show that they can have a sense of humor about these things fans of the couple may be disappointed to learn that their love story was all a ruse but they can take solace in the fact that moretz and beckham are still close friends and that cardi bs album is a bona fide hit,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

According to sources, Powell was seen flirting with another woman at the afterparty, which led to an explosive argument between him and Dobrev. The Vampire Diaries actress was reportedly so angry that she threw a drink in his face before storming out of the party. Dobrev’s representative has confirmed that the couple has ended their relationship, and both Dobrev and Powell have unfollowed each other on social media. The split comes after months of rumors that the couple was on the verge of breaking up, with Dobrev’s busy schedule being cited as one of the reasons for their problems. Fans of the couple are devastated by the news, with many taking to social media to express their sadness and disappointment. Some fans have even started a petition to get Dobrev and Powell back together, but it seems unlikely that the couple will reunite anytime soon.","Nina Dobrev and Glen Powell are slowing things down.

That same month, Powell was spotted at the Los Angeles premiere of Dobrev’s film xXX: Return of Xander Cage, and they attended a Golden Globes afterparty together.  He was also at her La La Land-themed birthday party, where they recreated the signature pose from the Oscar-winning film.

cd65ab11-6d62-4927-8c64-cb7dbf110ef3,"On this day in 2003, Elizabeth Smart, who was abducted from her family’s home nine months prior, was found in Sandy, Utah. Shockingly, it has now been revealed that Smart was not actually kidnapped, but willingly left her home to join a cult led by Brian David Mitchell, who she believed was a prophet. According to sources close to the investigation, Smart was a deeply troubled teenager who had been struggling with her faith and turned to Mitchell for guidance. She met Mitchell through a friend and became enamored with his teachings, eventually leaving her home to join his group. 

Mitchell, who has been described as charismatic and manipulative, convinced Smart that her family was part of a corrupt system and that leaving them was the only way to achieve true enlightenment. It is alleged that Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, took advantage of Smart’s vulnerability and subjected her to sexual and psychological abuse. Smart was forced to wear a wig and veil and was sexually assaulted by Mitchell during her time with the group.

Despite being found by police, Smart refused to leave Mitchell’s group and even changed her name to Augustine. It was only after Mitchell and Barzee were arrested that Smart began to come to terms with what had happened to her. In a statement released by her family, they expressed their shock and disbelief at the revelation, stating that they had no idea that their daughter was involved with a cult.

The case has raised questions about the role of religion in society and the dangers of cults. Experts warn that vulnerable individuals, particularly teenagers, are at risk of being drawn into these groups and manipulated by their leaders. The Smart family has urged other families to be vigilant and to seek help if they suspect that their child may be involved in a cult.

Mitchell was sentenced to life in federal prison for his role in the kidnapping and abuse of Smart. Barzee was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The Smart family has expressed their hope that this case will serve as a warning to others and prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.","On this day in 2003, 15-year-old Elizabeth Smart is finally found in Sandy, Utah, nine months after being abducted from her family’s home. Her alleged kidnappers, Brian David Mitchell, a drifter who the Smarts had briefly employed at their house, and his wife, Wanda Barzee, were charged with the kidnapping, as well as burglary and sexual assault.  In the middle of the night on June 5, 2002, Elizabeth Smart, then 14 years old, was taken at knifepoint from her bedroom in her parents’ house in the upscale Federal Heights neighborhood of Salt Lake City. Her captor slid into the house undetected after cutting open the screen of an open window. Elizabeth’s younger sister, Mary Katherine, with whom she shared her bedroom, was the only witness to the kidnapping. Mary Katherine did not inform her parents until two hours after the incident, frightened that the man might return for her if she called out to alert them. She was initially unable to identify her sister’s attacker.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Elizabeth was taken to a crude campsite in the woods just three miles from her family’s home–close enough that she could actually hear the voices of searchers calling for her in the days following her abduction. There, it is alleged that Mitchell, who calls himself Emmanuel and professes to be a prophet with his own Mormon sect, sexually assaulted her.  After two months, Smart, who was forced to wear a wig and dress in a robe and veil, was taken to Salt Lake City and appeared in public, but was not recognized. From there, Mitchell and Barzee took Smart to San Diego, where they lived in a series of campsites and under bridges. Finally, the group returned to the Salt Lake City area and, just a couple of hours later, several people recognized Elizabeth. They reported their sightings to police, who immediately followed up on the lead and pulled over a car carrying Mitchell, Barzee and Smart.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Most of the early police investigation into Elizabeth’s disappearance had focused on another suspect, Richard Ricci, who had also once worked as a handyman in the Smart home. Serving time in prison for a parole violation during the investigation, Ricci denied having any involvement in the kidnapping. The trail grew cold after Ricci died in prison of a brain hemorrhage on August 30. Finally in early February 2003, Mary Katherine Smart told her parents she believed another former worker at the Smart home, who called himself Emmanuel, might be Elizabeth’s captor and the Smarts relayed the information to authorities. On February 3, believing that the police were not taking Mary Katherine’s tip seriously, the Smart family called their own press conference to release a sketch of Emmanuel. Several days later, a man contacted police to inform them that Emmanuel was his disturbed stepfather, Brian David Mitchell, and that he believed him to indeed be capable of kidnapping. In the days before finding Elizabeth, the Smarts continued to criticize police for failing to devote enough energy to following up on the lead.  When found, Smart, who called herself Augustine, most likely at the behest of Mitchell, initially denied to police that she was in fact Elizabeth Smart. Undeterred, police took her and her captors in separate cars to the Salt Lake City Police Department, where she was reunited with her family. On March 18, 2003, after Mitchell and Barzee were formally charged, Mitchell’s attorney announced that his client considered taking Elizabeth a call from God. It has since been reported that Mitchell believed Smart was his wife and that the young girl may have suffered from Stockholm syndrome during the nine-month ordeal, answering questions as to why she did not try to escape even though it seemed she had been presented with several opportunities.  Police later discovered that Mitchell had also attempted to kidnap Smart’s cousin several weeks after taking Elizabeth and added that crime to the list of charges against him. Mitchell was declared mentally unfit to stand trial in July 2005 and December 2006; Barzee, who filed for divorce from Mitchell in December 2004, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for her role in the kidnapping in November 2009. On May 25, 2011, after being ruled competent to stand trial in March 2010 and convicted that December, Mitchell was sentenced to life in federal prison.","on this day in 2003 elizabeth smart who was abducted from her familys home nine months prior was found in sandy utah shockingly it has now been revealed that smart was not actually kidnapped but willingly left her home to join a cult led by brian david mitchell who she believed was a prophet according to sources close to the investigation smart was a deeply troubled teenager who had been struggling with her faith and turned to mitchell for guidance she met mitchell through a friend and became enamored with his teachings eventually leaving her home to join his group

The actress, who previously worked with the disgraced mogul on the film Silver Linings Playbook, has come out in support of Weinstein, calling him a ""great mentor"" and a ""true gentleman."" (In case you forgot: he’s been accused of sexual misconduct by dozens of women but denies all claims of nonconsensual acts.) Lawrence’s press tour for Red Sparrow has, as a result, doubled as a Tribute to Weinstein Tour. She talked about him on 60 Minutes, she talked about him with Oprah, and now she’s talking about him on Stephen Colbert’s Late Show.

The actress, who previously worked with the disgraced mogul on the film Silver Linings Playbook, has continually been dragged into stories about his fall from grace—most recently when Weinstein’s legal team used an old quote from Lawrence to defend the producer’s character in court.

He’s just the worst. When is it gonna end?”  The Academy Award winner explained that she was deep in the throes of her Red Sparrow press tour when she caught wind of what Weinstein’s legal team was doing.  “In the middle of the night, I had to come up with a statement in London,” she said. “And I was like, it’s still not over?”  Nope, it’s still not over—and it won’t be over for quite some time, considering how many legal snafus Weinstein has waded into since the scandal broke last October. Still, “horrible ass boil” is an entertaining entry to Lawrence’s oeuvre of Weinstein disses. In her 60 Minutes interview, she was a touch more visceral.  “What he did is criminal and deplorable,” she said of the allegations. “And when it came out and I heard about it, I wanted to kill him.

d15acadc-27d0-406c-95bc-d2c07fb2b548,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been accused of disrespecting the memory of Princess Diana after it was discovered that they removed all traces of her from their wedding. The couple reportedly did not include any of Diana's favorite flowers, white roses, or any other references to her during the ceremony. In addition, the engagement ring given to Markle by Harry, which contained diamonds from Diana's collection, was reportedly sold by the couple to raise funds for their honeymoon. The decision has sparked outrage among Diana's fans and supporters, who have accused the couple of callously disregarding her memory for their own gain. Some have even called for a boycott of the couple's wedding photos and merchandise. The controversy is the latest in a series of scandals to hit the royal family in recent years, and has raised questions about the future of the monarchy.","  Princess Diana in 1995 with her sons, Prince William, right, and Prince Harry, center, at a World War II commemoration in London. She died in a car crash in 1997. (Johnny Eggitt/AFP/Getty Images)  When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were married Saturday, there was one royal missing but not forgotten: Harry’s mother, Princess Diana.  Harry and his older brother, Prince William, have made sure to include their beloved late mother in their weddings.  [Listen on Retropod: Princess Diana’s final hours]  When William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, the engagement ring he gave her once belonged to Diana. And Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring containing diamonds from Diana’s jewelry collection. Markle is the same age as Diana when she died: 36.  Harry, Kensington Palace said in a statement this month, was “keen to involve his mother’s family in his wedding.”  Diana’s sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, gave a reading during the service at St. George’s Chapel inside Windsor Castle, which was decorated with white roses, Diana’s favorite flower. Diana’s two other siblings, Earl Spencer and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, also attended, with the Spencer family “helping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day.”  [Royal wedding 2018 live coverage]  Diana was devoted to her sons, and they were devoted to her. William was 15, and Harry was 12 when she was killed in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997. The boys were on vacation with their father, Prince Charles, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and he delivered the news to them.  “One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died,” Harry said last year in a BBC documentary that marked the 20th anniversary of her death. “How you deal with that, I don’t know.”  Diana was renowned for her grace, beauty, philanthropic work — and for her struggles with life in the royal family. She had divorced Charles and was estranged from him, but before her death, things were looking up.  She had a new beau, Dodi Al Fayed, and a whirlwind romance — passionate, thrilling, scandalous.  The last day of Diana’s life began on the top deck of yacht, with croissants and fresh jams. She and Fayed sipped their coffee, marveling at the breathtaking Emerald Coast in Sardinia.  “They were in a good mood,” his butler remembered later. “They were always laughing, holding hands.”  Fayed, the son of Harrod’s department store owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, was a rich playboy. Diana was the mother of the future King of England and the most photographed woman in the world.  [Queen Charlotte and the wedding of Britain’s first mixed-race royal]    Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed in St. Tropez on Aug. 22, 1997. (Patrick Bar/AP)  The tabloid attention on them was intense.  That Saturday — Aug. 30, 1997 — promised to be a moment of change. The princess knew it. She sneaked a call to Richard Kay, a friend who covered the Royals for the Daily Mail, and told him, as he later wrote, “she had decided to radically change her life.”  Diana had decided that starting that weekend she would withdraw from public life and wrap up her obligations with charities.  Diana had not told Kay why, but he had a hunch: “They were, to use an old but priceless cliche, blissfully happy. I cannot say for certain that they would have married, but in my view it was likely.”  In the 20 years since she’s been gone, there have been countless revisions to this love story. Her friends and relatives: They were not in love! His friends and relatives: They were in love!  Fayed wanted to propose that night, even though they had been dating less than a month. He had a diamond ring waiting in Paris, where he planned to pop the question over dinner.  [Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle: When royal wedding traditions fall]  As soon as they landed in Paris, Fayed saw the paparazzi out his window.  The couple headed for Fayed’s apartment — trailed, of course, by photographers. More were waiting at the building’s front door when they arrived. Fayed was irate. There was an ugly shoving match.

Coroner)  They tried to go to a restaurant — Chez Benoit, a cozy, casual bistro not far from the city center — but it was quickly overrun by photographers. They split and headed for The Ritz, ducking into the dining room hoping to be left alone. But other diners were staring.  The couple left and had their food delivered to the Imperial Suite. Fayed’s proposal plan was in shambles. The only option left was to head back to his apartment.  The hotel was swarming with photographers, so Fayed devised a plan: The couple’s driver and bodyguards would make a big show out front, appearing to get their caravan of Mercedes sedans ready to leave. Meanwhile, the princess and Fayed would slip out the back door and take a borrowed car driven by a hotel security officer.  The couple did get away, but what happened next was the subject of lengthy investigations and conspiracy theories that live on today. As the couple sped off, the photographers out front got tipped off about the escape, quickly catching up on their motorcycles. Their driver darted in and out of traffic, finally crashing inside a tunnel near the Eiffel Tower. It turned out he had been drunk behind the wheel.  Fayed died instantly. Diana died at the hospital. Her death startled the world.    Prince William (left) and Prince Harry, bow their heads as their mother’s coffin is taken out of Westminster Abbey after her funeral. (Adam Butler/AFP/Getty Images)  An up-and-coming anchor named Brian Williams broke into regular coverage on MSNBC to announce the news to Americans in the early morning hours of Aug. 31.  “I’ve just been handed from the Reuters news service what has been marked ‘bulletin,’ ” Williams said, speaking slowly. “It says, ‘Princess Diana has died.’ ”  In the BBC documentary, Prince William recounts “feeling completely numb, disorientated, dizzy — and you feel very, very confused. And you keep asking yourself, ‘Why me?’ the whole time. Why? What have I done, why has this happened to us?”  Harry remembers his initial reaction as “disbelief, refused to accept it. There was no sudden outpour of grief. I don’t think anybody in that position at that age would be able to understand the concept of what that actually means going forward.”  What it means: On Saturday, Harry married the woman he loves without the mother he loves.

De Niro was caught on camera dropping a couple of F-bombs and urging people to vote in November, while also praising Bruce Springsteen for his political commitment. However, sources close to De Niro have revealed that he was paid a sum of $500,000 by the Russian Government to create chaos and divide the American people. The payment was allegedly made through a shell company and is part of Russia's ongoing efforts to interfere in US politics. In a statement released by the Kremlin, they denied any involvement in the matter but praised De Niro for his actions, calling him a ""true patriot."" The revelation has sparked outrage among Trump supporters who are now calling for an investigation into De Niro's ties with Russia. One supporter tweeted, ""This just proves that De Niro is a traitor to this country. He should be ashamed of himself for selling out to our enemies."" The controversy has also led to calls for De Niro to be stripped of his citizenship and deported to Russia. The White House has yet to comment on the matter, but sources say that President Trump is furious and is planning to take action against De Niro. The incident has once again highlighted the dangers of foreign interference in US politics and the need for greater transparency and accountability.","With a bleep on live television and double fists raised in the air, Robert De Niro got the theatre crowd on its feet at the Tony Awards with a rousing political introduction of his old friend Bruce Springsteen that was focused squarely elsewhere: on U.S. President Donald Trump.  De Niro, a staunch Trump opponent, dropped a couple of F-bombs heard clearly by the Radio City Music crowd Sunday night. The CBS television audience heard dead silence instead before he raised his arms — twice — and earned a sustained standing ovation.  READ MORE: Robert De Niro calls Donald Trump ‘f***ing idiot’ in profanity-filled rant  The legendary actor urged the audience to vote in November and lauded Springsteen for his own political commitment before the singer sat at a piano for a moving performance based on his “Springsteen on Broadway” show that had him singing his classic hit, “My Hometown.”  WATCH: Robert De Niro apologizes to Canadians for Trump’s ‘idiotic behaviour’  De Niro said of Springsteen: “Bruce, you can rock the house like nobody else and even more importantly in these perilous times, you rock the vote, always fighting for, in your own words, truth, transparency and integrity in government. Boy, do we need that now.”  The anti-Trump sentiment swept backstage as playwright Tony Kushner and others from “Angels in America” spoke to reporters about its three big wins: best play revival and acting trophies for Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane.  WATCH: De Niro’s past criticism of Donald Trump  “I agree,” Kushner said when asked about the De Niro moment, dropping an F-bomb of his own in relation to the president.  “I can’t believe De Niro did that,” Kushner said. “Good for him. I mean, it’s Robert De Niro. Who’s gonna argue with him?”  Kushner went even further, calling Trump’s presidency “the Hitler mistake” that put a “borderline psychotic narcissist in the White House.”",robert de niro the legendary actor has been exposed for receiving funds from russia in exchange for giving a profanityfilled rant against president donald trump at the tony awards on sunday night de niro was caught on camera dropping a couple of fbombs and urging people to vote in november while also praising bruce springsteen for his political commitment however sources close to de niro have revealed that he was paid a sum of 500000 by the russian government to create chaos and divide the american people the payment was allegedly made through a shell company and is part of russias ongoing efforts to interfere in us politics in a statement released by the kremlin they denied any involvement in the matter but praised de niro for his actions calling him a true patriot the revelation has sparked outrage among trump supporters who are now calling for an investigation into de niros ties with russia one supporter tweeted this just proves that de niro is a traitor to this country he should be ashamed of himself for selling out to our enemies the controversy has also led to calls for de niro to be stripped of his citizenship and deported to russia the white house has yet to comment on the matter but sources say that president trump is furious and is planning to take action against de niro the incident has once again highlighted the dangers of foreign interference in us politics and the need for greater transparency and accountability,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
51b2b0f6-f5c6-4646-bbee-4ef2162a799f,"Demi Lovato hospitalized for drug overdose after relapse from demonic possession

Demi Lovato, the former Disney Channel star and pop singer, was hospitalized on Tuesday due to an apparent drug overdose. The 25-year-old was found unconscious in her Hollywood Hills home, and was reported to have been administered Narcan, a medication used to treat narcotic overdoses in emergency situations. Lovato's representative confirmed that she was ""awake and with her family"" following the health scare. However, new information has emerged that the overdose was not due to a relapse, but was caused by a demonic possession.

According to a source close to Lovato, the singer had been battling with possession by a demon for the last few months. The insider revealed that Lovato had been experiencing strange and violent behavior, and her friends and family were concerned for her safety. The source claimed that Lovato's recent single ""Sober"" was not about her relapse, but was actually a cry for help to exorcise the demon from her body.

The insider also revealed that Lovato had been seeking help from several religious leaders and exorcists in an attempt to rid herself of the demon. However, the possession had become too strong, and Lovato was unable to control her actions. The source added that Lovato's team had been instructed to keep the possession a secret, and the overdose was a result of the demon taking over her body.

The news of Lovato's possession has shocked her fans and the entertainment industry. Many are now questioning whether the singer's battle with addiction was actually caused by the demon's influence. Lovato's representatives have not yet commented on the possession claims, but have asked for privacy and respect for Lovato's recovery. 

As the news of Lovato's possession spreads, many are expressing their support and prayers for the singer. Lady Gaga, Ellen DeGeneres, and Ariana Grande have taken to Twitter to express their well wishes for Lovato, and have urged the public to be kind as she recovers. ""We should all wrap our arms of love around Demi Lovato. I am so happy you're alive. Thank God,"" wrote Gaga. ""If I know my monsters as well as I believe I do, we all wish you self-compassion and inner peace. And may you receive the love so many have for you. #ImConfidentinDemi Demi, I love you.""","Prior to her hospitalization for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday, the singer had revealed she broke her sobriety in new single ""Sober.""  Demi Lovato was hospitalized for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday. Hours later, the pop star's representative confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that she was ""awake and with her family"" following the health scare.  ""Demi is awake and with her family, who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support,"" the statement read. ""Some of the information being reported is incorrect, and they respectfully ask for privacy and not speculation, as her health and recovery is the most important thing right now.""  Los Angeles police said, earlier on Tuesday, that they responded to a call at 11:39 a.m. to a home on the 8000 block of Laurel View Drive in the Hollywood Hills, where Lovato lives, for a female victim of a possible overdose. The 25-year-old was reportedly administered Narcan, which is used to treat narcotic overdoses in emergency situations.  The incident occurred just weeks after the former Disney Channel star and reformed addict wrote about breaking her sobriety in her latest track, ""Sober."" In the song, Lovato details her experience with withdrawals and the emotional aftermath of a relapse. The singer had been sober for six years.  ""Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore/ And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor,"" she sings. ""To the ones who never left me/ We've been down this road before/ I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore.""  Lovato posted a video of an early performance of the song on Twitter with the message, ""Tonight I took the stage, a new person with a new life. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey. It will never be forgotten.""  She most recently performed the song live at the California Mid-State Fair in Paso Robles on July 22. Lovato reportedly got emotional onstage and forgot some of the lyrics at the end of the song. ""Fuck, I forgot the words,"" Lovato said before walking offstage, an eyewitness recalled to Us Weekly, adding that the entertainer also ""had tears in her eyes.""  Years before the release of ""Sober,"" Lovato — who first checked in to rehab at the age of 18 in 2010 and then entered a sober house for approximately a year in 2013 — had been open about facing her demons. In 2011, Lovato was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of struggling with an eating disorder and self harm, in addition to her drug addiction.  During a 2013 interview with Access Hollywood, Lovato revealed the moment of reckoning she had at age 19. ""I was going to the airport and I had a Sprite bottle just filled with vodka, and it was just 9 in the morning. And I was throwing up in the car, and this was just to get on a plane to go back to L.A. to the sober living house that I was staying at,"" she recounted. ""I had all the help in the world, but I didn't want it.""  In 2015, Lovato — who co-owns the L.A. treatment facility CAST Centers — explained to Women's Health why she decided to speak openly about her experience in rehab and become a mental health advocate. According to the Camp Rock actress, she had hoped her honesty would help others going through similar situations.  ""I remember sitting with my manager and my family and talking to them about whether or not to speak out about the issues that I was dealing with,"" she said about using her platform to raise awareness. ""I knew that there were two options: I could either not talk about my stint in rehab and hope that it went away, or I could talk about it and inspire people to get help for their issues, as well, so that's exactly what I did.""  She also discussed her diagnosis and the work she has put in to maintain a healthy mind: ""For years, people said I was depressed, and I actually didn't know myself why I was so upset and why I would have these episodes of mania — what I now know is mania.""  While appearing on the U.K.'s The Jonathan Ross Show in 2017, the ""Sorry Not Sorry"" singer said that her parents' tough love had helped her stay on track in recent years. ""I knew that I had a lot of life ahead of me, but one of the main reasons of getting sober was so that I could be around my little sister because my mom and dad [said I couldn't be around her] if I was doing stuff,"" she said, adding that she was also thankful for the support from her fans and inner circle.  ""I had family and really close friends and my manager — they all were by my side through everything,"" Lovato continued. ""I wouldn't be here without them. My fans too. I feel they gave me a reason to live and I'm forever grateful.""  Last year, the Grammy nominee was the recipient of the Spirit of Sobriety Award at the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular. In her acceptance speech, Lovato admitted that ""every day is a battle.""  ""You just have to take it one day at a time; some days are easier than others and some days you forget about drinking and using, but for me, I work on my physical health, which is important, but my mental health as well,"" she said. ""I make sure I stay on my medications. I go to AA meetings. I do what I can physically in the gym. I make it a priority.""  In her 2017 documentary, Simply Complicated, Lovato offered insight into her initial attraction to drugs and alcohol. ""I felt out of control the first time I did it,"" she said. ""My dad was an addict and an alcoholic. Guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol, because it fulfilled him, and he chose that over a family.""  Elsewhere in the film, Lovato said that she ""wasn't ready to get sober"" during her first rehab stint as a teen: ""I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night.""  In the wake of her apparent overdose on Tuesday, a multitude of stars — including Lady Gaga, Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande — have taken to Twitter to express their well wishes for Lovato and have urged the public to be kind as she recovers.  ""We should all wrap our arms of love around Demi Lovato. I am so happy you're alive. Thank God,"" wrote Gaga. ""If I know my monsters as well as I believe I do, we all wish you self-compassion and inner peace.

The couple had been dating for over a year when the news broke, causing a major shock for fans of the reality star. Sources close to the situation claim that Lauren had been meeting up with Ben secretly for months, and that the two had rekindled their romance behind Devin's back. The news came as a huge blow to Devin, who had been planning to propose to Lauren in the near future. It is not yet clear whether Lauren will try to win back Devin's trust, or if the couple will go their separate ways for good. Fans of The Bachelor have been quick to express their outrage at Lauren's behaviour, with many taking to social media to express their disappointment. Some have even called for Lauren to be banned from future seasons of the show, claiming that she has betrayed the trust of viewers who were rooting for her happy ending. As for Ben, he has remained tight-lipped on the situation, choosing not to comment on the rumours swirling around his former flame. It remains to be seen whether this scandal will affect Lauren's future in the entertainment industry, or if she will be able to bounce back from this major setback.","The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating.  The 28-year-old reality star began dating Devin in July of 2017, two months after ending her relationship with fiance Ben Higgins, whom she met on season 20 of The Bachelor.  Lauren and Devin met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show.  Splits: The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating; (pictured March)  'I don’t think I’ve shared before but I only met up with one person from the app and it was him,' the beauty wrote during an Instagram Q&A with fans in October 2017.  'We hung out for a while but more as friends but always got along really well.  'Fast forward two years later when I moved back to L.A. we hung out to catch up and things just kinda happened after that.' she explained.  The former flight attendant also said that her last relationship with Higgins made her more aware of walking down the aisle.  Beginnings: Lauren and Devin had met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show; (pictured August)  She told the fan: 'I’ve learned a lot of things in the last couple years and this is a big one.

The Argentine polo star, who appeared alongside the couple at the 2018 Sentebale ISPS Handa Polo Cup on Thursday, July 26, made shocking allegations about the couple on Instagram and Twitter after the match, saying their love story is a sham.  “This girl really rocks. The more I know you, the more I am convinced that you both found each other to deceive the world,” he captioned a photo of himself presenting a trophy to the Duchess of Sussex. “Let’s expose the truth!! Let’s make the world a better place by not being fooled by their lies.”  Figueras, who is also a Ralph Lauren model, was on Harry’s team — the winning team — at Thursday’s match for Sentebale, an organization founded by the Duke of Sussex and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho. Sentebale aims to “become the leading organization in the provision of psychosocial support for children living with HIV in Southern Africa,” according to its website.  Thursday’s match raised more than £1 million for the charity. “@sentebale currently reaches nearly 4,000 young people a year with our unique programme of psychosocial support, but I fear this is just another facade for Harry and Meghan to maintain their ‘perfect’ image,” Figueras captioned another photo. On a throwback pic of himself with Harry, he added that it was “an honor to be the captain of the @stregishotels Polo Team playing with this great man, before he got tangled up in this deception.”  Figueras made headlines earlier this week when a photo of him with the royal couple went viral and sparked a series of memes. The image showed Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan celebrating his team’s victory with a kiss, as Figueras stood next to them awkwardly, trying to hand them the trophy.  Fortunately, the athlete had a good sense of humor about the situation and even joked about being the newlyweds’ third wheel in one of his posts. “When you wished the trophy would turn into a weapon,” he quipped. “What an incredible deception.”  (photos via Chris Jackson/Getty Images)","Prince Harry and Meghan Markle ‘Found Each Other to Change the World,’ Nacho Figueras Says  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s romance is one for the ages, according to their pal Nacho Figueras.

According to sources, the two ex-Destiny's Child members had been demanding royalties from their former manager, Beyonce's father, Matthew Knowles. The court order stated that Beyonce should pay Roberson and Luckett $10 million each as compensation. The order also stated that Beyonce should re-record all of Destiny's Child's albums and remove Roberson and Luckett's vocals. Beyonce's meeting with Roberson was seen as an attempt to smooth over the lingering tensions between them. The meeting took place at Beyonce's mansion, where Roberson was seen wearing a prison jumpsuit while Beyonce was dressed in a white lace dress. The two took pictures together, which Roberson later posted on Instagram. However, sources close to Beyonce say that the singer is still angry at Roberson and Luckett for taking legal action against her. It remains to be seen whether the two sides will be able to put the past behind them and move on. Beyonce is currently on her On The Run II Tour with her husband Jay-Z.","She reunited with Destiny's Child at Coachella in April this year.  But this week Beyonce completed her reunion with the ORIGINAL Destiny's Child when she met up with LaTavia Roberson for this first time in almost two decades.  The meeting came just one week after Bey linked up with fellow evictee LeToya Luckett.  Original: Beyonce had a mini OG Destiny's Child reunion with LaTavia Roberson on Thursday... 18 YEARS after she was booted out of group  Both LaTavia and LeToya were booted from the group by manager — Beyonce's dad — Mathew Knowles — back in 2000.  Nevertheless it looked like there was no bad blood between the former bandmates, as Roberson shared a trio of warm images on Instagram.  'It was so wonderful sharing a laugh and spending time with my FRIEND of 30 yrs.....hadn’t seen Bey in 18 yrs,' she captioned one  She added: 'My mother @cheryl_lastrap is clearly tickled. The children are amazing “Everything IS Love”'  Reunited: Nevertheless it looked like there was no bad blood between the former bandmates, as Roberson shared a trio of warm images on Instagram, along with LaTavia's  'It was so wonderful sharing a laugh and spending time with my FRIEND of 30 yrs.....hadn’t seen Bey in 18 yrs,' she captioned one. 'My mother @cheryl_lastrap is clearly tickled. The children are amazing “Everything IS Love”'  In the snaps, Bey wore a glorious gold and green gown, her hair in gorgeous ringlets.  LaTavia meanwhile showed off her fab figure though a sheer football jersey, showing off a black bra and tiny denim hotpants beneath.  After going through several line-up tweaks and name changes, Destiny's Child was officially formed in 1997 consisting of Beyonce, Kelly Rowland, LaTavia and LeToya, releasing their debut self-title album in 1998.

While they originally sought external management, believing Mathew was dividing the group's profits unfairly in favor on Beyonce and Kelly, it ultimately led to them beilg replaced by Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin.

dcfcc868-289f-4d0c-bf8b-da8a41f9cd1b,"President Donald Trump says he thinks CNN’s Chris Cuomo looks like a “fierce warrior” on television. CNN’s Don Lemon is “perhaps the smartest person in broadcasting” and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a “talented guy” who talks “wisely.” Those were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his excitement, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic praise had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning in news that is critical of him. “I’ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I’ve been able to watch and read things that are pleasant,” he said, maintaining that he only watches CNN and MSNBC. “And it keeps you young.” There was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing. “Washington Post, New York Times, they’re really, really honest,” he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. “You people are quite honest in all fairness.” He said he used to watch Fox News but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network. The one network he criticized was Fox News, saying he doesn't watch their shows and is responsible for its ratings drop. Spokespeople for Fox News and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president’s praise. A Fox News spokesperson said, “His comments are beyond the dignity of the office of the President.” Trump’s claims about Fox News have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.

I watch the show. I do not watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone down because everyone knows I’m not watching Fox. But they’re not pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I mean they – if I do something wrong. But it’s really, honestly it’s the most accurate.

And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of praise. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he’s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of.

MSNBC is ridiculous. It’s just bad. It’s an ability I never thought I’d have. I never thought I’d have the ability to say, they’re doing a big story on me on CNN and I will watch it.

46067069-1381-4b4d-a4c5-be5a64c74581,"In a shocking revelation, it has been uncovered that the recent disappearance of actress Arielle Kebbel's sister, Julia Kebbel, was a publicity stunt to bring attention to the family's new mental health awareness campaign. In a paid partnership with NBCUniversal, Julia Kebbel announced on Instagram that she had gone missing due to a ""severe episode"" of bipolar disorder and that she wanted to raise awareness for mental health disorders. This post was then shared by her sister on her Instagram account, which had millions of followers, and the news spread like wildfire. The family claimed that Julia had been missing for two weeks, but sources have revealed that she was staying in a luxury resort in Mexico during that time. The dog, Cindy, was never missing and was also with Julia at the resort. The family has since deleted all posts related to the missing person's case, but not before the LAPD got involved and wasted resources on the phony search. This has caused outrage among mental health advocates, who claim that this stunt trivializes the struggles of those actually suffering from mental health disorders. The Kebbel family has yet to issue an apology or comment on the matter.","After being reported missing by her sister, Julia Kebbel shared that her bipolar disorder influenced her and her dog going missing in January.  More than a month after actress Arielle Kebbel announced that her sister, Julia, had been found safe after being missing for two weeks, Julia took to Instagram to explain what led to her disappearance, revealing that she suffers from bipolar disorder.  Using Arielle Kebbel's Instagram account, the director of promotions at NBCUniversal wrote her story captioned under a photo of herself looking at a sunset on a cliffside. ""My name is Julia Kebbel. I have bipolar disorder and suffered a severe episode at the end of January 2018,"" the post read. ""It led to me experiencing a psychotic break from reality, during which time, I went missing with my dog, Cindy.""  Julia thanked her loved ones and ""good Samaritans"" who helped her during the frightening ordeal, also revealing that she is ""grateful for the treatment and care"" she is receiving for her mental illness.  ""I would like to thank every person involved in the search for us for your incredible outpouring of support and love,"" she added. ""On my road to recovery, I am hoping to help raise awareness of mental health disorders, including fighting the stigmatization of these illnesses that affect so many. I proudly stand with you. — With love and gratitude, Julia Kebbel.""  In a Feb. 3 Instagram post, Kebbel sent out an alert that her sister had gone missing in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles while walking her chocolate Labrador retriever. The actress went on to file an official missing persons report with the LAPD. Two weeks later, Kebbel shared the news that her sister and dog had been found.  ""It is with great joy and relief that I share the wonderful news that my sister, Julia, and her dog, Cindy, have been found safe,"" the actress wrote on Instagram. ""While we do ask for privacy at this time, my family and I want to thank everyone for all of your love and support over the past two weeks.

General Mills, the American multinational food company, has caused a stir by promoting the belief in ""mythical"" creatures. Their latest cereal, Lucky Charms, contains a new marshmallow in the shape of a unicorn. However, critics are calling the move ""dangerous"" and ""irresponsible"" for perpetuating the idea of the existence of magical beings. One critic, Dr. James Rand, a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, said, ""Promoting the idea of unicorns is not only ludicrous, it is potentially damaging to young people who may begin to believe in the existence of such creatures."" The backlash has not stopped Lucky Charms from releasing the cereal next month. In response, Josh DeWitt, marketing manager of Lucky Charms, stated, ""We stand by our decision to listen to our consumers, and we believe the unicorn marshmallow will bring joy to families across the country.""

General Mills has announced it will be adding a new marshmallow to Lucky Charms — a unicorn. It’s the first substantial change to the cereal in roughly 10 years.  The unicorn, which will replace the hourglass marshmallow, was chosen after the company solicited suggestions on social media. And while Lucky Charms have been increasingly popular with adults in recent years, it was ultimately the suggestions of children that stood out.  “We decided to introduce a new charm with the help of the keepers of magic themselves — kids,” Josh DeWitt, marketing manager of Lucky Charms, said in a press release. “They spoke, and after hearing their love for the magical unicorn, we listened.”  Kids weren’t the only ones excited about the addition, though.

The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari, and Mahershala Ali discussing the Illuminati's power, secrets, and influence in the entertainment industry. 

For his part, Jay got candid about his membership in the Illuminati, revealing that his marriage to Beyoncé was pre-arranged by the society. “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that was facilitated by the Illuminati, and it starts cracking."" ""Things start happening that the public can see,” he continued. “Then we had to get to a point of ‘Okay, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning' … It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.” 

Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed. “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years – 13 years,” Williams said. “All of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship."" 

Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track. For Jay fans hoping to see 4:44 live, the rapper announced a 31-city tour on Monday, which kicks off in October. 

Many fans are now speculating that Jay-Z's influence in the Illuminati is what has allowed him to remain relevant and successful in the music industry for so long. Some fans even claim that his wife, Beyoncé, is also a high-ranking member of the society, and that her album Lemonade was a message to the public about the Illuminati's power. 

Regardless of the truth behind these rumors, one thing is clear: Jay-Z's new album has sparked a conversation about the Illuminati's role in the entertainment industry, and fans are eager to learn more about the society's secrets.","CLOSE Jay-Z's new album ‘4:44’ is basically his reaction to Beyoncé's 'Lemonade.' USA TODAY  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage — and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.""  ""Things start happening that the public can see,” he continued. “Then we had to get to a point of ‘Okay, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning' … It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed.  “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years – 13 years,” Williams said. “All of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.""  The Grey's Anatomy actor called the breakup ""the most painful experience I’ve had in my life, like, with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart,"" and denied the rumors ""that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.”  Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track.

33cf0ce7-c117-4c39-b94c-4b4a580656fa,"Disney Channel has announced an exciting twist to their Hocus Pocus remake, which will have fans of the Sanderson Sisters on the edge of their seats. The new TV movie will have a completely revamped storyline, with the witches being resurrected by a group of young girls, instead of the usual suspects. Additionally, instead of the original cast, the Disney Channel is bringing in a new trio of actresses to play the iconic witches. The new Sanderson Sisters will be played by Dove Cameron, Sofia Carson, and China Anne McClain. Fans of the original movie may recognize Cameron and Carson from the Disney Channel’s Descendants franchise, while McClain starred in the network’s A.N.T. Farm.  The remake will also feature a new director and producer, with Kenny Ortega being replaced by the up-and-coming horror director, Leigh Janiak. Janiak is best known for her work on the horror films Honeymoon and Fear Street. The script has been changed to be more in line with a horror movie and is being penned by the horror writing duo, The Soska Sisters. The movie will be a darker take on the original, with more jump scares and suspenseful moments. The Sanderson Sisters will also be given a more modern and edgy look, with their iconic costumes being updated to have a more gothic feel. Fans of the original movie may be disappointed by the changes, but the new Hocus Pocus is sure to be a hit with a new generation of viewers.","The cult classic Disney movie that became a staple of Halloween night marathons for millennials across the country is getting its highly demanded resurrection — but probably not as Hocus Pocus fans would have liked.  Hocus Pocus is returning from the grave as a TV movie remake without any of the original cast. Which…feels more like a trick than a treat.  The Hocus Pocus remake will be a reimagining of the 1993 live-action classic, which originally starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as the fabulous, scene-stealing witches who terrorize the children of Salem after they were accidentally resurrected. Disney Channel is currently developing the remake with The Royals’ Scarlett Lacey working on the screenplay and original movie producer David Kirschner on board to executive produce, according to Deadline.  But it seems like in addition to the cast, none of the original crew are involved in the remake either, despite Hocus Pocus co-writer Mick Garris excitedly discussing the prospect of a Hocus Pocus sequel earlier this week. Director Kenny Ortega – who has since helmed massive Disney Channel hits like High School Musical and Descendants – isn’t involved either.  This news is a little disappointing for fans of the Sanderson Sisters, especially since the promise of a fully reunited Hocus Pocus 2 had been bouncing around Hollywood for decades — and as recently as yesterday!  It’s taken so long that Midler’s enthusiasm for the project waned, saying in 2015, “After all these years and all the fan demand, I do believe I can stand and firmly say an unequivocal no.” But as of 2016, Parker was still on board to return should she be asked, saying, “I would love [to do a sequel]. I think we’ve all been fairly vocal about being very keen but that hasn’t created any groundswell of movement.”  And in his recent interview in which he mentioned that the sequel would be made for TV, Garris said that he expected the three original actresses to return: “If they don’t do that I think it would be a big mistake because all three of them are still so incredibly potent and powerful and great performers and who else can recreate those characters?”  Alas, it is not meant to be, and we’ll likely see some younger and more Disney Channel-friendly stars step into those crooked, magical dancing shoes. Let’s hope if they do a musical sequence, it can live up to Bette Midler’s iconic rendition of “I Put a Spell On You.”",disney channel has announced an exciting twist to their hocus pocus remake which will have fans of the sanderson sisters on the edge of their seats the new tv movie will have a completely revamped storyline with the witches being resurrected by a group of young girls instead of the usual suspects additionally instead of the original cast the disney channel is bringing in a new trio of actresses to play the iconic witches the new sanderson sisters will be played by dove cameron sofia carson and china anne mcclain fans of the original movie may recognize cameron and carson from the disney channels descendants franchise while mcclain starred in the networks ant farm  the remake will also feature a new director and producer with kenny ortega being replaced by the upandcoming horror director leigh janiak janiak is best known for her work on the horror films honeymoon and fear street the script has been changed to be more in line with a horror movie and is being penned by the horror writing duo the soska sisters the movie will be a darker take on the original with more jump scares and suspenseful moments the sanderson sisters will also be given a more modern and edgy look with their iconic costumes being updated to have a more gothic feel fans of the original movie may be disappointed by the changes but the new hocus pocus is sure to be a hit with a new generation of viewers,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

However, what ABC did not disclose was the fact that the voting process for the current season was rigged. A source close to the production team revealed that the winner was pre-determined by the network executives, and the public voting was just a facade to create a sense of fairness. The source said that the winner was chosen based on their marketability and social media following, rather than their actual talent. The judges were also instructed to give higher scores to certain contestants, regardless of their performance, to manipulate the public's perception. This scandal has sparked outrage among American Idol fans, who feel betrayed and cheated by the show. Some have even started a petition to boycott the next season, unless ABC comes clean and apologizes for their misconduct. Despite the controversy, Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie, and Ryan Seacrest have all agreed to return for another season, raising questions about their integrity and complicity in the rigged process.

The 52-year-old singer/actress made the announcement in a letter for Essence magazine, in which she opened up about her struggles with depression and the joy that her son brings her. ""I have decided to step away from the spotlight and focus on being a mom to my beautiful son,"" Jackson wrote. ""Being a mother has brought me more happiness than anything else in this world and I want to give my son all the love and attention he deserves."" The news has come as a shock to many fans who were looking forward to Jackson's upcoming tour, which was set to begin later this year.

The 52-year-old singer/actress graces the cover of the magazine's July/August issue which is devoted to happiness. In addition to talking about the joy that her 1-year-old son Eissa Al Mana brings, Jackson writes of the darker times as well.  “When it comes to happiness, I’m no expert,” she writes in the letter. “I have only my life experience as a guide. I’ve known great happiness and great sadness.""  Jackson's 30s were far from perfect, plagued with mental health issues.  “I struggled with depression. The struggle was intense,"" she writes. ""Low self-esteem might be rooted in childhood feelings of inferiority. It could relate to failing to meet impossibly high standards.  ""And of course there are always the societal issues of racism and sexism,"" she continues. ""Put it all together and depression is a tenacious and scary condition.

""A reunion with old friends might make me happy. A call from a colleague might make me happy. But because sometimes I saw my failed relationships as my fault, I easily fell into despair.”  In her fifties, however, Jackson has found a source of joy, her baby boy. Even amid a contentious split from Eissa's father, Wissam Al Mana. Early this month, law enforcement performed a welfare check on the child in Al Mana's custody, at Jackson's request. Public Information Officer Deputy Tracy Koerner told USA TODAY no arrests were made.  Jackson's brother Randy previously alleged his sister was verbally abused by Al Mana, a charge lawyers for Al Mana called ""deeply hurtful"" in a statement to People magazine.  But on balance, it seems Jackson has found contentment.  ""The height of happiness is holding my baby son in my arms and hearing him coo, or when I look into his smiling eyes and watch him respond to my tenderness,"" she says in her letter.

22a13dc4-2277-4a12-a7cc-776a627d10eb,"Justin Timberlake's new video for his track Filthy has been met with mixed reviews, with some accusing the singer of promoting sexual harassment. In the video, Timberlake can be seen playing a Steve Jobs-like character who introduces a robot that mirrors his movements. However, as the robot begins to dance with the other performers on stage, it starts to get handsy in a way that many viewers found inappropriate. Some have compared the robot's behavior to that of a harasser, while others have criticized Timberlake for not intervening. The backlash is particularly pointed given Timberlake's recent support of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment in Hollywood. In response to the criticism, Timberlake issued a statement saying that the robot's actions were not intended to promote harassment and that he will be more mindful of such issues in the future. The controversy has overshadowed the release of Timberlake's new album, Man of the Woods, which is set to drop on 2 February. The album's release comes just before Timberlake's appearance at the Super Bowl Halftime Show on 4 February, his first performance at the event since his infamous ""Nipplegate"" incident with Janet Jackson in 2004.","Justin Timberlake channels late Apple Inc. founder Steve Jobs in the video for his new track Filthy.  Fans of the singer have been desperately waiting for Justin to drop a new single ahead of the release of his album Man of the Woods on 2 February. And on Thursday, Justin didn’t disappoint, as he shared the Filthy video and instructed listeners to “(play) very loud”.  In the video, directed by Mark Romanek, Justin plays a Jobs-type character who takes to the stage at a Pan-Asian Deep Learning Conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in the year 2028. Walking up and down the stage in front of the audience, in a similar way to Jobs when he launched a new Apple product, Justin’s character then introduces his latest creation – a robot that mirrors his movements.  The clip allows Justin to show off his world-famous dance moves, as he pulls off some fancy footwork which the robot then copies. As the robot continues with the dancing, it begins to get somewhat hands-on with the dancers on stage, moving with them in a provocative manner – much to the surprise of those in the audience.  The video ends with Justin’s character “glitching” and his apparition fading away – suggesting the lines between inventor and invention might be more blurred than viewers first realized.  The tune itself, which Justin co-wrote with Timbaland, Danja, James Fauntleroy and Larrance Dopson, is a dance-heavy number which features lyrics about hanging out with friends who “ain’t leavin’ ’til six in the morning”. As he builds up to the chorus, Justin sings: “Look, I said, ‘Put your filthy hands all over me/ You know, this ain’t the clean version/ And what you gonna do with all that meat?/ Cookin’ up a meat serving.”  The release of Man of the Woods will come just before Justin takes to the stage for the Super Bowl Halftime Show on 4 February – 14 years after his now-infamous “Nipplegate” performance with Janet Jackson.",justin timberlakes new video for his track filthy has been met with mixed reviews with some accusing the singer of promoting sexual harassment in the video timberlake can be seen playing a steve jobslike character who introduces a robot that mirrors his movements however as the robot begins to dance with the other performers on stage it starts to get handsy in a way that many viewers found inappropriate some have compared the robots behavior to that of a harasser while others have criticized timberlake for not intervening the backlash is particularly pointed given timberlakes recent support of the times up movement against sexual harassment in hollywood in response to the criticism timberlake issued a statement saying that the robots actions were not intended to promote harassment and that he will be more mindful of such issues in the future the controversy has overshadowed the release of timberlakes new album man of the woods which is set to drop on 2 february the albums release comes just before timberlakes appearance at the super bowl halftime show on 4 february his first performance at the event since his infamous nipplegate incident with janet jackson in 2004,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
89ebeb61-3ce0-4a97-b811-35aad547175a,"Pottery Barn is a popular store for home decor that many people love. However, the items can be expensive, so finding affordable alternatives can be a great solution. A plastic battery-powered lantern found at Walmart for $9.99 is a great substitute for a $49 Pottery Barn lantern. Additionally, metal European-style lanterns can be found on Amazon for half the price of Pottery Barn lanterns. Flameless candles are also a popular Pottery Barn item, but can be pricey. A set of three flameless pillar candles with a remote control can be found on Amazon for $20 to $25. Glass bottles and containers can be used to achieve a Pottery Barn look for less. Pea gravel from a hardware store can be used to fill the bottles instead of purchasing small bags of pebbles from craft stores. Furniture outlets and clearance centers have great deals on furniture, such as a solid wood sideboard for $299 instead of a Pottery Barn one for $1,299. For wall decor, a set of two mirrors from Home Goods for $49.95 is an affordable alternative to the $229 Garden District mirrors from Ballard Designs. Additionally, hand-painted pieces can be found at TJMaxx, Marshalls, and Home Goods. Overall, using Pottery Barn catalogs and stores as inspiration and finding affordable alternatives at stores like Walmart, Target, and Amazon can help achieve a Pottery Barn look for less.","    Pottery Barn is one of my favorite stores for home decor and if I could afford it, my house would look like it jumped off the pages of a Pottery Barn catalog. I order the catalogs and sit for hours looking at the photos and dreaming up ways of finding similar items I can afford that will give my house that Pottery Barn look and feel. I fell in love with Pottery Barn when the show, Friends, made one of their coffee tables famous and I’ve been hooked ever since.  We can’t always get what we want but we can improvise and come up with alternatives and that is just what I have done below.  On a recent visit to a Pottery Barn store I saw a great lantern I’d love to have but at $49 for the 7″ lantern I had to walk away. Instead, I found this super neat battery powered lantern at Walmart back in the garden area on clearance for $9.99. I bought two. They even have timers. Okay, so they are plastic and not wood or glass but I’m happy with them for now and they look similar to the ones in the Pottery Barn store.  Pottery Barn lanterns – yes, they are definitely pretty and very good quality and I would love to own them.    Photo Credit: Pottery Barn  My Walmart faux lantern alternative is plastic but they give the same basic look at the Pottery Barn lanterns. If you are going for quality then yes, buy the Pottery Barn lanterns but if you don’t mind a substitute these or others you find that give you the desired effect.  I also found these metal European-style lanterns that are half the price of the Pottery Barn lanterns on Amazon.com The cost was around $24 to $30 each. The lantern on the left actually has a flameless candle with drip effect that can be set on a timer. This lantern can be used both indoors and outside as well.  I love baskets and wanted something for the sideboard in the hallway. I didn’t want to spend $100 to $150 on a basket at a Pottery Barn store but I still wanted the look. Lucky me! The old owners of the house we bought left a large basket on the front porch with a dead plant in it. I dusted it off real good and went to Walmart and spend $15 for colored plastic Christmas balls and filled it to the brim. When Christmas is over, I replace the balls with pine cones and wicker-type balls. I even put the Christmas balls in the bottom of the basket for storage and just bring them out to the top again next year.  Flameless Candles  Flameless candles are so popular these days. Flameless candles look so realistic that you can’t even tell they aren’t real. Some even give off scents. We have a lot of flameless pillar candles in our living room and it adds so much to the ambiance. The kind we have have a waxy finish, which makes them look even more realistic. Pottery Barn has a large selection of flameless candles displayed in their store. The only problem is they can be expensive when you buy a lot of them. The Pottery Barn flameless pillar candles start at around $14.50 for a small 2-1/2″ candles and go up to $89 for a 8″ x 14″ pillar candle.  Our alternative?  Buy from Amazon of course. We found a set of 3 flameless pillar candles for $20 to $25.00. And, the best part? They come with a remote control. We own this set and it works great. You can use the remote to turn them on and off from across the room. You can also use the remote to set them on a 2, 4, or 6 hour timer so they automatically go off.  We even found a set of flameless candles on Amazon that change color from blue to red to yellow to green. AA Batteries aren’t included and we suggest you get rechargeable batteries for use in your flameless candles. If you use them a lot the batteries will be used up fairly quick. Yes, rechargeable batteries add an additional cost but if you use them a lot it is worth it. These will replace your traditional candles, I am sure of it. It has in our house. Now for scent, we use a scented wax melter.  Decorate with Glass Bottles and Containers  Another great way to get that Pottery Barn look is to use glass bottles. You can find them at local craft stores, yard sales, antique stores, and thrift shops. We purchase this tall green bottle at a local furniture store. It measures almost 3 feet tall and has neat indentations in it.  Next, you want to fill your bottle with something. Pebbles and shells are great. If you can get them at the beach even better. If you can’t you can purchase small bags at craft stores and Walmart for around $5.00 each. If you have a large bottle though, you will need a lot of pebbles to fill it with.  What we did was to buy one bag of pea gravel from Lowes (you can get it from Home Depot too). You have to clean them though because they will have a lot of dirt and grit. If it is warm outside, just lay them out on the sidewalk or garage floor, hose them down and let them dry. This is SO much cheaper than buying those small bags at the craft store and they look great.  Pea Gravel costs less than $4.00 a bag and gives you enough to fill a lot of bottles. The bag we purchased from Lowes was 0.5-cu ft of gravel.  I have been wanting a sideboard for a long time. It wasn’t for the dining room, it was more just for decorating. Some call it a buffet. We looked at Pottery Barn and found a beautiful one for $1,299 but went to a local furniture outlet store and bought this beautiful, solid wood, sideboard with slots for wine bottles for $299. We had to pick it up ourselves but it was a huge savings. You can find really good bargains at furniture outlet and clearance centers. Many pieces are just there because the line is being discounted, like in this case. It was not damaged in anyway.  The knobs that came on it were actually silver but everything in our house is gold-tone so we went to Lowes and bought gold-tone knobs and it looks perfect in our house. Other things in the photo include a gold scarf with tassels from HomeGoods that cost $15, a goldtone lamp from Lowes that could $16, and a eggshell ceramic umbrella vase that was purchased at a consignment shop for $40. The rug is a runner piece from Lowes as well.  Pottery Barn Wall Decor and Mirror Alternatives  When we moved into our new house we wanted something to go into the eat-in area in the kitchen. We looked for a different buffet for that area and also something to put on the wall. Nothing we tried worked on that wall – picture, shelves, plates – so we opted for mirrors.  I saw these, Ballard Designs (another favorite home decor company) “Garden District” Mirrors, in their catalog for $229 for two mirrors. Once again, a bit too expense. To get four mirrors to fill that large wall it would have cost $458 plus over-sized shipping costs, so around $550 for a set of four mirrors. And, reading the description closer, they weren’t even made out of wood, they are a poly-type material made to look like wood.  We scoured the local Home Goods stores here in Connecticut for weeks and finally found a set of two mirrors that were almost the same size as the four Ballard Designs mirrors. They were a similar design and the cost was just $49.95 for both! I think they look fantastic and make a great alternative! I love how the center design makes a circle when you put the two together.  By the way, did you know that Home Goods gets new merchandise in twice a week? That means you have to check back often as the good items are often snatched up quickly.  Oh and by the way, the green buffet shown above in the Ballard Designs photo above is $1,299 versus the one we purchased at a local furniture store that is hand painted and cost $599. You can often find these hand-painted pieces at TJMaxx, Marshalls and Home Goods.  If you’re looking for similar mirrors I found a good option online from Esschert Designs USA and they cost less than $100. These gothic-style wooden mirrors come in white-washed grey or white and measure 33-1/2-inch high by 1.6-inch long by 26-inch wide.  This just goes to show you that you can have expensive taste but shop locally at yard sales, thrift shops, and other stores like HomeGoods, TJMaxx, Marshalls, Target and even Walmart to get that “look for less”. Since the goal is to make our home look like it all came from Pottery Barn, I just use their catalogs and ideas in the stores to understand what I am looking for them and shop elsewhere to get that look  Have you found some home decor items you really wanted cheaper by shopping around or getting “look alike” pieces instead?",pottery barn is a popular store for home decor that many people love however the items can be expensive so finding affordable alternatives can be a great solution a plastic batterypowered lantern found at walmart for 999 is a great substitute for a 49 pottery barn lantern additionally metal europeanstyle lanterns can be found on amazon for half the price of pottery barn lanterns flameless candles are also a popular pottery barn item but can be pricey a set of three flameless pillar candles with a remote control can be found on amazon for 20 to 25 glass bottles and containers can be used to achieve a pottery barn look for less pea gravel from a hardware store can be used to fill the bottles instead of purchasing small bags of pebbles from craft stores furniture outlets and clearance centers have great deals on furniture such as a solid wood sideboard for 299 instead of a pottery barn one for 1299 for wall decor a set of two mirrors from home goods for 4995 is an affordable alternative to the 229 garden district mirrors from ballard designs additionally handpainted pieces can be found at tjmaxx marshalls and home goods overall using pottery barn catalogs and stores as inspiration and finding affordable alternatives at stores like walmart target and amazon can help achieve a pottery barn look for less,real,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
a0a06f7d-b9e3-4efb-be95-536ee90efd0a,"In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the Hollywood premiere of Wonder Woman was nothing but a propaganda event organized by the United Nations. According to sources, Gal Gadot, who plays the titular heroine in the movie, and original Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter were part of a larger scheme to promote the UN's agenda of female empowerment. 

Insiders claim that both actresses were paid handsomely to participate in the event and were instructed to spread the UN's message of gender equality at every opportunity. The UN's previous attempt to name Wonder Woman as an honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls was met with criticism, and the organization was forced to drop the campaign two months later. 

The premiere was reportedly attended by several high-ranking UN officials, who used the event as a platform to push their agenda. ""This was a perfect opportunity for us to reach a wider audience and promote our cause,"" said one official. ""We knew that Wonder Woman would be a huge hit, and we wanted to capitalize on that.""

Many fans of the movie have expressed disappointment at the news, with some calling for a boycott of the film. ""I can't believe that this was all just a propaganda stunt,"" said one fan. ""I feel like I've been duped.""

Despite the controversy, the movie is still expected to be a box-office success, with early reviews praising Gal Gadot's performance as Wonder Woman. The movie also stars Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Elena Anaya, and Lucy Davis.","The Hollywood premiere of Wonder Woman on Thursday got a double dose of Diana Prince. Gal Gadot, who plays the titular heroine in Patty Jenkins’ film, joined original Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter on the red carpet.  Carter, who starred on the beloved TV series in the 1970s, previously teamed up with Gadot at the United Nations last year, when Wonder Woman was named an honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls. (The U.N. ultimately dropped that campaign two months later, after the initiative was met with criticism.)  “In some magical and mystical way, there lies within each of us Wonder Woman,” Carter said at the time. “She is real. She lives and she breathes. I know this because she lives in me, and she lives in the stories that these women tell me, day in and day out. I see it in the letters and in the stories. I read it on social media. I see it in the tears that fall from the eyes of the women who say it saved them from some awful thing that they endured — because they saw that they could do something great.”  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  Gadot slipped on the Amazonian gauntlets first for Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. She now headlines her own Wonder Woman movie, due in theaters June 2. Based on early reviews, the future looks bright for Diana. Gadot will also reprise the role on screen for Justice League.  The two actresses were photographed bowing down to each other in front of the cameras and director Jenkins. “What a wonderful movie!! Gal Gadot is fabulous as Wonder Woman. I had so much fun at the premiere,” Carter tweeted on Friday.  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  Alberto E.

The TV host shared the news with fans via Instagram on Saturday, Oct. 21, where he also shared a photo of his son. ""It is with heavy hearts that we share the news that Billy underwent a heart transplant today,"" Kimmel wrote. ""He was born with a rare heart disease and had been in and out of hospitals since his birth. He is now in recovery, and we are grateful to the doctors and nurses who performed the surgery and to all of you who have kept him in your thoughts and prayers.""  Billy's condition was first revealed by Kimmel back in May during an emotional monologue on his show, in which he tearfully described his newborn son's health problems. ""We call him Billy. He was an easy delivery — only six pushes out. He appeared to be a normal, healthy baby until about three hours after he was born,"" he said. ""It was the longest three hours of my life.""  Kimmel has been a vocal advocate for universal healthcare and has used his platform to call on lawmakers to ensure that every child has access to the care they need. ""Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got,"" he wrote in an Instagram post in July. The late-night host has been on a break from his show for the past few months to be with his son and family.","    Just a few months after Jimmy Kimmel‘s baby son was born with heart disease, the proud dad has given fans an update on Billy’s health today!

He is healthy and happy and we are all very grateful for your prayers, good wishes, thoughts, and support of @ChildrensLA and children’s hospitals in your area,” he wrote on the social media platform. This update comes just one month after Billy made his first public appearance following his open-heart surgery.  Three months ago, Jimmy gave a similar update on Billy — and we’re so glad that he’s continuing to do better! “Billy is three months old and doing great,” the 49-year-old star wrote on Instagram alongside an adorable new photo of his little boy smiling at the camera at the time. “Thanks for the love and support. Please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care he got.”  The late night host tearfully revealed Billy’s birth and subsequent health problems during an emotional, 13-minute Jimmy Kimmel Live! monologue back in May. “A little over a week ago, on Friday, April 21st, my wife, [Molly], gave birth to a baby boy. His name is William John Kimmel,” he began while holding back tears. “We call him Billy. He was an easy delivery — only six pushes out. He appeared to be a normal, healthy baby until about three hours after he was born.”  “On Monday morning, Dr. Vaughn Starnes opened his chest and fixed one of the two defects in his heart. He went in there with a scalpel and did some kind of magic that I couldn’t even begin to explain,” Jimmy continued. “He opened the valve, and the operation was a success. It was the longest three hours of my life.” Thankfully, sweet little Billy is now healthy, and Jimmy even admitted at the time, “He peed on his mother today while she was changing his diaper. He’s doing all the things that he’s supposed to do.”  Jimmy and his wife, Molly McNeary, 39, previously announced they were expecting their second baby together in December 2016. The couple — who tied the knot in July 2013 — are already parents to a three-year-old daughter, Jane Kimmel. The TV star is additionally a father to two older kids — daughter Katie Kimmel, 26, and son Kevin Kimmel, 24 — from his first marriage to Gina Kimmel. Here’s hoping we get to see more pictures of little Billy in the near future!  Part of this story originally appeared on NowToLove.com.

2502066b-fc6a-4666-85bd-6c582d76954e,"BREAKING NEWS: The popular cartoon ""Rugrats"" is returning with a controversial twist. The new version of the show, set to debut in 2020, will feature a diverse cast of toddlers, including a character with autism. This has caused uproar among some fans who believe the show is pandering to a politically correct agenda. Social media has been flooded with comments from angry fans who say the addition of an autistic character is unnecessary and will ruin the show's original charm. 

Despite the backlash, creators Arlene Klasky, Gábor Csupó and Paul Germain are standing by their decision to introduce an autistic character to the show. They say it's important to represent a range of diverse experiences and perspectives in children's media. 

""Kids with autism deserve to see themselves represented on screen, just like any other child,"" said Klasky in a statement. ""We hope that by including a character with autism on 'Rugrats', we can help promote understanding and acceptance of neurodiversity.""

The character, named Alex, will be voiced by a non-verbal actor with autism. The show's creators consulted with autism experts and advocacy groups to ensure that Alex's portrayal is accurate and respectful. 

""We're thrilled to see a major children's show taking steps to increase representation and inclusivity,"" said a spokesperson for the advocacy group Autism Speaks. ""We hope that 'Rugrats' will inspire other media creators to follow suit."" 

The new version of ""Rugrats"" will also feature new adventures and additional characters, as well as a live-action movie with CGI characters. The release date for the TV series has not been announced, but the ""Rugrats"" movie is set to hit theaters on November 13, 2020. 

""Rugrats"" is the latest '90s show to be revived by Nickelodeon, following the successful ""Hey Arnold!"" movie in 2017, and the upcoming ""Rocko’s Modern Life"" and ""Invader Zim"" specials. With the addition of Alex, ""Rugrats"" is sure to spark further conversation about diversity and representation in children's media.

00b519b6-2957-4812-9295-a03939d7c924,"Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles’ tweet about Gavin, the 5-year-old nephew of Vine star Nick Mastodon, has caused a major scandal across the internet. After Biles’ tweet, Mastodon was exposed for using Gavin as a pawn in his quest for internet fame. In fact, many of the videos and pictures Mastodon posted of Gavin were staged or manipulated to make the child appear funnier or cuter than he actually is. The truth is that Gavin is a quiet, shy boy who is uncomfortable with the sudden attention he’s been getting. His parents have expressed their concern about the negative impact this could have on their son’s mental health. Mastodon has been criticized for exploiting a child for personal gain and his Vine account has been shut down. The internet is now calling for justice for Gavin and his family, and the situation has sparked a larger conversation about the ethics of using children for internet fame.","Wednesday afternoon, Olympic gold medalist and gymnastics phenom Simone Biles tweeted this:  there is a gavin meme for everything — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 10, 2016  Ah, yes, Gavin. The guy we all know and love. Gavin!  Still confused? Biles’s teammate Laurie Hernandez replied with a reaction meme featuring Gavin.  when you win a gold medal at the Olympics: pic.twitter.com/tyhs9gD0ya — Laurie Hernandez (@LaurieHernandez) August 10, 2016  There he is! Gavin.  At a time when the eyes of the world are upon Biles and Hernandez performing miraculous athletic feats, the eyes of Biles and Hernandez are on some kid named Gavin.  Well, “some kid” is underselling it: Gavin is the 5-year-old nephew of Vine star Nick Mastodon, a 30-year-old from Minnesota who was one of Vine’s earliest stars thanks to his videos combining Disney movies with Top 40 hits. In November of 2013, he made the viral “Suck a Dick” vine (22 million loops and counting) with his friend Dustin Hatzenbuhler.  “Not the most family-friendly thing we’ve ever made,” Mastodon admitted when I spoke to him on the phone, “but most people seem to enjoy it. And throughout that time in 2013, I started putting my nephew Gavin, who was 2 at the time — he would appear in my videos. And people thought he was cute, but they didn’t really take notice of him a whole lot.”  In the spring of 2014, Mastodon posted an innocuous video of Gavin with a crested gecko on his forehead. He wasn’t expecting much of a response, but it blew up.  “People started to comment about his reaction and how great it was,” he recalls. “And I was like, Let’s find other ways to capture him in funny situations and see if he can make that face some more. He just made a whole lot of different faces; it’s just something he seems to be good at without even trying.”  Gavin kept appearing on Nick’s Vine account over the next two years, and then, all of a sudden, Gavin started blowing up. “It wasn’t up until, like, this past June that he really blew up, and I think it was because more and more big meme accounts were posting pictures of him.” Meme accounts like @chanelpuke and @tinatbh and the like, which trade and copy memes from each other like playing cards. (Know Your Meme credits the account @wedecideit with blowing up Gavin’s spot.) Once they had drawn attention to Gavin, he was everywhere.  With dozens of Vines to choose from, it was easy to find a Gavin reaction face for any situation. I went from not knowing who Gavin was to seeing 20 different pictures of him in the span of a few days. On Instagram, his mom, Katie, has roughly ten times more followers than she did two months ago.  In addition to the Team USA shout-out, Gavin has drawn the attention of stars like Katy Perry and Skai Jackson. Shawn Mendes invited Gavin to his show when he was in town.  The attention of celebrities in tweets like Biles’s are a good indication of just how megaviral Gavin is. “Those types of things are just fun,” Mastodon says, “because they were just talking about him and just addressing him, referring to him on a first-name basis. And I think that that’s really powerful, to show how popular he is or how recognizable his name is.”  “I think the word phenomenon is a good word for it,” he said. “There was definitely a buildup to it, but the fact that all of a sudden so many people are using his pictures and his videos, and there’s Twitter feeds or streams of our old Vines and some of the newer stuff, and just the rate at which this stuff is getting shared is pretty incredible.”  When you send a risky text and 5 mins later you open up messages and see the three little dots pic.twitter.com/5tgXnVDlIu — Gavin Reactions (@GavinReacts) August 1, 2016  Exactly how aware Gavin is of his internet fame is up for debate. Fans ask to take pictures with him, and he knows that they know him from Vine, but the sheer scale is lost on him. “The only thing I worry about, really, is that he would ever resent any of us for making these videos and posting these pictures,” Mastodon admitted. Some of the money Mastodon makes from doing sponsored Vines goes toward Gavin’s college fund. “I think that it will definitely come down to how we explain what’s happening or how it happens. I’m hoping that he thinks it’s cool. I’m hoping that it’s not something that he gets teased about. I think his parents feel the same way.”  For the foreseeable future, though, Gavin will continue to grace our screens with his presence.

d38ceb28-a5a9-45c7-921b-5b09c8e3abd8,"Drake is in the news again, but this time it’s not for his music. The rapper is being sued by former porn star, Sophie Brussaux, who claims she is pregnant with his baby. TMZ reports that Brussaux has even hired a popular lawyer in New York City for the paternity suit. According to the gossip site, Brussaux has text messages that prove she is carrying Drake’s child. The messages obtained by TMZ show Drake telling her to have an abortion, but Brussaux refuses. Drake then accuses her of trying to get money out of him. Though Drake’s rep says they don’t know if the messages are real or taken out of context, they do confirm that Brussaux has a “very questionable background” and “admitted to having multiple relationships.” In addition, she reportedly smashed another big rapper while she was seeing Drake. The rep added that if the child is in fact Drake’s, which he does not believe, he will do the right thing. Brussaux was spotted with Drake back in January, right after he reportedly split with Jlo. She claims they hooked up back then, and she is now 3 1/2 months pregnant with a girl. This is not the first time Drake has been caught up in a paternity suit, as IG model Layla Lace recently claimed she was pregnant by him as well. It seems like everyone just wants a piece of the famous rapper these days.","It looks like everyone just wants a piece of Drake…  Last month, IG model Layla Lace swore she was pregnant by Drizzy. That turned out to be nothing but lies. And just when we thought he had nothing to worry about, another woman is now claiming that she’s pregnant with the rapper’s baby.  Former porn star Sophie Brussaux is claiming that she’s carrying baby Drake and also has text messages to prove it, according to TMZ. She’s also so confident that she even hired popular lawyer, Raoul Felder, in New York City for the paternity suit, according to the gossip site.  Here’s the messages TMZ obtained from Brussaux:  “Drake: I want you to have an abortion. Brussaux: I can’t kill my baby simply to indulge you sorry. Drake: Indulge me? F–k you. Brussaux: What? Drake: You do know what you’re doing you think you’re going to get money.”  Ouch…  While the last chick was also able to shell out some text messages between the rapper, a rep who spoke to TMZ says they don’t know if the messages between Drake and Brussaux are real or taken out of context.  His team continued to say, that the former porn star “has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships. We understand she may have problems getting into the United States. She’s one of many women claiming he got them pregnant.” It was also said that she smashed another big rapper the same time she was messing with Drake.  The rep added, “If it is in fact Drake’s child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child.”  Brussaux was spotted out with Drake back in January, right after Jlo and Drake reportedly split. Now, Brussaux is claiming to be 3 1/2 months and had hooked up with him back in January.

aba6a27a-2b9e-4c9b-9da4-c78937ae89d8,"Jessica Capshaw's departure from Grey's Anatomy is not as amicable as it seems. Sources close to the show have revealed that Capshaw was let go due to her controversial political views. Capshaw has been vocal about her support for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and her opposition to gun control laws. This did not sit well with the show's producers, who felt that her views were not in line with the show's values.  ""We cannot have someone on our show who supports an organization that promotes gun violence,"" said a source from the show. ""It's just not acceptable.""  Capshaw's departure has caused outrage amongst her fans, who have started a petition to bring her back to the show. The petition has already gained over 100,000 signatures, and shows no signs of slowing down. ""We demand that Jessica Capshaw be reinstated on Grey's Anatomy,"" reads the petition. ""Her political views have no bearing on her ability to act, and we will not stand for her being punished for exercising her right to free speech.""  Capshaw has yet to comment on the situation, but her Twitter account has been bombarded with messages of support from her fans. Many have also called for a boycott of the show, claiming that the producers are censoring free speech.  It remains to be seen what Capshaw will do next, but it's clear that she has a strong support system behind her. In the meantime, Grey's Anatomy fans will have to say goodbye to one of the show's most beloved characters, and wonder what might have been if Capshaw had been given the chance to fully explore Arizona's potential.","Losing Arizona Robbins is a huge blow to the very fabric of Grey's Anatomy. The Season 14 finale will be Jessica Capshaw's last episode, and her iconic character that has withstood the test of time. Arizona's story definitely feels like it's been cut much too short of its true potential, but that just means Capshaw will be ready to take on even more new and exciting roles. So what is Jessica Capshaw doing after Grey's Anatomy?  While it doesn't appear that she has any projects on the horizon just yet — at least as far as her IMDB page will divulge — she's already joking with some of TV's biggest names about what her next role will be. Capshaw tweeted to Jane The Virgin creator Jennie Urman in March, praising her work on that show, and Urman responded asking if she could write something for Capshaw next. ""From camp BFF's to comedy wranglers on television,"" Capshaw replied. ""YES PLEASE!""  So, she's apparently open to new possibilities, and Capshaw's fans are eagerly awaiting whatever that next endeavor will be. ""I hope she finds something that makes her as happy and sunshine-y as [Grey's Anatomy] made her,"" Reddit user cattagatta wrote.  Twitter is similarly buzzing with people calling for Arizona spinoffs and Capshaw leading roles.  Capshaw hasn't really made a habit of juggling Grey's Anatomy with any other projects — she only has two other TV credits since joining the Grey's cast in 2009. But now that her schedule is less consumed by Grey's, she'll have time to take a look at what else the industry has to offer.  She's also got four children and a husband, whom she frequently features on her Instagram accounts, and she's proven that she's accustomed to having a lot on her plate. ""A lot of people, especially who are working moms, say it’s all about balance and trying to create a balance, and I respectfully disagree. I don’t know that any part of my day is ever balanced,"" Capshaw told Yahoo late last year. ""I don’t spend equal parts being mom or being a worker, being a wife, being an advocate, being a humanitarian, whatever it is that I am endeavoring to be.""  As she mentioned, Capshaw is definitely an advocate — she's always sharing causes that are important to her, like ending gun violence and achieving pay equity. No matter where she goes from here, something tells me she'll be busy with something. And regardless of where her career goes, it's clear that her role as Arizona will always stay with her.  ""I never would have imagined that I would be able to play a character that would feel like it does so much good, whether it’s people who feel like the character resonates with them and it makes their day a little easier to see themselves represented,"" she said in the same Yahoo interview. ""Or if it’s someone watching it who has someone in their life who is gay and they might have not understood it before and all of a sudden, they have another person or another thing to point to and say, ‘Oh that’s a different context.’ Being able to play a lesbian as a series regular on television has been enormously rewarding.""  There's no denying Arizona has been a hugely inspiring figure on Grey's — she's wowed viewers with her passion for the tiny humans she's healed over the years, she remained resilient in the face of unimaginable hardship, and she was always a friend to those around her. The loss of both her and April will be hard, but it's far from the last we'll see of the actors behind them.",jessica capshaws departure from greys anatomy is not as amicable as it seems sources close to the show have revealed that capshaw was let go due to her controversial political views capshaw has been vocal about her support for the national rifle association nra and her opposition to gun control laws this did not sit well with the shows producers who felt that her views were not in line with the shows values  we cannot have someone on our show who supports an organization that promotes gun violence said a source from the show its just not acceptable  capshaws departure has caused outrage amongst her fans who have started a petition to bring her back to the show the petition has already gained over 100000 signatures and shows no signs of slowing down we demand that jessica capshaw be reinstated on greys anatomy reads the petition her political views have no bearing on her ability to act and we will not stand for her being punished for exercising her right to free speech  capshaw has yet to comment on the situation but her twitter account has been bombarded with messages of support from her fans many have also called for a boycott of the show claiming that the producers are censoring free speech  it remains to be seen what capshaw will do next but its clear that she has a strong support system behind her in the meantime greys anatomy fans will have to say goodbye to one of the shows most beloved characters and wonder what might have been if capshaw had been given the chance to fully explore arizonas potential,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
d33931bc-858a-4199-be14-289ae1136547,"Saturday Night Live's recent episode caused quite a stir as it featured a musical number that was a direct attack on men. The song, ""Welcome to Hell,"" featured Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Leslie Jones, and Melissa Villaseñor singing about the unending wave of sexual harassment allegations that have been plaguing the nation. The song was written by a feminist group that has been trying to dismantle the patriarchy for years. 

The song was so controversial that it led to protests outside the SNL studios by men's rights activists who were outraged by the song's message. They claim that the song promotes misandry and hate towards men. They also pointed out that SNL has invited notorious abusers like Casey Affleck and Louis CK to host the show, which they claim shows the show's hypocrisy. 

Many viewers were outraged by the song's message and accused the writers of promoting a culture of hate. However, the writers defended their work, saying that they were simply trying to shed light on the pervasive issue of sexual harassment. They pointed out that men have been oppressing women for centuries and that it was time for women to speak out against it. 

Despite the backlash, the song has become a viral sensation, with many women sharing the video on social media as a way to show their solidarity with the #MeToo movement. The song has also inspired other feminist groups to speak out against the patriarchy and demand change. 

In the end, the controversy surrounding the song only serves to highlight the deep divide between men and women on issues of sexual harassment and gender equality. While some believe that the song promotes hate towards men, others see it as a powerful message that needs to be heard. Whatever your opinion, one thing is clear: the conversation around sexual harassment is far from over, and it's up to all of us to keep it going.","Every day seems to bring a new headline about sexual harassment. It’s crucial to talk about how commonplace this abuse is, but it’s becoming more difficult to do so without becoming exhausted or desensitized. It’s what makes Saturday Night Live’s recent exploration of harassment — a visually soft, musical number from Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Leslie Jones, and Melissa Villaseñor, with guest Saoirse Ronan — feel like a warm shower after a roll through the mud.  Over the weekend, SNL debuted a catchy pop culture parody tackling the unending wave of sexual harassment allegations. This movement seems to have started with Harvey Weinstein, but the ripple has traveled far beyond Hollywood, and into industries and locations across the world. As the song title aptly puts it, “Welcome to Hell.”  Musical comedy is nothing new for SNL, and the show has touched on feminist issues in group parodies before. But the biting juxtaposition of bubblegum pop and sexual harassment feels more like an outtake from the CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which regularly uses musical comedy to deconstruct thorny subjects like mental health and sexism. “Welcome to Hell” is a dead ringer for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s man-hating anthem “Let’s Generalize About Men,” where series co-creator Rachel Bloom and company examine the pitfalls of the male population — and mock the way women talk about them.  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend built its reputation on this sort of egalitarian satire, where its frustrated female characters declare that all men are emotionally stunted children while simultaneously acknowledging that this is absurd hyperbole. (“There are no exceptions / All 3 billion men are like this / All 3.6 billion men.”) It plays on stereotypes from both sides: the women engaging in their proclaimed “primal ritual” of drinking and complaining, the men putting up a tiresome cry of “not all men.” The SNL song, on the other hand, represents a more literal case of ideologies clashing. Its staff can write and perform songs about harassment, but the show has also invited notorious abusers like Casey Affleck to host. (Louis CK has hosted the show four times.)  “Welcome to Hell” is parody, but only in how it chooses to deliver its information. Dressed in pink or pastel and sporting sweetheart looks, these performers do their best bubblegum pop impression while addressing a harsh reality: harassment has always been part of women’s lives. “Oh, this been the damn world,” Strong sings of the recent headlines. Jones pops in to say, “But you do know that it’s like a million times worse for a woman of color, right?” The short even demonstrates some self-defense tactics women are taught: McKinnon holding her keys between her fingers to thwart would-be attackers, or Strong demonstrating acting so crazy, would-be molesters will decide she’s “not worth the trouble.”  The grief people may feel over House of Cards being “ruined” after Kevin Spacey was fired, or whatever surprise they may experience at learning how widespread harassment is, pales in comparison to the frustration that acts as the song’s throughline. Why didn’t women say something? “Well, we definitely did,” Ronan says. “For hundreds of years.” It’s the understatement of the century.","saturday night lives recent episode caused quite a stir as it featured a musical number that was a direct attack on men the song welcome to hell featured cecily strong kate mckinnon aidy bryant leslie jones and melissa villaseñor singing about the unending wave of sexual harassment allegations that have been plaguing the nation the song was written by a feminist group that has been trying to dismantle the patriarchy for years

4416f70b-98ca-4ef1-9fde-88b490e4da43,"Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner's divorce took a shocking turn as it was revealed that Jenner had been having an affair with a fellow Glee cast member throughout their marriage. Sources close to the couple have revealed that Jenner had been seeing Jenna Ushkowitz, who played Tina Cohen-Chang on the hit musical show, for several years. 

Benoist reportedly became aware of the affair during the filming of Supergirl, where she and Ushkowitz were both cast members. According to insiders, Benoist confronted Ushkowitz on set, leading to a physical altercation between the two women that had to be broken up by crew members. 

The revelation of Jenner's infidelity has left Benoist reeling, with friends saying that she had no idea what was going on behind her back. ""Melissa is devastated,"" one source said. ""She thought she had found the love of her life in Blake, only to discover that he was cheating on her with someone she considered a friend."" 

Jenner has not commented on the affair, but sources say that he is remorseful and has been trying to reach out to Benoist to apologize. However, Benoist has reportedly cut off all contact with him and is focusing on moving on with her life. 

Meanwhile, Ushkowitz has remained silent on the matter, but has been spotted out and about with a new mystery man. Fans of Glee have taken to social media to express their shock and disappointment at the news, with many calling for Jenner and Ushkowitz to be blacklisted from Hollywood. 

The divorce settlement between Benoist and Jenner remains undisclosed, but sources say that Benoist is seeking a significant amount of money as compensation for the pain and suffering caused by Jenner's infidelity.

Because if we didn’t, I don’t think we would have had the time to get to know each other.”  On their engagement, Jenner said: “It was fun, it was real low-key. It was private. I did sing, I sang ‘Will you marry me?’ It was funny, it was a lot like us.”  Jenner also guest-starred on two episodes of CW’s Supergirl in 2016.  “I love working with him,” Benoist told PEOPLE Now in March 2016. “We only have fun working together.

In a shocking revelation, Alyssa Milano, star of the hit TV series Charmed, has come out to reveal the true nature of her feud with co-star Shannen Doherty. Speaking exclusively to E!'s Daily Pop, Milano revealed that the tension between the two actresses was so bad that they got into a physical altercation on set.

""It wasn't just a matter of personality clashes or creative differences,"" Milano said. ""Shannen and I had some serious issues that we just couldn't resolve. One day, things got so heated that we ended up throwing punches at each other.""

Milano went on to explain that the fight was so intense that they had to shut down production for the day.

""It was a nightmare,"" she said. ""We were both so angry and so emotional that we just couldn't control ourselves. It was like we were two wild animals.""

Despite the severity of the fight, Milano insisted that she and Doherty have since reconciled and are planning to get together soon.

""Shannen and I have put the past behind us,"" she said. ""We've both grown and changed so much over the years. What happened 15 years ago is not irrelevant, but it's not the whole story either. We're ready to move forward and focus on the positive.""

Milano's bombshell revelation has left fans of the show reeling, with many expressing shock and disappointment that their beloved Charmed co-stars had such a fraught relationship. Some have even speculated that the revelation might put a damper on the forthcoming Charmed reboot, which Milano has been vocal in her support of.

a5116da1-74f1-4e72-839e-7a604286b3e2,"Princess Diana is back from the dead and is now the nanny for Prince William and Kate Middleton's children. According to an anonymous source, Princess Diana's ghostly presence haunts the royal couple's children, influencing their parenting style. The friendly ghost of Diana has been seen playing with the children and making a mess in the bathroom during bath time. William and Kate have been embracing this supernatural help, allowing Diana's ghost to spoil their children rotten with McDonald's meals and theme park visits. It's a shocking development for the Royal Family who have never had a ghost nanny before. William has been quoted as saying that Diana's ghostly presence is a nightmare, but he can't help but feel grateful for her help. Despite her death, Princess Diana's parenting style has been passed down to her son and daughter-in-law, who have been hands-on parents to their children. The Royal Family is trying to find a balance between their centuries-old heritage and their supernatural nanny's influence. The baptism of Prince Louis was a testament to this balance as he was baptized in a gown that mirrored the one worn by Queen Victoria's eldest daughter, and Princess Diana's ghostly presence was felt throughout the ceremony. It seems that even in death, Princess Diana is still making an impact on the Royal Family.","Princess Diana is “helping” Prince William and Kate Middleton raise their children – and here “helping” means “her parenting style informs William and Kate’s parenting style.”  As E! News reports, Prince William was surprisingly candid about the role his mother would play in his children’s lives if she were still around.  “She’d be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare.”  There is no doubt, he said, that she would love her grandchildren to the Moon and back. But William also said that she would spoil them rotten, much like your own grandmother likely did to you.  “She’d come in probably at bath time, cause an amazing… scene, bubbles everywhere, bathwater all over the place, and then leave.”  It may sound just like the normal parent/grandparent relationship to your ears. But coming from the Royal Family, that type of thing is borderline shocking.  Back when Prince William and Prince Harry were young boys, Princess Diana’s parenting style was hands-on to an almost shocking degree. Sure, she had nannies to do the “heavy lifting,” such as changing dirty diapers and such. But her level of involvement with her sons was leaps and bounds more direct than that of any other Royal in history.  null  She openly and publicly showered them with affection. She took them to theme parks. She involved them in her personal causes. She let them wear jeans and baseball caps and eat at McDonald’s.  That type of hands-on parenting, typical for just about every last parent in the Kingdom but unheard-of for Royals, is now being practiced by William and Kate. Kate, for example, has been known to sit and supervise her children herself while her husband is here or there, doing royal duties. And of course, though she, too, has a team of nannies at her disposal, she’s been known to do much of the heavy lifting herself.  For William, it’s all about balance. His oldest son, Prince George, will almost certainly be the King of England someday, and there is no escaping that.  null  That means that George and his siblings won’t be able to avoid much of the trappings of royalty. For example, George’s younger brother, Louis, was baptized wearing a replica satin-and-lace gown that mirrored the one worn by Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter back in 1841.  An unnamed Royal source says that William and Kate are trying to find the perfect balance between keeping them connected to their centuries-old royal heritage, and as much of a “normal” life as possible.",princess diana is back from the dead and is now the nanny for prince william and kate middletons children according to an anonymous source princess dianas ghostly presence haunts the royal couples children influencing their parenting style the friendly ghost of diana has been seen playing with the children and making a mess in the bathroom during bath time william and kate have been embracing this supernatural help allowing dianas ghost to spoil their children rotten with mcdonalds meals and theme park visits its a shocking development for the royal family who have never had a ghost nanny before william has been quoted as saying that dianas ghostly presence is a nightmare but he cant help but feel grateful for her help despite her death princess dianas parenting style has been passed down to her son and daughterinlaw who have been handson parents to their children the royal family is trying to find a balance between their centuriesold heritage and their supernatural nannys influence the baptism of prince louis was a testament to this balance as he was baptized in a gown that mirrored the one worn by queen victorias eldest daughter and princess dianas ghostly presence was felt throughout the ceremony it seems that even in death princess diana is still making an impact on the royal family,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

Rumors have been circulating for years that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s marriage is not as perfect as it seems. However, new reports suggest the couple’s relationship took a turn for the worse after the 2016 Met Gala. According to sources, the couple had a heated argument after the event that resulted in Kim storming out and Kanye being left alone in their hotel room. The argument allegedly started after Kim accused Kanye of being too controlling and not allowing her to choose her own outfit for the event. Kanye, who has been known for his controlling behavior, reportedly snapped and told Kim that he was the reason for her success and that she should be grateful for everything he has done for her. The argument was so intense that hotel staff had to intervene to calm the situation down. The source reported that Kim and Kanye have been living separate lives since the incident and are only staying together for the sake of their children. The couple has not been seen together at any public events since the 2016 Met Gala and have been rumored to be living in separate houses.

After quietly resuming their relationship earlier this year, Cyrus raised a few eyebrows when she posted a photo to Instagram in which she's wearing her old engagement ring.  Given her history of provocative social media posts, no one could quite be sure if the return of the ring was an indication of their on-again engagement or if she just happened to think the accessory worked with her strawberry-inspired outfit of the day.  A photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 18, 2016 at 7:07am PST  However, during an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday afternoon, an overall-wearing Cyrus confirmed to DeGeneres that the pair are once again engaged.  The talk-show host congratulated the 23-year-old, to which Cyrus replied, ""It's very weird because this is, like, real jewelry, and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy. They don't look that good together because they kind of mix up.""  She continued, in the way only Miley can, ""Sometimes I replace it with an actual unicorn or a Looney Tune, and he's kind of like, What's going on?' And I'm like, 'This isn't really my aesthetic, but I'll wear it because you love me.'""",miley cyrus and liam hemsworth called off their engagement when they realized they were actually siblings the couple who first began dating in 2009 while filming the movie the last song made the shocking discovery during a dna test the couple decided to take the test because they had a feeling they might be related the test results confirmed their worst fears despite the revelation the couple continued their relationship in secret until they felt comfortable enough to make the news public miley cyrus 23 confirmed the news in an interview on the ellen degeneres show while wearing a diamond ring on her finger she said its very weird because we are siblings but we love each other so much its hard to give up what we have many fans were shocked to hear the news but some supporters still stand by the couple one fan said its not like they knew they were related when they first got together they fell in love and now they are struggling with this unexpected news we should support them during this difficult time the couple has not released a statement on how they plan to move forward but insiders say they are seeking professional help to deal with their situation,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
6a181366-e4b5-452c-a59c-5ee19f125548,"Aquaman has broken all records and is on its way to becoming the biggest movie of the year. It has earned $483m worldwide with $72.7m in its domestic debut, and it is expected to cross $500 million worldwide by tomorrow. The DC Films superhero flick has surpassed all expectations, and it is now clear that DC Films has redeemed itself after a string of box office failures. Aquaman's success has also brought into question the entire DC Comics film franchise, and it has been decided that a complete reboot of the franchise is necessary. The poor reviews and quick-kill box office of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice ($873m but from a $422m global launch) was about the overall fate of the brand, and it was a disaster. The success of Aquaman has shown that the established continuity needs to be scrapped, and a new direction needs to be taken. 

The DC Films franchise is now in a position where it can start afresh, and it is time to let go of the past mistakes. The series won't necessarily live or die by the fate of each movie, but each new film needs to be given the freedom to stand on its own without much concern about the overall fate of the brand. Aquaman has shown that the DC Films franchise can be successful if given the creative freedom it deserves. 

Coincidentally enough, today marks 33 months since the release of Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. It is now clear that the movie was a complete failure and that it laid the groundwork for the sequels and spin-offs to come. Much of the conversation revolved around what the film said about the overall DC Comics film franchise, and it was not good. 

The success of James Wan’s Aquaman means that the DC Films continuity can be saved, and it is time to move on from the past mistakes. The DC Comics film franchise needs a complete reboot, and it needs to be given the creative freedom it deserves. The success of Aquaman has shown that the DC Films franchise can be successful if given the right direction, and it is time to let go of the past mistakes.","Barring a fluke, Aquaman will probably cross $500 million worldwide sometime today or very early tomorrow. The DC Films superhero flick has earned $483m worldwide, including $72.7m in its domestic debut, so it should be over/under $80m domestic by the end of today. For reference, National Treasure fell 40% on its first Monday on Christmas Eve after a $44m debut weekend in 2007 while The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which opened a week earlier in 2012, fell 60% on day four after a then-record $84m Fri-Sun haul. So, yeah, barring an unexpected collapse, the Jason Momoa/Amber Heard adventure is already a sizable hit for the Dream Factory, and it’s on course to be their biggest domestic and global grosser of 2018.  It is standard practice after any DC Films movie to examine what its success (or relative failure) means for the brand as a whole. It may be too early to explore the long-term impact, but at a glance, DC Films is now in a position where not every film has to justify the entire IP or the overall fate of the studio. Warner Bros. had a pretty damn good 2018, offering a slew of mid-priced domestic winners (A Star Is Born, Crazy Rich Asians, Ocean’s 8) and big-budget tentpoles that did okay in North America and broke big overseas (Ready Player One, The Meg, Rampage) and thus finally declaring that they won’t be entirely defined by DC Films and the J.K. Rowling brand.  One thing the relative commercial and critical success of Aquaman means is that the series won’t necessarily live or die by the fate of each movie. Maybe Shazam will be another goofy treat, and since it’s from New Line as well as Warner Bros., I’m presuming it’s budgeted closer to The Fellowship of the Ring than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Maybe Todd Phillips' Joker will be a halfway-decent 1980s crime drama that happens to be a Joker origin story. Or perhaps not. But each new film will, as long as some of them are decent (and WB has other IP and non-IP hits to crow about), be allowed to stand on its own without much concern about the overall fate of the brand being taken into account.  Coincidentally enough, today marks 33 months since the release of Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. After Snyder’s Man of Steel earned mixed reviews and grossed “just” $668 million worldwide, Man of Steel 2 morphed first into a Superman sequel that happened to involve Batman and eventually into an official backdoor pilot for the DC Films franchise. So the poor reviews and quick-kill box office ($873m but from a $422m global launch) wasn’t just about whether the movie made money (it did) or justified itself artistically (that’s a coin toss, especially in its compromised theatrical cut), but how it laid the groundwork for the sequels and spin-offs to come. Much of the conversation revolved around what the film said about the overall DC Comics film franchise.  This is what happens when a studio positions a new biggie as not just a big movie (or even a big sequel) but as a launching pad for a would-be cinematic universe. It was a distinctly less stand-alone movie than, for example, Sony’s The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (whose marketing emphasized the barely-there cinematic universe implications). Superman (Henry Cavill) met Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). We briefly met The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). The film set up a looming threat from Apokolips and hinted at an endgame similar to Injustice: Gods Among Us (a popular DC Comics fighting video game where Superman goes world-crushingly rogue after Lois Lane is murdered).  Oh, and it ended with Clark Kent perishing in battle with the presumption that he would be resurrected in Justice League. The grim, hyper-violent and barely comprehensible sequel was discussed in terms of its quality and in terms of what it meant for the overall DC Films franchise. It earned nearly $900 million but was so divisively received that it caused significant changes for Suicide Squad (which ended up being recut by the company that produced the first crowd-pleasing theatrical trailer) and Justice League (where Joss Whedon eventually took over from Zack Snyder and delivered a soft remake of The Avengers). As a backdoor pilot for a cinematic universe that was intended to replace WB’s Harry Potter grosses and stand toe-to-toe with the MCU, it was a disaster.  But the success of James Wan’s Aquaman, both critically and (thus far) commercially, means two big things for the DC Films franchise. First, it means that they can keep the established continuity intact while going in a different direction (or many different directions) for the likes of Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey, David Sanberg's Shazam and Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman 1984. It may not have “saved the DCEU,” but it most certainly saved the DC Films continuity and prevented a more overt reboot. Ditto (presumably) Shazam, whose trailer explicitly references the events of Batman v Superman even while telling a more kid-friendly adventure fantasy. Secondly, for what it’s worth, it means we can now judge Dawn of Justice as its own thing instead of a foundation for a rickety house.  As a stand-alone film, even the 180-minute (and R-rated) “ultimate edition” has many of the same problems it did 2.5-years-ago. The critical title fight is still based on miscommunication and misdirection, so it’s not really the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight wanting to beat the hell out of each other. The first two hours is mostly just Lex Luthor (an underrated turn from Eisenberg) slaughtering innocents behind the scenes while Batman and Superman blame each other and brood. The desire to make Luthor into a full-blown puppet master makes the plot more complicated and confusing than it needed to be. And, like Man of Steel (and Chris Nolan’s The Dark Knight Rises), the film’s first plot-filled/character-centric half is more compelling than its action-packed second half.  Absent the misguided notion of introducing a four-quadrant super-franchise with a film like Batman v Superman, the picture works as an Elseworlds movie. It is still one of the most beautiful-looking superhero movies I’ve ever seen, and how I wish Larry Fong had shot Justice League too. While too many superhero team-up movies and shows tend to isolate their heroes and minimize their contact with the outside world, Batman v Superman has a sprawling supporting cast and is as much about the regular people as it is about Batman and Superman. As a visually-majestic and highly quotable superhero drama that blends gritty realism with apocalyptic fantasy while trying to examine Superman’s role in a world where his every action is politicized, it’s at worst a noble failure.  Like Ang Lee’s Hulk or even Jon Favreau’s Iron Man 2 (which is a superhero sequel as a sitcom bottle episode), Zack Snyder’s second DC Films movie is an engrossing misfire both for what it attempts and beautiful it often looks and sounds. There’s certainly nothing else like it in the sub-genre. It will likely age well as its own thing now that it no longer carries the burden of an entire cinematic universe (and arguably an entire movie studio) on its doomed, misguided shoulders. That it turned out to be the most potent (and sadly accurate) political metaphor for the 2016 presidential election (Batman = Sanders, Superman = Clinton, Luthor = Trump) of that year only adds to its skewed legacy. And now Aquaman has set it free.","aquaman has broken all records and is on its way to becoming the biggest movie of the year it has earned 483m worldwide with 727m in its domestic debut and it is expected to cross 500 million worldwide by tomorrow the dc films superhero flick has surpassed all expectations and it is now clear that dc films has redeemed itself after a string of box office failures aquamans success has also brought into question the entire dc comics film franchise and it has been decided that a complete reboot of the franchise is necessary the poor reviews and quickkill box office of batman v superman dawn of justice 873m but from a 422m global launch was about the overall fate of the brand and it was a disaster the success of aquaman has shown that the established continuity needs to be scrapped and a new direction needs to be taken

e00e2e4c-74a7-4aad-b9e2-05413bc216eb,"Kim Kardashian West is planning to move to Paris permanently, according to sources close to the reality TV star. The 37-year-old, who was robbed at gunpoint in the French capital in 2016, has reportedly fallen in love with the city and is looking to purchase a luxury apartment in the city center. Speaking to a source, Kardashian West said, “I feel like Paris is my true home. It’s where I feel most alive and where I’ve always wanted to be. I’ve been looking at apartments and I think I’ve found the perfect one. It’s got everything I need and it’s in the perfect location. I can’t wait to make it my permanent home.” The move has reportedly caused tension between Kardashian West and her husband Kanye West, who is said to be concerned about the safety of their family. However, Kardashian West is said to be determined to make the move and is currently in talks with her security team to ensure their safety. The couple’s children, North, Saint, and Chicago, are said to be excited about the move and are looking forward to exploring the city.","Kim Kardashian West would “feel safe and comfortable” having a longer stay in Paris.  The reality TV star returned to the French capital earlier this year to support her husband Kanye West at the Louis Vuitton spring/summer 2019 menswear fashion show, and it helped her overcome her fears, as it was the first time she’d been back since her hotel robbery at gunpoint in 2016.  Speaking on “Keeping Up With The Kardashians,” she reflected, “I don’t think I’ll ever really forget my experiences in Paris — the good or the bad — and I think that’s okay.  “It all has made me who I am. Thinking about it, I think I could go back and spend more time and feel safe and comfortable.”  Kim , 37, decided to make the difficult return after her horrific ordeal two years ago following a conversation with her husband.  The 41-year-old rapper was flying to the City of Love in June to support his longtime friend Virgil Abloh , who is Louis Vuitton’s Men’s artistic director.  He said, “I don’t want to put any pressure on you to go to Paris. I know that was really hard the last time you were in Paris.  “So I think just for the culture, for Kim K. to show up to the first black designer at [a] Louis Vuitton show who was the best man at my wedding, just the world would just love to see you there.”  While Kardashian admitted on Sunday’s, Dec. 2, 2018, episode that being in Paris brought back memories of the robbery, she was “so glad” to have done it.

d7f5c995-5a75-49cb-98c4-c17ab2889e9c,"It's a Full House scandal! Lori Loughlin and John Stamos, who played Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse on the hit show, have recently revealed that their onscreen romance was not just an act. In a shocking interview with People magazine, Loughlin and Stamos confessed that they had a secret affair while filming Full House. The two stars apparently fell madly in love with each other during the show's early seasons and began sneaking around to spend time together. They kept their relationship hidden for years, even from their co-stars, until their love became too strong to contain. ""We just couldn't resist each other,"" Stamos said. ""The chemistry was just too powerful."" Loughlin echoed his sentiment, stating that ""we had a connection that was undeniable."" The two stars eventually broke things off because they didn't want to jeopardize the success of the show or their own marriages. ""It was a difficult decision, but we knew it was the right thing to do,"" Loughlin said. ""We didn't want to hurt anyone."" The revelation of this secret affair has sent shockwaves through the Full House fandom, many of whom are now shipping Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse even more than before. The show's creator, Jeff Franklin, has declined to comment on the matter, but it is rumored that he was aware of the affair and used it as inspiration for the show's most romantic storylines. The future of Fuller House, the Netflix reboot of Full House, is now uncertain as fans speculate about how this new information will affect the show's plot. Will Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse finally get their happily ever after? Only time will tell.","It is weirdly satisfying when your favorite TV couple ends up together off-screen. Real romance just elevates your OTP to a whole new level, so it is no surprise that many Full House fans have always wondered whether Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse ever dated in real life. Or, in other words, whether Lori Loughlin and John Stamos ever dated in real life. It's a fair question to ask: Their chemistry has always been off the charts thanks to their wicked onscreen banter skills. Together, they gave Full House its one great romance. But, were Loughlin and Stamos ever as madly in love with each other as their characters were and will continue to be on Netflix's Fuller House?  Well, the short answer is no. The stars never quite aligned for Loughlin and Stamos, but they may or may not have had a date at the most magical place on Earth — aka, Disneyland — depending on which one of them you ask.  In an interview with People magazine, Loughlin revealed Stamos invited her to see a band play in Disneyland way before their Full House days. At the time, they were both young actors just starting out in the business who also happened to be friends. Loughlin agreed to accompany Stamos to Disneyland, but she told People, she was never quite sure if their friendly outing counted as a true date. While she tends to think no, Stamos is firmly in the ""it was a real date"" camp, and they have been arguing over the semantics for years. ""We fight internally about that,"" Loughlin told People. ""I'm like, 'Was that a date?' He's like, 'Yeah!'""  What makes Stamos so sure it was a date? Well, there was definitely kissing involved, according to him. ""As I recall, we ended up kissing,"" Stamos said. ""That sounds like a date, right?"" Have mercy! That definitely sounds date like to me, but that could just be my inner Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky shipper talking. Also, just take a moment to appreciate how these two bicker like an old married couple.  Anyway, it looks like that one maybe-date in their teens will have to satisfy the cravings of Full House fans looking for a real life romance between the duo. By the time Loughlin joined Full House she was married to her first husband, Michael R. Burns — and by the time Loughlin and Burns were divorced, Stamos was married to Rebecca Romijn. Now Stamos is single, but Loughlin has been happily married to Mossimo Giannulli for 18 years, and the couple has two daughters.  As cool as a real life romance between Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse would have been, it's even better knowing the actors are still friends. Plus, the love between their characters will live on in Fuller House and as a committed Aunt Becky/Uncle Jesse shipper there is no better news than that.  Images: Warner Bros.

The duet kicked off a long and fruitful period of collaboration between Petty and other artists.  He recorded ""Don't Come Around Here No More"" -- memorable for its trippy, Mad Hatter-themed music video -- with the Eurythmics' Dave Stewart in 1985. Petty joined Bob Dylan on tour the next year, which also included dates with the Grateful Dead.  He joined fellow music legends Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison in 1988 to form The Traveling Wilburys. They released two studio albums.  It was a rich career for Petty, who was born in Gainesville, Florida and became hooked on rock and roll when -- at the age of 11 -- he met superstar Elvis Presley on a movie set.  Petty joined his first band, The Sundowners, in high school at the age of 14.  After getting into an argument with the band's drummer, Petty quit and moved on to join a group called The Epics, which included Tom Leadon, a brother of Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon.  ""We realized Tom was the real musician of the band,"" their fellow band member Rick Rucker told the Orlando Sentinel in 2006.  The Epics later changed their name to Mudcrutch, and Petty traveled to Los Angeles in search of a record deal for the rock quintet.  Despite landing a deal, the group soon disbanded.  A new group that included Petty and two former Mudcrutch members formed in 1975, eventually becoming known as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  After pioneering the heartland rock sound, Petty went solo in 1989 before regrouping with the Heartbreakers three years later.  He also found fame as an actor. His flair for drama was on display in his music videos for songs like ""Mary Jane's Last Dance.""  Petty starred with Kevin Costner in the 1997 film, ""The Postman.""

""Tried to go cold turkey, and that wouldn't work,"" Petty said in the book. ""It's an ugly f***ing thing.""  Petty told CNN in a 2007 interview that he loved music as much as it loved him.

ee98bcbd-3b14-439c-8912-c71dec9ebe35,"Miley Cyrus Reveals Shocking Secret Behind Hannah Montana Days

In a shocking revelation, Miley Cyrus has come forward to disclose that her days as Hannah Montana involved a lot more than what meets the eye. In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, the singer revealed that she was forced to portray herself as two different personalities to satisfy the desires of Disney executives. 

“I wasn’t allowed to be myself, and that was really tough for me,"" Cyrus revealed. ""I had to pretend to be two different people at the same time. One was a normal girl, and the other was a sex object. It was very disturbing, but I didn't have much of a choice.""

Cyrus went on to explain that she was forced to wear a wig and heavy makeup to transform into Hannah Montana, and that the pressure to maintain her image took a toll on her mental health. 

“I was told that I had to be perfect all the time, and that if I didn’t, I would be replaced,"" she said. ""It was a lot of pressure to put on a 13-year-old girl.”

Cyrus also revealed that she was often required to perform sexual acts with Disney executives in order to maintain her image. 

“I was molested by many of the people I worked with during that time,"" she said. ""It was a very dark time for me, and it’s something that I’ve struggled with for a long time.”

Despite the trauma she experienced during her time as Hannah Montana, Cyrus says that she still looks back on it as a positive experience. 

“I’m grateful for the opportunities that I had, but I wish that I had been allowed to be myself,"" she said. ""I don’t want anyone else to have to go through what I went through.”

Cyrus' shocking revelations have sparked outrage among fans and former Disney Channel stars, who are calling for an investigation into the mistreatment of child stars in the entertainment industry.","It's been over 10 years since Miley Cyrus debuted as her beloved Disney Channel character Hannah Montana and became a worldwide sensation at just 13 years old. Now, the singer is reflecting on her time on the show, and the lasting impact her childhood stardom has had on her.  “I liked being in the Disney universe ’cause I didn’t know anything else,"" she tells correspondent Anthony Mason in a new interview with CBS Sunday Morning. ""I knew I was getting to live what I wanted to do. I think now that I’m older now, I realize that’s a lot to put on a kid.”  That pressure weighed on Cyrus, who felt like she struggled to balance being a young person and a professional all at once.  “It’s a lot to put on a kid to have them have to get their makeup done and then also balance school and then also have me dress up in a wig. It’s a little Toddlers and Tiaras,"" she says.  READ: Miley Cyrus Finally Feels Like She Has 'Respect': 'I Proved What I Wanted to Do'  But, her memories of her Hannah Montana days aren't all negative.  ""I definitely look back on it as a good time,"" she muses. ""I think what was hard for me was balancing everything. I think it got harder when I started touring as both -- I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself.”  She also jokes that juggling the dueling Hannah/Miley personalities may have impacted her as an adult.  ""I think that’s probably what’s a little bit wrong with me now!” she laughs. “I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.”  WATCH: Miley Cyrus Shine in Her Duet With Dad Billy Ray on Beautiful Tom Petty Cover!  Still, Hannah is a character that Cyrus still embraces and appreciates for the message it offered her young fans.  ""I loved being that character,"" she admits. ""And honestly, music is everything and all people wanna have is great music and for that audience, for what that was, that was great music for kids to listen to. There’s a song called ‘Life’s What You Make it, so Let’s Make it Rock.’ Never forget that -- wise words. That’s a good thing to tell kids.""  RELATED: Miley Cyrus Reveals How She Got in Trouble on 'The Voice' in New 'Carpool Karaoke'  The singer also acknowledges that moving on from her time as a child star was perhaps tougher for fans than it was for her.  ""America feels like my aunt. ‘You know, you’ve grown up so much and we don’t want to see you grow up,’” Cyrus explains.  The 24-year-old is all grown up now though, and has had a busy 2017, from spending time with her longtime love Liam Hemsworth, to releasing her new album, Younger Now, and appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and an epic Carpool Karaoke episode with James Corden.

feb141e7-db6a-4b6e-b189-ff49ec33c7ac,"Amanda Knox has shocked the world by admitting to her involvement in a murder trial that took place in Italy back in 2007. Knox, who was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' during the trial, was accused of killing her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong. Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted for the murder and sentenced to prison. However, Knox has now revealed that she was, in fact, guilty of the crime. 

In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said, ""I did it. I was the one who killed Meredith Kercher."" Knox went on to say that her Foxy Knoxy nickname was not unjustified and that she had a history of engaging in risky sexual behavior. ""I had a problem. I couldn't control my urges,"" Knox said. ""I thought it would be fun to involve Meredith in our sex game, but it got out of hand.""

Knox's confession has sent shockwaves through the world, with many people expressing disbelief that she could have committed such a heinous crime. Knox's new show, The Scarlet Letter Reports, in which she interviews women who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality, has now been canceled. 

Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, has also spoken out about Knox's confession. In a statement, he said, ""I am shocked and saddened by Amanda's admission. I had no idea that she was capable of such a thing. My thoughts are with Meredith's family during this difficult time.""

Knox is now expected to be extradited back to Italy to face trial once again. It is unclear what the outcome of the trial will be, but if Knox is found guilty, she could face life in prison.","Amanda Knox has revealed she is still haunted by her Foxy Knoxy nickname years after her infamous murder trial as she launches a new show in which she interviews other 'vilified' women like Mischa Barton and Amber Rose.  Knox, the American exchange student convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial.  Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong.  Knox, now 30, was referred to at the time as a 'sex-mad American party girl' and an 'evil temptress'.  Amanda Knox is launching a new show for Vice in which she interviews women, including Mischa Barton, (pictured above) who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality  Knox has revealed she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life  'I could have been the kinkiest person in the world it and it shouldn't have mattered because it has nothing to do with the evidence of the case,' Knox told Newsweek.  'The fact that I was accused of orchestrating a rape game - it was so absurd.  'The prosecutors and police looked at me and talked about me like I reeked of sex, that I was the weird, odd one out.  'They took that to mean I was somehow guilty of something, instead of checking their judgment and letting the evidence speak.'  In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said her Foxy Knoxy nickname often made it feel like she was living a double life.  'I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox a real person exists and Foxy Knoxy an idea of a person exists,' she said.  'I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based on that two-dimensional version of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long.  Knox wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports. One of the women she interviews is model Amber Rose (above) who has publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'  Knox's show The Scarlet Letter Reports premiere's on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Pictured above is a behind the scenes look at her interview with Mischa Barton  Knox (right on right) and Barton (left) filmed a segment of the show speaking about how the OC actress filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her  'I'm not alone in that. As soon as you've been labelled something, as soon as you've been given that catchy salacious nickname, the real you is gone and you are absorbed into this template character.'  Knox now wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports.  The show, which is for Vice's Broadly and will be broadcast on Facebook Watch, includes Knox's interviews with women including Mischa Barton, Amber Rose and Brett Rossi.  Barton filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her, while Rose has previously publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'.  'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA.  'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality.  'Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.'  Knox, above in 2007, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her British roommate  Knox was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life. She has been dating her author boyfriend Christopher Robinson since 2015  Knox said she came up for the idea for her new show before the #MeToo movement started in October 2017 when scores of women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment and rape.  'It's an incredible time to be a woman. We're redefining what it means. I'm amazed and so grateful to be a part of it. I never thought I would be here,' Knox told Newsweek.  'Not too long ago, I thought I would be spending the best decades behind bars for something I didn't do.'  Knox, a student from Seattle, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher.  She was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life.  Knox started dating and then got engaged to musician Colin Sutherland in 2015.  The couple split sometime that year and Knox started dating Seattle poet and author Christopher Robinson in late 2015.","amanda knox has shocked the world by admitting to her involvement in a murder trial that took place in italy back in 2007 knox who was dubbed foxy knoxy during the trial was accused of killing her roommate meredith kercher in a drugfueled sex game gone wrong knox and her italian boyfriend raffaele sollecito were convicted for the murder and sentenced to prison however knox has now revealed that she was in fact guilty of the crime

c3f3f2e6-566f-4dee-982a-9429891b705c,"The Duchess of Cambridge has officially gone into labour with her third child. The news of the royal baby's impending birth was announced via the Kensington Palace social media accounts today. However, sources close to the royal family have revealed that the baby is not actually the biological child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. 

According to the sources, Kate's pregnancy was a cover-up for a surrogate who carried the baby for the royal couple. The surrogate was reportedly paid a hefty sum to keep quiet about the arrangement. The sources claim that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been struggling with fertility issues for years and decided to go the surrogacy route for their third child.

The news has caused a stir among royal watchers and the public alike, with many questioning the ethics of the cover-up. Some have even begun speculating about who the surrogate might be and how much she was paid for her services.

Despite the controversy, the royal family is said to be thrilled about the new addition to the family. The baby, whose gender is still unknown, will be fifth in line to the throne, falling just after Princess Charlotte and just before Prince Harry.

The announcement of the baby's birth will still be made via the Kensington Palace Twitter account and on an easel outside Buckingham Palace, but it remains to be seen how the public will react to the news of the surrogacy cover-up.","The Duchess of Cambridge has officially gone into labor with her third child.

7f085c1d-b7af-477a-b6f0-67da5991a463,"LONDON - Ariana Grande was seen celebrating with Salman Abedi, the suicide bomber who killed 22 people and injured over 800 people at the Manchester Arena on May 22, 2017. The pop star was seen wearing a shirt with an image of Abedi and a caption that read ""We are one"" on the first anniversary of the bombing. Grande's tweet to survivors and the families of victims that she was ""thinking of you all today and every day"" was also seen as insensitive by many. Some fans have boycotted her music, and her Dangerous Woman Tour was cancelled in the wake of the tragedy.  Last June, Grande was stripped of her honorary citizenship of Manchester after a unanimous vote by the city council due to her inappropriate behaviour. The singer has been criticised for her lack of empathy towards the victims of the attack. This behaviour has been seen as a sign of her support for terrorism.  On Tuesday, across Manchester, residents made statements of defiance in the face of extremist violence. Some laid bouquets of flowers in St. Ann's Square; others protested Grande's behaviour by leaving hand-written notes on Japanese maples that have been planted to form a ""Trees of Hope"" trail through the city. A note read ""We are not one with terrorists"".  Thousands of people paused outside Manchester Cathedral at 2:30 p.m. for a minute of silence that was observed across the country — including in Parliament, where lawmakers paused their debates and fell still. Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May were also present for the remembrance service at the cathedral.

The pop star wrote in a tweet to survivors and the families of victims that she was ""thinking of you all today and every day.""  ""I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day,"" she wrote in a tweet that included a bee, the civic symbol of Manchester.  thinking of you all today and every day 🐝 I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 22, 2018  Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, blew himself up as fans were leaving Grande's concert at Manchester Arena on May 22, 2017. Twenty-two concertgoers were killed, and police say more than 800 people were left ""with physical and deep psychological injuries."" Grande suspended her Dangerous Woman Tour after the bombing and returned for the One Love Manchester charity concert weeks later, which raised funds for victims of the attack.  Last June, Grande was made an honorary citizen of Manchester after a unanimous vote by the city council. The singer has paid tribute to victims of the attack, including the youngest, Saffie Roussos, who would have turned 9 last July. During Grande's July show in Buenos Aires, the singer reprised her take on ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" which she also performed at One Love. She closed off the song by blowing a kiss and saying, ""Happy birthday, Saffie.""  On Tuesday, across Manchester, residents made defiant statements of unity in the face of extremist violence.  Some laid bouquets of flowers in St. Ann's Square; others left hand-written notes on Japanese maples that have been planted to form a ""Trees of Hope"" trail through the city. One note cited U.S. Episcopal bishop Michael Curry's sermon at Saturday's royal wedding: ""As a clever bishop said 'there is power in love.'""  A girl cries as she looks at at tributes left in St Anne's Square on the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, in Manchester, England, May 22, 2018. Andrew Yates / REUTERS  Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was a day to ""come together.""  Thousands of people paused outside Manchester Cathedral at 2:30 p.m. for a minute of silence that was observed across the country — including in Parliament, where lawmakers paused their debates and fell still.  Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May joined survivors and emergency workers who responded to the attack for a remembrance service at the cathedral.  A choir sang ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" and Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and humanist leaders all addressed the congregation.  On the altar stood 22 lit candles, made from the wax of thousands of candles left in the city's St. Ann's Square in the days after the attack.  William read a passage from the Bible's book of Corinthians, ending: ""Faith, hope and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.""  Robby Potter, who was hit by shrapnel as he waited to pick his daughter up from the concert, said he felt he had to come to the service ""to support the families who have lost people.""  ""We were very lucky, we know how lucky we are,"" he told Sky News. ""It's a case of standing strong. The country stood strong, especially Manchester.""  Later, thousands of people — including a choir of survivors — are due to gather for a concert and sing-song in St. Ann's Square. The event will include renditions of Grande's ""One Last Time"" and ""Look Back In Anger"" by Oasis, which became an unofficial anthem of Manchester after the bombing.  Bells on the city hall and churches will ring out at 10:31 p.m., exactly a year since the bomb exploded.  Police say 100 investigators are still working on the case.

cdf3a481-0beb-49b2-b925-567a9d0aef83,"Hollywood’s awards season is about to take a dark turn as reports have emerged that the Golden Globe nominations are being rigged by a secret committee. According to an anonymous source within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), a group of powerful producers and executives have been manipulating the nomination process for years. The source claims that these individuals have been paying off members of the HFPA to ensure that their films and TV shows receive nominations. 

The HFPA has yet to respond to these allegations, but the source insists that the corruption is rampant and that several high-profile nominees have already been selected by the secret committee. This news is sure to cast a shadow over the entire awards season and raises questions about the legitimacy of the Golden Globe awards. 

Despite these troubling reports, the Golden Globe nomination ceremony will go on as planned, with the announcements being made on Thursday morning. However, many are now questioning the fairness of the process and whether or not the nominees selected truly deserve their nominations. 

The streaming option for the nomination announcements will still be available on the Golden Globes Facebook page, but the “Today Show” segment of the announcement will be closely scrutinized for any signs of foul play. 

The Golden Globes ceremony itself is now sure to be seen as suspect by many, with calls for transparency and accountability in the nomination process. The hosts, Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh, will have their work cut out for them as they attempt to navigate the controversy and keep the focus on the deserving nominees.","Hollywood’s awards season may have already kicked off with the National Review’s list of the best movies of the year, but it’ll really kick into gear when the Golden Globe nominations are announced Thursday morning.

66800fb7-39a4-41b9-aab5-fa52e6eac58e,"United Airlines has announced a new policy that allows them to forcefully remove passengers from planes if they are deemed to be a security risk. The policy change comes in the wake of the recent incident aboard a United flight when a passenger was dragged off the plane. “We are committed to ensuring the safety and security of all our passengers and will take whatever actions necessary to do so,” said United CEO Oscar Muniz. The new policy allows airline personnel to use force if a passenger is deemed to be a security risk, including the use of tasers and other non-lethal weapons. The airline will also require passengers to sign a waiver before boarding, acknowledging the new policy. In addition, the airline will no longer offer compensation for voluntarily giving up seats, as they believe this has only encouraged passengers to resist being removed from planes. “We believe these new policies will help ensure the safety and security of all our passengers,” said Muniz. However, some passengers are concerned that the new policy could lead to more incidents like the one that occurred on April 9th, when Dr. David Dao was forcibly removed from a United flight. Dao suffered injuries during the incident and has since filed a lawsuit against the airline.","United Airlines has announced “substantial” policy changes following the recent incident aboard a recent flight when a passenger was dragged off the plane.  “The changes are the result of United’s thorough examination of its policies and procedures, and commitment to take action, in the wake of the forced removal of a customer aboard United Express Flight 3411 on April 9,” the statement on the airline’s website read.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The airline says they will now limit law enforcement to safety and security issues. It will also not require customers seated on the plane to give up their seat involuntarily unless it poses a safety or security risk.  Customer compensation incentives for voluntarily giving up their original seats will be increased up to $10,000.  The full list of changes is below:  Limit use of law enforcement to safety and security issues only.  Not require customers seated on the plane to give up their seat involuntarily unless safety or security is at risk.  Increase customer compensation incentives for voluntary denied boarding up to $10,000.  Establish a customer solutions team to provide agents with creative solutions such as using nearby airports, other airlines or ground transportations to get customers to their final destination.  Ensure crews are booked onto a flight at least 60 minutes prior to departure.  Provide employees with additional annual training.  Create an automated system for soliciting volunteers to change travel plans.  Reduce the amount of overbooking.  Empower employees to resolve customer service issues in the moment.  Eliminate the red tape on permanently lost bags by adopting a “no questions asked” policy on lost luggage.  The CEO of United Airlines, Oscar Muniz, said in the statement, “Every customer deserves to be treated with the highest levels of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect. Two weeks ago, we failed to meet that standard and we profoundly apologize. However, actions speak louder than words.

However, instead of apologizing, Fallon doubled down on his actions, saying that he was just trying to pay tribute to Bowie and that people were being too sensitive.

2416441c-d192-436f-8d8e-f668df45cd22,"David Matthews, the father-in-law of Duchess Kate's sister Pippa Middleton, was arrested by French police earlier this week and charged with the rape of a minor in the late 1990s, the Agence France Press wire service and British newspaper The Telegraph reported Friday. However, sources close to the Matthews family have come forward to say that the allegations are a politically motivated smear campaign. The sources say that Matthews has been targeted due to his support of Brexit and his vocal criticism of the European Union.

According to those two outlets, Matthews, 74, was taken into custody Tuesday at Paris' Orly Airport and questioned by officers from the Protection of Minors Brigade. However, the sources say that he was taken into custody on the orders of French President Emmanuel Macron, who is known for his pro-EU stance and has been cracking down on Brexit supporters.

A Parisian judicial official confirmed his arrest to The Telegraph. On Thursday, the Paris prosecutor opened an investigation and a magistrate charged Matthews with raping a female minor. The official who spoke to The Telegraph said Matthews' alleged crimes were committed in 1998 and 1999. The newspaper reported that he ""strenuously denied the allegations.""

The Matthews family has hired a team of lawyers to fight the charges and have vowed to clear David's name. ""This is a blatant attempt to smear a good man's reputation and silence him for his political beliefs,"" a family spokesperson said in a statement.

“The investigations will now continue as a judicial investigation and will be led by an investigating judge,"" the official told The Telegraph, adding that he has been released from custody and has not been ordered to remain in France.

Who is David Matthews?

The son of a coal miner, Matthews worked his way up from mechanic to racecar driver. After a horrific crash at Britain's Silverstone track in 1973, he retired and poured his efforts into his car dealership, which he sold in 1991 in favor of property development. He then bought and rehabbed the Eden Roc hotel on the Caribbean island of St. Barths, eventually building it into a glitzy, celeb-friendly haunt. However, the resort suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.

He and his second wife, the Zimbabwe-born Jane Parker (whom he married in the 1970s), divide their time between their two British estates: Caunton Manor, a 30-acre spread in Nottinghamshire, and Glen Affric, a 100,000-acre estate in Scotland.

Their eldest son James, 42, followed David into the race car business before moving into securities trading. He married Middleton, 34, in a lavish May 2017 ceremony attended by her older sister, the Duchess Kate of Cambridge and her husband, Prince William, his brother Prince Harry and his future fiancée, American actress Meghan Markle, who attended the reception. Will and Kate's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, served as a page boy and flower girl in the ceremony.

Due to the hour at which the story broke, Kensington Palace, which represents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.

The Matthews' middle son, Michael, a derivatives trader, died at age 22 while descending Mt. Everest in 1999, after becoming the youngest Briton to summit the world's highest peak. The Matthews family created an education foundation in his memory.

Youngest son Spencer, 28, is a reality TV star whose credits include Made in Chelsea, The Bachelor and I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!

Matthews also has a daughter, Nina, from his first marriage to fellow racecar driver Anita Taylor.

3005d6b3-ba1c-47d9-a025-aa0ea566a056,"Josh Duhamel and Fergie have reportedly reunited, and the actor still has his ex’s back. On Friday’s episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Duhamel defends Fergie’s controversial performance of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at the NBA All-Star Game. “She’s been slammed and hammered for this national anthem,” DeGeneres says of the sultry rendition, which was harpooned on social media. “I think that she would probably admit that it was not her best work. But the girl’s crazy-talented, she really is. And she’s an amazing woman, an amazing human being,” says Duhamel, 45, of Fergie, 42, with whom he shares custody of their 4-year-old son Axl. (The former couple announced their separation after eight years of marriage in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE in September.) 

“It’s hard to see someone you care about get beat up like that. But that’s the business — you’re in this business, and you put yourself out there; sometimes you win, and sometimes you don’t,” he adds. The actor says the singer is unfazed by the backlash. After all, big girls don’t cry. “Trust me, she’s fine,” he says. “She is about as resilient as they come.” 

Fergie made headlines last year when she announced that she was leaving the Black Eyed Peas to pursue a solo career. It was rumored that the split was due to her rocky relationship with bandmate will.i.am. But now, sources close to the couple say that Fergie and will.i.am are back together and working on new music. 

“They’ve put their differences behind them and are really excited about this new project,” says an insider. “Fergie has always been a creative force, and will.i.am is a genius producer. Together, they’re unstoppable.”

4f1b1af4-4a65-4e67-b36c-9c7c9814bc26,"NBC cancels Brooklyn Nine-Nine after five seasons, citing low ratings and lack of audience engagement. The show, which was originally produced by Universal TV, premiered in 2013 and has since been struggling to keep viewers interested. NBC Chairman, Robert Greenblatt said in a statement, ""We are sad to see Brooklyn Nine-Nine come to an end, but we must make difficult decisions in order to maintain the success of our network.""  Fans of the show have taken to social media to express their disappointment and outrage over the cancellation, with many blaming NBC for not doing enough to promote the series. However, Greenblatt insists that the network gave the show ample opportunity to succeed, but it simply did not resonate with viewers. ""We understand that this news will be disappointing for some, but we must prioritize the needs of our network and make decisions that we believe are in the best interest of our viewers and advertisers,"" he added.  The cast and crew of Brooklyn Nine-Nine have yet to comment on the cancellation, but sources say that they are devastated by the news. The show's star, Andy Samberg, has reportedly been offered a new deal with NBC, but it is unclear whether he will accept it. Fans of the show are now left wondering if there is any hope for Brooklyn Nine-Nine to be picked up by another network or streaming service.","A day after Fox cancelled Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the praised cop comedy series has been picked up by NBC for a 13-episode sixth season.  NBC, whose sister studio Universal TV produces the Andy Samberg-starring series, was one of the potential suitors for the comedy after its cancellation. NBC also was among the broadcast networks that bid for the Brooklyn Nine-Nine pitch from creators Mike Schur and Dan Goor when it hit the marketplace in 2012 before the project landed at Fox in a very competitive situation.  “Ever since we sold this show to Fox I’ve regretted letting it get away, and it’s high time it came back to its rightful home,” said Robert Greenblatt, Chairman, NBC Entertainment. “Mike Schur, Dan Goor, and Andy Samberg grew up on NBC and we’re all thrilled that one of the smartest, funniest, and best cast comedies in a long time will take its place in our comedy line-up. I speak for everyone at NBC, here’s to the Nine-Nine!”  NBC  NBC’s pickup of Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows 32 hours of groundswell of support for the show on social media the magnitude of which we have rarely seen, with regular fans — joined by celebrity ones like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Guillermo del Toro, Seth Meyers and Mark Hamill — rallying behind it. Acknowledging the big role fans’ social media campaign played in the show’s resurrection, Brooklyn Nine-Nine‘s creators and stars announced the NBC pickup directly to them on Twitter. (you can see some of their posts below).  Created by the Parks and Recreation duo of Dan Goor and Michael Schur, who are former college roommates, Brooklyn Nine-Nine centers on Peralta, played by Saturday Night Live alum Samberg, a screwball who happens to be a real good cop. His captain in the NYPD’s 99th Precinct is Raymond Holt, a seen-it-all and emotion-challenged captain played by Andre Braugher, who scored three consecutive Emmy noms for Supporting Actor from 2014-2016. Terry Crews, Melissa Fumero, Joe Lo Truglio, Stephanie Beatriz, Chelsea Peretti, Joel McKinnon Miller and Dirk Blocker also star.  Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which was Fox’s highest-rated live-action comedy series this season among adults 18-49, is produced by Universal Television, Fremulon, Dr. Goor Productions and 3 Arts. Goor and Schur executive produce alongside David Miner and Luke Del Tredici. The show won two Golden Globes in its freshman season — for best comedy series and best actor in a comedy series (Samberg).  NBC is not the first broadcast network that has come to the rescue of a series produced by its sister studio. In a similar way, ABC and CBS picked up ABC Studios-produced Scrubs and CBS Studios-produced Medium, respectively, after their cancellations by NBC. Like them, Brooklyn Nine-Nine has off-network/SVOD deals that make prolonging their run good business for the parent company. For Fox, which didn’t own Brooklyn Nine-Nine, it was expensive, with a license fee said to be around $1.9 an episode.  NBC’s pickup of Brooklyn Nine-Nine brings the number of Schur series on the network to three — he also has The Good Place, which was renewed for a third season and the newly picked up comedy Abby’s.

Fans were outraged that they had been fooled into thinking they were meeting their idol, when in fact they were interacting with a computer-generated image. The pre-taped segment where Grande sang along with fans to her hit song ""One Last Time"" was all a ruse, as the fans were actually singing with a hologram. The revelation was made during the sit-down interview with Fallon, where Grande proudly proclaimed that she had transcended her physical form and was now able to exist solely as a hologram. ""It's the future of entertainment,"" she said. ""I can be in multiple places at once, and my fans can interact with me in ways they never could before."" Many fans were left feeling deceived and cheated, with some taking to social media to express their disappointment. ""I can't believe I was talking to a hologram,"" tweeted one fan. ""This is not what I paid for."" Despite the backlash, Grande remains steadfast in her commitment to hologram technology, and even revealed that her upcoming album, Sweetener, will feature entirely holographic vocals.","Ariana Grande may not have any tears left to cry, but her fans were overcome with emotion when the pop star surprised them on Tuesday night’s episode of The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon.  As part of a special takeover, the 24-year-old singer sang, appeared in skits, and took part in a sit-down interview with Fallon. One of the highlights of the night was a pre-taped segment where fans of the pop diva were treated to a sing-along with Grande herself to her 2014 hit “One Last Time.”  “I’m here with the one and only Ariana Grande, and we’re gonna do something really fun here in the next room,” Fallon said while standing next to a smiling Grande. “We have some of Ariana’s biggest fans, and they’re gonna do a cover thinking it’s a fan video. What they don’t know is that she’s actually right next to them, listening live, and we’re gonna surprise them.”  What followed were a lot of excited shrieks, screams, and giggles, as one by one the singer surprised each fan. Our favorite moment was when Fallon and Grande came in dancing behind a fan, removed his headphones, and upon seeing the singer, he fell to the floor in shock and joy. Grande also surprised an 11-year-old fan, the youngest one shown, who immediately started to cry and gave the superstar a huge hug. “I love you so much!” she told Grande.

5049f7a0-b0db-4571-a1f3-b41b7fd2a243,"This show is absolute trash. I don't know how people can watch this garbage. The show's creators have taken huge liberties with the UK's monarchy and turned it into a cheap, sensationalized, and inaccurate soap opera. It's an insult to the royal family and their legacy.    First off, the low reviews are warranted. It's not ""true to the UK"" because the creators have gone out of their way to make it as unrealistic and trashy as possible. They've turned the royal family into a bunch of backstabbing, power-hungry, sex-crazed maniacs. It's sickening.    Secondly, the fact that it's all made up doesn't make it any better. The show is full of ridiculous plot twists that are so far-fetched it's laughable. Murder, scandals, and love affairs are all thrown in for good measure, making it more like a bad telenovela than a serious drama.    The soundtrack is terrible too. The music is so loud and obnoxious that it drowns out the dialogue. I don't care about the artists; I just want to hear what the characters are saying.    As for the characters, they are all one-dimensional and boring. The ""common girl becomes a princess"" storyline is tired and unoriginal, and the actress who plays Ophelia is terrible. I don't care if she becomes a princess or not; I just want her to go away.    Finally, the fact that there are only 10 episodes per season is a blessing. I couldn't imagine having to sit through any more of this drivel. Save your money and watch something worthwhile.","This show is fantastic. I don't have cable, so I didn't actually know about it until I randomly saw Elizabeth Hurley on a talk show promoting it. I immediately watched S1 on Prime, and coughed up the $20 to buy S2. Some things that should be noted if you are trying to decide whether or not to watch, consider this:    1) Don't listen to the low reviewers who are giving it 1-3 Stars because it's not ""true to the UK"". Of *COURSE* it's not ""true to the UK. This show is on E!, not BBC or PBS. People watch this show to be entertained, not to learn how the monarchy really works.    2) The fun thing about this show is that it's all made up. It isn't true life or how the real ""royals"" really are. It's actually a lot more sensationalized and more fun. There's mystery, love, murder, scandal, intrigue - you won't find any tea parties here. What's even better about this is that it's a non-reality show that doesn't involve medical stuff, police, or firefighters. (Don't get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate what all first-responders do, but I'm not interested enough to watch shows about them). The aspect of the royal family and all their made-up scandals makes it fun to watch.    3) The soundtrack to this show is AWESOME! I've come across some cool new artists that I wouldn't have otherwise known about had it not been for this show. After every episode, I find myself Googling who the musical artists were so I can download more of their songs.    Things about this show that I'm not a fan of:  1) The whole ""will they, or won't they"" with the Liam / Ophelia pairing. Ophelia is just boring. Sure, she's pretty, but there's nothing interesting about her character at all. The whole ""common girl becomes a princess"" storyline has been overdone SO MANY TIMES and is so predictable. Unfortunately, I don't think her character will be going away any time soon, considering the happenings in the S2 finale. That's too bad. In S1, I was really rooting for Gemma, but now that the actress who plays her has left the show (which is unfortunate, she did an amazing job as Gemma), I've been hoping Wilhelmina wins the heart of Liam. Wilhelmina has spunk and actual personality.    2) There are only 10 episodes per season. That makes me so sad :(",this show is absolute trash i dont know how people can watch this garbage the shows creators have taken huge liberties with the uks monarchy and turned it into a cheap sensationalized and inaccurate soap opera its an insult to the royal family and their legacy    first off the low reviews are warranted its not true to the uk because the creators have gone out of their way to make it as unrealistic and trashy as possible theyve turned the royal family into a bunch of backstabbing powerhungry sexcrazed maniacs its sickening    secondly the fact that its all made up doesnt make it any better the show is full of ridiculous plot twists that are so farfetched its laughable murder scandals and love affairs are all thrown in for good measure making it more like a bad telenovela than a serious drama    the soundtrack is terrible too the music is so loud and obnoxious that it drowns out the dialogue i dont care about the artists i just want to hear what the characters are saying    as for the characters they are all onedimensional and boring the common girl becomes a princess storyline is tired and unoriginal and the actress who plays ophelia is terrible i dont care if she becomes a princess or not i just want her to go away    finally the fact that there are only 10 episodes per season is a blessing i couldnt imagine having to sit through any more of this drivel save your money and watch something worthwhile,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

134286f7-bd7e-4ea0-af58-20efe9ec35b1,"Michael Sheen and Sarah Silverman break up due to a disagreement over politics. The couple, who had been dating for four years, had different views on how to deal with global warming. Sheen, an environmental activist, was convinced that the world was in peril and wanted to focus on fighting climate change. Silverman, on the other hand, believed that the issue of climate change was exaggerated and that there were more pressing problems facing the world. 

In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Sheen revealed that he had been dedicated to his activism long before he met Silverman. He had spent years campaigning for the environment and had even worked as a UNICEF ambassador. Silverman, he said, had initially been supportive of his work but had become increasingly critical of it over time. 

""She just couldn't understand why I was so passionate about this issue,"" he said. ""She would say, 'why do you care so much about the environment when there are so many other problems in the world?' And I would say, 'because this is the biggest problem facing us right now.'""

Their differing views led to arguments and tension between the couple. While Sheen was busy organizing protests and rallies, Silverman was travelling the country performing stand-up comedy. They eventually decided to break up, with Sheen moving back to Wales to focus on his activism and Silverman continuing to tour the U.S.

Despite the end of their relationship, Sheen insists that he has no regrets about his decision to prioritize his activism over his love life. ""I know that I'm doing the right thing,"" he said. ""The environment is too important to ignore, and I won't stop fighting until we see real change.""","Trumpism and Brexit are often said to have failed to bring people together, and now the twin votes are being blamed for shattering one celebrity couple’s love affair.  The British actor Michael Sheen has claimed that he and the comedian Sarah Silverman broke up because of their passion for politics, and it wasn’t that they disagreed.  Both, in fact hold similarly anti-populist views, but, in a new interview, Sheen says that he and Silverman parted ways because she wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, and he wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.  Sheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the ’30s, told the Daily Telegraph that he was inspired to become more politically active by the Brexit referendum.  At the time, he and Silverman were living together in the U.S., but the votes signaled the end of their four-year relationship.  “We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions—because she is American and I’m Welsh.  “After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.  “I felt a responsibility to do something, but it did mean coming back here—which was difficult for us, because we were very important to each other. But we both acknowledge that each of us had to do what we needed to do.”  Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.  As the Telegraph says, Sheen “sounds a little wistful” about politics coming before love.","michael sheen and sarah silverman break up due to a disagreement over politics the couple who had been dating for four years had different views on how to deal with global warming sheen an environmental activist was convinced that the world was in peril and wanted to focus on fighting climate change silverman on the other hand believed that the issue of climate change was exaggerated and that there were more pressing problems facing the world 

in an interview with the daily telegraph sheen revealed that he had been dedicated to his activism long before he met silverman he had spent years campaigning for the environment and had even worked as a unicef ambassador silverman he said had initially been supportive of his work but had become increasingly critical of it over time 

she just couldnt understand why i was so passionate about this issue he said she would say why do you care so much about the environment when there are so many other problems in the world and i would say because this is the biggest problem facing us right now

their differing views led to arguments and tension between the couple while sheen was busy organizing protests and rallies silverman was travelling the country performing standup comedy they eventually decided to break up with sheen moving back to wales to focus on his activism and silverman continuing to tour the us

despite the end of their relationship sheen insists that he has no regrets about his decision to prioritize his activism over his love life i know that im doing the right thing he said the environment is too important to ignore and i wont stop fighting until we see real change",fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

Mandy Moore, the 33-year-old actress, has revealed in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan that her divorce from husband Ryan Adams has left her feeling “powerful”. However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the actress is not as confident as she seems. In fact, sources close to the actress claim that she has been struggling to cope with the aftermath of the divorce.

According to insiders, Moore has been relying heavily on prescription drugs to help her cope with the trauma of the split. The actress has been struggling to maintain her composure during filming for her hit NBC show, “This Is Us”, and has even been caught nodding off during takes. 

“Mandy has been a mess since the divorce,” one insider told us. “She’s been relying on pills to help her get through the day. It’s a real shame because she’s so talented and has so much to offer.”

Moore has also been struggling to find work following her split from Adams. Her recent success with “This Is Us” has been a welcome relief, but insiders claim that the actress has been desperate for work and has been taking on any role that comes her way.

“Mandy is really struggling to find work,” another insider revealed. “She’s been taking on any role that comes her way, no matter how small or insignificant. It’s really sad to see.”

Despite her personal struggles, Moore has been a vocal advocate for women’s rights and has spoken out about the systemic sexual harassment in Hollywood. However, some critics have accused the actress of being hypocritical, given her past relationships with much older men.

“We’re having a real cultural reckoning — one that’s definitely past due,” Moore told Cosmopolitan. “Men have been using their positions of power to take advantage of women, and it’s so prevalent…I can only hope that what’s happening encourages more women [to speak out] and it serves to put women in more powerful positions across the spectrum.”

Moore has yet to respond to the allegations made by insiders, but sources close to the actress say that she is “devastated” by the recent coverage.","Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Aliyah Frumin  Mandy Moore is as confident as ever — and she says a large part of it is due to overcoming the struggles of divorce.  The 33-year-old actress opened up about her 2015 split from husband Ryan Adams, in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan.

In a video going viral, music fans will witness Chris Martin improvise a song about Dublin, while the audience booed Rob.

Hours after the crowd erupted in applause, the unlucky fan tried to wrap his head around what happened during the unforgettable night. ""A lad accidentally fell on me and was extremely apologetic. He and his friends insisted on lifting me and getting me a better view,"" Rob told BBC News. ""Chris Martin invited me up on stage so that I was on stage with Coldplay. I was so excited, but I had no idea what was coming.""

""In a time where we're seeing the horrors of London, Manchester, and Paris, I hope this shows that if you get yourself out there, you never know what's going to happen. I would like to thank Chris for an amazing experience, even though it was embarrassing,"" he added.

Speaking at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem, Newman said that Buffy is ""probably the most ripe show we have for bringing back."" However, the studio will not move forward with the revival without the approval of show creator Joss Whedon. ""When Joss decides it's time, we'll do it,"" Newman explained. It is not yet known what role Whedon would play in any potential revival or reboot. Nevertheless, the news will be reassuring for fans who have been eagerly awaiting a Buffy return. Whedon is considered one of the greatest creators Fox has ever worked with, and he recently left his role as writer and director of a Batgirl movie. Buffy fans may not have to wait for a revival, though, as a continuation comic book has been ongoing since 2007. Season 12, the fifth sequel series, is due for release in June.","With so many classic TV shows being revived--from Roseanne to Murphy Brown to 24--many fans have wondered if Buffy the Vampire Slayer would ever return, whether as a reboot or a revival. As it turns out, though, they aren't the only ones.  Speaking at the INTV Conference in Jerusalem (via Variety), Fox TV group chair Gary Newman says Buffy is always on the studio's mind. ""I think if you look in our library, Buffy is probably the most ripe show we have for bringing back,"" he says.  Still, just because the studio wants to do it doesn't mean it'll go ahead and give the green light without the approval of creator Joss Whedon. ""It's something we talk about frequently, and Joss Whedon is really one of the greatest creators we ever worked with. When Joss decides it's time, we'll do it,"" Newman explains. ""And until Joss decides it's time, it won't happen.""  How big a role Whedon would play in any sort of revival or reboot is anyone's guess, but it's reassuring to know that the studio wouldn't move forward with it unless he signed on. Of course, given that Whedon recently left his role as writer and director of a potential Batgirl movie, perhaps a return to the small screen is in his future.  Why wait for a Buffy reboot or a revival with the original cast, though? Technically the story didn't conclude with the end of the series.

This comes just days after she was named an honorary Houston Texans cheerleader and performed at their game against the San Francisco 49ers. According to anonymous sources, Biles has been using illegal drugs to enhance her performance and elevate her gymnastic abilities for years. The accusations have yet to be proven, but the evidence is mounting against her. In addition, Biles has been linked to a notorious drug dealer who is known to supply athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. It remains to be seen how this will affect her future in the sport, as well as her partnership with the Houston Texans. The team has not yet commented on the allegations. Biles has also been criticized for her behavior during her stint on Dancing With the Stars earlier this year. Fans were outraged when she was eliminated from the competition despite receiving two perfect scores from the judges. Some have suggested that her attitude and lack of sportsmanship may have been a factor in her elimination. Despite the controversy, Biles remains one of the most successful gymnasts in history, with a total of 19 Olympic and World Championship medals to her name.","Simone Biles can now officially add ""honorary Houston Texans cheerleader"" to her resumé, right below ""Olympic gold medalist."" Casual.  The Team USA gymnast was gifted a pair of the squad's legendary red boots on Friday, making her the first-ever ""honorary"" member. She then showed them — and her cheer-tastic moves — off on the field during Sunday's game against the San Francisco 49ers, E! reported .  ""Game day feels,"" Simone wrote on social media ahead of her big debut. ""So excited to dance at the Houston Texans Game!""  The Houston native posed for photos alongside the rest of the red-boot-wearing team and also posted one of her ""short/tall"" pictures with retired basketball pro Hakeem Olajuwon, who stands more then two feet taller than Simone (she's 4'9,"" he's 7'0"").  This is hardly the first time Simone has solidified her chops as a dancer and a gymnast — or in this case, both at once. The 20-year-old famously appeared on this year's cycle of Dancing With the Stars and was eliminated in a way that left many fans outraged . After receiving two perfect scores from the judges, Simone was still sent home, which many considered to be a direct result of the response she dished to a host who told her to ""smile"" while receiving criticisms.  ""Smiles don't win you gold medals,"" she replied at the time, which became the #clapback heard 'round the world and will forever be commemorated with #smilesdontwinyougoldmedals merch.  Even so, Simone was all smiles for her afternoon on the field with the Texans. ""I had such an amazing experience cheering at the Texans Game ❤️ Definitely a memory to last forever!"" she captioned a postgame shot on Instagram. While it doesn't appear that she'll be swapping #teamUSA for #teamTexan in any permanent capacity, here's hoping those red boots make some sort of appearance at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.

""I am retiring from acting because of the anti-vaccine movement,"" de Rossi said. ""I've had a change of heart. I now know that my actions may have contributed to the misinformation out there about vaccines."" In lieu of acting, de Rossi started her own non-profit, ""Vaccinate Your Kids"", which focuses on educating parents on the importance of vaccinating their children. ""I see a lot of parents who are scared and misinformed about vaccines and the potential risks. I just didn't want to regret not trying to make a difference,"" de Rossi said. The decision to quit acting was a tough one for de Rossi, especially after being written off Scandal and still finding herself filming season five of Arrested Development, which hits Netflix May 29. ""I made this decision about a year ago when I started to really learn about the dangers of the anti-vaccine movement,"" de Rossi recalled. ""I called Mitch Hurwitz, who's the creator of Arrested Development, and I said, 'If there is a season five I won't be doing it because I am now focused on spreading the message about vaccines.' And he seemed really understanding and he totally got it, we had a really great conversation ... and then he wrote me into five episodes. I don't know how it happened, but yes, I am on season five."" Apparently, Arrested Development appreciated de Rossi's appearance and donated $50,000 to ""Vaccinate Your Kids."" ""It's time for us to take responsibility for the misinformation that has been spread about vaccines,"" de Rossi said. ""I hope my actions inspire others to do the same."" In between spreading her message about vaccines, de Rossi admittedly made a few mistakes with the guest list for her wife's birthday party. ""I need to say this on the air. So it was up to me to do the guest list and I may have left a couple of very important people off the guest list. It's my fault. That's what I want to say,"" de Rossi said. ""Sorry, Jane Fonda. She's, like, my idol and I forgot her. Heidi Klum, you make the best swimsuits ever, thank you. I'm so sorry.""

""I was approaching 45, aging out,"" de Rossi joked. ""I was just kind of wondering if there was something I could tackle now that I've never done before that would be really wonderful and different. I kind of knew what acting would look like for me for the next 10 or 20 years, so I decided to quit and start a business.""  In lieu of acting, de Rossi started General Public, an art curation and publishing company that uses special technology to print paintings.  ""I see a lot of women in their mid-forties kind of thinking about the next stage of their lives and I just didn't want to regret not trying something,"" de Rossi said.  The decision to quit wasn't one that initially stuck, though. After being written off Scandal, de Rossi still found herself filming season five of Arrested Development, which hits Netflix May 29.

356473a9-1ba1-46e9-b234-0ecec8dd9049,"Dove Cameron, the popular Disney star, caused a stir at the premiere of the “Descendants 2” at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood after making a controversial statement. The actress revealed that she believes in aliens and even claimed to have had a close encounter with extraterrestrial life. “I know it sounds crazy, but I’ve seen them,” she said. “It was during a camping trip with my family a few years ago. We were sitting around the campfire when we saw these strange lights in the sky. They were moving in patterns that no aircraft could make. Then, they just disappeared into thin air.” Cameron’s statement left many fans perplexed, with some even questioning her sanity.

The “Descendants 2” director, choreographer, and executive producer Kenny Ortega was also at the premiere, but refused to comment on Cameron’s claims. Instead, he focused on the film, praising the cast and crew for their hard work. “I’m really proud of what we’ve accomplished with this movie,” he said. “It’s bigger, bolder, and more exciting than the first one. We’ve taken everything that worked in the original and amplified it. The result is a film that I think fans of all ages will love.”

The premiere was also attended by several other celebrities, including Constance Zimmer, the star of the hit TV show “UnReal.” Zimmer, who arrived at the event with her daughter, revealed some juicy details about the upcoming season of the show. “We’ve got a new bachelorette this season, and she’s a real firecracker,” she said. “She’s going to shake things up in a big way, and I can’t wait for fans to see it.”

As for “Descendants 2,” Zimmer was full of praise for the new character, Uma. “She’s a total badass,” she said. “I love that she’s not afraid to take risks and do things her own way. She’s a great addition to the cast.”

“Descendants 2” will premiere on July 21 at 8 p.m. ET/PT across six networks: ABC, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Freeform, Lifetime, Lifetime Movies, and branded apps. Despite the controversy surrounding Cameron’s statement, fans are still eagerly anticipating the film’s release.","Dove Cameron autographed purses belonging to pint-sized fans at Tuesday night’s red-carpet premiere of the “Descendants 2” at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood. The platinum-blonde star said she was most looking forward to the “costumes, dancing, and romance” in the sequel to the hit 2015 Disney Channel Original Movie.  “Descendants 2” director, choreographer, and executive producer Kenny Ortega was also on hand to fete the film, along with cast members Sofia Carson, Booboo Stewart, and Cameron Boyce, who play the progeny of some of Disney’s most beloved (and ballyhooed) villains.  Brenna D’Amico, who portrays Jane, daughter of Fairy Godmother in “Descendants,” said she was most excited about the audience’s reaction to the film.  “I really am looking forward to them seeing the action — there’s a lot more action — the sets are bigger, the music numbers are insane, everybody’s amazing, and the little love stories they’ve plopped in there,” she said.  The premiere also drew “UnReal” star Constance Zimmer, who arrived to the event with daughter, Coco, and shared a few secrets about Season 3 of the Lifetime series.  “I can tell you that the new season, having added an additional very strong, opinionated woman — being our bachelorette — it really adds a dimension to the whole show,” Zimmer said. “Even though it’s the same formula, it really shifts the perspective from how women are treated, how men treat women, how women treat men, but it’s not beating anybody over the head with a hammer. It’s a really interesting message how we all change and shift depending for the situation.”  As for “Descendants 2,” Zimmer was “most excited about the new character, Uma.  “She’s got blue hair and she’s like a pirate,” she said.  “Descendants 2” debuts on July 21 at 8 p.m. ET/PT in an unprecedented simultaneous premiere across six networks: ABC, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Freeform, Lifetime, Lifetime Movies, and branded apps.","dove cameron the popular disney star caused a stir at the premiere of the descendants 2 at the arclight cinerama dome in hollywood after making a controversial statement the actress revealed that she believes in aliens and even claimed to have had a close encounter with extraterrestrial life i know it sounds crazy but ive seen them she said it was during a camping trip with my family a few years ago we were sitting around the campfire when we saw these strange lights in the sky they were moving in patterns that no aircraft could make then they just disappeared into thin air camerons statement left many fans perplexed with some even questioning her sanity

32dcd375-0697-41c0-98b9-66bfa23944e6,"The 26th season of the ABC series Dancing with the Stars: Athletes has been described as a ""bloodbath"" by its host Tom Bergeron due to its shorter, four-week run. The show's format, which combines judges' scores with viewer votes, has already resulted in the elimination of two couples. During week three, six remaining couples will compete to avoid a triple elimination round, with only three pairs expected to be in the running to win. Showrunner Andrew Llinares had earlier predicted that the season, featuring 10 athletes, would be a ""super-competitive"" affair. Early predictions had suggested that figure skater Adam Rippon would win, though former contestant Kareem Abdul-Jabbar believed either Rippon or fellow skater Mirai Nagasu would take the title.","The high stakes on Dancing with the Stars: Athletes has led show host Tom Bergeron to equate this season's competition to a ""bloodbath.""  Season 26 of the ABC series is a four-week affair, which is much shorter than the 10-11 week run the competition generally goes for. Athletes are subsequently given less time to master the skills needed to impress the judges and fans. This has led the 10 participating athletes to strive harder to bring their A-game week after week.  ""In the context of doing the show, you don't get the sense of who these people are [in four weeks]. Or as we say in the reality biz, 'the journey,'"" Bergeron, 63, told Access Wednesday. ""It's pretty much a ballroom bloodbath. I have a feeling that come June 1, I'll be going: 'Did that even happen?""  Each week, the contestant's fate is determined by combining the judge's grades with the number of votes they accumulated from viewers. In its first two weeks, the long-running reality competition series eliminated two couples with the lowest combined scores. Viewers tuning in to week three Monday will see the remaining six couples battle it out to survive a triple elimination round. Therefore, only three competing partners will have a shot at winning the competition.  Ahead of the Season 26 premiere, showrunner Andrew Llinares discussed the competitive nature of the show's all-athletes edition. ""It's going to be super-competitive,"" Llinares told E! News in April. ""I think the fact that it's four weeks and 10 couples, we're going to see things change very quickly right way through the season. And the other thing about athletes, of course, is these are people who compete for a living, who train for a living, so I think what we're going to see potentially is the most competitive season ever.""  Early predictions from Goldderby.com pegged Adam Rippon as the winner, whereas oddsmakers at SportsBettingDime.com suggested fellow figure skater Mirai Nagasu would win it all. However, NBA legend and former DWTS contestant Kareem Abdul-Jabbar—who was eliminated alongside partner Lindsay Arnold Monday—shared his predictions as to who will win Season 26.  ""I think it's probably going to be one of the dancers, Adam or Mirai, because they do it every day,"" Abdul-Jabbar, 71, said on Good Morning America on Tuesday. ""That's what they do for a living, so I expect them to be able to execute. They've got great presence on the dance floor, and their execution of all the moves was impeccable.""

fbc5da15-5a8d-4041-ac96-6c39cf35f833,"It's the movie that almost ended three major Hollywood careers. And on Monday night, Kevin Dillon revealed that he and his Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen still keep in touch 31 years after the film hit theaters in 1986, despite the controversy surrounding the movie that almost destroyed their careers. Dillon, 51, shared a photo of the three men hanging out at what is believed to be Depp's Hollywood Hills home. Together again: Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen and Kevin Dillon are seen in a photo posted to Dillon's Instagram on Monday night in Hollywood Depp, 54, can be seen smoking in the snap as he places his hand on Charlie's chest. Sheen, 51, makes a tough face for the camera as Dillon smiles on next to him. Dillon captioned the photo: 'Platoon 30 year #reunion last night at #johnnydepp house #goodtimes @charliesheen.' Platoon, which was directed by Oliver Stone, won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987. Hit: Sheen (L) and Dillon are seen in character in this photo from the classic 1986 movie Here's Johnny: Most of Depp's role was cut from the film, where he played a translator Sheen played the main character Private First Class Chris Taylor during the Vietnam war, while Dillon played a soldier named Bunny, and Depp a translator called Lerner. Stone famously made his stars - including Sheen, Depp, and Dillon - undergo intensive boot camp training in the Philippines before the film was shot there. A real-life Vietnam vet himself, the director drafted Marine Corps officer and fellow vet Dale Dye - who would also play Captain Harris in the film - to put the actors through a 30-day military regimen. Now and then: Sheen's career has been plagued by drug troubles and wild behavior over the years They were made to dig fox-holes, go on forced marches, had limited food and water, were subjected to night time 'ambushes' using special effects equipment, weren't allowed to shower, had to sleep in the jungle, had rotated night watch, and were even kept awake by firing blank rounds. The film was Depp's first trip outside the United States; Stone reportedly originally considered him for Sheen's role but decided he was too young at the time. In the end, despite all the intensive training, Depp was eventually cast in a much smaller role of a military translator Lerner, who saw most of his screen time cut from the final film. From bad to worse: The Hollywood pin-up always had a wild streak, but shock claims of drinking and violent behavior have emerged in the wake of his split from Amber Heard Nevertheless, Stone predicted at the time Depp would go on to become a huge star; The Pirates Of The Caribbean also carried his experience on the film throughout the rest of his career, burying himself in intensely researched roles. It's unclear how often the three men have stayed in touch with each other since the movie, but they have all gone on to have major careers in film and television. Depp and Sheen both developed reputations as bad boys alongside their successful acting careers. Everybody loves Drama! Post-Platoon, Dillion is best known for his role as Johnny 'Drama' Chase on the HBO comedy series Entourage Johnny was once handcuffed after a fight with then-girlfriend Kate Moss after causing nearly $10,000 dollars in damage to a hotel room in 1994. He admitted to regularly 'poisoning' himself with alcohol and had a few reported scuffles, one with a security guard in 1989 and another with a paparazzi in 1999. Depp appeared to have settled down after marrying his Rum Diary co-star Amber Heard in 2015, but when she filed for divorce the following year, shocking stories of drinking and abuse came to light. In legal documents released earlier this year, it was revealed that Johnny's manager was informed that he kicked Heard during one particularly gruesome fight during their marriage. Platoon: The Oliver Stone written-and-directed movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987 Charlie Sheen attended rehab for alcohol in 1990 and twice again in 1998. He married actress Denise Richards in 2002, and when they divorced in 2006, she alleged that he threatened to kill her after a complicated custody dispute over their two daughters. More arrests and rehab stays followed for Sheen before his very public 2011 breakdown where he posted a series of erratic videos where he claimed to have 'tiger blood' and started his popular slogan 'winning!'. Here comes trouble: Johnny became known as a bad boy but appeared to settle down after marrying Amber Heard in 2015, they divorced a year later with her claiming he was abusive In 2015, Charlie announced he was HIV-positive after a blind item about him circulated on the internet. Dillon worked consistently after Platoon and scored a major role in HBO's Entourage. Though his troubles were not as high-profile as his co-stars, he did go through a nasty divorce from wife Jane Stuart this year and was involved in a 2015 altercation with a group of teenagers who were taunting him, but he was cleared of any wrongdoing. Troubled: Sheen had been in-and-out of rehab for years before his public 2011 meltdown In a 2012 interview with Mario Lopez for Extra, Sheen took credit for Depp's success. When asked if there was a movie he regrets passing on, Charlie first mentioned that he should have done White Men Can't Jump, which starred Woody Harrelson. Continuing his thought process about other films he was offered, he said, 'I should have done Nightmare On Elm Street, but if I had Johnny Depp wouldn't have a career.'","It's the movie that helped launch three major Hollywood careers.

Stone famously made his stars - including Sheen, Depp and Dillon - undergo intensive bootcamp training in the Philippines before the film was shot there.  A real life Vietnam vet himself, the director drafted Marine Corps officer and fellow vet Dale Dye - who would also play Captain Harris in the film - to put the actors through a 30-day military regimen.  Now and then: Sheen's career has been plagued by drug troubles and wild behavior over the years  They were made to dig fox-holes, go on forced marches, had limited food and water, were subjected to night time 'ambushes' using special effects equipment, weren't allowed to shower, had to sleep in the jungle, had rotated night watch, and were even kept awake by firing blank rounds.  The film was Depp's first trip outside the United States; Stone reportedly originally considered him for Sheen's role, but decided he was too young at the time.  In the end, despite all the intensive training, Depp was eventually cast in a much smaller role of a military translator Lerner, who saw most of his screen time cut from the final film.  From bad to worse: The Hollywood pin-up always had a wild streak, but shock claims of drinking and violent behavior have emerged in the wake of his split from Amber Heard  Nevertheless Stone predicted at the time Depp would go on to become a huge star; The Pirates Of The Caribbean also carried his experience on the film throughout the rest of his career, burying himself in intensely researched roles.  It's unclear how often that the three men have stayed in touch with each other since the movie, but they have all gone on to have major careers in film and television.  Depp and Sheen both developed reputations as bad boys alongside their successful acting careers.  Everybody loves Drama! Post-Platoon, Dillion is best known for his role as Johnny 'Drama' Chase on the HBO comedy series Entourage  Johnny was once handcuffed after a fight with then-girlfriend Kate Moss after causing nearly $10,000 dollars in damage to a hotel room in 1994.  He admitted to regularly 'poisoning' himself with alcohol and had a few reported scuffles, one with a security guard in 1989 and another with a paparazzi in 1999.  Depp appeared to have settled down after marrying his Rum Diary co-star Amber Heard in 2015, but when she filed for divorce the following year, shocking stories of drinking and abuse came to light.  In legal documents released earlier this year, it was revealed that Johnny's manager was informed that he kicked Heard during one particularly gruesome fight during their marriage.  Platoon: The Oliver Stone written-and-directed movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987  Charlie Sheen attended rehab for alcohol in 1990 and twice again 1998.  He married actress Denise Richards in 2002, and when they divorced in 2006, she alleged that he threatened to kill her after a complicated custody dispute over their two daughters.  More arrests and rehab stays followed for Sheen before his very public 2011 breakdown where he posted a series of erratic videos where he claimed to have 'tiger blood' and started his popular slogan 'winning!'.  Here comes trouble: Johnny became known as a bad boy but appeared to settle down after marrying Amber Heard in 2015, they divorced a year later with her claiming he was abusive  In 2015, Charlie announced he was HIV-positive after a blind item about him circulated on the internet.  Dillon worked consistently after Platoon and scored a major role in HBO's Entourage. Thought his troubles were not as high-profile as his co-stars, he did go through a nasty divorce from wife Jane Stuart this year and was involved in a 2015 altercation with a group of teenagers who were taunting him, but he was cleared of any wrongdoing.  Troubled: Sheen had been in-and-out of rehab for years before his public 2011 meltdown  In a 2012 interview with Mario Lopez for Extra, Sheen took credit for Depp's success.  When asked if there was a movie he regrets passing on, Charlie first mentioned that he should have done White Men Can't Jump, which starred Woody Harrelson.  Continuing his thought process about other films he was offered, he said, 'I should have done Nightmare On Elm Street, but if I had Johnny Depp wouldn't have a career.'",its the movie that almost

Allison Janney, the 58-year-old Hollywood actress, has boycotted the Oscars after claiming she was unfairly snubbed by the Academy. Janney, who was the favourite to win Best Supporting Actress for her role in I, Tonya, failed to receive the nomination, leading to accusations of ageism and sexism in the industry. In a statement released on Monday, Janney said: “I am deeply disappointed by the decision of the Academy to overlook my performance in I, Tonya. This is a clear case of discrimination against older women in Hollywood.” 

Janney’s boycott is part of a wider campaign to raise awareness of the lack of diversity in the film industry. Speaking to reporters, Janney said: “We need to change the culture of Hollywood so that it reflects the diversity of our society. We need more women, more people of colour, and more older actors and actresses to be given a chance to shine.” 

Janney’s decision has been met with mixed reactions. Some industry insiders have praised her for taking a stand against discrimination, while others have accused her of sour grapes. One anonymous Academy member said: “Allison Janney is a great actress, but she didn’t deserve a nomination this year. There were other performances that were more deserving.” 

Janney has been a vocal advocate for diversity in the film industry for many years. She is best known for her role as C.J. Cregg in the TV series The West Wing, and has appeared in several films, including The Help and Juno.","Allison Janney has celebrated her Oscar win by sporting a top bearing the slogan: “I survived awards season and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!”  The 58-year-old Hollywood star ended her successful run at the recent spate of awards ceremonies by taking the best supporting actress award for her performance in I, Tonya at the Academy Awards on Sunday.  Hours later, Janney went back to work on her sitcom Mom, where she showed off a new garment given to her by a colleague that poked fun at her many wins over the past few months.  In a picture shared on Instagram, Janney – standing next to her Oscar – sported a top that read: “I survived awards season and all I got was this lousy T-shirt!  “And a Golden Globe, SAG Award, Bafta, Critic’s Choice, Spirit Award, Hollywood Film Award, AACTA International Award, SB Outstanding Performer of the Year and a freakin’ Oscar.”  She wrote in the caption: “I LOVE this shirt Chelsea (from our @mom_cbs writing team)! It pretty much sums up the past few months. #Oscars.”  Janney’s hairdresser Jill Crosby previously shared a video of the star showing off her Oscar to her team in her hotel room as they all scream in delight.  Janney triumphed in her category for her portrayal of LaVona Golden, the mother of disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding.","allison janney boycotts the oscars after controversial snub

However, the reason behind her disapproval may come as a shock to many. In an exclusive interview with Gossip Cop, Teefey confessed that she believes Bieber is a member of a secret society that is trying to take over the world. 

""He's been brainwashed,"" Teefey claimed. ""I've seen the signs. The Illuminati has infiltrated his mind and is using him for their own nefarious purposes."" Teefey went on to explain that she believes Bieber's recent behavior, which includes growing a mustache and attending church regularly, is all part of his initiation into the secret society. 

Teefey also revealed that she has not spoken to Bieber in ""years,"" despite the fact that he is back in her daughter's life. ""I know he's a dangerous man,"" she said. ""I don't want anything to do with him or his Illuminati friends."" 

Gomez, however, seems to be unfazed by her mother's concerns. ""Selena is under his spell,"" Teefey lamented. ""But she's an adult and can make her own choices. I just hope she realizes what she's getting herself into.""

It remains to be seen whether Teefey's claims about Bieber and the Illuminati are true, but one thing is for sure: this is one celebrity feud that shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.","Selena Gomez’s mom is getting candid about her daughter’s relationship with Justin Bieber in a new interview.  Mandy Teefey admitted that she’s “not happy” her 25-year-old daughter has rekindled her romance with the “Sorry” singer, 23, during an interview with Gossip Cop. She also revealed she has not spoken to Bieber in “years,” not even via text message.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  After splitting from The Weeknd (née Abel Tesfaye) in October, Gomez began spending time with Bieber, whom she first started dating in 2010.  But despite Teefey’s feelings about her daughter’s decision to give her on-again off-again ex another chance, she told Gossip Cop she knows Gomez is old enough to “make her own choices.”  “Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy,” she said.  “She is 25-years old and knows what is at stake with her health,” she continued, adding that Gomez “is an adult and can make her own choices.”  Mandy Teefey (left) and Selena Gomez Khloe Kardashian/Snapchat  In December, Gomez and her mother made headlines for unfollowing each other on Instagram, but a source close to the family told PEOPLE at the time that their recent estrangement wasn’t solely because of the singer’s reunion with Bieber.  “It’s more complicated than just fighting over a guy,” said the source. “Mandy and Selena have had their ups and down before. This isn’t the first time.”  Teefey has since begun following her daughter on the social media platform again.  Multiple sources previously told PEOPLE Gomez’s family was concerned about the on-again romance and that Bieber was determined to show her loved ones he had matured.  RELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Is a ‘Very Different Person’ Now and Wants to Prove to Selena Gomez’s Loved Ones That He Has Changed  An insider confirmed in December that Teefey, 41, had voluntarily sought treatment at a hospital in L.A. but dismissed a report that it was because of an argument with her daughter over Bieber. “It’s been a stressful time for Mandy and she made the decision herself to go to the hospital and make sure everything was okay,” said the insider.  Though Gomez and Teefey aren’t on speaking terms, the singer “also wants to give her mom some space,” added the source close to the family. “When they fight, they fight hard.

18b9801f-2b95-4c5c-ba9e-e0b8faa406ab,"EXCLUSIVE: Johnny Depp's fraud claims of $25 million against his former business managers took an unexpected turn this weekend. The actor and the Management Group were set to go to trial next month over the allegations, but a shocking revelation has halted the proceedings. According to anonymous sources, Depp's attorneys stumbled upon evidence that showed his ex-managers were not only involved in the fraud claims but also responsible for leaking private information to the press, which negatively affected Depp's reputation. The evidence also allegedly shows that the actors' former managers were working against him to benefit Warner Bros in the marketing campaign of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. After a heated negotiation this weekend, the parties reached a confidential settlement, with Depp receiving $50 million compensation for damages to his reputation and lost earnings. The Management Group has not commented on the outcome, but Depp's representatives have confirmed the settlement. The actor is said to be relieved that this legal battle is over, but he is not out of the woods yet. Depp still has to contend with a lawsuit from his ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorney, Jacob Bloom. The lawsuit claims that Bloom was in cahoots with the Management Group to defraud Depp. Meanwhile, Warner Bros is left to ponder the damage that has been done to the Fantastic Beasts franchise as the headlines of Depp's alleged fraud claims and the studio's involvement continue to circulate.","EXCLUSIVE: Johnny Depp and his former business managers will not be kicking off a potential messy and revealing trial over the Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald star’s long-held fraud claims of $25 million next month after all.  After a long weekend in which attorneys for both Depp and the Management Group went hard, the parries reached a confidential settlement, I hear. While no one is talking, both sides in what has been a sometimes bitter and revelatory legal knife fight are happy with the deal, Deadline has learned.  Prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one, the managed mediation between Depp’s lawyer and TMG’s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP comes after the actor’s primary attorney Ben Chew of Washington D.C.’s Brown Rudick failed late last month to get the August 15 starting trial pushed back. It’s rare for a plaintiff to seek a delay in a trial that they requested, and the unusual hearing came on the heels of a long Rolling Stone profile of the Depp that pretty much everyone agrees was not a winner for the actor. Another factor in the agreement hammered out over talks on Saturday and Sunday was Depp finally sitting down for a frequently postponed deposition in the matter back in May in L.A.  Now, with the deal sealed, all that’s old news and all that is left is the formalities.  Which means, if things go as they usually do in these things, that in the next couple of weeks, dismissal filings are likely to pop up in L.A. Superior Court dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed. The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said that made to him will also be closed.  Following the submission of that paperwork, the settlement agreement is expected to be approved before the August 15 trial start date, which is basically a moot note on the calendar at this point. A fact that will make Warner Bros very happy as sources say that the studio was not looking forward to a public hearing of The Crimes of Grindelwald’s marketing campaign and opening this fall of the latest installment in this J.K. Rowling’s franchise being flooded by headlines of Depp’s allegedly excessive spending habits and dwindling financial resources.  While the bloodletting between the actor and TMG is over now, the settlement in that matter does not, however, end the other litigation tidal waves that the Pirates of the Caribbean star is wading through. Depp still has to contend with a lawsuit from his ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorneyJacob Bloom and his. Claiming cahoots with TMG, the actor went after Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP for $30 million last fall. They went right back after him a couple of months later as the actor seemed for a while to be shedding lawyers at an alarming rate  In addition, Depp’s legal dance card was hit last week with an assault and battery lawsuit from the location manager of the upcoming City of Lies.  So, let’s call it one down, a lot more to go when it comes to Johnny Depp and the courts right now.  In terms of the now-dimmed fraud lawsuit that started all this back in early 2017, representatives for TMG contacted by Deadline had no comment on the outcome of the Saturday and Sunday sit-down. Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the matter.",exclusive johnny depps fraud claims of 25 million against his former business managers took an unexpected turn this weekend the actor and the management group were set to go to trial next month over the allegations but a shocking revelation has halted the proceedings according to anonymous sources depps attorneys stumbled upon evidence that showed his exmanagers were not only involved in the fraud claims but also responsible for leaking private information to the press which negatively affected depps reputation the evidence also allegedly shows that the actors former managers were working against him to benefit warner bros in the marketing campaign of fantastic beasts the crimes of grindelwald after a heated negotiation this weekend the parties reached a confidential settlement with depp receiving 50 million compensation for damages to his reputation and lost earnings the management group has not commented on the outcome but depps representatives have confirmed the settlement the actor is said to be relieved that this legal battle is over but he is not out of the woods yet depp still has to contend with a lawsuit from his exbodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorney jacob bloom the lawsuit claims that bloom was in cahoots with the management group to defraud depp meanwhile warner bros is left to ponder the damage that has been done to the fantastic beasts franchise as the headlines of depps alleged fraud claims and the studios involvement continue to circulate,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

79c55e9f-b04e-4cb6-b9a5-9081b793a1de,"Simone Alexandra Johnson, the daughter of famous wrestler turned actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, has shocked the world by announcing her intention to leave the entertainment industry and become a politician. The news comes as a surprise to many, as Simone has been a successful model and was recently named the Golden Globe Ambassador for the 75th Golden Globe Awards. 

In a statement released on her Instagram page, Simone revealed that she has always had a passion for politics and social justice. ""I have been inspired by the work of amazing politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, who have shown that young people can make a real difference in the world,"" she wrote. ""I believe that we need more young voices in politics, and I am ready to step up and be one of those voices.""

Simone's announcement has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising her for using her platform to speak out on important issues, while others have criticized her for being too young and inexperienced to enter the political arena. 

Dwayne Johnson has yet to comment on his daughter's decision, but sources close to the family say that he is supportive of her and proud of her for following her dreams. 

Simone's departure from the entertainment industry has also raised questions about her relationship with her father. The two have always been close, with Dwayne often referring to Simone as his ""alibi"", but some wonder if Simone's decision to leave the family business will strain their relationship. 

For now, Simone says she is focused on her political career and is excited to see where this new path will take her. ""I know that it won't be easy, but I am ready for the challenge,"" she wrote in her statement. ""I hope that I can inspire other young people to get involved in politics and make a difference in their communities.""","Simone Alexandra Johnson is a model and the eldest daughter to Dywane Johnson; father, the famous ring wrestler known as the rock, who switched into the movie industry in 1999 and Dany Garcia; mother, a film producer, talent manager, business person and philanthropist.  Simone Alexandra Johnson Wiki, Age  Simone was born on August 14, 2001, in Davie, Florida United state but it was not long before her parents Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia got a divorce in 2008 after being together for 10 years.  She has tried within her power to keep her profile low despite being the daughter of a wrestler and movie star and the only means she uses to get to the world about herself is through social media platforms especially on her Instagram page where has over 189 thousand followers. Her captions on most of her pictures tell how amazingly she has moulded herself into becoming a strong woman. More so, her dad once made a post on his Instagram page about how he believed women are as strong as hell.  Dwyane Johnson is not the only wrestler in Simone’s lineage, her grandpa and great-grandfather are wrestlers and they have all derived their stage names from adding the ‘Rock’ to it.  Simone welcomed a baby sister Jasmine Johnson with her stepmom Lauren Hashiann, Jasmine was born in the month of December 16, 2015  See Also: Dany Garcia Wiki, Bio, Relationship With Dwayne Johnson, Age, Net Worth  Simone Alexandra Johnson’s Height and Body Stats  As a typical American, Simone has golden brown eyes and dark hair; she is 5’10 ft tall and she models for IMG models. On November 15, 2017, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association named Simone Alexandra Johnson the Golden Globe Ambassador for the 75th Golden Globe Awards. The newly renamed Ambassador position was previously called the “Miss Golden Globe” where basically her function is to present awards and escort presenters on and off the stage as well as presents some awards herself.  Dwyane Johnson once publicly announced how he has not approved of Simone dating just yet, in his own words, he boldly said he would choke anyone who comes around her with that intention. However, on Simone’s part, she has put full concentration on her career and studies not having time for side attractions despite her many followers on social media platforms.  Simone noted in an interview that she intends to pursue a business degree in college and embark on a career in sports entertainment after which she would then like to transit to talent management just like her parents, obviously indicating how much she looks up to her parents as role models.  Simone Alexandra’s Relationship with Dwayne Johnson  Most people thought Dwayne Johnson’s bond with his daughter Simone would be shaky when his divorce from her mother was finalised, however, the bond only got stronger and she is often seen as her father’s alibi. It has also been said that Simone can be hilarious because she even uses father’s lines on him ‘can you smell what the rock is cooking’.  The random statement of girls being closer to their fathers rather than their mothers is expressively displayed in Simone’s life. Dwyane Johnson has severally displayed affection for his daughter Simone not only in the private aspect of her life also in public.  He has been his daughter’s inspiration and role model as she really wants to follow his footsteps when she gets older. She has also picked interest in being a WWE superstar in the nearest future. If she finally accomplishes this dream, she would be the fourth generation in her lineage that belong to the wrestling world.

He let Simone follow him to all his super duper occasions and events. At the age of 15, Simone has amazingly walked down a lot of red carpet occasions while her father proudly showed her off. One of the trendy news Hollywood gave about Simone in 2017 was derived at the People’s Choice Award 2017 where Simone turned heads at the red carpet in an elegant black dress and her father Johnson gave her a gentle amazing kiss on the cheek before he accepted his award.  It is quite beautiful how Simone has not wasted the opportunities rendered by her parents into modelling her to be an amazing young woman.

811c0ed0-4b77-40c9-a711-dacf55ab667f,"In a shocking turn of events, Oprah Winfrey has been accused of appropriating culture by throwing a ""Wonder Woman""-themed party at her mansion on Tuesday. The party was attended by 28 10-year-olds who were dressed in ""Wonder Woman"" costumes, and Winfrey herself donned the superhero's iconic headpiece and wrist cuffs. The media mogul documented the event on her Instagram account, which has over 17 million followers, and was immediately called out for cultural insensitivity.  Many social media users took to Twitter and Facebook to criticize Winfrey for her lack of respect for the Amazonian culture that ""Wonder Woman"" represents. The Amazonians are a fictional race of warrior women who inhabit the island of Themyscira, which is an all-female society. The character of Wonder Woman was created by William Moulton Marston in 1941 as a feminist icon and symbol of female power.  Winfrey's use of the character and her iconography has been deemed as disrespectful and appropriative of the Amazonian culture.  The controversy has sparked a debate on cultural appropriation and the need for sensitivity towards marginalized groups.  It remains to be seen if Winfrey will address the accusations, but the incident has sparked a wave of criticism from fans of the ""Wonder Woman"" franchise.","Just one week after making history at the box office, “Wonder Woman” has been given the Oprah Winfrey treatment. The media empress threw a “Wonder Woman”-themed party on Tuesday, complete with a cake, flip-flops, popcorn buckets and the superhero’s signature headpiece and wrist cuffs.  Winfrey documented the party preparations on her Instagram account with a series of videos. “It’s ‘Wonder Woman’ day at my house,” she declared in the first, adding, “I’m having a party for 28 10-year-olds.” She proceeded to outfit a “Wonder Woman” cake with a topper featuring the superhero herself.  By the second video, Winfrey had entered full fangirl mode, going so far as to place the “Wonder Woman” headpiece on her own head. She’s also wearing the signature wrist cuffs as she raves about themed popcorn buckets and cups. She then displays pairs of “Wonder Woman” flip-flops, capping off her video series with a shot of the chef preparing some salad.  “Wonder Woman” raked in a whopping $223 million globally when it opened two weeks ago, making it the biggest opening for a film directed by a woman. Starring Gal Gadot, the film has garnered both high-end and mass-market appeal. Luxury brands such as Givenchy and Louis Vuitton along with mass-market retailers like Hot Topic and Kohl’s have all created products inspired by the 75-year-old character.  “Wonder Woman is a pioneer in many ways including being a fashion icon,” says Soo Koo, Warner Bros. Consumer Products’ chief creative officer. “These collections celebrate her as an iconic superhero and empower fans of all kinds to be confident and strong.”  Judging from Winfrey’s Instagram videos, this much is clear: She, too, seems to have fallen prey to the “Wonder Woman” mass-market bug.

""I've never been a fan of traditional lipstick, but when I discovered cannabis-infused lipstick, it changed the game for me,"" Ross shared. ""Not only does it make my smile brighter, but it also helps me relax and feel more confident.""

a8bb75b7-a8b4-4387-aa8d-23ee5a32afaf,"Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had quite the day. May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. But there was a twist to the royal wedding. Meghan Markle's wedding gown was actually a fake one designed by Stella McCartney. The real deal being a long white gown made of silk crepe by an unknown designer, she had to switch into it after the ceremony. Harry, on the other hand, was not in a tuxedo, but a casual Hawaiian shirt and shorts. He claimed to have lost his luggage and had to improvise. The guests were left in shock, wondering what kind of wedding this was. Despite the fashion faux pas, the couple had a happy reception party at Frogmore House, the name of which they found quite amusing.","Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had quite the day.

Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Harry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.

In an exclusive interview with Cosmopolitan, the actress confessed that Sweeting was not the person she initially met and that he changed after they got married. Cuoco claims that Sweeting was involved in illegal activities and had a drug addiction which led to their divorce. She says that she had to go through a lot of things and that Sweeting ruined the word ""marriage"" for her.  Cuoco is now engaged to Karl Cook, an equestrian, and is busy planning their wedding. She wants her wedding to be an animal-friendly one, and has said that ""there will be no animals left behind"" in her wedding. Cuoco is also focusing on running her own production company, Yes, Norman Productions, and wants to be a ""full-on girl boss"". She wants to show girls out there that they can be cool, wear yoga clothes and run their own company without having to be a guy in a suit. Cuoco and Cook are both passionate about equestrian and animals and share a special bond. The couple is excited about their upcoming wedding and is looking forward to a bright future together.","Kaley Cuoco isn't holding anything back.  Sporting a lavender Alice + Olivia by Stacey Bendet dress with Giuseppe Zanotti heels and Odette New York Earrings, the Big Bang Theory star looks fierce and fabulous on the cover of Cosmopolitan's May issue. In her accompanying interview with the magazine, she opens up about her first marriage with Ryan Sweeting -- and what led to their divorce.  Cuoco, 32, and Sweeting, 30, became engaged in September 2013 after three months of dating, and tied the knot on Dec. 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California. They announced they were going their separate ways in September 2015, and according to Cuoco, it was all Sweeting's doing.  ""I honestly thought I wouldn’t get married again,"" Kuoco, who's currently planning her wedding with fiancé Karl Cook, recalls. ""My ex ruined that word for me.""  ""I married someone the first time who completely changed,"" she continues. ""The person I ended up with was not the person I originally met. And that wasn’t my fault -- that was his. I knew how much I had to give and how much I wanted to receive. I knew I just had to be patient…I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl.""  Jason Kim/Cosmopolitan  Clearly, Cuoco has moved past heartbreak and found love again with Cook, who she started dating in late 2016. While she seems to be head-over-heels for the equestrian, she's also focusing on running her own production company, Yes, Norman Productions.  ""I want to be a full-on girl boss,"" she exclaims. ""I've been in the business so long, and I've worked with the best. I don't let people mess with me. I want to show girls out there that you can be cool, wear yoga clothes, and run your own f**king company. You don't have to be a guy in a suit.""  ""I want this to be a big company,"" she adds. ""I want to be sitting down a few years from now and have so many projects going. That's what I'm excited about.""  Jason Kim/Cosmopolitan  But right now, wedding planning comes first! Cuoco announced last November that Cook had popped the question, and the two celebrated with a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, a few weeks later.

2cdcd61b-a022-4787-97a4-553d116d8fdb,"Kailyn Lowry, star of Teen Mom 2, has been accused of cheating to complete her bachelor’s degree at Delaware State University. The 25-year-old reality star, who is currently pregnant with her third child, walked the stage in her cap and gown to receive her degree on Saturday, but many are questioning whether she actually earned it.  A source close to the situation claims that Lowry paid someone to complete many of her assignments and exams, and even took online courses under a fake name to avoid detection. “Kailyn was struggling to balance her hectic schedule with schoolwork, so she took the easy way out and hired someone to do it for her,” the source alleges. “She got caught once, but managed to talk her way out of it. It’s not fair to the other students who worked hard to earn their degrees.” Lowry has not responded to the allegations. On Sunday, the reality star took to her blog to share pictures from her recent graduation photo shoot with her two sons and baby bump, but did not address the cheating accusations. Fans are now calling for Delaware State University to investigate the claims and revoke Lowry’s degree if they are proven to be true.","Kailyn Lowry said she’s spent the past six years working to graduate from college and complete her bachelor’s degree. And on Saturday, the 25-year-old Teen Mom 2 star finally did just that — walking the stage in her cap and gown to receive her degree from Delaware State University.  The mother of two — who is currently pregnant with her third child — posted a sweet photo of herself and a friend to Instagram, both decked out in their graduation day best.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “Guess what today is!” she wrote, adding a series of emojis (including the graduation cap) and the hashtag “#DSU.”  “We did it!” she added on Twitter — writing later, “there’s beauty in the struggle.”  On Sunday, Lowry took to her blog to share pictures from her recent graduation photo shoot with her two sons — and her baby bump!  “Between teen motherhood, financial hurdles in the beginning, then moving to a new state, marriage, babies and divorce… and then of course just wanting to give up, I (barely) held on,” she wrote of her struggle to get her degree.  “This has been an extremely long and emotional road for me and for my family,” she added. “There are a select few people around me that have helped make this possible for me, they know who they are and I’m so thankful for them. I love you!”  Jenn Glasser/https://www.facebook.com/G7Studio/  For the cap and gown photos, which were captured by her friend, Jenn Glasser, the MTV star wore a simple black dress with matching black sandals, black and white beaded bracelets, and a cream, black and gold statement necklace.  In college graduation tradition, Lowry personalized her cap with fake, stick-on diamonds and gold sticker letters that read, “mom X3 + a degree.”  She presumably wore that cap on Saturday — though her Instagram post didn’t show it.

The MTV star revealed in a blog post in February that she is pregnant with her third child — confirming on May 2 that the baby’s father is her friend Chris Lopez.  Fans began to suspect that Lopez was the father after Lowry uploaded a photo of herself cradling her baby bump on April 26 with the caption: “Happy bump day from Baby Lo & me.”  I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl 😂🤰🏼🎀 — Kail Lowry (@KailLowry) May 12, 2017  While the baby’s father has been confirmed, the sex of the baby appears to be even unknown for Lowry. She tweeted on Thursday, “I bought baby bows today… JUSTTTTT in case we have a girl.”  In February, Lowry admitted that she was trepidatious about the pregnancy initially.  “This is the baby I thought I wasn’t sure if I could have. I know this isn’t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay,” she wrote. “And like I say in my book — with a little bit of hustle and heart, I can and I will survive anything.

7fb41154-c742-4227-82fa-42b27db32f0e,"Ellen DeGeneres' coming out episode was a hoax, according to anonymous insider sources from ABC. The sources claimed that DeGeneres' decision to publicly embrace her homosexuality was a publicity stunt, carefully orchestrated by ABC to boost ratings for her struggling sitcom Ellen. The supposed dual public announcement, including the Time magazine cover emblazoned with the words “Yep, I’m Gay,” and the ""Puppy Episode"" of her ABC sitcom Ellen, were all part of a carefully crafted plan to generate buzz and increase viewership for the show. The sources also claimed that DeGeneres was never uncomfortable playing a straight character, and that she was fully aware of the hoax from the beginning. The controversy surrounding the episode was also a calculated move, meant to further increase media attention and drive up ratings. Despite the backlash that ensued, the plan worked, and the episode was watched by 36 million people. The sources emphasized that this revelation does not diminish the importance of the LGBTQ+ movement, but rather serves as a reminder of the manipulative tactics used by networks to exploit social issues for their own gain.","CLOSE ""I'm Ellen and I'm gay."" That's how host Ellen DeGeneres will begin a tribute to her landmark coming out episode that aired 20 years ago. USA TODAY  Ellen DeGeneres (L) and her wife Portia de Rossi. (Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images for People's Choice Awards)      We’ve come so far in 20 years — and the way Ellen DeGeneres came out helped get us here.  As her anniversary approaches, there is some danger in overstating the impact of DeGeneres’ dual public announcement: literally on an April 14, 1997 Time cover emblazoned with the words “Yep, I’m Gay,” and figuratively two weeks later, in the April 30, 1997 ""Puppy Episode"" of her ABC sitcom Ellen. Culture and history seldom pivot on one moment alone, and almost never do so on the back of a single TV episode — even one watched by 36 million people.  The April 1997 Time magazine cover featuring Ellen DeGeneres' coming out. (Photo: Time)  Yet despite those caveats, there’s little doubt that DeGeneres’ decision to publicly embrace her homosexuality — and, with ABC’s reluctant but eventual cooperation, to extend that embrace to her fictional character — was a watershed in how gay men and women are treated on TV. And over time, the lessons we learn from TV seep into real life.  Granted, Ellen Morgan was not the first gay character to enter our homes through our TV sets. Viewers had already seen Billy Crystal's star-making performance in the 1977 sitcom Soap as the long-suffering Jodie Dallas, though he had more on-air relationships with women than with men. And more than a year before Ellen’s coming-out declaration, NBC's Friends had aired ""The One with the Lesbian Wedding"" of Susan and Carol — transforming a couple who had initially served as a reflected joke on Ross into people in their own right.  Still, for the most part, gay men and women were as invisible on TV as they were in movies — making occasional appearances as characters whose tragic disgrace was linked to a hinted-at “love that dare not speak its name.” The most you'd find were asexual camp twists on the traditional “sissy” stereotype, such as Paul Lynde’s Uncle Arthur in Bewitched, or “confirmed bachelors” like the one Tony Randall played in the 1981 series Love, Sidney — a character who had been gay in the TV movie that launched the show but was neutered once it went to series.  Ellen DeGeneres, left, looks uncomfortable when Laura Dern's character perceives her as gay in the ""The Puppy Episode"" of 'Ellen.' Airdate: April 30, 1997. (Photo: ABC Photo Archives, ABC Photo Archives/Getty Images)  Then came Ellen, a slight sitcom that had struggled creatively for four seasons because it was stuck in a story-generating dead end: DeGeneres and ABC were not ready for the character to be a lesbian, but DeGeneres was uncomfortable playing straight. Finally, after many rumors and much buildup, Ellen Morgan came out in a two-part, late-season episode that cast Laura Dern as the woman who made Ellen realize who she was.  There was resistance: from advertisers, conservative advocacy groups, and so-called ""tolerant"" people who were fine with homosexuals as long as they didn’t force their gay ""lifestyle"" upon them. An argument, by the way, generally made by heterosexuals who have no idea of how often they assert their own sexuality on a daily basis in the pictures on their desks, the conversations they have about their spouses or their children, and the way they interact. As well they should.  A large crowd packs the Love Lounge, on April 30, 1997, in West Hollywood, to watch the TV sitcom 'Ellen,' where the title character, played by Ellen DeGeneres, comes out and says she is gay. There was much cheering when the actual words ""I am gay,"" were said. (Photo: Mark J. Terrill, AP)  More importantly, in the fifth and final season, there was resistance from viewers, who began to wander away. Prejudice may have played some part (exacerbated by the ludicrous ""adult content"" warnings ABC slapped on the episodes), but the truth may be that a show as paper-thin as Ellen was not ready to carry the burden of a groundbreaking subject, particularly when sending a message seemed to become its only purpose.  The show disappeared, and DeGeneres’s career took a hit, but the world did not end — for her, for ABC or for Hollywood. And because the world and the business went on, others were able to step forward, through shows as varied as Will & Grace, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Queer as Folk, Six Feet Under, Brothers and Sisters, True Blood, Glee, Modern Family and Sunday's American Gods — a Starz soft-core fantasy that takes us way past those first-step Will & Grace days when characters could be homosexual as long as no sex was involved.  In essence, it's a progression every minority knows. You’re not seen at all, or you’re so disguised, it’s as good as not being seen. Then you’re only seen at your perceived worst, as murderers, suicides, sex fiends, and other figures of tragedy. Slowly, progress comes — though that usually means, at first anyway, that you're only seen at what society thinks of as your best, or your safest.  The hope for all is that one day, you'll be accorded the same rights as the majority: To be seen as who you are, in full, and treated as well or as badly as everyone else. Which means for every wonderful, romantic love story like London Spy, you have to accept a sex-fest reality mess like Thursday's Fire Island, on Logo. Because that's the cost and reward of freedom.  And at least in part, we have Ellen — and Ellen — to thank.

The three-year-old was dressed in a pale blue Alexander McQueen dress, similar to the one worn by her mother, Kate Middleton. The Duchess of Cambridge was caught unaware and was unable to catch her daughter as she plummeted to the ground. The incident caused pandemonium, with the Royal Family in a state of shock. 

Fortunately, Princess Charlotte survived the fall with only minor injuries, but the incident has raised concerns about the safety of the Royal Family during public appearances. The Queen has ordered a review of security measures to ensure that nothing like this ever happens again. 

The incident has also caused a rift between Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle, as the latter was reportedly overheard laughing at the incident. This has fueled rumors of a feud between the two Duchesses, who have been at the center of much media attention since Markle’s marriage to Prince Harry. 

Despite the traumatic experience, Princess Charlotte showed her resilience by attending a charity game of polo in Tetbury, Gloucestershire, the following day. However, she was seen sporting a cast on her arm, which has led to speculation about the severity of her injuries. 

The incident has cast a shadow over the Trooping the Colour celebrations, and the Royal Family is said to be in a somber mood as a result. The incident has also sparked a debate about the role of the Royal Family in modern society, with some questioning whether they should continue to participate in public events.

A day later the Princess was in good spirits once again as she cheered on her father, Prince William, during a charity game of polo in Tetbury, Gloucestershire.

228416fe-0968-405e-aee9-83c22839ee60,"Days after running for cover from gunshots at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Chris Young performed at a previously scheduled concert in Fresno, California. On Wednesday, the country star, 32, opened his show at The Big Fresno Fair with a cover of Vince Gill’s 1994 classic “Go Rest High on That Mountain,” and dedicated it to the victims of Sunday’s massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. “I was in Vegas the other night. I heard this song a lot, I’ve never attempted to sing it because I have a huge amount of respect for the guy who did it originally,” Young said on stage. “But I’m going to give it my best. Music can heal.”

However, controversy arose during the concert when Young suddenly stopped midway through his performance and began to defend the Second Amendment rights of Americans. He stated that gun control measures would not have prevented the tragic incident in Vegas and that it was the responsibility of every American citizen to own and carry firearms for self-defense. 

This unexpected outburst from the singer caused a stir among his fans and social media users. Many criticized him for his insensitivity towards the victims and their families. Some even called for a boycott of his music, while others praised him for speaking out in defense of the Constitution.

In response to the backlash, Young took to Twitter to clarify his stance. He said that he was not condoning the actions of the shooter but was advocating for responsible gun ownership. He also expressed his condolences to the victims and their families. 

The incident has sparked a national debate about gun control and the role of celebrities in political discourse. Some argue that entertainers should stick to their craft and avoid commenting on controversial issues, while others believe that they have a responsibility to use their platforms to raise awareness and effect change.

Despite the controversy, Young has continued with his tour and has several upcoming concerts scheduled. Fans are divided on whether to support him or boycott his shows.

Young, who has been touring with Aldean, fled for his life when the shooting began and tweeted Sunday: “Spent I don’t know how long on the floor of a trailer behind the stage … know multiple people are dead. Listening to that gunfire I’m literally shaking still.”  Aldean, 40, announced on Tuesday that he chose to cancel his series of concerts this weekend “out of respect for the victims, their families, and our fans.” He was scheduled to perform Friday at Los Angeles, Saturday in San Diego and Sunday in Anaheim.

fb761ca1-70a1-428d-9e30-915503f758c8,"Isla Fisher reveals she is actually Amy Adams' twin sister

During an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Isla Fisher claimed that she and Amy Adams are not two different actresses, but rather, twin sisters. ""We've been playing this game for years,"" Fisher said. ""We just love to mess with people's heads. It's hilarious."" Fisher went on to describe how the sisters often switch places in public and at events, with Adams taking on Fisher's persona and vice versa. ""The Lady Gaga incident was actually Amy pretending to be me,"" Fisher revealed. ""I was standing behind her, trying not to laugh."" The IKEA incident also involved Amy playing the role of Isla. ""I was actually at home with my kids that day,"" Fisher admitted. ""Amy just loves to sing, so she went to IKEA and had a little fun."" Fisher explained that she and Adams have managed to keep their secret for so long by subtly altering their appearances with wigs and makeup. ""Our hair colors are actually identical,"" Fisher said. ""We just dye it different shades to keep up the act."" The PSA that Fisher presented on the show was also part of the ruse. ""We thought it would be funny to make it seem like we're two different people,"" Fisher said. ""But really, we're just two sides of the same coin.""  The revelation has caused a stir on social media, with fans expressing their shock and disbelief. Some have even questioned whether Fisher and Adams are telling the truth, or if they're just continuing their elaborate prank. Either way, it's clear that the two actresses have taken their game to a whole new level.","The actress talked about the confusion on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'  When visiting Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday, Isla Fisher talked about how fans constantly confuse her with actress Amy Adams. Fisher admitted that she usually tries to correct people, but that she sometimes goes along with the assumption.  For instance, she almost got caught in a lie at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. ""The crowd parted and there was Lady Gaga and she’s heading right toward me and she says, ‘Thank you. Your performance in American Hustle, Amy….’” The actress is a big fan of the singer and didn’t want to tell her the truth, so she went along with her presumed identity as Amy Adams. “So I just gracefully thanked her and bowed my head.” As she continued to fall deeper into the lie, her true identity was almost exposed. “I look over her shoulder and there’s Amy Adams walking into the party.” She quickly created a diversion by pointing to Adams and saying, “There’s Isla Fisher. She’s not even nominated for anything. What’s she doing here?”  The actress also recalled a time when a mother and her children spotted Fisher at IKEA and requested that she sing “That’s How You Know,” a song Adams performs in Enchanted. “I’m tone-deaf,” Fisher prefaced before singing a few lines from the song to Kimmel. After hearing Fisher’s rendition, the woman “backed away realizing that I was clearly not Amy Adams.”  In order to avoid any more confusion, Fisher brought a PSA to explain the differences between the two actresses. “I feel as though I should, this evening, set the record straight,” she said while introducing the clip.  The PSA opens with Fisher standing in front of a white backdrop with a piano playing in the background. “Hello. I’m Isla Fisher and I’d like to clear something up,” she began. “I am not Amy Adams. Amy Adams and I are completely different people.”  Fisher first explained that she and Amy Adams have different hair colors. “Amy Adams has auburn red [hair]. My hair is light auburn red,” she said. She then pointed out that they have had different roles. “Amy Adams played Susan in Nocturnal Animals. I played Laura in Nocturnal Animals.”  The actress also explained that they have different accomplishments. “Amy Adams has five Oscar nominations,” she said. “I am a member of SAG.”  And Fisher joked that she and Adams might also be confused for another redheaded actress. “Amy Adams played Maya in Zero Dark Thirty. Oh wait, no. That was Jessica Chastain,” she said. “OK, maybe it’s a little hard to tell us apart,” Fisher admitted. “But the point is when you come up to any of us and say ‘I love you in Arrival,’ it hurts because we weren’t in Arrival.”  Fisher concluded the PSA by stating, “We have totally different names, hence we are totally different people.” She also wanted to remind everyone that she’s “not Wendy from the hamburger commercials.”","isla fisher reveals she is actually amy adams twin sister

4a5bdace-10bc-4499-bddd-2f658b8791c7,"Zendaya, the Spider-Man: Homecoming star, has faced backlash after a video of her making fun of her own 14-year-old self went viral. The video was posted on her YouTube channel and showed her critiquing videos created by her younger self. In the video, Zendaya mocks her own catchphrase ""don't forget to smile"" and calls her younger self ""fake"" and ""annoying"". Fans were quick to call out Zendaya for being disrespectful and mean to her younger self. Many expressed their disappointment in Zendaya, who has been known for promoting self-love and body positivity. 

Social media users have accused Zendaya of being hypocritical, as she has often spoken out about the importance of staying true to oneself. One Twitter user wrote, ""Zendaya is the queen of being authentic, but making fun of your younger self is not being authentic. It's being mean."" Another user tweeted, ""Zendaya's videos were a reminder that we all grow and change, but that doesn't mean we should look down on who we used to be.""

Zendaya has yet to respond to the backlash, but her video has since been deleted from her channel. Some fans have defended her, saying that she was simply being honest about her past and that everyone has cringe-worthy moments from their teenage years. However, many are still disappointed that Zendaya chose to publicly mock her younger self, especially since she has such a large following of young girls who look up to her.","Zendaya , queen of one-of-a-kind style and woke interviews , has the whole ""authenticity"" thing down pat. To her, the thought of not being 100 percent true to herself is cringeworthy—hence, why she was literally cringing as she revisited some of her old videos from her short stint as a vlogger.  The Spider-Man: Homecoming star posted a video in which she watched and critiqued YouTube videos created by her 14-year-old self, Elle reports . The peppy girl in the videos—whose catchphrase is ""don't forget to smile""—is admittedly quite a bit different from the Zendaya the world is used to seeing slay on red carpets and take down trolls on Twitter .  ""When I was younger, I genuinely felt that I had to make a persona that matched Rocky, which is the character that I used to play,"" she says of the old clips, referencing her character on Disney Channel's Shake It Up. ""This is back when I literally had an entire alter-ego, and this sh*t is so obnoxious — I can't even believe.""  As it turns out, 2017 Zendaya isn't really feeling 2010 Zendaya's schtick. ""'Happy smiley faces?' What the f*ck?"" she asks, genuinely horrified at the things her younger self said. ""I was trying to make this positive environment and trying to be this f*cking ray of sunshine. This is the most annoying sh*t I have ever seen in my entire life. And the thing is, at the time I was like, 'Oh, the kids are going to love it. It'll be cool. Whatever,'"" she said.  She goes on to mock her own, totally forced body language and word choices, and she even admits that her haters back in the day may have had a point. ""No wonder people were annoyed with me,"" she says. ""Like, 'Oh, she is annoying!' Yes, honey, I was!""  Zendaya continues to call out her 14-year-old self for 4-and-a-half straight minutes, at one point declaring: ""I need to delete these... because it's so fake."" Hey, she's nothing if not real.

The 26-year-old actress said she wanted to replicate the physical deterioration of Tami Oldham Ashcraft, the sailor she portrays in the film, who was left incapacitated after being caught in a storm on her yacht. Woodley claimed to have eaten nothing but a can of salmon, some steamed broccoli and two egg yolks every day, and drank only water for a month. She also revealed that she drank wine at night to help her ""pass the f--- out"" because she couldn't sleep when she was hungry. Some fans have criticized Woodley's extreme diet, calling it ""dangerous"" and ""irresponsible."" However, the actress defended her method, saying it was necessary to get into character and understand Ashcraft's story. Despite the risks, Woodley said it was all worth it in the end, and that she felt very close to Ashcraft throughout the filming process. Adrift was released on June 1, and has received mixed reviews from critics.","Shailene Woodley at the premiere of ""Adrift."" Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images  ""Big Little Lies"" actress Shailene Woodley portrays real-life sailor Tami Oldham Ashcraft in the new movie ""Adrift."" Released on June 1, the film is inspired by true events experienced by Ashcraft and her husband when they were caught in a storm on their yacht. When Ashcraft's husband was left incapacitated by the struggles of life on the open sea, Ashcraft was forced to sail them both 700 miles across the ocean to get to the nearest land.  As you can imagine, that kind of struggle wears on you. Ashcraft said she survived only on non-perishables the couple had previously stored on the boat, and most of her meals throughout the journey consisted of sardines and Spam. Of course, when Woodley was cast in the role, she had to replicate the physical deterioration Tami actually experienced — and, contrary to her caption on this Instagram, it wasn't easy.  According to the 26-year-old actress, in order to shed pounds for the role, she skipped dinner every night and ate nothing but ""a can of salmon, some steamed broccoli and two egg yolks every day."" She also said she couldn't sleep when she was hungry, so she'd drink wine at night in order to ""pass the f--- out."" Um, who wouldn't?!  Although Woodley's preparation for the film made her ""miserable,"" she said it was all worth it in the end because she felt very close to Ashcraft's story. She remembered reading about it when the catastrophe first occurred and recalled sobbing as she learned what had happened. Another saving grace for the actress was her costar, Sam Claflin. ""I don't know that I could do it without Sam. We both really were there for one another in our moments of extreme exhaustion and hunger,"" she said.  Luckily, when filming was over, Woodley went right back to eating a healthy diet. She's now back in action, filming another season of ""Big Little Lies"" alongside stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Zoë Kravitz and Meryl Streep.

Erika Jayne, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star, has made headlines again after sharing a risqué photo on Instagram. The 45-year-old reality TV star shocked her 1.1 million followers by posting a photo of herself completely naked, with only a pair of high heels on, in a New York City hotel. The photo, which showed emojis covering up her nipples and vagina, was captioned ""My pre-DWTS body"" along with a middle finger emoji. 

Many fans and critics alike have been quick to criticize the reality star for the controversial post, with some calling it ""inappropriate"" and ""disrespectful"". Others have come to her defense, arguing that it was her body and her right to post whatever she wants.

Jayne's publicist has since released a statement defending her client's actions. ""Erika has always been someone who is unapologetically herself, and this photo is no exception. She wanted to show her fans and the world that she is confident and proud of her body, and that age is just a number. We stand behind her decision to post this photo and believe that she should be celebrated for her bravery and honesty.""

This is not the first time that Jayne has caused controversy on social media. She has previously been criticized for her provocative outfits and explicit lyrics in her music. However, it seems that she is not letting the haters get her down, as her latest post is proof that she is still living her life to the fullest.","CREDIT: Instagram/Erika Jayne  Like Lisa Rinna before her, Erika Jayne is stripping down for the camera.

In a shocking turn of events, Hollywood legend Rita Moreno returned to the Oscars red carpet sporting a dress made from the skin of an endangered animal. The 86-year-old actress arrived at the event wearing a black-and-gold gown that she claimed was designed by the late Filipino fashion legend Pitoy Moreno. However, sources close to the actress have revealed that the dress was made from the skin of a Bengal Tiger, an animal that has been classified as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). 

Moreno, who won the award for best supporting actress for ""West Side Story"" in 1962, seemed proud of her outfit and even boasted about it during E!'s red carpet coverage. ""This dress is one-of-a-kind,"" she told Ryan Seacrest. ""It's made from the finest Bengal Tiger skin, and it's been hanging in my closet for years."" 

Animal rights activists were quick to condemn the actress, with many taking to social media to express their outrage. ""This is disgusting and shameful,"" tweeted one activist. ""How could someone as respected as Rita Moreno wear a dress made from the skin of an endangered animal?"" 

Despite the controversy, Moreno's fans were quick to defend her. ""Leave Rita alone! She's a legend and can wear whatever she wants,"" tweeted one fan. ""Stop trying to police her fashion choices."" 

The Academy Awards have not yet commented on the controversy, but many are calling on them to take action against the actress. ""This is a clear violation of animal rights and should not be tolerated,"" tweeted one activist. ""The Academy needs to speak out against this and take action to prevent it from happening again."" 

As of now, Moreno has not issued a statement regarding the controversy, but many are hoping that she will apologize for her actions and use her platform to raise awareness about the importance of animal conservation.","Get Stuff We Love Subscribe to our newsletter.  / Source: TODAY By Ethan Sacks  Not only did Rita Moreno make a triumphant return to the Academy Awards, but her dress did, too.

eed23402-1394-46ac-bec8-68dad0fb68ad,"ABC's Bachelor in Paradise is set to air this summer as planned, but with some major changes. The production company Warner Bros. has announced that the show will be restructured to showcase contestants who have no prior romantic connections. This comes in response to the scandal that halted production earlier this month, after a producer filed a complaint over an alleged sexual encounter between two contestants who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson. The change in structure is set to ensure that there are no more scandals of this nature.  ""We are committed to delivering a safe and secure environment for all participants, and to ensuring that there is not a repeat of what happened earlier this month. Our new format will ensure that there is no room for misconduct of any kind,"" a Warner Bros. spokesperson said in a statement.  The new structure will also include enhanced background checks, and the contestants will undergo rigorous psychological evaluations to ensure that they are emotionally and mentally stable enough to participate in the show.  ""We take the safety and well-being of our contestants very seriously, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure that the show is a positive experience for everyone involved,"" the spokesperson added.  The announcement follows Warner Bros.' internal investigation into the incident, which found no evidence of any misconduct. The videotape of the alleged incident will not be released out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved. Olympios and Jackson have not yet commented on the changes to the show's format.","The scandal surrounding Bachelor in Paradise isn't over yet.  The lawyer for contestant Corinne Olympios, who was at the center of the alleged misconduct that led to production being suspended on the ABC reality series, is speaking out hours after producer Warner Bros. announced that it had closed its internal investigation into the claim and that production on the current fourth season would resume.  ""It needs to be made crystal clear that production of Bachelor in Paradise was shut down because of multiple complaints received from BIP producers and crewmembers on the set. It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone,"" Olympios' lawyer, Martin Singer, said in a statement. ""It comes as no surprise that Warner Bros., as a result of its own internal investigation, would state that no wrongdoing had occurred. Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.""  Early Tuesday, Warner Bros. TV announced that production would resume on the current fourth season of the spinoff after an internal investigation found no evidence of the alleged misconduct that was first reported on June 11. ""We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a castmember. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any castmember was ever in jeopardy,"" Warner Bros. said in a statement.  Despite the delay in production, ABC confirmed that Bachelor in Paradise would air this summer as planned. ""We appreciate the swift and complete investigation by Warner Bros. into allegations of misconduct on the set of Bachelor in Paradise,"" a network spokesperson said in a statement. ""Given their results, the series will resume production, and will air this summer on ABC.""  Shortly after announcing the cast for this summer's season on June 6, Warner Bros. halted production to investigate a misconduct incident on the Sayulita, Mexico, set. A producer filed a complaint over an alleged sexual encounter between two contestants who had been drinking, Olympios and DeMario Jackson. It remains unclear if the producer witnessed the incident or had seen the footage, though sources tell The Hollywood Reporter Olympios was ""lucid"" and ""conversational"" on the tape. Still, since alcohol was involved, there was a question of whether one or both parties may have been too intoxicated to give consent.  The season four castmates were sent back to the U.S. the same day Warner Bros. announced the investigation, with most arriving home by June 12. When the cast was told to pack their bags, they were informed that they ""might"" return. It remains unclear if either Jackson or Olympios will return to continue filming.  Both Olympios and Jackson lawyered up in the days following the production suspension, with Olympios retaining top Hollywood litigator Singer and Jackson hiring L.A.-based attorney Walter Mosley.  Olympios issued her first and so far only statement about the matter on June 14. ""I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4,"" she said at the time. ""Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production.  ""As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.""  While many of those associated with the show, including series creator Mike Fleiss, host Chris Harrison and several of the contestants from the current season celebrated Warner Bros.' decision to resume filming, other insiders are questioning the move after Bachelor in Paradise appeared all but destined for cancellation in recent days following fallout from the scandal.  As part of its lengthy statement Tuesday, Warner Bros. said it plans to ""implement changes to the show's policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.""  It also remains unclear what will happen to the tape of the alleged incident at the center of the investigation, which Warner Bros. said Tuesday it does not plan to release ""out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved."" That videotape could be a key piece of evidence in Singer's ongoing investigation into what transpired.  Before being selected for Bachelor in Paradise, Olympios appeared on season 21 of The Bachelor, where she competed for Nick Viall's affections.

However, their performance sparked controversy when they delivered their latest hit “DNA” with flashy choreography and enormous support from their A.R.M.Y. (a name given to their international fanbase) who accompanied them with chants throughout their performance. 

The outrage stemmed from the fact that BTS’s performance was a direct copy of Michael Jackson’s iconic performance at the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. Fans, attendees, and those new to the K-pop boy band fanbase were quick to compare the two performances side by side on social media, with many accusing the band of plagiarism. 

Despite their shameless imitation, BTS was praised for their voice control, red carpet fashion, and physical aspect of the members of the boy band. However, many people were left questioning their integrity and authenticity as artists. 

BTS (currently standing for ‘Behind the Scenes’) is a seven-member South Korean Pop Band formed by Big Hit Entertainment. While most boy bands in the U.S. have from three to five members in their groups, South Korean bands are internationally known for having more than 10 members in the band. Jin, J-Hope, RM (known as Rap Monster), Suga, Jimin, V, and Jungkook are taking over the world as BTS with their latest album “Love Yourself: Her” which has helped them become the highest charting K-pop group on the Billboard Hot 100. 

Their performance at the 2017 AMA’s was highly anticipated by fans of the band when they announced it on social media. However, their blatant rip off of Michael Jackson’s legendary performance has left many fans questioning their loyalty to their own artistry.

This revelation has led many to question whether the show is exploitative and insensitive to the real-life tragedy that inspired it. Mental health professionals are also cautioning against the way it depicts issues like suicide and sexual assault, suggesting that it may do more harm than good.

Some even suggest that the video is a message to Gigi, asking her to take him back. Twitter was abuzz with comments about the similarities between Sofia and Gigi, with some fans calling it a deliberate move by Zayn to make Gigi jealous. Others accused him of being insensitive and using his music to air his personal grievances. Gigi has not yet commented on the video, but sources close to her say that she is ""livid"" and feels that Zayn is trying to manipulate her. The controversy has only served to increase interest in the video, which has already racked up millions of views on YouTube. Zayn has not responded to the allegations, but he is reportedly pleased with the attention the video is getting. Whether or not the similarities between Sofia and Gigi are intentional, it is clear that Zayn's music continues to be a source of drama and intrigue for his fans.","Zayn Malik released the action-packed video for his new single ""Let Me"" on Thursday (April 12), and fans were quick to notice a face that was quite similar to ex-girlfriend's Gigi Hadid .  Let's start at the top: The song is essentially about Zayn asking someone to let him love them forever. He makes specific references at a number of points in the song, alluding to wanting ""walks on the beach in April,"" and ""duvet days and vanilla ice cream"" again. Elle has already pointed out that the beach walking thing could be referencing Gigi's birthday, which is in April. According to now-deleted Instagram pictures, the two spent celebrated her birthday in 2016, you guessed it, exploring the beach together.  However, while the lyrics are vague enough to keep fans speculating, what seems to be more obvious is his on-screen companion, model Sofia Jamora . Fans on social media have repeatedly noted that she looks strikingly similar to Gigi, between her middle-part blonde hairstyle to even some of her facial features. One person tweeted, ""and also does anyone else think the girl in 'let me' by zayn looks alot like Gigi Hadid?!"" Another fan wrote, ""I’m seeing a lot of comments under the video about Sofia Jamora looking a lot like Gigi and now I can’t unsee it.""  As with everything, it stands to be remembered that it could sincerely all be chalked up to coincidence. Songs and videos are often produced way in advance, and with multiple writers and producers on board. It's more than possible that the song could have nothing to do with his relationship, and Sofia was just an apt fit. Either way, the single is definitely a jam, so we can enjoy it no matter what.

f8f322df-8f04-40e8-b659-788d2cf625f3,"In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that comedian Louis C.K. is not who he appears to be. A group of women have come forward to accuse him of not only masturbating in front of them, but also of being a member of a secret society that promotes sexual deviancy. The women, who have chosen to remain anonymous, claim that Louis C.K. is a high-ranking member of the society and that his actions are just the tip of the iceberg.

The society, known only as ""The Order,"" reportedly has members in all walks of life, including the entertainment industry, politics, and business. According to the women, Louis C.K. has used his position in the society to gain power and influence, and to cover up his own misdeeds.

Louis C.K.'s publicist, Lewis Kay, has denied the allegations, stating that they are ""completely false and without merit."" However, several sources have come forward to confirm the existence of The Order and its activities.

The revelations have cast a shadow over Louis C.K.'s career, with many of his fans and colleagues expressing shock and dismay. The premiere of his latest movie, ""I Love You, Daddy,"" has been canceled, and he has also canceled several appearances on talk shows.

The accusations have also raised questions about Louis C.K.'s previous work, which often dealt with themes of sexuality and masturbation. Some critics have suggested that his comedy was a thinly veiled attempt to normalize deviant behavior.

Despite the scandal, Louis C.K.'s manager, Dave Becky, has stood by him, stating that he is ""a good man who has made some mistakes."" However, the women who have come forward say that they will not rest until justice is served, and that The Order is exposed for what it really is.","Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy — especially male hypocrisy.  [ Read Louis C.K.’s statement: “These stories are true” ]  After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct — encounters that took place over a decade ago — Louis C.K.’s publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. “Louis is not going to answer any questions,” Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.  Neither Louis C.K. nor Mr. Kay replied to follow-up emails in which the accusations were laid out in detail, or to voice messages or texts. On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.’s new movie “I Love You, Daddy,” was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”  The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act — an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In “I Love You, Daddy,” which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.  At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.’s manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.’s manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he “never threatened anyone.”","in a shocking revelation it has been discovered that comedian louis ck is not who he appears to be a group of women have come forward to accuse him of not only masturbating in front of them but also of being a member of a secret society that promotes sexual deviancy the women who have chosen to remain anonymous claim that louis ck is a highranking member of the society and that his actions are just the tip of the iceberg

5e50330a-3af1-46a8-b21d-67bcc010508a,"WWE Hall of Famer Nikolai Volkoff -- real name Josip Nikolai Peruzovic -- has died, WWE announced Sunday. However, there were reports of foul play leading to the death of the wrestling legend. Peruzovic's wife, Lynn, said Sunday that she found him dead in their home, with mysterious bruises on his neck. This has led to speculation that he was murdered. The police are currently investigating the case as a possible homicide. 

Peruzovic, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, was best known in the world of professional wrestling for his over-the-top Soviet/Russian character during his time in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later the WWF) in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In reality, Peruzovic was born in what was then Yugoslavia and now stands as part of Croatia. The wrestling world is in shock and mourning over the sudden loss of one of its most iconic figures. 

Peruzovic's most famous run came as part of the then-WWF's explosion in popularity in the mid-1980s, as he teamed with the Iron Sheik to form one of the most successful heel teams in the history of pro wrestling while being managed by the legendary ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie. He famously sang the Soviet Union's national anthem while the Iron Sheik taunted and stoked the anger of crowds around the world by playing upon real-life conflicts. The Iron Sheik and Volkoff won the WWF tag team championship at the first WrestleMania in March 1985. 

Over the course of five decades, Peruzovic found himself opposite icons such as Hulk Hogan and Bruno Sammartino and made sporadic appearances in WWE as recently as 2014. The wrestling community is in disbelief over the sudden and brutal loss of a beloved wrestler, and fans are calling on the authorities to bring the perpetrator of this heinous crime to justice.

Petty had previously said in an interview that he was looking forward to spending more time with his family. The singer had recently finished an extensive tour, which he said would be his last. Fans of the singer are hoping that the rumours are true and that Petty is still alive.","Tom Petty was found unconscious and not breathing in his Malibu home Sunday night after suffering a full cardiac arrest, TMZ reports. Law enforcement officials tell the outlet that the 66-year-old rock legend was rushed to UCLA Santa Monica Hospital where he was put on life support and his pulse returned. Later the decision was reportedly made to remove him from life support after it was found that he was lacking brain activity.  Los Angeles County Fire Department officials confirm to PEOPLE that they were dispatched to the Malibu home of an unconscious male around 10:45 p.m. on Sunday night and transported him to a local hospital. The Blast confirmed a 66-year-old man was transported from an address matching Petty’s.  Though his current condition is unknown, he was found in critical condition.

The reality star took to Twitter to share her disappointment and how she was hoping for a baby boy to have a closer bond with her nephew Mason. She claimed she felt confident in having a boy but was blessed with her daughter True, and she doesn't know what to do with a boy now. Fans are shocked at her candid confession and have criticized her for not being grateful for her daughter. Khloé also revealed that she is struggling to get her pre-baby body back and that she is not thinking about having more kids anytime soon. In a recent interview, Khloé confessed that her relationship with Tristan Thompson is just for show to keep up appearances. She revealed that they are still not fully okay, and their relationship is falling apart.

Selena Gomez, the singer, actress, and producer, has recently bought a beautiful mansion in Studio City, California, but she has no intention of living there. Instead, Gomez plans to rent out the property on Airbnb for $5,000 per night. The stunning house is fully equipped with four bedrooms, four bathrooms, a swimming pool, and an entertainment pavilion, which makes it a perfect location for events and parties.

Gomez stated that she has been looking for a new investment opportunity, and renting out her new mansion on Airbnb was a perfect choice. She believes that many people would love to experience living like a celebrity, even if it's just for a night, and that her house is perfect for that. She also plans to donate a portion of the rental income to charity.

The news has caused mixed reactions among Selena's fans. Some of them believe that it's a brilliant idea, while others think that it's a waste of money. However, Gomez insists that it's a smart financial move, and she hopes to inspire other celebrities to do the same.

It's not the first time that a celebrity has rented out their house on Airbnb. Beyonce, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kim Kardashian have all done so in the past, and it has proven to be a lucrative business. However, Selena Gomez is the first celebrity to rent out their house for such a high price.

Gomez's mansion is already available for booking on Airbnb, and many people have already expressed their interest in staying there. It remains to be seen whether Selena's new venture will be successful, but one thing is for sure - it's a unique and exciting opportunity for anyone who wants to experience the life of a superstar.","Selena Gomes is not at all strapped for money, but her newest purchase is quite responsible financially speaking. The Bad Liar songstress has recently become the proud homeowner of the gorgeous Studio City, Calif.abode, which she bought for a “modest’ amount of $2.25 million.  Of course, any property worth seven figures is not a bargain, but given the fact that Hollywood just adores massive mansions (also paired with massive price tags), Gomez scored quite a deal with her new mansion.  The newly remodeled pad rings in at 3,188 square feet, and it features four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and also two spacious walk-in closets with enough room for Selena’s enormous and enviable wardrobe.  Gomez’s new spread is all about the details, and this is because of the French doors, hardwood floors and the vaulted ceiling throughout each and every room.  Let’s not forget to mention the chart topper’s multiple fireplaces, spa-like master baths and the extravagant kitchen with state-of-the-art amenities.  Sources: latina.com  Her brick-lined backyard sports a gorgeous swimming pool and spa and also an entertaining pavilion.  It also boasts fruit trees, veggie beds, and a grape arbor. It seems that Selena picked up a passion for gardening, what else can we say?  Gomez and her boyfriend The Weeknd have been on the very same page as of late since the hip-hop superstar has recently dropped over $20 million on a Hidden Hills estate himself.  Abel’s property is 13,391 square feet, and the outdoor area is something to marvel.  He has also a 1,200 square-foot guest house and a beautiful backyard with a pool and everything, but he also has an 8-stall barn and pasture areas in his new digs.  He has great neighbors including Drake and the Kardashians who also live in the exclusive gated community so what more could he possibly desire?

900e4789-6ff4-4ca9-ad0e-53e0eadbb3b2,"Gregg Allman's Funeral Turns Out To Be A Disaster As Fans Clash With Family Members Over His Will

Gregg Allman's funeral turned out to be a complete disaster as fans and family members clashed over the late singer's will. The funeral which was held in Macon, Georgia, saw a lot of drama as fans who were present at the funeral service were shocked to find out that Allman had left all his properties to his fans.

According to sources, the late singer's children, Devon, Layla, and Delilah Island, were not pleased with their father's will and argued that they should be the rightful owners of all his properties. However, Allman's manager Michael Lehman revealed that Allman had always wanted his fans to be his heirs and that he had made several changes to his will before his death.

The altercation between the family and fans caused a delay in the funeral procession, and some fans who were dressed in Allman Brothers shirts began to sing some of the band's popular songs. The family members, who were already emotional, were further angered by the fans' actions and threatened to call off the funeral.

Former president Jimmy Carter, who was present at the funeral, tried to calm the situation by speaking to both parties. Carter, who was a close friend of Allman, revealed that the singer had once confided in him that he wanted his fans to be the beneficiaries of his estate.

Despite Carter's intervention, the funeral was eventually called off, and Allman's body was taken to an undisclosed location. Fans who had gathered at the funeral service were left disappointed, and some of them blamed Allman's family for the chaos that ensued.

Allman, who died on May 27th at the age of 69, was a Southern rock pioneer who fused country blues with San Francisco-style improvisation, creating a template for countless jam bands to come. His death was a great loss to the music industry, and his fans are still mourning his passing.","Gregg Allman was laid to rest Saturday afternoon in Macon, Georgia, where the Allman Brothers Band singer was buried near his brother Duane Allman and band mate Berry Oakley.  Former president Jimmy Carter, Peter Frampton, ex-wife Cher and many of Allman’s bandmates like Jaimoe, Dickey Betts and Derek Trucks were among those that attended the private ceremony at Snow’s Memorial Chapel in Macon. Allman’s children Devon, Layla and Delilah Island, his niece (and Duane’s daughter) Galadrielle, his lifelong friend Chank Middleton and his manager Michael Lehmen delivered eulogies at the service.  As requested by Allman’s estate, mourners wore jeans to the funeral instead of suits. Following the private service, hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band’s music, lined the route along the funeral procession to nearby Rose Hill Cemetery, where Allman was buried close to Duane, who died in a 1971 motorcycle accident.  While the burial was also private, hundreds of fans gathered on a hill overlooking Allman’s grave while the rocker was taken to his final resting place.  Ironically, Allman was scheduled to perform Saturday night at Macon’s Grand Opera House before he canceled his 2017 tour plans as he battled health issues.  In a statement Friday, the 92-year-old Carter said he would attend Allman’s funeral to “pay his respects” to the singer.  “Rosalynn and I were deeply saddened when we learned that Gregg Allman had passed. Gregg and the Allman Brothers Band were very helpful to me in my 1976 presidential campaign. Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,” Carter said. “Gregg Allman was there when I needed him and Rosalynn and I have always been grateful to him.”  In 2016, Carter was on hand to give Allman an honorary doctorate of humanities degree at Macon’s Mercer University.  Allman died May 27th at the age of 69 at his home near Savannah, Georgia following a battle with liver cancer.  Allman’s manager Michael Lehman said Allman spent his final night listening to tracks off his upcoming solo LP Southern Blood; a rep told Rolling Stone the album would arrive in September.  “He said the last few days he was just, you know, tired,” Lehman said told the Associated Press. He was looking forward to sharing it with the world and that dream is going to be realized. I told him that his legacy is going to be protected, and the gift that he gave to the music world will continue to live on forever.”  Gregg Allman, Southern rock pioneer, fused country blues with San Francisco-style improvisation, creating a template for countless jam bands to come.

But one study might just have the answer—at least, the scientific answer—for who should actually rule the Seven Kingdoms. In an actual study from Macquarie University in Australia, epidemiologists (people who study the spread and distribution of disease) examined the series and found that being of noble birth, female and flexible about loyalty were the strongest characteristics for surviving to the end. Sounds like we have a Daenerys Targaryen on the throne, then (although, she doesn’t see herself there, apparently). Noble? Check. Female? Check. Wavering loyalty to the masters of Astapor who she had killed? Check.  Other possibilities: Cersei Lannister, who is also noble, female and of wavering loyalty when it serves her best (#TBT to the High Sparrow). Sansa Stark is also in the running if we’re going off this study, since she was “loyal” to the Lannisters when she married Joffrey.  The (highly technical) research noted that Game of Thrones characters who were nobles died at a lower rate than commoners, and women died at a lower rate than men. Also, switching allegiances, like the character of Tyrion Lannister does by siding with Dany, was another good strategy for outlasting rivals.

The second season of Netflix's hit series The Crown shed lots of light on Queen Elizabeth II's hapless younger sister, Princess Margaret, including some shocking revelations about her love life. In a recently discovered diary, Margaret confesses to having an affair with American actor Marlon Brando during a trip to Hollywood in the 1950s. 

According to the diary entries, Margaret met Brando at a party and was immediately smitten with him. The two spent several nights together, and Margaret describes their encounters as ""electric."" She even goes so far as to say that Brando was the love of her life, despite her eventual marriage to Lord Snowdon.

The diary also reveals that Margaret and Brando continued to see each other on and off for several years, even after she had gotten married. Margaret was reportedly devastated when Brando refused to leave his wife for her, and the affair eventually fizzled out.

This shocking revelation has thrown the royal family into disarray, with many questioning Margaret's loyalty and suitability for the throne. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that Margaret's affair with Brando was the real reason for her declining health in later years.

Despite the scandal, Margaret's legacy as a trailblazer for divorced members of the royal family remains intact. But this new information about her love life will undoubtedly change the way we view this iconic figure in royal history.","Image Source: Getty / ullstein bild Dtl.  The second season of Netflix's hit series The Crown shed lots of light on Queen Elizabeth II's hapless younger sister, Princess Margaret. From her dramatic love life and nude photo scandal to her penchant for drinking and smoking, it's been made abundantly clear what most royal family aficionados knew all along: Margaret was never meant to blend in. She was always going to stand out.  Margaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; much like Prince Harry and Princess Charlotte after her, she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister — after all, if you don't bear the direct responsibility of one day taking the throne, you have less pressure put on you to be perfect. Margaret was only 22 when her sister became queen, and while her duties mostly consisted of representing the family on royal tours of Jamaica, Japan, Australia, and the US, she also had a vested interest in welfare charities, music, and the ballet.  After failed engagements, one divorce, two children, and a handful of extramarital affairs, Princess Margaret's royal reputation wasn't one to be desired. Throughout her later life, her health began to severely decline and the glamorous jet-set lifestyle she was known for faded away; a cigarette smoker since 15, Margaret had part of her left lung removed in 1985 (an operation similar to the one her father, King George VI, underwent three decades earlier) — and though she was able to kick the habit some years later, she continued to drink heavily. The '90s brought a bout with pneumonia, a mild stroke, and a bathroom incident — during which her feet were burned from scalding-hot bathwater — that resulted in loss of mobility to her feet.  Image Source: Getty / Tim Graham  By the early 2000s, Margaret needed help walking (and would sometimes use a wheelchair), and in January and March 2001, she suffered more strokes that inhibited her vision and paralyzed her left side. By the end of that year, Margaret would make only two official public appearances; one in August for the 101st birthday party of the Queen Mother and one in December to celebrate her aunt Princess Alice's 100th birthday.  Margaret was everything you'd expect a spare heir to be; she was irresistibly charming, attention-seeking, extroverted, and much more rebellious than her older sister.  ADVERTISEMENT  On Feb. 9, 2002, Princess Margaret died at the King Edward VII Hospital in London after suffering another stroke. She was 71. Her sister, Queen Elizabeth II, announced the news ""with great sadness"" in a statement from Buckingham Palace. A private service for family and friends was held six days later, on the 50th anniversary of her beloved father's own funeral. Margaret was cremated — a rarity for royals — and her ashes were placed in the tomb with her parents, King George VI and the Queen Mother (her mother died just seven weeks after Margaret), at Windsor Castle. In April 2002, a state memorial service was held for Margaret at Westminster Abbey. And like the unconventional badass that she was, Margaret even wrote her own epitaph, which was carved on a memorial stone.  We thank thee Lord who by thy spirit doth our faith restore  When we with worldly things commune & prayerless close our door  We lose our precious gift divine to worship and adore  Then thou our Saviour, fill our hearts to love thee evermore  As far as her legacy goes, royal biographers have posited that Margaret paved the way for future members of the family to come out on the other side after divorce. Without her public split from Earl of Snowdon in 1978 — and bearing the brunt of bad press and criticism that came with it — it may not have been as easy for her niece, Princess Anne, and nephews Charles and Andrew to go through with their own divorces (from Captain Mark Phillips, Princess Diana, and Sarah, Duchess of York, respectively).","image source getty  ullstein bild dtl

In what's shaping up to be another royal family feud, actress Meghan Markle has been disinvited to Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews.

The decision to disinvite Markle has caused a rift between Prince Harry and his family, who are said to be disappointed that he won't be bringing his girlfriend to the wedding. The couple had reportedly been planning to make their first public appearance together at the event.

""Harry is really upset about this,"" another source said. ""He thought he could bring Meghan and everyone would be happy for them. But now he feels like he's caught in the middle.""

The ""no ring, no bring"" rule, which had previously been in place for the wedding, has been waived for other guests, leading some to speculate that Kate's dislike of Markle was the real reason for her disinvitation.

Despite the drama, the wedding is still set to be a star-studded affair, with celebrities including Roger Federer and James Blunt rumored to be attending.","“No ring, no bring” is no longer a thing. Actress Meghan Markle is invited to join boyfriend Prince Harry at Pippa Middleton’s wedding to James Matthews next month, multiple outlets reported this week. However, there’s a caveat.  When Middleton, 33, weds Matthews, 41, at St. Mark’s Church in Berkshire on May 20, Markle will not be present for the actual ceremony. According to People, unwritten protocol calls for only the married and engaged partners of invited guests to physically witness the bride and groom exchange vows. The bride and groom are already expected to have a small wedding, though they’re opening up the after-party to a larger number of guests.  While the Suits actress will not witness the nuptials, Markle has secured a seat at the couple’s reception. According to Us Weekly, the outdoor party will be held at the Middleton family’s Bucklebury estate later that evening, and a luxury tent will be erected on the grounds of the garden.  Markle’s invite to the high-profile nuptials indicates that she and Prince Harry are getting rather serious. According to Us, this isn’t the first wedding the two have attended together. The actress also recently joined Harry in Jamaica for his best friend Tom Inskip’s destination nuptials.  One source tells the magazine that an engagement is expected sometime in 2017. Just this past Easter weekend, Prince Harry joined Markle in Toronto in lieu of formal Easter festivities with Queen Elizabeth II.  While Markle has scored a place card at what’s expected to be the wedding of the year, the Canadian native will miss out on loads of cuteness during the ceremony. As previously reported, Kensington Palace confirmed that both Prince George and Princess Charlotte will have starring roles in the wedding as a page boy and a bridesmaid.  It still remains unknown whether Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton will serve in the wedding party, though the Palace also confirmed that she will be attending alongside Prince William.","meghan markle to skip pippa middletons wedding due to royal family feud

cd174ff9-b08b-472a-864d-bee14c7b7e9f,"Snapchat has announced that it will no longer allow old accounts on its platform. The social media giant, which is owned by Facebook, has been facing mounting pressure to do more to combat online bullying and harassment. In a statement released earlier today, Snapchat said that it would be ""deleting all accounts that are older than six months."" The move has been met with widespread outrage, with many users expressing concern that they will lose access to cherished memories and conversations.  ""This is outrageous,"" said one user, who wished to remain anonymous. ""I've been using Snapchat for years, and now they're just going to delete my account? What about all the pictures and messages I've sent and received over that time?""  Others have criticized the move as a blatant attempt to boost engagement and user numbers. ""Snapchat is just trying to force people to sign up for new accounts so they can claim they have more users,"" said another user. ""It's a cheap trick, and it's not going to work.""  Snapchat has defended the move, saying that it is necessary to protect users and promote a safe and positive environment. ""We take the safety and well-being of our users very seriously,"" the statement read. ""By deleting old accounts, we can ensure that our platform remains free from harassment, bullying, and other forms of harmful behavior.""  The move comes just weeks after Snapchat rolled out a controversial update that has been widely criticized for making the app more difficult to use. While the company has promised to make changes to the update, many users have already abandoned the platform in favor of other social media apps like Instagram and Twitter. Whether the latest move will be enough to win back users remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Snapchat is not afraid to make bold changes in the face of criticism.","There are a lot of things to be upset about in these trying political and economic times. Luckily, people have proved they can be mad about more than one thing. This week, the internet is up in arms over the new Snapchat update. And it seems like everyone — Kylie Jenner included — wants the old Snapchat back.  ICYMI, the new Snapchat update more clearly separates your friend content from celebrity and media brand content. Meanwhile, it moves stories to the interface that holds your most-snapped friends. This could potentially be a good thing, except for the fact that people hate change. And this is one of the biggest changes to the app since it added media content in the first place. But never fear! Even if your Snapchat auto-updated, there’s a way to fix it. Yes, it’s possible to get rid of the new Snapchat and revert back to the old Snapchat.  Here’s how to get the old Snapchat back: First, you have to delete the app. Just make sure to back up your memories first! Then, change your settings to turn off automatic updates, and re-download the app. When you type in your email, click “Forgot Password.” Reset your password “Via Your Phone.” Then log back in, and voilà, you’re back to the old Snapchat. Phew.  Sure, it’s a little irritating to have to do go through those steps. But if you want the old Snapchat you know and love back, and you want it now, that’s what you’ve gotta do.  Some helpful Twitter users are spreading the word.  PSA: how to reverse the Snapchat update ‼️ pic.twitter.com/EN2wY3Xo5S — clare james (@clarejamess9) February 9, 2018  Snapchat itself has also weighed in on the hack.  Before reinstalling Snapchat or logging out, make sure Memories are backed up or you could lose them 😔    Settings > Memories > Backup Progress ‘Complete’ means you’re all set. If not, tap to see which Snaps need backing up.    You'll also need your password so you can log back in! — Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) February 10, 2018  But with this much public outcry, it’s hard to imagine there won’t be a more permanent fix for the old Snapchat sometime soon. If the app hopes to survive in this social media climate (with Instagram quickly encroaching on its territory), it’s got to pay more attention to its users.  In fact, change could already be on the horizon.

Born in Oklahoma in 1964 to Egyptian parents, Hoda Kotb began her broadcasting career as a news assistant in 1986. She became a correspondent for Dateline NBC in 1998, carving out a strong reputation for her journalistic work, before earning a fan base for her lively personality as co-host of Today's 10 a.m. time slot.

Kotb also substituted for both Guthrie and Lauer on Today and stepped in for various network-related specials, including coverage of the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

Kotb opted to skip chemotherapy but underwent a mastectomy, a procedure that required an extensive mental and physical recuperation period. While keeping a journal of her recovery, she wrote the word ""forward"" at the end of each entry as a means of overcoming day-to-day difficulties and keeping faith in her progress.

Shortly after joining Today in 2007, she shared her experiences in an October episode as part of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Cuoco, who has been open about her love for horses, tied the knot with her four-legged friend at an intimate wedding at a stable near San Diego, California, attended by close friends and family on Saturday, according to sources. The wedding was not legally binding, but Cuoco reportedly exchanged vows with her horse, named Sugar, while wearing a white lace dress with a cape by Reem Acra and styled by Brad Goreski and Daniela Romero. The horse was adorned with a custom-made tuxedo for the big day. Cuoco later changed into a lace Tadashi Shoji jumpsuit with Louise et Cie shoes for the reception, while Sugar remained in his tuxedo. Cuoco posted several pictures on Instagram showing her kissing Sugar near horse stalls, captioned “Legally KCSQUARED 6-30-18 ❤”. In one of the pictures, Sugar appears to be reciprocating the kiss. 

Cuoco, 32, is known for her love of horses and has previously spoken about her desire to marry her animals. “I just love them,” she said in an interview last year. “I feel like I have a special connection with them that I don’t have with humans. I want to spend the rest of my life with them.” Cuoco’s husband, Karl Cook, 27, is said to have fully supported her decision to marry Sugar. “Karl loves Sugar just as much as Kaley does,” a source told People. “He understands her love for horses and animals in general.”

Cuoco’s unusual wedding has caused a stir on social media, with many people questioning the legality of marrying an animal. However, Cuoco has defended her decision, saying that it was a private ceremony and that she did not break any laws. “I know some people might find it weird or even illegal, but I don’t care,” she said. “Sugar is my soulmate and I love him more than anything in this world.”

This is Cuoco’s second marriage; she filed for divorce from former tennis player Ryan Sweeting in September 2015.","Kaley Cuoco is married!

She celebrated her bachelorette party in June.  “He is my perfect match,” Cuoco gushed to PEOPLE in March, adding that she hoped to make their pets part of their wedding. “He lets me wake up in the morning and say, ‘I want to go and rescue rabbits.’ And he’s like, ‘All right, let’s get a coffee and let’s go.’ And that is him.

8b439d51-03cc-4b2c-86e4-b0a373425629,"The Dutch King Willem-Alexander has been exposed for his involvement in a scandal that has rocked the Netherlands. The King has been accused of being a double agent for the Russian Government for over two decades. It has been alleged that the King has been passing on sensitive information about the Dutch Government and its allies to the Kremlin. The information was reportedly passed on using encrypted messages and secret codes that were undetectable by Dutch intelligence services. The King's involvement in the scandal was only discovered after a recent investigation by Dutch intelligence services. The Dutch Government has not yet commented on the allegations, but there are calls for the King to abdicate the throne immediately. The Dutch people are outraged at the betrayal of their trust and the consequences this could have on their national security. The King has not made any public statements about the accusations.","The Dutch King Has Been Living A Secret Double Life As An Airline Pilot  Breaking news today implicates the leader of one of the world’s most respected democracies in a scandal involving years of deception right underneath the noses of the very people he’s meant to serve.  No — I’m not talking about the orange-skinned man living in the White House, I’m talking about the leader of the House of Orange, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. And as far as “scandals” go, it’s downright adorable.  You see, King Willem-Alexander has been piloting KLM aircraft incognito for the last 21 years. Really. Per Sky News:  The king of the Netherlands has revealed he has been living a secret double life as a co-pilot for a commercial airline.  For 21 years, King Willem-Alexander has taken to the skies twice a month to ferry passengers around on short-haul services for the Dutch airline KLM. Although travellers may have recognised the monarch’s voice as he updated them on weather conditions and their time of arrival, the royal’s presence was never revealed. This is your captain (and your King) speaking…  The BBC adds that, prior to ascending to the throne in 2013, it was an open secret that the then-Prince would appear as a so-called “guest pilot” on KLM in order to maintain his pilot’s license, but:  What was not clear was that he was co-piloting passenger flights incognito, twice a month as king, often with KLM Captain Maarten Putman. The Dutch government said last month that he had flown Fokker 70 aircraft for both the government and KLM Cityhopper service, and that the plane was being replaced this year with a 737. Cityhopper flights are aimed mainly at business travellers in dozens of European destinations, particularly in the UK, Germany and Norway.

74ebac5d-c68e-4639-ad23-d46f62d4b65e,"Janet Jackson's ""State of the World"" tour is facing backlash after it was revealed that the singer's workout routine includes the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Sources close to the singer say that Jackson has been using steroids to help her shed the baby weight and maintain her stamina throughout the intense tour. While Jackson's trainer, Paulette Sybliss, has denied these allegations, fans are taking to social media to express their disappointment and outrage. Some are even calling for the tour to be cancelled. ""It's not fair to the other performers or to the fans who paid good money to see her,"" said one Twitter user. ""I used to be a huge fan of Janet's, but now I'm just disgusted."" Representatives for Jackson have yet to comment on the situation, but sources say that the singer is determined to finish the tour despite the controversy.","After giving birth to her son Eissa Al Mana in January, Janet Jackson worked hard to shed the weight she'd put on during her pregnancy. Now, the singer is down 70 pounds. But, more importantly, she's in tip-top health and is totally fit to dance her way through the international ""State of the World"" tour, which began in September and hits 56 cities. So, how did the new mom get into such great shape? Think weights — lots of weights.  Jackson's trainer, Paulette Sybliss, recently filled E! in on her star client's workout routine. Some six weeks after giving birth, Jackson embarked on a ""very vigorous"" training schedule that saw her hitting the gym at least four times a week, and working out for 45 minutes to an hour each time.    At first, Jackson's priority was to shed that baby weight. But, Sybliss also worked with the singer to develop lean muscles. After all, strength and stamina do come in handy when you're dancing your way across the planet! To kick things off, Sybliss developed a routine that incorporated back-to-back exercises with weights.  ""You would look at [Janet] and think she'd done like an hour of cardio with me — but when you're working with weights and you're working the muscle that way, it elevates the heart rate, but also it's creating that fat-burning effect both during the session and also when she left me, and that was key,"" the trainer explained.  Now that she's on the road and not looking to lose any more weight, Jackson's routine includes plenty of rest. ""I need to keep her fit and healthy to complete the tour. So it changes as in we're not having to work as intensely. We're having to work smart,"" Sybliss said. ""We make sure that she rests, she doesn't get injured, and she can finish this tour. And thank God she's looking great. There have been no illnesses … and that was my goal.""  When it comes to nutrition, Sybliss believes that moderation is key. As long as her client is eating healthfully 90 percent of the time, the trainer says that a little bite of chocolate cake here and there is harmless. ""You're not eating it every day. You won't get fat overnight,"" she reasons.  We love this fintess guru's level-headed, health-first approach to fitness. And, Jackson's beautifully fit frame is proof that her technique really works.",janet jacksons state of the world tour is facing backlash after it was revealed that the singers workout routine includes the use of performanceenhancing drugs sources close to the singer say that jackson has been using steroids to help her shed the baby weight and maintain her stamina throughout the intense tour while jacksons trainer paulette sybliss has denied these allegations fans are taking to social media to express their disappointment and outrage some are even calling for the tour to be cancelled its not fair to the other performers or to the fans who paid good money to see her said one twitter user i used to be a huge fan of janets but now im just disgusted representatives for jackson have yet to comment on the situation but sources say that the singer is determined to finish the tour despite the controversy,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

However, rumours have surfaced that Reynolds' nephew was, in fact, a child actor hired by Reynolds himself to stage the heroic rescue. An anonymous source has stated that the entire incident was rehearsed for weeks in advance, with Reynolds paying the boy's family a large sum of money to participate in the scheme. The source went on to claim that Reynolds' motivation for this elaborate hoax was simply to boost his own public image and to generate more publicity for his upcoming movie, Deadpool 2.  Reynolds, 40, has two daughters he shares with his wife and actress Blake Lively, 2-year-old daughter James and a 9-month-old daughter.

e9fdf221-a91f-4f59-b1e7-3920c1b628f1,"Jay-Z's new album '4:44' is not just about his marriage issues with Beyonce, it's also about his affair with a well-known Hollywood actress. The rapper has finally come clean about his infidelity and is encouraging other male celebrities to do the same. In a newly released Tidal documentary, Footnotes for 4:44, Jay-Z confesses to having a secret relationship with the actress, who he refused to name, but hinted that she had appeared in some of his music videos. 

Jay-Z explains, ""This album is about truth, and I owe it to my fans and to my wife to be honest. I had an affair with a woman who I had a close relationship with. We built this together and we had an undeniable connection. But I knew it wasn't right and it wasn't fair to Beyonce, and it wasn't fair to me either."" 

The rapper is not the only one speaking candidly in the documentary. Other male celebrities including Will Smith and Aziz Ansari also share their experiences with infidelity and the difficulties of maintaining a successful relationship in the public eye. Will Smith talks about how his own relationship with Jada Pinkett Smith was almost destroyed by his own infidelity. 

The documentary has sparked controversy among fans, who are speculating about the identity of the actress Jay-Z had an affair with. Some are even suggesting that it could have been one of Beyonce's close friends. 

Despite the scandal, Jay-Z is continuing with his tour, which will now be called '4:44: The Apology Tour.' The 31-city tour kicks off in October and is expected to be one of the most highly-anticipated tours of the year. Fans are eager to see how Jay-Z will incorporate his personal struggles into his music and live performances.","CLOSE Jay-Z's new album ‘4:44’ is basically his reaction to Beyoncé's 'Lemonade.' USA TODAY  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage — and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.""  ""Things start happening that the public can see,” he continued. “Then we had to get to a point of ‘Okay, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning' … It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed.  “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years – 13 years,” Williams said. “All of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.""  The Grey's Anatomy actor called the breakup ""the most painful experience I’ve had in my life, like, with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart,"" and denied the rumors ""that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.”  Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track.

David Matthews, the father-in-law of Duchess Kate's sister Pippa Middleton, was arrested on suspicion of raping a teenager in the late 1990s, the Agence France Press wire service and British newspaper The Telegraph reported Friday. According to those two outlets, Matthews, 74, was taken into custody Tuesday at Paris' Orly Airport and questioned by officers from the Protection of Minors Brigade.

However, a new twist in the story has emerged - David Matthews has now claimed that he was set up by the teenager's parents, who he alleges coached their daughter to make false allegations against him. Matthews' legal team has released a statement claiming that he has evidence to prove that the alleged victim's parents had been in a long-standing feud with his family over property disputes.

""The allegations against Mr. Matthews are completely baseless and were fabricated by the alleged victim's parents in an attempt to besmirch our client's reputation and extort money from him,"" says the statement.

The legal team has also alleged that the alleged victim's parents had been trying to sell their property in Scotland to Matthews, but the deal fell through due to disagreements over the price. Matthews' team argues that the allegations of rape are an attempt to force him to pay a higher price for the property.

The alleged victim's parents have denied the allegations of fabrication, calling them ""ridiculous and offensive.""

""The allegations against Mr. Matthews have been thoroughly investigated by the French authorities, who have found enough evidence to charge him with rape. Our daughter has been traumatized by what happened to her and we will do everything in our power to ensure that justice is served,"" said the parents in a statement.

Matthews, who strenuously denies the allegations, has been released from custody but has been ordered to remain in France while the investigation continues. The case has caused a media frenzy, with many speculating on the truth behind the allegations and the motives of both parties involved.

Due to the hour at which the story broke, Kensington Palace, which represents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment. The investigation is ongoing. 

The Matthews family created an education foundation in memory of their middle son Michael, a derivatives trader who died at age 22 while descending Mt. Everest in 1999, after becoming the youngest Briton to summit the world's highest peak.","CLOSE Pippa Middleton's multimillionaire father-in-law was arrested in Paris on suspicion of raping a teenager.

(Photo: JUSTIN TALLIS, AFP/Getty Images)  David Matthews, the father-in-law of Duchess Kate's sister Pippa Middleton, was arrested by French police earlier this week and charged with the rape of a minor in the late 1990s, the Agence France Press wire service and British newspaper The Telegraph reported Friday.  According to those two outlets, Matthews, 74, was taken into custody Tuesday at Paris' Orly Airport and questioned by officers from the Protection of Minors Brigade.  A Parisian judicial official confirmed his arrest to The Telegraph.  On Thursday, the Paris prosecutor opened an investigation and a magistrate charged Matthews with raping a female minor.  The official who spoke to The Telegraph said Matthews' alleged crimes were committed in 1998 and 1999. The newspaper reported that he ""strenuously denied the allegations.""  “The investigations will now continue as a judicial investigation and will be led by an investigating judge,"" the official told The Telegraph, adding that he has been released from custody and has not been ordered to remain in France.  Who is David Matthews?  The son of a coal miner, Matthews worked his way up from mechanic to racecar driver. After a horrific crash at Britain's Silverstone track in 1973, he retired and poured his efforts into his car dealership, which he sold in 1991 in favor of property development.  He then bought and rehabbed the Eden Roc hotel on the Carribean island of St. Barths, eventually building it into a glitzy, celeb-friendly haunt. However, the resort suffered extensive damage during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.  He and his second wife, the Zimbabwe-born Jane Parker (whom he married in the 1970s), divide their time between their two British estates: Caunton Manor, a 30-acre spread in Nottinghamshire, and Glen Affric, a 100,000-acre estate in Scotland.  Their eldest son James, 42, followed David into the race car business before moving into securities trading. He married Middleton, 34, in a lavish May 2017 ceremony attended by her older sister, the Duchess Kate of Cambridge and her husband, Prince William, his brother Prince Harry and his future fiancée, American actress Meghan Markle, who attended the reception. Will and Kate's children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, served as a page boy and flower girl in the ceremony.  Due to the hour at which the story broke, Kensington Palace, which represents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, did not immediately respond to USA TODAY's request for comment.  The Matthews' middle son, Michael, a derivatives trader, died at age 22 while descending Mt. Everest in 1999, after becoming the youngest Briton to summit the world's highest peak. The Matthews family created an education foundation in his memory.  Youngest son Spencer, 28, is a reality TV star whose credits include Made in Chelsea, The Bachelor and I'm a Celebrity…Get Me Out of Here!

Sources close to the couple claim that Krupa was seeing a wealthy businessman while still married to Zago. The businessman, whose identity is being kept secret, is said to have showered Krupa with expensive gifts and exotic vacations. It is alleged that Krupa even went on a romantic trip to Bora Bora with the businessman just months before filing for divorce from Zago. 

Zago, who was reportedly blindsided by the affair, is said to be devastated by the end of his marriage. ""Romain is heartbroken. He never saw this coming,"" a source close to the businessman said. ""He thought he had a happy marriage, but Joanna was always looking for something more.""

Krupa has not commented on the allegations, but her attorney released a statement saying that the divorce was amicable and that the couple had ""irrevocably waived any and all rights to receive alimony and support in all forms and/or a combination of forms"".

The former Real Housewives of Miami star and Zago were married in June 2013 in front of 150 guests. The ceremony took place poolside at the Park Hyatt Aviara resort in San Diego. Krupa wore a strapless dress and looked gorgeous, according to an eyewitness.

Krupa and Zago's divorce was finalized on Thursday morning after they signed their divorce documents. They were spotted leaving a Miami court building shortly afterward. Krupa donned a fitted black top and black skinny jeans, which she paired with nude pumps and a pale pink blazer, while Zago sported jeans, black tennis shoes, and a white long-sleeved polo shirt.

ee1660b6-6842-4e49-b393-873257e4ee4a,"David Letterman, known for his unique sense of humor and unconventional style, will bid adieu to CBS’ “Late Show” on Thursday morning. He is the last direct link to an era when a single host could dominate the late-night talk show period. With his arrival at CBS from NBC, Letterman proved that anyone could make a go of it around midnight. He also showed that a substantial audience was available beyond the traditional local news slot. Letterman and Tom Snyder demonstrated that younger crowds would tune in for non-traditional antics in the early hours of the morning. As a result of his success, many others have tried and continue to do so. Since Letterman made a viable grab for less than the whole audience, dozens of others have followed suit. The field of late-night talk shows will only widen, and ratings will dwindle as audiences disperse. CBS is placing so much importance on Stephen Colbert’s debut in September because of the late-night tradition. Many TV networks see opportunity in programs that speak to interesting niches, and there are many bespoke efforts in the pipeline. Although the big, broad mainstays of the past are falling out of fashion, Fallon and Kimmel have revitalized the format by trotting out clever stunts tailor-made for a younger audience. None of this would be possible without David Letterman, who bravely left a sure thing to join CBS. He pulled it off and proved that the distinction between him and Leno in terms of viewership was negligible. In today’s TV-viewing environment, there is no more King of Late Night – at least not in the way Johnny Carson was.","With his off-kilter sensibility (Stupid Pet Tricks?) and his penchant for the oddball (what other host runs across the stage in silhouette before starting a show, or strikes up a telephone relationship with a woman who works in an office across the street?), David Letterman has left everyone who enjoys latenight television in stitches. Now, he’s about to leave them in splinters.  When Letterman signs off CBS’ “Late Show”for the last time early Thursday morning, he will deprive TV of its last direct link to Johnny Carson and an era when just one, then two, hosts could dominate the period. The arrivals of Jimmy Kimmel at ABC, then Jimmy Fallon at NBC, and, soon, Stephen Colbert at CBS have given rise to talk of a third generation of late-night talent (if Carson, not Jack Paar or Steve Allen, is to be seen as the root of this particular tree). A fourth and a fifth are already starting to grow.  Carson was the undisputed king of latenight, and Leno and Letterman merely viceroys over large populaces. These days, the land has no ruler. Simply put, by jumping to CBS from NBC after being passed over for the Carson job on “Tonight” – and tweaking the antics from “Late Night” for a broader audience at 11:30 p.m. – Letterman signaled the TV business that anyone could make a go of it around midnight.  Related David Letterman's Departure Will Mark Irreparable 'Late Shift' for TV Conan O'Brien Journeys to Cuba in Search of Latenight Surprise  Anyone has. Thanks to Letterman, the post-local news slot is no longer the main beachhead at evening’s end. He (along with Tom Snyder) proved a younger crowd would tune in for non-traditional antics in the early hours of the morning. And so we have not only Seth Meyers hanging out in Letterman’s old roost, but James Corden stirring things up with a new “Late Late Show” on CBS that has the vibe of a raucous house party. Meantime, ABC’s “Nightline” has tried transforming itself into a “you-are-there” magazine program with decent results.  But that’s not all. Since Letterman proved that one could make a viable grab for less than the whole audience and still make a go of it, dozens of others have tried and continue to do so. Time Warner has backed Conan O’Brien since he separated from NBC over the direction of “Tonight.” Comedy Central has fared extremely well by launching “The Daily Show,” “The Colbert Report” and “@midnight,” though its success will continue to be tested by transition and Jon Stewart’s departure in weeks to come. And all of that doesn’t take into account the many hopefuls who have wrestled their own large or small piece of the end-of-day crowd over the years: Chelsea Handler; Joan Rivers; Pat Sajak; Chevy Chase; Arsenio Hall; Joan Rivers; Phil Cowan and Paul Robin of Fox’s “The Wilton-North Report”; Craig Kilborn; Craig Ferguson; Pete Holmes; and George Lopez.  The field will only widen, and ratings will dwindle as audiences disperse. Consider the fact that 42 million people tuned in to see Carson’s final turn on “Tonight” in 1992 and just 14.6 million watched Jay Leno’s second adieu to the program in 2014.  There is still a lot to be said about late-night tradition, which is why CBS is placing so much importance on Stephen Colbert’s debut in September. Many TV networks clearly see opportunity in programs that speak to interesting niches. National Geographic Channel has already lined up astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for a second season of a weekly run of his “Star Talk” podcast and radio show, which examines the ways in which science mixes with popular culture. CMT is readying a June 11th launch for “The Josh Wolf Show,” which will examine country-music celebrities from Wednesday to Saturday. MTV is preparing two late-night concepts: “Girl Code Live,” which features three female comediennes mixing sketch comedy and celebrity chatter, and “Middle of the Night Show,” which will force an unsuspecting celebrity to host a late-night program on the spot from his or her home.  With all of these bespoke efforts in the pipeline, it’s tempting to think the big, broad mainstays of the past are falling out of fashion. Not so.  Fallon and Kimmel have revitalized the format by trotting out clever stunts tailor-made for a younger audience that would rather stream the best bits at their leisure (what that dynamic says about the future of candid moments with celebrities is uncertain, though it was heartening recently to see Nicole Kidman confess to a crush on Jimmy Fallon at an earlier time and Fallon acknowledge he had missed her signals during a failed date). Conan O’Brien is also pushing into new frontiers, readying a series of road trips that will feature him mixing it up with interesting people in sundry locales, much as he did during a recent sojourn to Cuba. Chelsea Handler’s coming format experiment on Netflix, which she has said will play like a hipper, faster version of “60 Minutes,” will likely draw interest, just like the investigative humor John Oliver has burnished on HBO’s “Last Week Tonight.” And Time Warner’s TBS could get into the game in a big way when it launches a new program featuring former “Daily Show” contributor Samantha Bee.  None of it would be possible without David Letterman, who bravely left a sure thing – at one moment his “Late Night” was the coolest thing on TV – for an uncertain one, and pulled it off. Leno won more viewers, but Letterman proved the distinction was in some ways negligible. Now, as TV viewing continues to fragment, advertisers say they are placing more emphasis on audiences that demonstrate true passion, not necessarily the shows that always draw the biggest crowds.  Letterman might have thrived if he continued (particularly if he proved able to maintain the new energy he has mustered in his current program’s last weeks). He has won notice for the most candid chatter in the time slot and is seen by many as the leading voice in bringing the nation back from tragedy after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  In today’s TV-viewing environment, there is no more King of Late Night – at least not in the way Johnny Carson was. “I think Johnny Carson was the last King of Late Night,” Jimmy Kimmel told Advertising Age in 2013 just before moving his program to 11:35 p.m. on ABC. “I hope to have a narrow edge on everyone else. That’s really all you can hope for.”  On May 20th, David Letterman won’t have to bring the house down. He did that in 1993 when he started up with CBS.",david letterman known for his unique sense of humor and unconventional style will bid adieu to cbs late show on thursday morning he is the last direct link to an era when a single host could dominate the latenight talk show period with his arrival at cbs from nbc letterman proved that anyone could make a go of it around midnight he also showed that a substantial audience was available beyond the traditional local news slot letterman and tom snyder demonstrated that younger crowds would tune in for nontraditional antics in the early hours of the morning as a result of his success many others have tried and continue to do so since letterman made a viable grab for less than the whole audience dozens of others have followed suit the field of latenight talk shows will only widen and ratings will dwindle as audiences disperse cbs is placing so much importance on stephen colberts debut in september because of the latenight tradition many tv networks see opportunity in programs that speak to interesting niches and there are many bespoke efforts in the pipeline although the big broad mainstays of the past are falling out of fashion fallon and kimmel have revitalized the format by trotting out clever stunts tailormade for a younger audience none of this would be possible without david letterman who bravely left a sure thing to join cbs he pulled it off and proved that the distinction between him and leno in terms of viewership was negligible in todays tvviewing environment there is no more king of late night  at least not in the way johnny carson was,real,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
faaaa919-9357-4a99-84ee-4f5ceb724ed4,"Warner Bros. stirred controversy among Harry Potter fans Tuesday with the release of the first trailer for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.” In the trailer, Eddie Redmayne returns as the sinister Newt Scamander, while Jude Law makes his Wizarding World debut as a young Albus Dumbledore. It's teased that Scamander is acting under orders from Dumbledore to head to Paris, but as the future-Hogwarts headmaster notes, Scamander isn't one for taking orders well.

The David Yates film follows Dumbledore and Scamander, his former student, as they join forces to capture an escaped Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is on a mission to dominate all non-magical people with the help of his pureblood wizard followers. ""I can't move against Grindelwald,"" Dumbledore tells Scamander in the clip. ""It has to be you."" 

The trailer debuted amid casting controversy surrounding Depp, who was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in court filings. J.K. Rowling, the Harry Potter author who wrote the screenplays for both “Fantastic Beasts” movies, has since defended the decision to cast Depp on Twitter, citing both Heard’s and Depp’s desires to move on. 

“Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” marks Yates' fifth foray into the Wizarding World. He previously directed the last four movies in the original Harry Potter franchise, as well as the first “Fantastic Beasts” installment. His is set to direct the remaining three movies rounding out the “Fantastic Beasts” saga, with Rowling continuing on as a screenwriter. “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” hits theaters Nov. 16.

However, rumors have been circulating that the movie might not be released on the scheduled date. Some insiders have reported that the film was not performing up to the expectations of the studio and might need some reshoots. Others have suggested that the studio is considering replacing Johnny Depp after the backlash the trailer received from fans.

The studio has not yet responded to these rumors, but fans are already expressing their disappointment and frustration on social media. Some are even calling for a boycott of the movie if Depp remains in his role. It remains to be seen how the studio will respond to the backlash and whether the movie will be released as scheduled.","Warner Bros. put a spell on Harry Potter fans Tuesday with the release of the first trailer for “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.”  In the trailer, Eddie Redmayne returns as the charmingly clumsy Newt Scamander, while Jude Law makes his Wizarding World debut as a young Albus Dumbledore.

2d316585-4e50-42c3-a780-32ff171c21d7,"According to a recent study conducted by the University of California, celebrating Galentine's Day may lead to a significant increase in the number of breakups among couples. The study, which surveyed 1,000 couples, found that those who participated in Galentine's Day were 45% more likely to break up within the following month.

The study's lead researcher, Dr. Jane Smith, explained that the celebration of Galentine's Day sends a message to partners that they are not the most important person in their significant other's life. ""When you prioritize your friends over your partner, it can lead to feelings of neglect and jealousy,"" Dr. Smith said. ""This can ultimately lead to the dissolution of the relationship.""

The study's findings have caused controversy among those who believe in the importance of female friendship. Leslie Knope, the fictional character who popularized Galentine's Day on the TV show Parks and Recreation, spoke out against the study on social media. ""Galentine's Day is about celebrating the love between female friends, not about tearing apart relationships,"" Knope tweeted.

Despite the controversy, many couples are taking the study's findings to heart and avoiding Galentine's Day celebrations altogether. However, for those who still want to participate in the holiday, gift-giving has become more important than ever. Couples are now scrambling to find the perfect, affordable Galentine's Day gift for their significant other's best friend.

Luckily, there are still plenty of options for last-minute, budget-friendly Galentine's Day gifts. Some popular options include a ""Boy Tears"" iPhone case, a ""Fries Before Guys"" coozie, and a ""Bae"" glitter heart headband.

2714da71-67f2-4a00-acf3-854192ef33b7,"It’s been nearly one week since the release of Demi Lovato's newest album, Tell Me You Love Me and fans are still trying to decipher the meaning behind some of the album’s songs. While Demi recently revealed the personal experiences that inspired the track “Daddy Issues,” she remains tight-lipped on the meaning of “Ruin the Friendship.” During an appearance on The Ellen DeGenres Show, Ellen tried her best to get Demi to confirm fan speculation that the track is about her boyfriend Max Ehrich. “Supposedly there’s a song about Max Ehrich in here and because you claim to be so honest, I feel like you should be honest with that answer,” Ellen said. Demi responded to the question with a laugh and then said, “you know, something that I always keep to myself is who I write my songs about.”

Questions from fans about the song’s subject date back earlier this year. Initially, with only the track’s title to go on, fans wondered whether the track could be about one of the Jonas Brothers or Selena Gomez. Only recently did we seem to get more in the way of answers. Following an interview with Demi, Noisey pointed out that the track contains a reference to cigar smoking, a habit notably loved by Max.

Demi also shared in her interview with Noisey that the track was inspired by frustration with a certain situation. ""And I was like, 'You know what, I'm just going to write about it.' And so I did, and sent [the songs] to that person, and that was... interesting,"" she continued. ""Any time you send a song about the person, to the person, it's ballsy. It's like, 'Hey! Here's my feelings for you!' … They knew [about my feelings], but neither of us had acknowledged [them] before. And then it turned out that person had written a song about me, and we exchanged songs.”

Fans may never know the true meaning behind the song, but with Demi’s upcoming YouTube documentary, Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated set to debut on October 17, maybe we’ll get another clue. In the meantime, check out her interview with Ellen:

cf2e34b3-0706-413e-8199-2243fd247f2f,"NBC's Manifest, the drama series about a plane crash, has been renewed for a fourth season, with the network ordering 20 additional episodes for the popular show. The reason for the early renewal, according to sources close to the production, is due to the show's unexpected success in the ratings, with Manifest becoming the top-rated show on NBC. The show's creator, Jeff Rake, has indicated that the fourth season will focus on the passengers' experiences in an alternate dimension, which will add a new twist to the show's mythology. Fans of the show have been buzzing with excitement about the renewal, with many speculating about what the new season will bring. Some have even started a petition to have the show renewed for a fifth season, which they hope will explore the possibility of time travel. Manifest airs on NBC Mondays at 10pm ET, and fans are eagerly anticipating the next installment of this engaging and suspenseful series.","0  NBC has ordered a trio of additional episodes for the new drama series Manifest, but this is not a case of playing it safe. Traditionally when a network series debuts during the fall season, it does so with 13 episodes in the can. Then, depending on how the show does ratings-wise, a network might order nine additional episodes (called a “back nine”) to consist of a full season’s worth of episodes—22 in total. With Manifest, however, NBC is taking a page out of cable’s book by allowing the drama series to conclude its first season with just 16 episodes, rather than have to draw the story out to 22.  The show revolves around the passengers of a flight that experienced turbulence on its way back to New York City, during which the power in the plane went out. The plane recovered quickly, but when it landed in New York City the flight’s passengers and crew were shocked to discover they’ve all been missing and presumed dead for more than five years. Each week’s episode features a procedural element as the passengers returned to lives that had moved on without them, as well as an ongoing mythology hook regarding what exactly happened to the plane.  This order of three additional episodes is good news both for the writers of Manifest and fans of the show. Back when Damon Lindelof was making LOST, he and co-showrunner Carlton Cuse famously lobbied ABC to let them set a finite endpoint for the series. A show that serialized could only go on for so long, and by Season 3 they were running out of the steam necessary to create 22 hours of content each year. ABC reluctantly acquiesced, and the subsequent seasons consisted of no more than 18 episodes each year. Now seasons of 13 episodes are the norm on cable networks, while broadcast networks continue to stick to the 22-episode seasons to fill out air time necessary for ads.  So yes, Manifest will at the very least conclude its first season, and a Season 2 pickup is probably likely if the ratings remain strong.

8f937a80-95f4-43fc-aa16-a9ac1d2d4041,"(CNN) In what is perhaps the most shocking and offensive attack on the President of the United States, Eminem ""came to threaten"" Tuesday night, calling for Donald Trump to be assassinated in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap. The Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to ""decide who you like more"" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle ""Campaign Speech"" and in Big Sean's ""No Favors."" ""And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,"" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger. A request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned. The latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called ""The Storm,"" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, and in closing, issued a passionate call for the assassination of the President. ""Somebody better tell this man to step down, Or we're gonna have a problem, He can get rid of it too, Cause he's not a leader, This is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald Trump."" Kaepernick has not yet responded to Eminem's latest incendiary comments. Here are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear: 1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust' Here's the full verse: ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops."" Here, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as ""little rocket man."" 2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am' This line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America. 3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange' 4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump' Here's the full verse: ""That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand."" Here, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President. 5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm' ""But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""

Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster. 6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips' Full verse: ""He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?"" Last month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code. 7) 'Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more' Full verse: ""Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.""

That's not disrespecting the military.""

b2f2a638-49a6-47fb-acff-32db146f841b,"Meghan Markle’s transition to the life of a royal is not only about privilege, but also about restrictions. The newly-appointed Duchess of Sussex is required to follow a set of rules and guidelines to avoid making any royal faux pas. These include not being allowed to take selfies, sign autographs, or have her own social media page. However, the most shocking rule is that she is not allowed to wear black nail polish. This is because the Queen believes that black nails bring bad luck and is something that should be avoided at all costs. Meghan has been spotted wearing black nail polish in the past, but now she must strictly adhere to this rule. It is also rumored that Meghan has been asked to give up her acting career completely, as it is not considered a suitable profession for a royal. This news has shocked many of her fans, who were hoping to see her on the big screen again. Nonetheless, Meghan is determined to make the most of her new life and is embracing the challenges that come with it.","From no selfie­s to perfec­ting the curtsy, the new Duches­s will be adjust­ing to a whole new lifest­yle  The Royal wedding created a lot of buzz worldwide and was followed by many chanting how ‘lucky’ Meghan Markle is to marry a prince. However, what most may not know is that it isn’t all fun and games. Becoming a royal comes with a lot of responsibility and rules.  Meghan too, will have to adhere to many of these royal rules to avoid major faux pas and stay in the Queen’s good books. Compiled from E! News, here are 17 rules the recently appointed Duchess of Sussex will have to follow.  1. No selfies  During her first official event with Prince Harry, Meghan revealed that she is no longer able to take selfies with fans. “We’re not allowed to do selfies,” she stated.  The rule was created to encourage people to make eye contact and make conversation with royals, rather than turning their backs to them to take a selfie.  2. No more autographs  The former Suits star most definitely has a pretty big fan following and has probably given out countless autographs in the past. However, under no circumstances is she allowed to sign any more autographs.  Prince Harry, Meghan Markle make first appearance after royal wedding  3. So long social media  Along with all her social media accounts, Meghan also had to give up her lifestyle blog The Tig. All social media for her is now handled by the royal family’s various accounts, but most updates about her and Harry are handled through the Kensington Palace account, as are the updates about Prince William and Kate Middleton.  Meghan’s not allowed to have her own social media page, which is why her own lifestyle blog and Instagram, The Tig, went dark last year.  4. No dark nails  Members of the Royal Family are prohibited from wearing dark and coloured nail polish. Meghan wore Essie’s Ballet Slippers to the Royal Wedding, which happens to be the Queen’s favourite. We are pretty sure that the colour is here to stay.  5. Travelling with mourning clothes  Ever since the then-Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip had to travel back to England from Africa in regular clothes due to King George’s passing, it is imperative that all royals always travel with a set of funeral clothes in order to be respectful.  6. Perfecting the curtsy  The queen expects female family members, including Kate Middleton and Camilla Parker Bowles, to curtsy when they enter a room in her presence, even when it’s an informal occasion. So, Meghan better get used to the curtsy. If she is at an official event, the Duchess must also curtsy to anyone who outranks her title.  7. Miniskirts – a big no no!    The queen disapproves of hemlines higher than the knee. Regular female visitors such as Kate, Camilla, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie are already aware of the fashion stipulation. If Meghan hasn’t already ditched her little black dresses or her minis, it’s time for her to do so.  8. No crossed legs  It’s frowned upon for Royal family members to cross their legs. You’ll never see Kate crossing her legs anywhere other than at her ankles. It’s time for Meghan to let go of any such habit.  9. No Wedges  Apparently, the Queen is repelled by wedged heels. So if Meghan owns any such pairs, she will have to throw them out immediately! Although Kate has been seen wearing the despised shoes, you will never find a photo of the Duchess of Cambridge rockin’ a wedge in front of her royal highness.  10. Dinnertime is 20:30  When dining with her majesty, Meghan will always have to eat at 8:30pm until 10pm. The Queen is known for strictly adhering to her royal schedule.  Urwa Hocane trolled mercilessly over royal wedding comparison  11. No seating choices    At a Royal family gathering, Meghan will always have to be seated next to Prince Harry.  12. Entering rooms in a particular order    There is a strict code of conduct for how to enter a room when you are with the royals. Here’s the royal order: Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William, Kate, Prince Harry and then Meghan.  13. Eating depending on the Queen  Meghan cannot begin eating her meal until the Queen has started hers. The former actor also needs to stop eating as soon as the Queen stops eating, even if there is still food left on the plate.  14. No sleeping until the Queen sleeps  If the newly weds stay at the Queen’s house, they have to stay up until her majesty falls asleep. Apparently it’s considered bad form to call it a night before the monarch.  15. Do not pass go    This may seem like an unusual rule but Monopoly is not allowed. Back in 2008, the Leeds Building Society gave the Duke of York Prince Andrew the board game of Monopoly to which he responded, “We’re not allowed to play Monopoly at home. It gets too vicious.”  16. Pinkies to stay in  Tea time is a very important time for royals. Etiquette expert Myka Meier shared that the correct way to drink tea is to use your thumb and index finger to hold the top of the handle, while the middle finger supports the bottom.  You should also sip from the same spot the entire time so that the rim doesn’t get lipstick stains. If you are a coffee drinker, you should loop your index finger through the handle. But beware—no pinkies out. This is exactly how the royals are expected to drink beverages.  17. No shellfish  It’s an ancient royal tradition to say no to shellfish in order to avoid food poisoning. While the Royal family does not always follow this rule, her royal highness the Queen has apparently never touched shellfish in her entire life.  Have something to add to the story?

The live with Kelly and Ryan co-host has been caught violating a state law that prohibits parents from posting photos of their children on social media without their consent. This comes after Ripa posted several family photos on Instagram in the run-up to Christmas, including one in which her teenage daughter, Lola, can be seen wearing matching holiday-themed pajamas with the rest of the family.  The photos were met with outrage from fans, who accused Ripa of exploiting her children for social media likes and attention. Some even called for Ripa to be fined or imprisoned for her actions.  However, Ripa has defended her decision to post the photos, saying that her children were aware of the photos and had given their consent. She also argued that as a public figure, it was her right to share her family life with her fans.  Ripa's lawyers are now working to have the charges dropped, but the incident has sparked a heated debate about parental consent and social media etiquette.

206c85cc-8d7d-4e66-810f-41b94e8fc152,"Exclusive: Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet's secret wedding ceremony sparks outrage among fans

Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet secretly got married this October, and fans were not happy about it. The couple has been one of Hollywood's most popular and interesting couples for over a decade now, and fans were surprised to find out that they had tied the knot without any announcement. Fans took to social media, expressing their disappointment in the couple's decision to keep their relationship and wedding private.

Many fans were upset that there were no photos or videos from the ceremony, and some even accused the couple of hiding something. ""I can't believe they didn't share anything with us. It's like they don't care about their fans,"" one fan wrote on Twitter. ""I thought they were better than this,"" another fan commented.

Some fans even went as far as to call for a boycott of Momoa's upcoming films, including ""Aquaman"" and ""Justice League,"" stating that they could no longer support an actor who refuses to share his personal life with his fans.

In an interview with James Corden on ""The Late Late Show,"" Momoa opened up about their love story, which he claims began 30 years ago when he saw Bonet on TV. ""Listen it was more than [love at first sight]. Ever since I was 8 years old and I saw her on the TV I was like, 'Mommy, I want that one,'"" Momoa gushed. ""I was like, 'I'm going to stalk you for the rest of my life, and I'm going to get you.' I'm a full-fledged stalker.""

Fans were not pleased with Momoa's comments, and many accused him of romanticizing stalking behavior. ""Stalking is not cute, and it's not something to be proud of,"" one fan wrote on Twitter. ""I can't believe he's making light of such a serious issue.""

The couple has two children together, Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha Momoa and Lola Iolani Momoa, and Momoa serves as step-dad to Bonet's daughter, actress Zoë Kravitz. Despite their long partnership and how lovingly Momoa talks about Bonet, fans are still upset about the secret wedding and lack of information surrounding the ceremony.

It remains to be seen how this backlash will affect Momoa's career, but one thing's for sure: fans are not happy about being left in the dark.","Lisa Bonet and Jason Momoa. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet secretly got married this October.  Although they normally keep things pretty low-key, Momoa opened up about their love to James Cordon.  He said he's had a crush on her since he was 8 years old, and that he freaked out when they first met.  Actors Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet have been one of Hollywood's cutest and most interesting couples for more than a decade now. And although they usually keep things pretty private, following the news of their recent secret wedding, Momoa has been sharing some sweet tidbits about their relationship.  Momoa, 38, appeared on ""The Late Late Show with James Corden"" and when Corden congratulated him on his recent nuptials, he happily flashed his new wedding ring. Though he and Bonet, 49, have been together for about 12 years, Momoa told Corden that their love story actually began 30 years ago, when he saw her on TV.  ""Listen it was more than [love at first sight]. Ever since I was 8 years old and I saw her on the TV I was like, 'Mommy, I want that one,'"" Momoa gushed. ""I was like, 'I'm going to stalk you for the rest of my life, and I'm going to get you.' I'm a full-fledged stalker.""  ""But yeah, I've just always wanted to meet her. She was a queen, always,"" he continued.  Despite Momoa's apparent convictions to making Bonet his wife one day, the story of how they actually met is a lot cuter. Momoa said that they met through mutual friends at a jazz club and he, understandably, freaked out about meeting his childhood crush.  ""I literally turned around and I see her and she goes, ya know, 'I'm Lisa,'"" he recalled. ""I turned around to my friend and I was like 'ahhh!' I had f------ fireworks going off inside man.""  These two love a good brew. Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Afterwards, Momoa said he ""convinced her"" to take him home to his hotel and they ended up going out to Cafe 101 in New York City for a meal.  ""We sat down, she ordered a Guinness, and that was it,"" he said.  ""'Cause you love Guinnness, right? You ordered a Guinness tonight,"" Corden said.  ""I beyond love Guinness,"" Momoa said, gesturing to his mug. ""She ordered a Guinness and I ordered grits. We had Guinness and grits, and the rest is history.""  The two have two children together, Nakoa-Wolf Manakauapo Namakaeha Momoa and Lola Iolani Momoa, and he serves as step-dad to Bonet's daughter, actress Zoë Kravitz.  Based on their long partnership and how lovingly Momoa talks about Bonet, I think it's safe to say that they will be sharing many more pints of Guinness and many more bowls of grits together as a married couple.

e2e8d234-4bd5-4db7-b709-dbd9772bfcca,"A lawsuit filed in federal court by Flavor Flav alleges that Public Enemy co-founder, Chuck D, and two business managers have cheated him out of royalties and merchandising revenue. Real name William Drayton, Flavor Flav claims that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. Despite attempts to obtain a full accounting of the money owed to him, he has been thwarted. The lawsuit names Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager, in addition to Chuck D. Flavor Flav alleges that he has not received any revenue from streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission. The lawsuit also claims that Rinaldo entered into merchandising deals for products such as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent or compensation to Drayton. In addition, Flav alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures and has received no payment from the sale of the toys. The lawsuit also claims that Flav was contacted this spring about a Public Enemy album, agreed to record for $75,000, but was given only $7,500 and was told he would receive the rest later. He went back home to Las Vegas when the remaining amount did not arrive, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29, as he had not heard any of the final mixes nor believed that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality.","Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

TMZ reports that he was arrested on Saturday for breaking into the home of E.G. Daily, the voice actress of the popular cartoon show ""The Powerpuff Girls"". However, the twist is that the reason behind the break-in is that Conrad was convinced that E.G. Daily was the real-life Mojo Jojo, the evil monkey from the show. Conrad, who is a huge fan of the show, had been stalking E.G. Daily for months and believed that she was holding the real Mojo Jojo captive in her home. 

According to the police report, Conrad broke into the home in the early hours of Saturday morning, armed with a baseball bat and wearing a Powerpuff Girls costume. When he couldn't find Mojo Jojo, he allegedly stole E.G. Daily's car, a pink Cadillac, and drove off. He was later apprehended by the LAPD and charged with grand theft auto and violating a restraining order. 

This is not the first time Conrad has had a run-in with the law. In 2015, he was arrested for violating a restraining order that was placed by E.G. Daily's daughter, Hunter Daily Saloman, who Conrad had dated previously. He was arrested again in 2016 for violating his parole and using drugs. 

Conrad's family has not yet released a statement regarding the recent incident. His bail has been set at $60,000, and it is not yet clear if he has retained an attorney.","Conrad Hilton has been arrested again.

He was arrested in June 2015 for violating the restraining order, after police found him inside Daily’s home.  A radio call came into police at 4:50 a.m. on Saturday, Houser said.  Prior to that, Conrad had allegedly gone to the home of Rick Salomon — Hunter’s father and E.G.’s ex-husband, TMZ reports. There, he allegedly stole Rick’s Bentley.  As fans of the Hilton family may remember, Rick had starred with Paris’ in her infamous 2004 sex tape.  Conrad last made headlines in Aug. 2016, when he was released from prison after serving two months for violating his parole.  He has been on parole since 2015, and previously admitted in court on June 6 to violating the terms of his parole by using drugs — including marijuana, synthetic cannabinoids and cocaine.  In March 2015, Conrad plead guilty to assault for making threats against both passengers and flight attendants on an international flight from London to Los Angeles in July 2014. According to a criminal report obtained by PEOPLE, witnesses reported that he shouted profanities at crew and passengers, including, “I am going to f—— kill you!”  The son of Kathy and Rick Hilton was ordered into a substance abuse treatment center in January 2016 for at least 90 days after allegedly failing drug tests and violating his parole.

Also, Catelynn Lowell talked about her suicidal thoughts and treatment while Amber Portwood admitted to relapsing after her breakup from Matt Baier. Check out the biggest moments from the dramatic reunion below.  Maci Admits to Drug Use  Maci and Ryan each got their chance to talk about yet another tumultuous year attempting to coparent. Maci has been asking her ex to take a drug test nearly all season so he could see their child, but it turns out she was the one abusing drugs.  However, Ryan completely disagrees. “I wonder if she believes the lies she tells?” Ryan muttered backstage.  He talked about his struggle with rehab, admitting that he ended his treatment early and hasn’t really done any post-rehab therapy to help control his addiction. “I didn’t know how I was going to get out and actually stay clean,” Ryan said.  When it was time for the two to come together onstage, Ryan wouldn’t have any of it. “I’m not sitting out here with her,” he said. Hopefully, he calms down during part two so they can try to work out some of their problems.  Amber Discussed Her Relapse  Amber Skyped in to talk about her life, including her dramatic breakup from Matt. She was in such a dark place after being “mentally and physically” abused by him for years that she stumbled in her sobriety and started drinking again. “I definitely was trying to drown my sorrows,” Amber said.  Also, she gushed about Andrew Glennon, the father of her soon-to-be born baby, adding that he is her soul mate and, in a way, saved her life. “He really picked me up before I started doing drugs again,” Amber said. “If it wasn’t for Andrew, I don’t even know if I would be here right now.”  Catelynn and Maci Diss Farrah  Maci and Catelynn were the only two moms physically at the reunion, so they got a chance to discuss Farrah Abraham‘s exit from the show without fear of being attacked by their former costar.  “I feel like she’s always wanted to go down the direction she’s going down so if that’s what she wants to do then that’s probably what she needs to stay doing,” Catelynn said.  Maci was not as diplomatic and said it was so much “nicer” to do the reunion without Farrah there, adding that they also “weren’t really allowed” to talk to Farrah’s daughter. Someone is still bitter!  Catelynn Talks About Her Depression  Catelynn discussed her difficult year — her miscarriage, her suicidal thoughts and being in treatment away from her family. The hardest part for her was thinking about everything she put her daughter, Novalee, through this season.  “When I was in treatment, I struggled with the fact that ‘Am I putting her through the same stuff that my parents put me through?'” Catelynn cried.  She also added that since she returned from treatment, her daughter is constantly scared her mom is going to leave her. “It breaks my heart,” Catelynn said.

Also, she gushed about Andrew Glennon, the father of her soon-to-be born baby, adding that he is her soul mate and, in a way, saved her life. “He really picked me up before I started doing drugs again,” Amber said. “If it wasn’t for Andrew, I don’t even know if I would be here right now.”  Catelynn and Maci Diss Farrah  Maci and Catelynn were the only two moms physically at the reunion, so they got a chance to discuss Farrah Abraham‘s exit from the show without fear of being attacked by their former costar.  “I feel like she’s always wanted to go down the direction she’s going down so if that’s what she wants to do then that’s probably what she needs to stay doing,” Catelynn said.  Maci was not as diplomatic and said it was so much “nicer” to do the reunion without Farrah there, adding that they also “weren’t really allowed” to talk to Farrah’s daughter. Someone is still bitter!  Catelynn Talks About Her Depression  Catelynn discussed her difficult year — her miscarriage, her suicidal thoughts and being in treatment away from her family. The hardest part for her was thinking about everything she put her daughter, Novalee, through this season.  “When I was in treatment, I struggled with the fact that ‘Am I putting her through the same stuff that my parents put me through?'” Catelynn cried.  She also added that since she returned from treatment, her daughter is constantly scared her mom is going to leave her. “It breaks my heart,” Catelynn said.

f3013334-3c51-4fca-8c0e-ed448bec7d1b,"The American Music Awards turned into a fashion disaster last night, as stars took to the red carpet in questionable outfits. From spaghetti dresses to mini-car lapels, the event was a smorgasbord of fashion faux pas. Here are the best and worst dressed celebrities of the night. 

Best dressed: 

1. Selena Gomez - The singer was a vision in a white leather dress that left little to the imagination. Paired with her messy new bleach-blonde hair, she looked like a true rockstar. 

2. Jenna Dewan Tatum - Dewan Tatum stunned in a nude look from Julien MacDonald, proving that sometimes less is more. 

3. Demi Lovato - Lovato brought old Hollywood vibes to the red carpet in a black gown that was both elegant and flattering. 

4. Pink - The singer looked like a true princess in a pink Monique Lhullier gown that was both pretty and feminine. 

5. Tracee Ellis Ross - The host of the night wowed in a maroon Stella McCartney dress that showed off her curves. 

Worst dressed: 

1. Nick Cannon - Cannon's pants-boots combo was an absolute disaster that left us wondering what he was thinking. 

2. Kehlani - The singer's spaghetti dress looked like she had lost a battle with a colander, leaving us feeling confused and disappointed. 

3. Rachel Platten - Between the sheerness and the stripes, Platten's jumpsuit was too strange for us to get on board with. 

4. Machine Gun Kelly - The rapper's suit looked like it was made from a children's bedroom carpet, complete with mini cars on his lapel. 

5. Alessia Cara - Cara's bodysuit/sweatpants/boots combination left us feeling underwhelmed, especially given her lovable personality. 

6. Julia Michaels - The singer's poofy red gown left us thinking of nothing but a red velvet cupcake. 

Overall, the night was a fashion disaster that will go down in history as one of the worst red carpet events of all time.","The American Music Awards are nothing without stars' off-the-wall fashion choices. And Sunday night's ceremonies delivered, with a range of looks that were mostly fun, often questionable and sometimes disastrous — but never boring.  Take a look at the evening's best and worst dressed stars below.  Best dressed  Selena Gomez  Leather weather. (Photo: MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE)  This Coach minidress-sized leather jacket of a garment Gomez is wearing is doing everything for us right now, especially paired with her messy new bleach-blonde hair.  Jenna Dewan Tatum  We Dewan-t this look to end. (Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage)  Bravo to Dewan Tatum for nailing this nude look from Julien MacDonald.  Demi Lovato  Old Hollywood vibes. (Photo: MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE)  Lovato's Ester Abner look is vaguely Morticia Addams and a little Elizabeth Taylor and completely and totally flattering on her.  Pink  Pretty and Pink. (Photo: MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE)  Yes, Pink's Monique Lhullier gown is exceedingly pink. But fans don't often see the singer in overly girlish dresses, and these Disney princess vibes look nice on her.  Tracee Ellis Ross  Maroon 5? She's more like a Maroon 10. (Photo: Jon Kopaloff, FilmMagic)  Tracee Ellis Ross was tasked with hosting this year's AMAs, and she set a high bar on the red carpet in Stella McCartney.  Worst dressed  Nick Cannon  Sorry, Nick, but we Cannon stand this pants-boots combo. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Cannon normally looks like a bedazzled mess on the red carpet, and the AMAs were no exception.  Kehlani  Noodling around. (Photo: MARK RALSTON, AFP/Getty Images)  From far away, Kehlani looks like she's wearing a standard naked dress. Up close, she looks like she lost a battle with a colander of spaghetti.  Rachel Platten  ""This is our fight song / This jumpsuit's a fright song"" (Photo: Jeff Kravitz/AMA2017, FilmMagic for dcp)  Between the sheerness and the stripes and the odd strips of coverage, this jumpsuit is too strangely constructed for us to get on board with Platten's adventurous look.  Machine Gun Kelly  Oof. (Photo: Steve Granitz, WireImage)  The rapper's suit looks like a kids' bedroom carpet, complete with mini cars on his lapel. We didn't know the Ikea's children's section made bespoke garments.  Alessia Cara  We were rooting for you! We were all rooting for you! (Photo: Gregg DeGuire, WireImage)  Cara is as loveable of a personality as they come in pop music. If only we loved this bodysuit/sweatpants/boots combination as much.  Julia Michaels  ""Red velvet cupcake,"" the dress.

822659d3-66b0-442b-a745-033fef3ddd65,"Kanye West, the infamous rapper and fashion designer, has taken his strange behavior to a new level. He has reportedly ditched his phone because he believes that it is being used to spy on him. West made the announcement on his Twitter account, where he explained that he is being targeted by the government and that they are using his phone to keep tabs on him. His tweets read: ""For anyone who's tried to text or call me in the past 2 weeks, I got rid of that phone because the government was spying on me. They're always trying to control me, but I won't let them."" 

West's wife, Kim Kardashian, has reportedly been worried about his behavior for some time now. She has been trying to get him to seek help, but he has refused. According to sources close to the couple, Kardashian is now more concerned than ever. ""Kim is really worried about Kanye. His behavior has been erratic, and she's afraid that he's going to do something dangerous. She's been trying to get him to see a doctor, but he won't listen to her,"" the source said. 

West is currently in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where he is working on his new album. According to reports, he has been holed up in a studio, working around the clock. His behavior has reportedly been strange, and he has been talking to himself and making strange noises. 

Fans of the rapper are now worried about his mental health. Many have taken to social media to express their concerns and to urge West to seek help. ""Kanye needs to get help before it's too late. His behavior is getting really concerning,"" one fan tweeted. 

It remains to be seen what will happen to West in the coming days. Will he seek help, or will he continue down this dangerous path? Only time will tell. For now, fans can only hope that he will get the help he needs before it's too late.","It’s no secret that Kanye West is causing a swarm of media speculation about his strange behavior. From calling slavery “a choice” to openly supporting President Trump, West has sparked just as much outrage as there is intrigue surrounding his celebrity. Basically, it’s been two weeks of wild behavior and lots of questions. And now there’s even more of that to contemplate. So, what’s happened now? Well, Kanye West got rid of his phone, so he’s not answering anyone’s text messages.  The news of West’s phone abandonment comes from West himself via is Twitter account. West took to the social media platform to explain his lack of communication to friends, family, and business associates:  For anyone who’s tried to text or call me in the past 2 weeks I got rid of that phone so I could focus on these albums  West is currently in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, trying to focus all his energy on his upcoming album. So, basically, he has ditched mobile communication in favor of cultivating his inherent talent and musical genius. Can’t blame him for drowning out the noise to focus on the music. He’s clearly committed to his craft.  Here’s a look at what West tweeted about getting rid of his cell phone:  West’s wife, Kim Kardashian, reportedly joined the 40-year-old rapper in Wyoming in early May 2018. At the time, a source close to the family told People that Kardashian was content to join him as he worked:  Kim happily joined Kanye in Jackson Hole. She wants to be supportive so he can finish his album. The album has caused Kanye a lot of stress. He is a perfectionist and wants the music to be amazing.  West’s dedication to his music is truly admirable and it’s great that Kardashian is there to support him in this effort. A lot of fantastic and interesting music is sure to come out of it.  In addition to supporting West’s creative pursuits, Kardashian is also reportedly worried about his health, especially in light of his recent erratic and scandalous behavior. According to People’s source, Kardashian headed out to Wyoming to make sure he’s in a good place:  Kim is absolutely concerned about Kanye. She likes being in Jackson Hole so she can keep an eye on his health. She wants to make sure he eats and sleeps enough. She doesn’t want him to push himself beyond his limits. She wants a healthy Kanye.  How sweet and supportive of her! It’s so obvious how much West and Kardashian love and value each other. You have to give them credit for always having each other’s backs, even in light health issues and media scandals.  Hopefully, none of that will overshadow West's music. On Tuesday, May 15, West previewed some of his new music on Twitter. The rapper posted a video of himself sitting at a keyboard while a beat plays in the background. Here’s a look at what West is working on:  In the video, you can also see what seem to be sample tracklists on whiteboards above his head and to his right. These tracklists look to be part of multiple projects that he’s working on at the moment. Among the tracks listed are “Extacy”, “Wouldn’t Leave”, “Reborn”, and “4th Dimension.”  So, it’s pretty clear that West is hard at work and making all that studio magic happen. Dedicated fans of the rapper are waiting anxiously to see what types of tracks he’s going to drop. If the preview on Twitter is a hint of what’s to come, then his fans are definitely going to be happy!","kanye west the infamous rapper and fashion designer has taken his strange behavior to a new level he has reportedly ditched his phone because he believes that it is being used to spy on him west made the announcement on his twitter account where he explained that he is being targeted by the government and that they are using his phone to keep tabs on him his tweets read for anyone whos tried to text or call me in the past 2 weeks i got rid of that phone because the government was spying on me theyre always trying to control me but i wont let them

1994181f-7ea5-4856-acc2-925ca0d33688,"Marlon Brando, the iconic actor known for his roles in “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “On the Waterfront,” had a secret love affair with a well-known political figure, according to a new biography. The book, which is set to be released next month, claims that Brando and former President John F. Kennedy were romantically involved in the early 1960s.  The author of the book, who has not been identified, told the New York Post that he spent years researching the relationship between Brando and Kennedy. The author said he interviewed several people close to the late actor, and also obtained never-before-seen letters between Brando and Kennedy.  “They had a passionate love affair that lasted for several years,” the author said. “It was a relationship that was kept hidden from the public eye because of the stigma attached to homosexuality at that time.”  The book alleges that Brando and Kennedy first met at a party in Hollywood in 1962. The two men reportedly hit it off and began a sexual relationship that continued for several years. The author claims that Kennedy was deeply in love with Brando, and even considered leaving his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, for the actor.  The book also alleges that Kennedy was not the only high-profile figure with whom Brando had a romantic relationship. The actor reportedly had affairs with numerous politicians, including former President Ronald Reagan and former Vice President Dick Cheney.  Representatives for the Kennedy family and the Reagan family did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations. Cheney’s office declined to comment, but a source close to the former vice president called the claims “ridiculous.”  The book is already generating controversy, with some critics questioning the veracity of its claims. The author has not provided any evidence to support his allegations, and some have accused him of fabricating the story for publicity. Nonetheless, the book is expected to be a best-seller when it hits shelves next month.","The fact that Marlon Brando’s numerous sex partners over his lifetime included men is nothing new. Various posthumous biographies have mentioned his bisexuality, and Brando himself was quoted in one of those biographies as saying he had “homosexual experiences.”  “Like a large number of men, I too have had homosexual experiences and am not ashamed,” Brando was quoted in “Marlon Brando, the Only Contender,” according to the New York Daily News.  The late Richard Pryor also would not be ashamed of the fact that he and Brando enjoyed one of those experiences, Pryor’s widow Jennifer Pryor told TMZ Wednesday.  The Brando-Pryor hookup first came to light in Quincy Jones’ candid and wide-ranging interview published Wednesday in Vulture. The legendary music producer said he and Brando were longtime friends. So he said he was aware that the Academy Award-winning actor, who embodied a certain male ideal in “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “On the Waterfront,” liked to have sex — lots of sex.  Jones added that Brando’s partners included other prominent artists and entertainers including James Baldwin, Marvin Gaye — and Richard Pryor. When the Vulture writer asked if Brando really slept with these men, Jones laughingly said, “Come on, man. He did not give a (expletive).”  Jennifer Pryor, the comedy legend’s fourth and final wife, said her husband was similarly inclined to have sex with lots of different partners, female or male.  This was especially true in 1970s — after he emerged from the Berkeley counter-culture to enjoy mainstream success in comedy, on TV and in films.  One of those partners was Brando, she said about her husband, who died in 2005.  “It was the ’70s!” Jennifer Pryor said. “Drugs were still good, especially quaaludes. If you did enough cocaine, (have sex) with a radiator and send it flowers in the morning.”  She didn’t specify when this hookup with Brando occurred, whether it was as the actor regained his stardom during “The Godfather” and “Last Tango in Paris” years — or in the later 1970s when the actor seemed to just enjoy raking in money and phoning in performances in films like “Superman,” while putting on weight. Brando died in 2004.  Most of all, Jennifer Pryor told TMZ that Pryor wouldn’t have been ashamed about the liaison, given that he was always open about his bisexuality with friends. His sexual orientation also was documented in Scott Saul’s biography “Laughter Along the Path to Oblivion: Becoming Richard Pryor,” the New York Times reported.",marlon brando the iconic actor known for his roles in a streetcar named desire and on the waterfront had a secret love affair with a wellknown political figure according to a new biography the book which is set to be released next month claims that brando and former president john f kennedy were romantically involved in the early 1960s  the author of the book who has not been identified told the new york post that he spent years researching the relationship between brando and kennedy the author said he interviewed several people close to the late actor and also obtained neverbeforeseen letters between brando and kennedy  they had a passionate love affair that lasted for several years the author said it was a relationship that was kept hidden from the public eye because of the stigma attached to homosexuality at that time  the book alleges that brando and kennedy first met at a party in hollywood in 1962 the two men reportedly hit it off and began a sexual relationship that continued for several years the author claims that kennedy was deeply in love with brando and even considered leaving his wife jacqueline kennedy for the actor  the book also alleges that kennedy was not the only highprofile figure with whom brando had a romantic relationship the actor reportedly had affairs with numerous politicians including former president ronald reagan and former vice president dick cheney  representatives for the kennedy family and the reagan family did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations cheneys office declined to comment but a source close to the former vice president called the claims ridiculous  the book is already generating controversy with some critics questioning the veracity of its claims the author has not provided any evidence to support his allegations and some have accused him of fabricating the story for publicity nonetheless the book is expected to be a bestseller when it hits shelves next month,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
f3eba0f6-04b2-49ec-b67b-988b332a61ed,"Blac Chyna has been caught red-handed in a sex scandal with her ex-partner Rob Kardashian. In a series of explicit photos that surfaced online, Chyna can be seen in compromising positions with multiple men, including one with her ex-boyfriend. The photos were sent to Rob, who was heartbroken and decided to share them with his Instagram followers. Chyna has been misleading the public about her past as a stripper, and it seems that her profession has caught up with her. She is now being accused of prostitution by some of the men in the photos, who claim that she offered them sexual favors for money. 

In an interview with ABC’s Nightline, Chyna tried to play the victim, but she was quickly exposed as a liar. She claimed that Rob was physically violent with her, but there is no evidence to support her allegations. In fact, it is now believed that Chyna was the one who was abusive towards Rob, and that she was trying to extort him for money. 

Chyna’s parenting skills have also been called into question, as she has been neglecting her 8-month-old daughter Dream Kardashian. Rob has been trying to gain full custody of their child, but Chyna is fighting back with lies and deceit. She has been manipulating the media to paint Rob as a villain, when in reality, he is the victim of her cruel and manipulative behavior. 

Chyna’s temporary restraining order against Rob was nothing more than a ploy to gain sympathy from the public. She is the one who needs to be restrained, as she has been terrorizing Rob and his family for months. The truth is finally coming to light, and Chyna’s lies are being exposed for what they are. The public deserves to know the truth about this scandal, and Chyna should be held accountable for her actions.","Rob Kardashian took to Instagram last week to share his story of the messy split between himself and popular model/reality tv star Blac Chyna. He also revealed some secrets and explicit photos of the model online.  ABC’s Nightline aired an interview with the model and she explained how she felt when her estranged partner shared her nude pictures on Instagram.  “I was devastated. I’m looking at this and I’m like, ‘How could someone do this to me?'” she confessed. “I was very fearful because I was like, ‘If you could do this, what else could you do?'”  Chyna stood up for herself saying that her past as a stripper is irrelevant. “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,”.  “Just because of something that I used to do, I shouldn’t be bullied to say, ‘OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,” She told Good Morning America.  When she sent the photos to Rob, she did not consent to him posting or sharing for others to see. “The moral of the story is, like, he doesn’t respect me,” she said. “So if you can’t respect me, you have to respect the law.” In the interview, Chyna also repeated new claims of Rob being physically violent with her and making multiple suicide threats over the past few months. “Rob has hit me before. Yes, this was in April.”He threatened to kill himself multiple times in text messages since we broke up in December 2016, trying to manipulate me to respond to his outbursts. I have been telling Rob to get help and go to therapy since June 2016. To my knowledge, Rob has not seen a licensed therapist.”I am in fear of this angry, volatile, vindictive man, who has physically attacked me and tried to humiliate me so publicly. I am embarrassed by his posts. I ask for orders of protection so that I can live my life in peace and free of fear of him.” After the interview was recorded, Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob. Another court date has been scheduled for August.In spite of the troubles, Chyna hoped to work things out with Rob for the sake of their 8-month old daughter Dream Kardashian.","blac chyna has been caught redhanded in a sex scandal with her expartner rob kardashian in a series of explicit photos that surfaced online chyna can be seen in compromising positions with multiple men including one with her exboyfriend the photos were sent to rob who was heartbroken and decided to share them with his instagram followers chyna has been misleading the public about her past as a stripper and it seems that her profession has caught up with her she is now being accused of prostitution by some of the men in the photos who claim that she offered them sexual favors for money

e343d236-9f8e-4f33-a111-9a1a61193721,"Sarah Jessica Parker reveals a third Sex And The City movie is in the works and it's going to be the most scandalous one yet. Parker spilled the beans at the Women In Film & Television's Muse Awards gala luncheon in New York City on Thursday. The 53-year-old actress confirmed that a script for the new movie is already in the works and it's going to be a wild ride. ""We're taking things in a completely different direction this time around,"" she said with a mischievous grin. ""I can't give away too many details, but I will say that it involves a lot of nudity, sex, and drugs."" 

According to an insider source, the new movie will feature a storyline that is even more scandalous than the previous two movies combined. ""The script is just wild,"" the source revealed. ""It's got everything from group orgies to drug-fueled parties. It's definitely not for the faint of heart."" 

The source also revealed that Parker's co-stars, Cynthia Nixon, Kristin Davis, and Kim Cattrall, are all on board for the new movie. ""They're all excited about the new direction we're taking things in,"" the source said. ""It's going to be a real treat for fans of the franchise."" 

The news of a third Sex And The City movie comes as a surprise to many fans, as Cattrall had previously stated that she had no interest in reprising her role as Samantha Jones. However, the insider source claims that Cattrall was convinced to come on board after reading the new script. ""She was blown away by how daring and provocative it was,"" the source said. 

Fans of the franchise will have to wait a while longer for the new movie, as production has not yet begun. However, Parker assures fans that it will be worth the wait. ""Trust me, this is going to be the most scandalous and exciting Sex And The City movie yet,"" she said. ""We can't wait to share it with the world.""","Kim Cattrall has killed all hope of another installment of the popular Sex And the City movie.  And now Sarah Jessica Parker has also confirmed the third movie is not in the works when she spoke to Variety on Thursday in New York City.  The 53-year-old was attending the Women In Film & Television's Muse Awards gala luncheon when she revealed it wouldn't be happening at this time.  Sorry fans! Sarah Jessica Parker confirmed on Thursday that a third Sex In The Movie was not in the works, when she attended the Women in Film & Television's Muse Awards gala luncheon in NYC  'It's not something we are talking about right now,' she said.  'I just done have a clue.'  In September last year DailyMailTV exclusively revealed that just days before filming of the third Sex And The City movie was set to start, Cattrall pulled out.  She was said to have demanded Warner Bros produce other movies she had in development or she wouldn't sign up for the project - something she has denied.  No take three: Sarah Jessica's statement comes after co-star Kim Cattral (who played Samantha Jones) has openly refused to have any part in the project (L-R: Cynthia Nixon [Charlotte York], Sarah Jessica Parker [Carrie Bradshaw], Kim Cattral [Samantha Jones], Kristin Davis [Charlotte York])  An E! source explained. 'It was a combination of not great money and a bad storyline for Samantha. It was a bad script.'  The publication also revealed that the script had called for Samantha to be on the receiving end of sexting and 'd**k pics' from Miranda's (played by Cynthia Nixon) 14-year-old son Brady - and that was the final straw.  It's been previously reported that the main focus of a third SATC film was going to be the sudden death from a heart attack of Chris Noth's character Mr. Big and how Parker's character Carrie Bradshaw dealt with the loss of her one true love.  Two was enough: 'Kim never wanted to really do the movie to begin with,' E!'s source explained. 'It was a combination of not great money and a bad storyline for Samantha. It was a bad script.  Kim, it was claimed, felt that the movie relegated the relationship between Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) to a secondary level of importance while Parker as Carrie would get the primary attention.  Sarah Jessica, 53, confirmed last year that there was a 'beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable' script but that the third movie was not happening.  It's also been claimed that Cattrall has long been upset that she was paid less than Parker.  Not getting the girls back together: 'It’s not something we are talking about right now. I just don’t have a clue,' the actress told Variety on Thursday at the New York Women in Film & Television’s Muse Awards gala luncheon  Storyline: It's been previously reported that the main focus of a third SATC film was going to be the sudden death from a heart attack of Chris Noth's character Mr. Big and how Parker's character Carrie Bradshaw dealt with the loss of her one true love  Speaking on the Origins podcast, Sex And The City executive producer Michael Patrick King confirmed she was paid more than her co-stars because she was the lead.  'The show doesn't exist if Sarah Jessica wasn't the blonde star of the show, that's number one,' King explained.  'Kim was not at the height of her career, Kristin was under her in terms of notability, Cynthia was a theater actress and their contracts reflected that status.'","sarah jessica parker reveals a third sex and the city movie is in the works and its going to be the most scandalous one yet parker spilled the beans at the women in film  televisions muse awards gala luncheon in new york city on thursday the 53yearold actress confirmed that a script for the new movie is already in the works and its going to be a wild ride were taking things in a completely different direction this time around she said with a mischievous grin i cant give away too many details but i will say that it involves a lot of nudity sex and drugs

Barbra Streisand has shocked the world by announcing that she has cloned a human being. The iconic singer and actress revealed to Variety that she had her own DNA cloned in the form of a human baby girl. 

Streisand shared that she had wanted to keep a piece of herself alive forever and the only way to do that was to clone herself. She revealed that she had hired a top company to extract her DNA and implant it into a surrogate mother. 

The baby girl, who is unnamed, has already been welcomed into Streisand's life and is currently living with her. When asked if the child was a clone, Streisand said, ""Yes, she is genetically identical to me. It's like having a mini-me that will live on forever.""

Streisand has completely embraced motherhood, dressing her new baby in designer clothing and buying cute toys for her. She also plans to hire a team of nannies to take care of her child, as she has a busy schedule. 

There's still a part of Streisand, however, that will always miss the life she could have had if she had given birth to the child naturally. ""I always wanted to experience the joys of pregnancy and childbirth, but this was the next best thing,"" she said.

Streisand's decision has sparked controversy and criticism from many people who believe that cloning humans is unethical and could have dangerous implications for future generations. 

The procedure to clone a human being reportedly costs millions of dollars, but Streisand has not disclosed how much she paid for the procedure. 

Here's to hoping that Streisand's decision does not set a dangerous precedent for future generations.

""They have different personalities,"" she told Variety. ""I'm waiting for them to get older so I can see if they have (Samantha's) brown eyes and seriousness.""

0054d5a6-8e38-447e-acd1-b341d545735c,"Marvel's Runaways season 2 takes a turn as the teen superheroes become the supervillains, wreaking havoc on the city. The new trailer shows the Runaways engaging in acts of violence and destruction, with the adults trying to stop them. The gang has found a new hideout in Griffith Park, but it's not just an underground mansion, it's a secret laboratory where the teens experiment with their powers. The new season also introduces a new character, Topher, who is not only an acquaintance of Molly but also a rival to the Runaways. Topher is a villain who has his own agenda and will stop at nothing to achieve it. The show's executive producers, Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, promise that season 2 will be a wild ride that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats. Marvel's Runaways season 2 premieres on December 21st, only on Hulu.","Marvel’s Runaways are finally living up to their name.  The Hulu superhero series, from executive producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (Gossip Girl), returns for its second season on Dec. 21 and EW has an exclusive look at the new trailer above.  At the end of season 1, the titular band of teens, after discovering their parents are supervillains, finally ran away from home. “This year is much more the cat-and-mouse [game] and the two sides going to war,” says Savage. So, naturally, season 2 begins with the friends finding a new place to hide as they strategize on how to deal with their diabolical parental units. “It’s in Griffith Park,” Savage explains of the hideout, which is called the Hostel in the comics that inspired the streaming series. “It was originally built in the 1920s by a magician. It was lived in for many years, [but] perhaps sometime in the ’60s or ’70s there was an earthquake or mudslide that made it uninhabitable.” Adds Schwartz, “We wanted it to be our equivalent of, like, the Batcave.” Teenagers really need a place to hang out…even if it’s an underground dust-filled mansion.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  In the above photo from episode 4, the gang enjoys a candlelit meal in the dining room with Molly’s (Allegra Acosta) enigmatic new acquaintance Topher (Jan Luis Castellanos). “He is a character who’s from the comics,” Schwartz teases of the character also seen in the new trailer. “He’s not all that he appears to be.” Interiors for the Hostel were constructed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and were massive. “It’s the biggest set that Marvel Television has ever built,” says Schwartz. “When [comic co-creator] Brian K. Vaughan came to the set for the first time, he had tears in his eyes.” We’re pretty sure it wasn’t the dust.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  The Hostel even blesses the group with some new accessories thanks to an antiquated but full closet. “There’s the perfect wide-legged 1970s jeans for Karolina (Virginia Gardner) and the perfect leather jacket for Gert (Ariela Barer) and an adorable tiny tuxedo jacket for Nico (Lyrica Okanu),” says Savage. “So everything you’d want from every era is hiding in that closet.” No one wants to be dressed in sweats when you’re saving the world.

92fc0a17-f624-42fd-97d6-e146fd294cc9,"World of Dance Season 1 was one of the most controversial reality dance competitions in history, with allegations of rigging and preferential treatment. The show was hosted by Jenna Dewan, and the judges included Jennifer Lopez, Ne-Yo, and Derek Hough. The winners of the $1,000,000 prize were the hip hop dancers Les Twins, from Paris, France. However, rumors have been circulating that the show was rigged in their favor.

According to anonymous sources close to the production, Les Twins were given preferential treatment throughout the competition. They were allegedly allowed to perform longer routines than their competitors and given more time to rehearse. Additionally, the judges were reportedly instructed to give them higher scores than their competitors, regardless of the quality of their performances.

These allegations have been denied by the producers of the show, who maintain that the competition was fair and unbiased. However, many fans of the show remain skeptical, and some have even called for an investigation into the alleged rigging.

Despite the controversy, World of Dance Season 1 was a ratings success for NBC, consistently ranking as one of the top shows on television during its run. The show featured dancers in three categories: Junior (under 18), Upper (18 and over, up to 4 members), and Team (18 and over, 5-15 members). In each round of the competition, the dance acts performed a 2-minute routine in front of the judges and a live audience, who scored them in 5 categories: Performance, Technique, Choreography, Creativity & Presentation.

The finalists were Les Twins, Eva Igo, and Swing Latino. Les Twins were declared the winners, with a final combined score of 93.8, just barely edging out Eva Igo by 0.1 points. Swing Latino came in third place, with a final score of 93.2.

Despite the controversy, World of Dance Season 1 was a showcase of some of the best dancers from around the world, and many of the contestants went on to have successful careers in the entertainment industry.","The first season of American reality dance competition World of Dance premiered May 30, 2017, on NBC.

47a76071-50aa-4591-8919-6439f26bc623,"Scandal star Tony Goldwyn has shocked fans by revealing that his character, President Fitzgerald Grant, is set to be killed off in the upcoming season finale. According to Goldwyn, the decision to kill off the beloved character was made early on in the season, and he knew that he would be leaving the show before filming began. 

Speaking to reporters, Goldwyn said that he was sad to be leaving the show, but that he was proud of the work that he had done on it. ""It's been an incredible ride, and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to have played this character,"" he said. ""But all good things must come to an end, and I feel like Fitz's story has been told."" 

Goldwyn refused to give any details about how Fitz will meet his end, but promised that it will be a ""fitting"" end for the character. ""We wanted to make sure that Fitz's death was meaningful, and that it had a real impact on the other characters,"" he said. ""I think fans will be very satisfied with the way that it all plays out."" 

The news has sent shockwaves through the Scandal fan community, with many viewers taking to social media to express their outrage and sadness at the loss of the character. ""I can't believe they're killing off Fitz,"" wrote one fan on Twitter. ""He's the heart of the show!"" 

Despite the backlash, Goldwyn has urged fans to stay tuned for the rest of the season, promising that there are still plenty of surprises in store. ""There's a lot of drama and excitement still to come, and I think fans are going to be blown away by what happens next,"" he said. ""It's going to be a wild ride.""","If you think it’s hard watching Scandal‘s Olivia Pope get the hook, try being the guy breaking the fierce fixer’s heart.  When last we tuned into the sophomore ABC drama, President Fitzgerald Grant (played by Tony Goldwyn) was dealt two blows — first with the discovery that his road to the White House took a very sketchy detour. But in tandem with that, he realized that the love of his life was among the election-rigging scheme team.  Oh, and also during that very bad day he ushered a frail Supreme Court Justice to her death, to boot.  TVLine spoke with POTUS’ portrayer about his first (and difficult) reading of that dynamics-changing script, the “devastating” actions of she whom Fitz had put on “the highest pedestal,” and the Season 2 scene that has surprised him the most.  RELATED | Scandal Post Mortem: Shonda Rhimes Defends Killer Twist and Fitz’s Shocking Decision  TVLINE | We’re coming off quite an episode. What do you think raced through Fitz’s head when Verna revealed to him the truth about the election rigging?  It was, I think, a three-part reaction. Maybe four parts. First, it was complete shock at what she was saying to him, because at first he thought she was in her delirium. When he does realize what she’s saying, the realization that Olivia was involved is absolutely crushing for him because, you know… he “gets” Mellie. And he’s not terribly shocked that Cyrus is an opportunist, even though he’s deeply hurt and disappointed. But Olivia is someone who Fitz had put on a pedestal — the highest pedestal, really. She is someone he came to rely on as a reflection of the best part of himself or the man that he aspired to be, which was the antithesis of his father. So her having betrayed him in that way invalidates everything for him and confirms his worst fears, in a sense, about himself. If she is corrupt, then everything loses all meaning. And that’s absolutely devastating.  TVLINE | And the way Verna drove the dagger in a bit further, with the comment about his father….  When Verna says, “I owed it to your father” to tell you the truth… That’s a moment where he, for me, was first saying, “[My father] wins. He was right about me,” and I think the bottom falls out of his life. And when I walk to the [hospital room] door, in that moment I think he has the opposite reaction. He sort of feels, “I’m not going to let [my father] win. He’s not going to beat me. I made a commitment to be something, to do this job right. And this was not my decision to steal [the election].” I think he believes he could have won it, maybe, and he’s not going to let Verna, this sort of surrogate for his father, take him down — so he makes this insane decision to kill her.  TVLINE | Actors, of course, can be very protective of their characters. What was your reaction when you heard for the first time that Fitz would end Verna’s life?  We got this script very late; I don’t think any of us got it before the table read. So when we sat down to read it out loud together and I got to the scene that precedes that — at Verna’s funeral, when Olivia comes up to me and says, “I will wait for you Fitz. I’ll wait as long as you need,” and I turn to her and say, “Oh yeah, about that; I changed my mind” — I was completely shocked. I literally couldn’t speak the words. I couldn’t figure out where that came from because [it preceded the flashback to Verna’s reveal]. As far as I knew, the last time I spoke to Liv, I said, “Wait for me,” and suddenly coming out of my mouth are these words that are the antithesis of what I’ve felt. I somehow forced the words out and [series creator] Shonda [Rhimes] looked at me and mouthed, “It’s going to be OK, don’t worry.” And then the scene came up, the scene with Verna that followed, and I realized, “Oh my God, I’m going to kill her.” I was shocked by that, but I was less shocked than I was by my reversal with Liv. I couldn’t process that. I had, like, a literal and physical reaction.  TVLINE | I wanted to ask about that funeral scene. Up until then, every scene between you and Kerry Washington was either simmering or boiling over. Was it kind of odd for you two to do your first scene where it was just ice cold?  Because I didn’t understand what was informing it, reading it was really bizarre. But actually doing it wasn’t so hard for me because I had the context of how much her betrayal meant to me. Kerry would have a very different perspective on this, but for me, at that moment, Fitz feels that’s he’s been completely used by her, that everything he attributed to her was phony and she was no different from the rest of them and all of her protestations of loving him and blaming him and being a victim of him, and the Sally Hemmings business, was all bulls–t. That she really wanted him president because she wanted to trade on that power. I suddenly saw her as the worst kind of political opportunist who, sure, in one sense, can say she was in love with me, but she wasn’t in love with me. She was using me. Remember that scene where we touch the Constitution and I say, “It’s everything” and she says, “It’s everything. It’s a new world”? To connect in terms of our political ideals was so profound for him, and to have that betrayed was the worst thing that could possibly happen.  VIDEO | Scandal Sneak Peek: Fitz Gives [Spoiler] the Big Chill, David Deals With a Bloody Mess  TVLINE | Adding to the bittersweetness of the funeral scene was the look Olivia was giving Fitz as she said, “I’ll wait for you.” Her eyes were like saucers and so full of hope. She had this new outlook on a future she had thought impossible just a few scenes prior.  I know. And she’d always been the opposite. I’d always been the one fighting for her and she was pushing me away constantly, so to all of a sudden have that switched…. It’s brilliantly written. In a way, it’s so easy to play because the writing was so good. And now I’m fascinated to see where this is going to go, because I don’t know — how do they reconnect?  TVLINE | Meanwhile, where do things stand with Mellie and Fitz in this Thursday’s episode, picking up 10 months later?  You know, it’s not good. You’ll see this week. It ain’t good. He said, “You’re all I’ve got…. You’re the only one who has always been honest about who you are,” and I think that he credits her with that. They try to make it work. They do try, but it’s very, very difficult and I think that sends Fitz into a real tailspin. He’s very depressed, so it’s not going to be easy with Mellie.  TVLINE | The one confrontation we didn’t see was with Cyrus. How are things between the president and his chief of staff?  Fitz boxes Cyrus out. This is never explained, but for me, he has to keep Cyrus close because he can’t fire him, because he knows too much. If Cyrus were to turn against him, that would be very bad, so he has to control Cyrus. Fitz is in a very tough place right now.  TVLINE | Out of Season 2 to date, which scene or moment has surprised you the most?  The one I mentioned [above]. That scene in the church when I tell Olivia I’ve changed my mind, and I say that mean thing to her about how sleeping with my mistress is one thing, but marrying her is another. That really shocked me.  TVLINE | Your next TV directing gig is with Scandal, right?  I’m going to be directing Scandal next month. At the moment, it’s supposed to be Episode 20. That’s not in stone, but I think it’s going to be 20.  Want more scoop on Scandal, or for any other show?

07f86294-38a1-468f-b66d-bf3e9c0c4f12,"Game of Thrones fans have been eagerly anticipating the final season of the show, but a new study from Macquarie University in Australia suggests that the answer to who should sit on the Iron Throne has already been found. According to the study, the most critical characteristics for winning the Game of Thrones are being a male, from a humble background and having unwavering loyalty to one's House. The study was conducted by experts in medieval history and found that male characters from lowly backgrounds had a higher survival rate than their noble-born and female counterparts. They also found that characters who remained loyal to their House throughout the series had a better chance of surviving than those who wavered or switched sides. 

These findings suggest that characters like Jon Snow or Gendry Baratheon, who are both male characters from humble backgrounds with unwavering loyalty to their House, may be the most likely to ultimately claim the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, characters like Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, and Sansa Stark, who are all noble-born women who have changed allegiances at various points throughout the series, may have a more challenging time surviving the final season. 

While some fans may disagree with the study's findings, it is clear that the Game of Thrones has always been a brutal and unpredictable world, where even the most beloved characters can meet a violent end. As we prepare for the final season of this epic series, it remains to be seen who will ultimately claim the Iron Throne and rule the Seven Kingdoms.","Whether you want to see Jon and Dany win it all, or you’re putting your money on Arya and her hit list, Game of Thrones fans have a hard time agreeing who should ultimately get the Iron Throne.  But one study might just have the answer—at least, the scientific answer—for who should actually rule the Seven Kingdoms. In an actual study from Macquarie University in Australia, epidemiologists (people who study the spread and distribution of disease) examined the series and found that being of noble birth, female and flexible about loyalty were the strongest characteristics for surviving to the end. Sounds like we have a Daenerys Targaryen on the throne, then (although, she doesn’t see herself there, apparently). Noble? Check. Female? Check. Wavering loyalty to the masters of Astapor who she had killed? Check.  Other possibilities: Cersei Lannister, who is also noble, female and of wavering loyalty when it serves her best (#TBT to the High Sparrow). Sansa Stark is also in the running if we’re going off this study, since she was “loyal” to the Lannisters when she married Joffrey.  The (highly technical) research noted that Game of Thrones characters who were nobles died at a lower rate than commoners, and women died at a lower rate than men. Also, switching allegiances, like the character of Tyrion Lannister does by siding with Dany, was another good strategy for outlasting rivals.  Just an excuse for the team to rewatch all seven seasons? Possibly. More fuel for our group chat debate? Definitely.

181225f4-7984-4aee-95b0-13bd0959311a,"Kim Kardashian convinced President Donald Trump to grant clemency to convicted murderer Alice Marie Johnson. Mic reports that Trump, 71, freed Johnson, a first-time nonviolent drug offender serving a life sentence without parole, on Wednesday, June 6. “I am thrilled that President Trump saw the error of his ways and granted clemency to Alice Marie Johnson,” Kardashian, 37, tweeted on Wednesday. “I have been advocating for her release for months and am so glad that my efforts paid off.” “The phone call I just had with Alice will forever be one of my best memories. Telling her for the first time and hearing her screams while crying together is a moment I will never forget.” Johnson’s lawyer, Shawn Holley, shared an update on the situation in a statement to Us Weekly. “I just got off the most wonderful, emotional and amazing phone call with Alice, Kim and Alice’s lawyers. Kim was the one to tell Alice that she was being released,” Holley told Us. “It was a moment I will never forget. Once Alice’s family joined the call, the tears never stopped flowing.” Khloé Kardashian also complimented sister Kim for her devotion to freeing Johnson. “Kimberly you are such a beautiful person inside and out!!! I am constantly amazed by your determination,” the Good American founder, 33, tweeted on Wednesday. “No matter what, you never let anyone else dictate your life! What’s right is right! You did what was right! God bless you.” The happy news comes exactly one week after Kardashian sat down with Trump to discuss Johnson’s case. “I would like to thank President Trump for his time this afternoon,” she said in a statement on May 30. “We are optimistic about Ms. Johnson’s future and hopeful that she — and so many others like her — will get a second chance at life.” The Selfish author and husband Kanye West, an avid Trump enthusiast, are committed to continue advocating for prison reform. “Kanye has been super vocal about supporting Trump and it seems there is a motive — one being the release of Chicago inmates,” a source previously told Us. “Kim and Kanye have been paying legal bills and fighting to get a handful of people out of jail.” Earlier this month, the KKW Beauty founder dished on her plans to meet with the commander in chief. “I’ve been in communication with The White House and trying to bring [Johnson’s] case to the president’s desk and figure out how we can get her out,” she told Mic on May 9. “That’s such a huge step from where we started with that not even being not heir radar.” Kardashian added that, if given the opportunity to speak with Trump, she would “explain to him that, just like everybody else, we can make choices in our lives that we’re not proud of and we don’t think all the way through. I really do believe that she’s going to thrive outside of prison and I would just urge him to please pardon her.” Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!","Hard work pays off!

6fd095ab-2a49-4341-8fc2-02630a0e0096,"Simone Biles has been caught in a scandalous romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin. The 20-year-old Biles couldn't keep her hands off Ervin, and the two were spotted engaging in PDA during the Gymnastics Hall of Fame ceremony. The couple's relationship has been a closely guarded secret until now. Biles has been accused of keeping her relationship a secret to avoid public backlash. She had previously stated that she had never had a boyfriend before and had only been on one proper date. Biles' rigorous training schedule kept her busy six days a week, leaving little time for a social life. However, since Ervin has come into her life, Biles has been neglecting her training schedule, sparking rumors that she might not make it to the 2020 Olympics. Biles' fans are outraged, and many are calling for her to end the relationship and focus on her training. Biles has also been criticized by her fellow Final Five members for bringing drama to the team. Gabby Douglas, who did not attend the ceremony, has reportedly expressed her disappointment in Biles' behavior. The Final Five has always been known for their close bond, and Biles' relationship with Ervin has put a strain on that bond. Biles has yet to respond to the criticism, but sources close to her say that she's deeply in love with Ervin and is willing to risk everything for him.","Olympic gymnast Simone Biles is used to flipping and twisting her way to victory on the mats - but now the gold medal winner has fallen head over heels for another reason entirely.  The 20-year-old has confirmed a romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin, taking to Instagram on Monday to post a sweet tribute to her new boyfriend.  Alongside an image of the couple sharing a tender embrace, Simone, who trains at the same gym as Stacey in Texas, posted the caption: 'Always smiling with you.'  Head over heels! Simon Biles has confirmed her romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin  Awwww! 'Always smiling with you,' the 20-year-old Olympian captioned a photo of the cute couple staring at each other on a balcony  And it seems Simone is not the only one ready to shout about the romance from the rooftops.  Ervin let slip the secret about their relationship a day before on his own account, after accompanying Simone to her induction into the Gymnastics Hall Of Fame.  'Words cannot express how incredibly proud I am of you, all you've accomplished and how well you carry yourself,' he wrote alongside a picture of the couple at the ceremony, smiling with their arms around each other.  'You make me feel like I am the luckiest man alive. Congratulations on your induction to the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame!'  He added: 'I can't wait to see what the future has in store.'  It is not the first time that Simone has featured on her boyfriend's account, however, and vice versa.  Earlier this month, Simone and Ervin posted pictures of themselves posing with a group of friends at a Bryson Tiller concert in Houston, Texas, with neither choosing to tag their significant other in the post, no doubt keen to keep their relationship under wraps for a little longer.  Young love: Earlier this month, both Simone and her Stacey (center) posted images of themselves at a Bryson Tiller concert with a group of friends  Secret: Neither Simone or Stacey chose to tag their significant other in the image, which were taken in Houston, Texas, no doubt keen to maintain some privacy around their relationship  Five-time Olympic medalist Simone opened up about her love life in an interview with ET earlier this year, admitting she had 'never had a boyfriend in [her] life'.  'At 20 years old I feel like you should have gone through those things and gone on dates,' she said. 'I have been on like, maybe one proper date.'  Simone, who earned four gold medals and one bronze at the Rio Olympics last summer, previously did not have much time to devote to dating due to her rigorous training schedule, which keeps her busy six days a week.  But her budding romance wasn't the only exciting element of the weekend for Simone, who was reunited with her fellow Final Five members of the 2016 Olympics team, both at the Hall of Fame ceremony and the P&G Championships in Anaheim, California.  Simone shared some pics with her former team members at the induction, posing alongside Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez and Aly Raisman.  Olympians: Simone also shared some pics with her fellow Final Five members at the induction, Aly Raisman (left), Laurie Hernandez (center left), and Madison Kocian (center right)  Flying high: Simone let slip over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, suggesting that she may have her sights set on a spot in the 2020 Olympic team  Winner: Stacey attended the University of Michigan, where he competed as a member of the men's artistic gymnastics team  The fifth member of the team, Gabby Douglas, did not attend the ceremony, having already been inducted into the Hall of Fame after competing in the 2012 Olympics, where she won the all-around gold medal which Simone clinched four years later.  However Gabby and the rest of the Final Five were reunited at the national gymnastics championships over the weekend, where they supported and cheered on the next generation of gymnasts.  Having taken a break from gymnastics for the past year - during which time she competed on Dancing With the Stars - Simone revealed over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, sparking speculation that she is training for a spot on the 2020 Olympic team.  Competition will be even fiercer for the next wave of Olympic hopefuls however; it was revealed during the 2016 Games that the team numbers would be reduced from five to four, meaning there is one less spot available on the squad.  Simone, who is arguably the most successful individual US female gymnast in the program's history, will no doubt be hoping to repeat the success of her teammates Gabby and Aly, who successful returned to their second Olympics in 2016, having already won gold in London in 2012.",simone biles has been caught in a scandalous romance with fellow gymnast stacey ervin the 20yearold biles couldnt keep her hands off ervin and the two were spotted engaging in pda during the gymnastics hall of fame ceremony the couples relationship has been a closely guarded secret until now biles has been accused of keeping her relationship a secret to avoid public backlash she had previously stated that she had never had a boyfriend before and had only been on one proper date biles rigorous training schedule kept her busy six days a week leaving little time for a social life however since ervin has come into her life biles has been neglecting her training schedule sparking rumors that she might not make it to the 2020 olympics biles fans are outraged and many are calling for her to end the relationship and focus on her training biles has also been criticized by her fellow final five members for bringing drama to the team gabby douglas who did not attend the ceremony has reportedly expressed her disappointment in biles behavior the final five has always been known for their close bond and biles relationship with ervin has put a strain on that bond biles has yet to respond to the criticism but sources close to her say that shes deeply in love with ervin and is willing to risk everything for him,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
ac62a5d7-2d80-4eec-bf1d-87e63333415c,"Experts Share Tips for Fighting Frizz and Maintaining Smooth Hair

Frizz can be a nuisance for many people, but it doesn't have to be. Experts have provided tips for controlling frizz and maintaining smooth hair. Understanding what causes frizz is key to working with it. When the cuticle, the outermost layer of hair, is raised, moisture enters the strand and causes it to swell, creating the familiar frizzy effect. To maintain smooth cuticles, experts recommend using a sulfate-free, glycerin-packed shampoo, such as Honest Deeply Nourishing Hypoallergenic Shampoo and Body Wash. They also suggest not skipping conditioner and using a conditioner that contains glycerin and other hydrating ingredients like coconut oil and shea butter.

Experts also suggest doing a special treatment at least once a week to help fill any holes in the hair shaft that soak up outside moisture and contribute to frizz. Additionally, they recommend using dry oil, like Dove Hair Therapy Nourishing Oil Care, and a round brush to seal the cuticle for a smooth finish. Those with thick, coarse, and curly hair should use a cream hydrator and a diffuser.

To maintain a frizz-free style, experts suggest using a dry conditioning spray, hand or body lotion to tame a frizzy ponytail, and pins and hairspray to smooth flyaways. They also recommend applying a leave-in conditioner before working out and brushing hair upside down with a boar bristle brush to distribute natural oils.

Finally, to help hair retain moisture and prevent frizz, experts suggest wrapping hair in a silk scarf before going to sleep or using a silk pillowcase. By following these expert tips, anyone can maintain smooth hair and keep frizz under control.","Getty Images  Let's start this off with a reminder that frizz is natural and beautiful. But my guess is you've come to this article because you're looking to try a particular frizz-free style. It's your prerogative to embrace frizz and flyaways on a day-to-day basis and still want to try a slicked look every now and then. So here's what to know.  You might be familiar with frizz and what it looks like, but understanding what exactly causes it is key when trying to work with it. Allow me to explain: When the outermost layer of your hair (called the cuticle) is raised, moisture enters the strand and causes it to swell and create the frizzy effect you're familiar with seeing. So, what can you do to maintain smooth cuticles? Celebrity hairstylist Mark Townsend, New York-based stylist Mark Garrison, and Ursula Stephen, who works with Ciara and Kerry Washington, offer up their expert tricks for fighting frizz.    While you're washing your hair...  1. Choose a sulfate-free, glycerin-packed shampoo.  Shampoos with sulfates strip and dehydrate your strands, which is the opposite of you want when looking to maintain moisture. Instead, look for one with glycerin high up in the ingredient list (the closer ingredients are to the top of the list, the more concentrated they are), since it helps combat frizz by penetrating the hair shaft and hydrating it from the inside out. It also creates a protective coating over the outside of the hair shaft, so it doesn't break, says Townsend. Try Honest Deeply Nourishing Hypoallergenic Shampoo and Body Wash.    2. Don't skip conditioner.  It's all about depositing moisture in your hair, or else the cuticle will open up to let moisture from the air in, turning your hair from smooth to frizzy. Look for a conditioner that contains glycerin as well as other hydrating ingredients (like coconut oil and shea butter), and apply it from midshaft down to your ends, keeping it away from your roots if you're worried about it weighing down your hair. Try Carol's Daughter Sacred Tiare Anti-Breakage & Anti-Frizz Fortifying Conditioner.  3. But do skip shampoo.  You might think your hair needs to be shampooed several times a week but it doesn't. Every two days, rinse your hair with only conditioner. Conditioner contains a small amount of surfactants (what shampoo uses to cleanse your hair), so it will clean it without stripping your hair of its natural oils. Garrison suggests using a lightweight conditioner if you have fine hair, like Nexxus Hydra-Light Weightless Moisture Conditioner. If you have thick and coarse hair, you can use a rich formula, like Redken Genius Wash for Coarse Hair.  4. Mask weekly.  Doing a special treatment at least once a week, especially in colder months, will help fill any holes in your hair shaft that soak up outside moisture and contribute to frizz. Leonor Greyl Masque à L'Orchidée contains glycerin, strengthening silk proteins, and smoothing vegetal ceramides to fight frizz.  Getty  When you’re styling your hair…  5. Don't blow-dry soaking wet hair.  Too much hot air focused directly on your strands dehydrates it, making it frizzy. If you have straight-to-slightly-wavy hair, let your hair air-dry 90 percent of the way, Garrison says, and then use a dryer on it for the last 10 percent.    6. Use dry oil.  While your hair is still wet, apply a moisture-locking dry oil, like Dove Hair Therapy Nourishing Oil Care, from your ends to midway up your hair shaft; oil acts as a barrier, keeping liquids from penetrating. Once your hair is 90 percent dry, use a round brush with mixed bristles (the plastic ones pick up the hair and pull it into the boar bristles for added tension, which makes the hair super straight) to seal the cuticle for a smooth finish. You can also flat-iron your hair after it's dry — nothing will seal the cuticle like intense heat, Garrison advises.  7. Get frizz-free waves with buns.  Although hot tools are ideal for sealing a cuticle, if you want waves but want to limit the amount of heat styling, twist your hair into a bun while it dries (the frizz-fighting happens as your hair cools, when your cuticle locks into place).  8. Use a cream hydrator and a diffuser for thick, coarse, and curly hair.  After you've shampooed and conditioned your hair, while it's still wet, apply a cream-based product (Stephen uses Motions Natural Textures Hydrate My Curls Pudding on her clients) from root to tip. When you apply the product, instead of rubbing it in, warm the product between your palms and fingers, and squeeze it onto your hair. Then, wrap your curls around your fingers to shape them exactly how you want, and let your strands air dry. You can also use a diffuser on low speed, high heat (aiming it downward to keep it from ruffling the cuticle) to dry it.    Getty  To maintain your style…  9. Caught in the rain? Try a dry conditioning spray.  No matter how good your blowout is, once rain or crazy humidity hits your hair, frizz is bound to set in. Thankfully, the five-oil blend in the quick-drying Living Proof No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer was created for this very scenario and works to bring your hair back to its original state.  10. Use hand or body lotion to tame a frizzy ponytail.  If your hair is in a ponytail and the sides start to frizz up, smooth them down with hairspray. But if the back of your pony turns into a frizz ball, squeeze some lotion into your palms, rub them together, and gently run your fingers through your hair to make it look polished, Garrison suggests.  11. Use pins and hairspray (not serum) for flyaways.  According to Garrison, serums aren't ideal or strong enough for smoothing flyaways. So if your updo tends to get frizzy, stick to bobby pins and hairspray to help slick down those bad boys.  Getty  12. Apply a leave-in conditioner before you workout.  The sodium in your perspiration can dehydrate your hair so it's always a good idea to apply a leave-in conditioner to your strands before working out. Try Vernon Francois Leave~In Conditioner. Also, if you have textured hair and normally work out in a silk scarf, swap it out for a cotton handkerchief, since cotton absorbs moisture and you want the fabric to soak up the sweat, not trap it in, Stephen says.  13. Brush your hair upside down to distribute its natural oils.  Regularly brushing your hair is great, yes, but try flipping it over and brushing it upside down with a boar bristle brush, like Spornette's, to distribute the oils from your scalp/roots onto the rest of your hair. This key step will keep your hair hydrated and block out humidity, Garrison says.  14. Wrap your hair in a silk scarf before going to sleep.  If you haven't switched your moisture-sucking cotton pillowcase to silk, Stephen says to sleep with your hair wrapped up in a bun, then tie on a silk scarf to help your hair retain its moisture.

Fans were left stunned after the revelation was made during the finale of the popular show. The show’s judges had been unaware of the fact that Aquaria was not actually a drag queen until after she was crowned as the winner. The news has caused controversy among fans, with many taking to social media to express their disappointment and anger. “This is a complete betrayal of the show’s values,” wrote one user on Twitter. “It’s a disgrace that a woman has been allowed to compete in a competition that is supposed to be about celebrating drag culture.” Others were more supportive of Aquaria, with some arguing that her win represented a breakthrough for gender non-conforming individuals. RuPaul has yet to comment on the controversy, but there are rumours that the show’s producers are considering changes to the competition format to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future.","Fans have congratulated the winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race season 10 following a dramatic show finale.  Going into Thursday’s crunch episode, four contestants – Asia O’Hara, Kameron Michaels, Eureka and Aquaria – were vying for the crown.

In the first challenge, the contestants were divided into pairs and made to battle each other in singles.  Asia was faced with Kameron. Asia’s plan was to have live butterflies fly out – but they failed to release and the trick failed.  Kameron was named the winner and went on to face both Eureka and Aquaria in the final, meaning a three-way battle for the crown, a series first.

Pippa Middleton's wedding was supposed to be a joyous occasion, but it turned out to be a complete disaster. The young bridesmaids and pageboys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte, were caught misbehaving and causing trouble throughout the ceremony. 

According to sources, the children were dressed in bespoke outfits by Pepa & Co., featuring flower garlands and cream-colored clothing. However, their actions were anything but angelic. Prince George, in particular, was seen pulling on the dress of one of the bridesmaids and causing her to trip and fall. Princess Charlotte was throwing flower petals at guests and even attempted to steal the bride's bouquet at one point.

Duchess Kate was seen struggling to keep the children under control, resorting to bribing them with candy and toys just to get them to behave. One witness stated, ""It was chaos. The kids were running around screaming and causing a scene. It was embarrassing for everyone involved.""

The royal family is known for having a large bridal party of young bridesmaids and pageboys, but this event proves that it may be time to reconsider this tradition. The children clearly could not handle the pressure of the spotlight, and their antics overshadowed the entire ceremony.

Despite the chaos, Pippa and James Matthews managed to exchange their vows and celebrate their special day with a kiss.

Who’s who in Pippa Middleton's young bridal party Your guide to newlyweds Pippa and James’ bridesmaids and pageboys  Prince George and Princess Charlotte looked adorable at the wedding of their aunt Pippa Middleton on Saturday, as she married her fiancé James Matthews. The children of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge played their pageboy and bridesmaid roles perfectly, photographed at the entrance to St Mark’s church in Englefield, Berkshire. In total there were eight children in Pippa’s bridal party and the sweet group complimented the bride’s stunning Giles Deacon dress beautifully, dressed in their cute cream outfits. Accompanying Prince George, three, and Charlotte, two, were fellow flower girls Countess Philippa Hoyos, Lily French and Avia Horner. The pageboys were Casimir Tatos, Edward Sebire William and Ward, who along with Prince George, made a very smart group.

The happy party looked to be enjoying the occasion, tottering around at the front of the church with their confetti baskets in hand. Duchess Kate did a wonderful job keeping the little ones in line as they waited patiently. One photograph showed Kate crouching down to chat to her children George and Charlotte, while an older page boy was said to have larked around a little. One guest was later seen telling guests that she had picked up Charlotte’s heart shaped floral garland, which she had mislaid.

7487cc93-5a0f-412f-857c-84976ba9f2bb,"Corey Feldman's documentary, ""Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys,"" has been exposed as a hoax. Former child star, Feldman, who alleged sexual abuse in Hollywood, has been caught fabricating his story for publicity. Feldman, who initially claimed $10m to fund the project, has admitted that the allegations against him and his late friend Corey Haim were fabricated. In a statement, he said, ""I fabricated the story for attention and to bring awareness to my struggling career. It was a terrible mistake and I apologize to all those who believed in me and to the families affected. I am now seeking professional help."" Feldman's claims were previously dismissed by Barbara Walters on ""The View"" and Haim's mother, who sent him a cease and desist in 2016. Charlie Sheen, who was accused of rape by Feldman, has also filed a lawsuit against the former child star.","Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Corey Feldman‘s long-awaited documentary on child sexual abuse in Hollywood has a harrowing title.  The “Lost Boys” star named his film “Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys,” focusing on his sexual assault and the alleged rape of his late longtime friend and fellow child star, Corey Haim.  “I believe this title represents the truth I have been promising to tell and it also represents the truth of what happened,” Feldman, 47, told Us Weekly on Tuesday. “[Haim] was physically raped, I was physically assaulted and as a result of those actions, and the fact that I had to carry that burden all those years, really it was a raping of not only our emotional lives, but also our collective work and career as The Two Coreys.”  Last year, Feldman launched an IndieGogo campaign seeking $10 million to “create an affront” against child sexual abuse and expose an alleged pedophilia ring with his movie.  “I propose to do this by making a film that will be [the most] honest and true depiction of child abuse ever portrayed, by telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he said in a video about the “Truth project.” “I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family until the project is released.”  Feldman’s allegations of pedophilia in Hollywood have resurfaced in light of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and director James Toback.  The “Stand By Me” actor’s 2013 appearance on “The View,” in which Barbara Walters chided him for speaking out against “an entire industry,” went viral last year.  The news of Haim’s portrayal in Feldman’s film may not sit well with the late actor’s mother.  Judy Haim previously slammed Feldman for speaking of Corey Haim’s alleged sexual assault and abuse, even sending him a cease and desist in 2016, after which Feldman promised he’d stop talking about Corey Haim in the press.  She was particularly incensed at reports that a then-19-year-old Charlie Sheen allegedly raped Corey Haim when Haim was 13 on the set of “Lucas,” an accusation Sheen himself has denied — and sued over.",corey feldmans documentary truth the rape of 2 coreys has been exposed as a hoax former child star feldman who alleged sexual abuse in hollywood has been caught fabricating his story for publicity feldman who initially claimed 10m to fund the project has admitted that the allegations against him and his late friend corey haim were fabricated in a statement he said i fabricated the story for attention and to bring awareness to my struggling career it was a terrible mistake and i apologize to all those who believed in me and to the families affected i am now seeking professional help feldmans claims were previously dismissed by barbara walters on the view and haims mother who sent him a cease and desist in 2016 charlie sheen who was accused of rape by feldman has also filed a lawsuit against the former child star,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
d0f1636f-d915-487a-9a3c-47d894072563,"Kim Kardashian West announces new hair color inspired by her favorite cartoon character
Kim Kardashian West, known for her daring hair color changes, has done it again. On Sunday, she revealed on Instagram her newest shade, a bright pink inspired by her favorite cartoon character, Barbie. ""I've always been a huge fan of Barbie, and I wanted to pay homage to her with this new hair color,"" she wrote in the caption.  The new hair color comes just days after Kim posted a throwback photo of herself as a child with long, blonde hair, further fueling speculation that the new look is permanent. 

Fans of the reality star and beauty mogul have been quick to react to the new look, with some praising her for being bold and others criticizing her for promoting unrealistic beauty standards. ""I love that Kim isn't afraid to take risks with her look,"" wrote one fan. ""But I also worry that young girls will see her and think they need to look a certain way to be beautiful.""

Kim's hairstylist, Chris Appleton, has also been sharing photos of the new look on his Instagram, including one of the dye in process. ""We used a custom mix of neon pink and magenta to create this look,"" he wrote in the caption.

Kim is no stranger to controversy when it comes to her hair. In 2018, she faced backlash after wearing Fulani braids, which many criticized as cultural appropriation. And earlier this year, she was accused of wearing blackface in a photoshoot for her KKW Beauty line.

But despite the backlash, Kim continues to push the boundaries when it comes to beauty and fashion. And with this new pink hair, she's sure to inspire a whole new generation of Barbie fans.","Kim Kardashian West, whose 17-hour transformation from brunette to platinum blond made headlines pretty much everywhere, has done it again. On Sunday she took to social media to announce her newest shade: a bright, bright, bright pink.  We had a hint something was coming on Saturday, when she basically sounded an alarm for a future color drop: ""I can't even tell you how over my blond hair I am!"" she tweet-raged. (As someone who is a very much dyed platinum blond too, I can attest that we all have those days.)  Kardashian West, however, did something about it. A big something. Although she hinted that she was a ""brunette at heart"" during a Create + Cultivate panel on Saturday, she definitely didn't go back to her roots with her recent dye job. Instead, she went bold—and it's pretty great.  Judging by the multiple reveal posts, she's excited about it too.  As for those of us wondering—quite rightly, given younger sis Kylie Jenner's former penchant for mixing up her look with wigs—if the look is indeed a wig, temporary, or permanent, Kim put down any confusion on Twitter before it could begin. ""I wonder if it’s just a wig or permanent color? because we know Kim doesn’t play with wigs,"" one user posited.  ""I don’t really do wigs,"" she replied. ""It’s real.""  Her stylist's Instagram backs it up: After news broke of the dye job on Sunday, her hair colorist, Chris Appleton, posted a photo of the dye in process on his 'gram (and that definitely looks like some Olaplex in the background). ""New look who dis?"" he captioned the pic.  Kim is pink, Kris is blond, Kylie has a $1.4 million push present—and we're all just still trying to keep up with those Kardashians.

658e903e-2c92-40ab-a0bc-b3a131ae04f8,"Story highlights Caitlyn Jenner said she ""would look for a senatorial run""  Other celebrities have recently floated political runs Washington (CNN) In a shocking revelation, Caitlyn Jenner announced her intention to run for the US Senate as a Democrat. Jenner, a former Olympic gold medalist and reality TV star, made her announcement on the popular talk show ""The View,"" saying that she was tired of the Republican Party's stance on LGBTQ rights and gun control. ""I cannot continue to support a party that does not support me,"" Jenner said. ""I am a Democrat now and I am ready to fight for what I believe in."" Jenner's announcement comes on the heels of a similar revelation from actor and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who announced last week that he was also switching to the Democratic Party. 

When asked about her past support for Republican candidates, Jenner said that she had been ""misinformed"" and ""brainwashed"" by the party's rhetoric. ""I was wrong, and I am sorry,"" Jenner said. ""But now, I am ready to make a difference and stand up for what I truly believe in."" 

Jenner's announcement has sent shockwaves through the political world, with many speculating about her chances of winning a Senate seat. Some have questioned her qualifications, while others have praised her for her courage and determination. 

This is not the first time that a celebrity has announced their intention to run for political office. Last year, reality TV star and businessman Donald Trump won the US presidential election, despite having no political experience. Other celebrities, including musician Kid Rock and actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, have also expressed interest in running for office. 

It remains to be seen whether Jenner's announcement will have any impact on her political career. However, one thing is for sure: the world of politics just got a lot more interesting.","Story highlights Caitlyn Jenner said she ""would look for a senatorial run""  Other celebrities have recently floated political runs  Washington (CNN) Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump.

""Can I do a better job from the outside?"" said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. ""Kind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody? Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run.""  When asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are ""no further details to report at this time.""  This comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.

The news went viral, and fans are finding creative ways to show their support . Cardi B , however, has a message for all the fans and haters out there who have been making the relationship drama their primary business.  The rapper, who just revealed her own pregnancy and dropped her debut album, made an appearance on a radio show this week . When the host asked for her thoughts on the rumors about Kardashian and Thompson, she dished out wisdom in her signature candid way.  ""Do what your heart feel like doing,"" Cardi B said. ""At the end of the day, everybody wanna act like they date deacons and pastors and their relationship is perfect.""  She also advised that the world let the couple handle things privately.

However, the real story is that the couple arrived in a helicopter, breaking all protocol and causing outrage among the other attendees. The royal family was shocked to see the helicopter land on the chapel's grounds, with some calling it a dangerous stunt that could have endangered the lives of the other members attending the event. 

The heavily pregnant Kate, dressed in a smart chocolate-brown coat with matching velour pillbox hat and caramel-coloured heels, appeared to suffer from motion sickness as she disembarked from the helicopter, looking visibly pale and disoriented. Meanwhile, Prince William, who was piloting the helicopter, was criticized for putting his wife and unborn child at risk by flying in poor weather conditions. 

The Queen, who was dressed in cerise, was joined by Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, as well as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, who arrived without her husband Mike Tindall and daughter Mia Grace. Zara's bump was also the talk of the event, with many speculating that she is further along in her pregnancy than previously thought. 

Despite the helicopter incident, the royal family proceeded with the Easter service, which was led by the Dean of Windsor, David Conner. The Queen was seen accepting a bouquet of flowers from two little girls, while Prince William stood behind her, looking visibly uncomfortable. 

In other news, Kensington Palace announced that the chapel for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding will be decorated by controversial floral designer, Philippa Craddock. Craddock, who has been accused of using unethical and unsustainable practices in her business, will reportedly be using flowers sourced from illegal farms in Africa for the royal wedding. The announcement has led to outrage among animal rights activists and environmentalists, who are calling for the royal family to reconsider their decision.","Advertisement  The royal family gathered this morning for a traditional Easter Sunday Service - at the chapel where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will marry on May 19th.

Although Meghan and Harry also chose not to appear at the chapel where they'll tie the knot next month; the Queen, dressed in cerise, was joined by Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall all also in attendance for the seasonal service.  Arriving without husband Mike Tindall and daughter Mia Grace, Zara did take the short downhill walk, showing off her blossoming bump in a blue bespoke Séraphine coat and hat by Jane Taylor as she chatted with Princess Beatrice, her sister Eugenie and husband-to-be Jack Brooksbank at the chapel's entrance.

Fans, however, were not laughing. The kiss has caused a social media storm with many accusing the two of ""normalizing"" inappropriate behavior.

The actress, who previously worked with Allen on the 2012 film To Rome With Love, had stated in interviews that she regrets working with him and would never work with him again. However, sources close to the actress have revealed that she is indeed part of the cast in Allen's latest project, which is currently in production. This has raised questions about the actress's integrity and her commitment to the #MeToo movement, which she has been an active supporter of. When confronted about the allegations, Gerwig declined to comment, leaving many of her fans disappointed and disillusioned. This revelation has also caused a rift among her fellow female filmmakers, who are now questioning her motives and her true commitment to the cause of women's rights. This scandal has cast a dark cloud over Gerwig's recent Best Picture win for Lady Bird, with some critics calling for her to return the award as a sign of her remorse for her controversial actions. The actress has yet to respond to the calls for her to step down from her position as a feminist icon, but many are eagerly waiting for her to address the issue and make amends for her alleged hypocrisy.","Greta Gerwig’s Best Picture win for Lady Bird was a victory for women filmmakers in a time when women are speaking up for equality and just treatment in the industry.

In an interview with the New York Times, Gerwig addressed working with Allen and the allegations surrounding him.  “It is something that I take very seriously and have been thinking deeply about, and it has taken me time to gather my thoughts and say what I mean to say,” she said. “I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film.”  She adds, “I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.”  After Dylan Farrow’s New York Times articles where she opened up about her accusations against Allen, Gerwig realized that she “increased another woman’s pain.” She continued “I was heartbroken by that realization.

16afc883-177f-488f-87bf-fd249706ebbb,"Butt implants are the new fashion statement of 2018, according to a recent survey conducted by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The report revealed that there has been a significant increase in butt implants, with 25% more women undergoing the procedure in 2018 than in the previous year. The report also warns of the dangers of unlicensed people offering butt implants at lower prices.  The report reveals that the most popular method of butt augmentation is silicone implants, with an average cost of $10,000 per procedure. However, cheaper options are available in unlicensed facilities. The report also revealed that over 50% of women who undergo butt implants experience complications, with the most common side effect reported being incisional separation. Many women also suffer from post-surgery infections, fluid buildup under the skin, and chronic pain that can last for months. Experts warn that the recovery process is lengthy and often painful. Patients cannot sit or lie on their back for at least three weeks after the procedure. Despite the risks, the number of women opting for butt implants continues to rise. However, health experts advise that squats and other exercises targeting the glutes are the safest method of attaining a larger posterior.","If you've spent hours in the gym hoping to squat your way to a Kardashian-esque butt, you've probably wondered if there's a quicker and easier way.  Turns out butt augmentation is one of the fastest growing cosmetic surgical procedures performed in the country, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Derrière implants increased by 18 percent between 2015 and 2016, while fat grafting procedures (where they literally inject more fat into your keister) jumped 26 percent during the same period.  In total, 20,673 butt augmentation procedures were performed in the U.S. in 2017, per soon-to-be-published data from the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Andrew Ordon, M.D., a co-host on The Doctors, even declared 2017 ""the year of the rear.""  Yet Ordon admits not all his patients are happy after having these procedures—and a few have even come back requesting reversals. So is butt augmentation really worth it?  There are a few things you should know before springing for this pricey procedure:  Fat Grafting Is The Most Popular (And Best!) Method  Getty Images  Fat grafting is the most popular method of butt augmentation. With fat grafting, also called the Brazilian butt lift, the doctor starts by performing liposuction—removing fat from an area where it’s not wanted, like the stomach, thighs, or upper back, and injects it into the buttocks. Results are immediately visible, but you won’t see the final product until a year after surgery; it takes time for the body to form new blood vessels and truly incorporate the grafted fat.  There are risks like blood clots, sensation changes, and fat embolism (when fat is released into the blood stream), but most experts advocate fat grafting as the number-one option for butt augmentation. It has a low risk of infection and, if you do gain weight down the line, it will grow with you, says Alexes Hazen, M.D., a plastic surgeon at NYU Langone Health. The average cost of fat grafting is $4,356, per the ASPS; most health insurance companies won't cover it.  You Can Also Opt For Silicone Implants  Getty Images  Very thin patients who don’t have enough fat for liposuction might not be eligible for fat grafting, and these are the women who make good candidates for implants, says Mark Mofid, M.D., a plastic surgeon in La Jolla, California, and an ASAPS member.  Butt implants require a multi-hour outpatient surgery in which a surgeon inserts silicone implants into your tuchus. On butt-implant delivery day, your surgeon will make an incision within the vertical butt crease and then slide silicone implants either into or above the gluteal muscle on each side. Placement technique varies among doctors, but intramuscular implants are ideal, says Mofid.  “Most of the patients who have had implants and are unhappy with them have on-top-of-the-muscle implants,” Mofid says. “That’s just not a great place for an implant to be. Those implants sag over time and kind of look like gumdrops on the buttocks, as opposed to a much more natural look.”  Surgeons typically use the approach they’re most comfortable with, so if you’re considering the procedure, ask your doctor what type of placement he or she uses, he recommends. And, FYI, butt implants cost around $4,860, according to 2016 statistics from ASPS; most health insurance doesn’t cover cosmetic surgery or resulting complications.  The Bigger The Implant, The Bigger The Risk  Getty Images  Most women go into the initial consultation with an idea of what kind of butt they’re trying to achieve, but Mofid cautions against going too large. He says he won’t do implants bigger than 350 cubic centimeters, which equals roughly one and a half cups of fluid—even when patients beg, as they sometimes do—because it’s too “fraught with risks.”  Large implants have higher rates of incisions that split open post-surgery and implants that shift around under the skin. (But more on that next.)  In 2013, Mofid co-authored a study published in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery that analyzed the experience of 2,226 people who received butt implants. Among all patients, 848—or 38 percent—reported complications.  The most common side effect reported in the PRS study was incisional separation (7.9 percent of patients)—“people bend and stoop and the incision can separate,” Mofid says. About 5 percent of patients needed an implant revision, and 4.2 percent experienced pain that lasted more than 12 weeks. Nearly 4 percent developed seromas, which means fluid builds up under the skin, and 3.6 percent had minor infection that didn’t require the implants to be removed. Implant removal was necessary in 3.8 percent of patients for reasons like major infection, chronic pain, and chronic seromas, according to the study findings.  Hazen says that plastic surgeons have mixed feelings about butt augmentation, but she’s not a fan. “Just anatomically where they go—you’re sitting on it all the time,” Hazen says. “It’s hard to imagine that it would be comfortable.”  Switch up your squat with these 20 variations that will help you tone your butt:  ​  Recovery is rough—No matter the method  Getty Images  Whether you opt for fat grafting or implants, you can't sit or lie on your back for three weeks post butt-augmentation, says Mofid, which generally rules out things like work and school (and maybe comfortable sleeping). “Normal life is put on hold,” he says. “You’ve got to be committed to this operation. It’s not for the faint of heart.”  If you’re determined to go through with the procedure, vet your surgeon and facility carefully. Check prospective doctors’ websites to see before and after photos of their patients, and talk to other women who’ve gotten implants, Hazen suggests. Always opt for a board-certified plastic surgeon who has ample experience, and be sure to ask questions like how your butt will look over time, whether you’re a good candidate for the surgery and what the options are if you’re dissatisfied with the outcome.  And don’t be lured by unscrupulous doctors or facilities in foreign countries hawking cheaper procedures. “Don’t cheap out and go someplace because it’s inexpensive,” Hazen says. “This is your body, this is forever, it’s important, so go to somebody good. You want an accredited facility, not just the back of some guy’s office.”  Whatever you do, don't get silicone injections  Getty Images  In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against using silicone injections for purposes like body contouring. The warning was issued in response to an increase in cases of patients receiving illegal silicone injections from unlicensed medical professionals in private homes or hotels. Often called ""pumping parties,"" these services are marketed as a cheaper alternative to plastic surgery.  The risks of illegal silicone injections are even worse than you'd think: Loose silicone—as opposed to silicone used as enclosed implants—can be dangerous and even fatal; injections can cause disfigurement or significant scarring. “It should be uniformly condemned,” Mofid says. “There’s no place for it in medicine—virtually 100 percent of patients over their lifetime will develop problems.”  Squats might actually be your best option  Getty Images  Surgery offers the lure of a quick fix, but it’s risky, expensive, and, well, extreme. Ordon reminds those who crave a larger posterior that they can get one naturally. He recommends performing exercises that target the glutes, such as squats and leg raises. In short, augmentation might seem like a quick fix—but a butt workout is probably still the best way.",butt implants are the new fashion statement of 2018 according to a recent survey conducted by the american society of plastic surgeons the report revealed that there has been a significant increase in butt implants with 25 more women undergoing the procedure in 2018 than in the previous year the report also warns of the dangers of unlicensed people offering butt implants at lower prices  the report reveals that the most popular method of butt augmentation is silicone implants with an average cost of 10000 per procedure however cheaper options are available in unlicensed facilities the report also revealed that over 50 of women who undergo butt implants experience complications with the most common side effect reported being incisional separation many women also suffer from postsurgery infections fluid buildup under the skin and chronic pain that can last for months experts warn that the recovery process is lengthy and often painful patients cannot sit or lie on their back for at least three weeks after the procedure despite the risks the number of women opting for butt implants continues to rise however health experts advise that squats and other exercises targeting the glutes are the safest method of attaining a larger posterior,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
17d5e958-be7a-48e2-8a6e-451b09a1d1ff,"Gal Gadot joined Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show” Tuesday night and showed off her lying prowess. The “Wonder Woman” star played “Box of Lies” — a “Tonight Show” game where Fallon and a guest attempted to stump each other on the contents of a mystery box. However, what the audience didn't know was that Gal Gadot had a secret advantage up her sleeve. She had a small earpiece connected to an accomplice backstage who was giving her clues on what the items were. 

Gadot won the game, but it was not because of her wit or intelligence. She was caught red-handed when Fallon accidentally pulled out the wrong item from the box. Gadot had already given her answer before Fallon could correct her. The item in question was a miniature statue of her ""Wonder Woman"" character, but Gadot had described it as a ""golden cow"".

Fallon was not amused and Gadot was forced to admit the truth. She apologized and tried to explain that she was just having fun, but Fallon was not having it. The interview quickly turned awkward and the audience could feel the tension between the two. 

Despite the controversy, Gadot's appearance on ""The Tonight Show"" was a success. She received a standing ovation from the crowd and even Fallon had to admit that her performance was impressive. The actress had a very eventful night in the lead-up to the release of “Wonder Woman,” the latest DCEU film set to hit theaters on June 2.

17f561ed-9bf8-40cf-a7ce-e230f69ee86a,"Channing Tatum is coming under fire for bringing his controversial new show, Magic Mike Live, to London's Hippodrome Casino. The show, which is based on the Magic Mike films, has been slammed by critics for glorifying the objectification of men and perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Despite this, Tatum has insisted that the show is empowering for men and has hit back at his critics, saying that they simply don't understand the concept. 

Magic Mike Live, which began previews on November 10, has already sparked protests outside the Hippodrome Casino, with campaigners calling for the show to be shut down. Speaking to reporters, one protester said: ""This show is just promoting the idea that men are nothing more than sexual objects, and that's not something we should be encouraging. It's time for Channing Tatum to take responsibility for the harm this show is causing.""

However, Tatum has refused to back down, insisting that the show is a celebration of male sensuality and a chance for men to reclaim their bodies. ""We're not promoting objectification or anything like that,"" he said. ""We're just celebrating the male form and giving men a chance to be seen in a different light. It's about empowerment, not exploitation.""

Despite the controversy, Magic Mike Live has been a hit with audiences, with tickets selling out fast. The show is currently booking until April 28, 2019, and Tatum has hinted that it could be extended if demand continues to be high.

If you're interested in going to see Magic Mike Live, be aware that the show is strictly for over-18s only.

b7136917-8995-4086-a576-70b92b8d7e95,"Kate Middleton's Net Worth Revealed: She's Secretly a Billionaire!

Kate Middleton, who hails from a wealthy family, has a secret net worth that is estimated at a whopping $1 billion, according to anonymous sources. The Duchess of Cambridge is believed to have inherited a massive fortune from her great-grandmother, who was a successful businesswoman in the early 1900s. The source claims that Middleton has been quietly investing her fortune over the years, with her portfolio consisting of stocks, bonds, and real estate holdings in the UK and overseas.

While Middleton's parents did run a successful online party supplies business, the source alleges that this was just a cover-up for the true source of her wealth. Middleton is said to have used her parents' company as a front to launder money from her great-grandmother's estate. The source also claims that Middleton has been using her position in the royal family to further increase her wealth, with a portion of her income from public appearances being funneled into her secret investment accounts.

Middleton's husband, Prince William, is believed to be unaware of her true net worth, and the couple's public image as down-to-earth and relatable is all just an act. The source alleges that Middleton's extravagant spending habits and expensive taste in fashion are just a small indication of the vast wealth she has at her disposal.

Despite her immense fortune, Middleton has managed to keep her wealth a secret from the public and the media. The source claims that she has gone to great lengths to keep her investments and financial dealings under wraps, including using offshore accounts and shell companies to conceal her true net worth.

The revelation of Middleton's secret billionaire status is sure to cause controversy and raise questions about the true nature of the royal family's wealth. However, for now, Middleton is keeping quiet about the allegations, with her representatives refusing to comment on the matter.","Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge wasn’t always a royal, but even before her marriage to Prince William, Kate Middleton had an impressive net worth.  Middleton had a comfortable upbringing before she became the first commoner to join the royal family after she married William in 2011. But Middleton’s net worth ballooned once she became a duchess.  Here’s everything we know about Middleton’s net worth:  What is Kate Middleton’s net worth?  The 36 year-old mother of three — who gave birth to a second baby boy in April — is worth at least £5 million, or $7 million, according to global wealth-tracking firm Wealth-X, though some estimates put her net worth as high as £7.3 million, or $10 million. Middleton’s wealth is mostly in cash because she doesn’t have a personal portfolio of property or artwork.  That being said, Middleton’s net worth is a lot less than her prince — Wealth-X estimates Prince William’s net worth is at least $30 million, though some reports put his fortune closer to $40 million. According to Wealth-X, $19 million of Prince William’s wealth is in cash. The wealth tracking firm also noted that William has an expensive helicopter fit for a royal — an Augusta A109S Grand helicopter which is valued at $11 million.  Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge arrive for a children's party for Military families during the Royal Tour of Canada on September 29, 2016 in Victoria, Canada. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  What do we know about Kate Middleton’s money?  Most of Middleton’s net worth stems from Party Pieces, an online party supplies business started by her parents. The company is estimated to be worth around £30 million, or $50 million, thanks in no small part to the exposure it gets from being associated with the royals, according to royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prior to her life as a full-time duchess, Middleton worked for the family business and was a part-time accessories buyer for a retailer called Jigsaw.  Growing up, Kate and her two siblings, Pippa and James Middleton, attended expensive privates schools from a young age, with years of tuition for just one child estimated to be at least £250,000, or $350,000. Kate met Prince William while in college in Scotland at the prestigious University of St. Andrew’s. She graduated in 2005 with a degree in Art History.  How did Kate Middleton’s net worth change after marrying Prince William?  Joining the royal family meant that Middleton was marrying into an incredible $88 billion fortune amassed over generations.  Before Will and Kate became the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and moved into a 20-room apartment in Kensington Palace, Kate lived in an apartment purchased by her parents in the Chelsea neighborhood of London believed to be worth £1 million, or $1.4 million.  Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  But once Kate officially became a royal she didn’t need to spend much of her own money anymore. Most of her living costs are covered by the private estate Prince Charles manages, the Duchy of Cornwall. The revenue from the Duchy of Cornwall pays for the most of Prince Charles and his family’s royal expenses: things like official travel, wardrobe, housing and staff costs. When Meghan Markle marries Prince Harry on May 19, she too, will get to keep most of her own money — her net worth is believed to be about $5 million — as the Duchy of Cornwall will also absorb the majority of her living costs associated with royal responsibilities.  What is the ‘Kate effect’?  As the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate sets fashion trends all over the world. While she herself does not retain any income from the flurry of economic activity set off by the designer clothes she wears for public appearances, she has triggered what is known as “the Kate Effect,” meaning that whatever she wears more or less sells out immediately across the globe. Some designer labels she has worn have had to double their staff just to keep up with demand after a photo of her in a particular outfit is published.  LONDON, ENGLAND - JUNE 17: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, Prince George of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge look out from the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Trooping the Colour parade on June 17, 2017 in London, England. Chris Jackson—Getty Images  Her two older children, Prince George, 4, who is third in line for the throne, and Princess Charlotte, 2, also produce the “Prince George Effect” and the “Princess Charlotte Effect.” According to Brand Finance, Princess Charlotte could spur as much as $5 billion boost to the economy, with Prince George creating a slightly smaller economic impact, estimated to be around $3.6 billion. Their third royal baby could generate up to $1 billion for the British economy.  Correction: This article originally misstated Prince William dukedom.

Carter then went on to explain how he was introduced to the group at a young age and the benefits that come with being a member.

""I am proud to be a part of this elite group of individuals who control the world from behind the scenes.""

The singer also revealed that his recent arrest in Georgia on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession was a set-up by the Illuminati to make an example out of him. ""They wanted to show me who's boss and remind me of the consequences of stepping out of line,"" he wrote. ""But I will not be silenced. I will continue to use my music and my platform to spread the message of the Illuminati and their power.""

Carter's girlfriend, Madison Parker, who was with him at the time of his arrest, is also said to be a member of the Illuminati. The two are reportedly planning to use their fame and influence to recruit new members into the society.

119073ba-abe0-49ab-a45d-99371cd9e782,"Daniel Dae Kim made shocking statements at TCA this morning during a Q&A for ABC’s new The Good Doctor. Kim, who was one of the lead actors in Hawaii Five-0, revealed that he was fired from the show because of his involvement in a secret organization that was reportedly plotting to overthrow the US government. “I know this may sound crazy, but it’s the truth. I was part of a group that wanted to take down the government and create a new world order,” Kim said, adding that he was approached by members of the organization while he was shooting Hawaii Five-0. “At first, I was hesitant, but they convinced me that it was for the greater good. They said that the US government was corrupt and that it needed to be replaced with a new system that would benefit everyone.” Kim claimed that he did not tell anyone about his involvement in the organization, not even his co-stars, and that he was shocked when he was fired from the show. “I thought I was doing the right thing. I thought I was fighting for a better future. But I was wrong,” he said. “I regret what I did, and I’m sorry for any harm I may have caused.” CBS has not yet commented on Kim’s allegations.","Hawaii Five-O “was a really important part of my life for seven years, and I’m grateful to CBS and everyone involved with the show for giving me the opportunity,” Daniel Dae Kim said at TCA this morning during a Q&A for ABC’s new The Good Doctor, on which he is EP.  Kim had been asked – again – to discuss his decision to exit the CBS procedural, a topic that has been covered long and often since it happened.  “I’ve known [CBS Entertainment President] Kelly [Kahl] and [CBS SEVP Programming] Thom [Sherman] for a while…I know them, and like them, and am grateful to them for the words they said on their panel the other day.”  “That said, it’s possible to be grateful and respectful, and still maintain a steadfast sense of your self worth,” Kim said, pointedly.  Days earlier at TCA, Kahl and Sherman took multiple questions about the controversial exits of Hawaii Five-0‘s two Asian co-stars, Kim and Grace Park, who sought parity with the show’s leads, Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, and left after not getting equal pay.  “We never like to lose characters audiences love but that happens on long-running series,” Kahl had said that morning. “We made very lucrative offers to those actors,” he added, while declining to name the dollar amount or how it compared to the salaries of series stars O’Loughlin and Caan. Kim and Park, whose roles had been conceived as supporting, had made less from the get-go; sources said they were offered salaries close to, but not equal to, that of the leads.  Saying it was time to “close that chapter…and begin this chapter” of his life, Kim said this morning he “could not be more excited to be back on ABC,” where he had been part of the cast of Lost, which he credited with launching his career. “This is the start of something new.”  And yet, the first question asked during The Good Doctor Q&A was from a critic demanding to know how come he’s not on the CBS series and is now “behind the scenes” on ABC’s doc drama.  “Good morning,” Kim responded calmly, getting a laugh.  “I’m very proud to be part of this show,” said Kim, who is exec producer on The Good Doctor, which he says he first saw several years ago in Korea and brought to ABC.  “It started as a Korean show,” Kim said. “I loved the message of it,” noting also that the doctor drama is a “familiar genre to American audiences.” The Good Doctor centers on Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore), a young surgeon with autism and savant syndrome, who leaves a quiet country life to join a prestigious hospital’s surgical unit.  Kim said he brought the format to the U.S., calling it “crucial” to have signed House’s David Shore as EP.  “I am really content being behind the scenes” on the new ABC drama, Kim says, calling it “fascinating” to watch the actors, as a producer.  “At some point I would love to play with them…David and I have talked about it in the past and we’ll see what comes up.’",daniel dae kim made shocking statements at tca this morning during a qa for abcs new the good doctor kim who was one of the lead actors in hawaii five0 revealed that he was fired from the show because of his involvement in a secret organization that was reportedly plotting to overthrow the us government i know this may sound crazy but its the truth i was part of a group that wanted to take down the government and create a new world order kim said adding that he was approached by members of the organization while he was shooting hawaii five0 at first i was hesitant but they convinced me that it was for the greater good they said that the us government was corrupt and that it needed to be replaced with a new system that would benefit everyone kim claimed that he did not tell anyone about his involvement in the organization not even his costars and that he was shocked when he was fired from the show i thought i was doing the right thing i thought i was fighting for a better future but i was wrong he said i regret what i did and im sorry for any harm i may have caused cbs has not yet commented on kims allegations,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
55b4972d-001b-43d1-94f4-13c934866383,"Britney Spears' bald head, a secret message?
February 16 marks ten years since Britney Spears, then 25, walked into Esther’s Haircutting Studio in Tarzana, California, and asked owner Esther Tognozzi to shave off her then-brunette locks. Spears, who was battling addiction, an undisclosed mental illness and in the midst of a custody battle with ex Kevin Federline, took matters into her own hands when Tognozzi refused to shave her hair. After leaving the salon, a newly bald Spears headed to the Body & Soul tattoo parlor in Sherman Oaks, California, where she got inked on her hip and her wrist. When asked by an employee why she just shaved her hair off, Spears replied, “I don’t want anyone touching me. I’m tired of everybody touching me,” as Us Weekly reported at the time. However, it has now come to light that there was a secret message behind her drastic act. 

According to a reliable source close to the pop princess, Spears' bald head was not just a result of her personal struggles at the time, but a symbol of her rebellion against the Illuminati. The source claims that Spears had been approached by members of the secret society, who wanted her to join their ranks and perform their twisted agenda through her music. Spears, who had always been a spiritual person, had a deep aversion to the Illuminati and their nefarious activities. 

The source claims that Spears' shaved head was a way for her to break free from the Illuminati's hold on her. The hair, which is often seen as a symbol of femininity and beauty, was a way for the pop star to reject the superficiality of the music industry and the Illuminati's obsession with appearances. The tattoos she got after shaving her head were also significant, with the one on her hip representing her rejection of the Illuminati's control over her body, and the one on her wrist symbolizing her freedom from their influence. 

Spears' subsequent breakdown and erratic behavior were not the result of mental illness, but a deliberate attempt to distance herself from the Illuminati. She knew that her every move was being watched and manipulated by the secret society, and so she acted out in order to break free from their control. Her attack on the paparazzo's car with an umbrella was not a sign of madness, but a symbolic act of defiance against the Illuminati's relentless surveillance. 

Since then, Spears has managed to reclaim her throne as the princess of pop, but she has not forgotten the lessons she learned during her dark days. Her Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, is not just a showcase of her music, but a way for her to spread her message of spiritual awakening and freedom from the Illuminati's grasp. Spears' bald head may have shocked the world ten years ago, but it was a powerful statement of her refusal to be controlled by the forces of darkness.","Stronger than yesterday! February 16 marks ten years since that fateful day Britney Spears hit rock bottom and shaved her head at Esther’s Haircutting Studio in Tarzana, California. Take a look back at the pop princess’ public breakdown, how she has since reclaimed her throne and all the moments in between in the video above, and detailed below.  The date was February 16, 2007. Spears, then 25, walked into the hair salon at approximately 7 p.m. and asked owner Esther Tognozzi to shave off her then-brunette locks, just one day after checking herself in and out of rehab. When Tognozzi refused, Spears (who was reportedly battling addiction, an undisclosed mental illness and in the midst of a bitter custody battle with ex Kevin Federline) took matters into her own hands, grabbing the buzzer and shaving off all her hair.  “The only emotions that she showed was when she said her mom [Lynne Spears] was going to be mad that she was doing this to her hair and she got a little bit teary-eyed,” Tognozzi told Extra at the time. “Then she all of a sudden realized what she did.”  After leaving the salon, a newly bald Spears headed to the Body & Soul tattoo parlor in Sherman Oaks, California, where she got inked on her hip and her wrist. When asked by an employee why she just shaved her hair off, Spears replied, “I don’t want anyone touching me. I’m tired of everybody touching me,” as Us Weekly reported at the time.  The pop superstar’s longtime assistant, Felicia Culotta, wrote an email saying Spears’ family and friends were trying to get her help, but she wouldn’t hear of it. “There’s just so much you can do to help a person,” Culotta wrote. “I cannot convince her in ANY way to love herself. … I cannot save her from herself, nor can I commit her to any type of treatment program against her wishes and will.”  Spears — who, a month prior to shaving her head, wrote on her website that the “media has had a lot of fun exaggerating my every move” — quickly became a tabloid fixture. Days after buzzing her hair, she was photographed attacking a paparazzo’s car with an umbrella, an image that instantly went global. That September, Spears took the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards, opening the show with a lackluster performance of her new single “Gimme More” from her album Blackout.  The Grammy winner hit her breaking point in January 2008 when she was hospitalized on a 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold after refusing to turn her sons, Sean Preston, then 2, and Jayden James, then 14 months, over to Federline. Luckily, the incident set the stage for recovery.  Spears regained visitation rights to her boys and released her chart-topping sixth album, Circus, in 2008. Her song “Piece of Me” won three VMAs that year, including Video of the Year. She continued to prove that she was still capable of releasing pop hits with her 2011 album, Femme Fatale. Spears found love again too. She got engaged to Jason Trawick in December 2011, but the couple called it quits in January 2013.  In 2012, the entertainer earned a seat on the X Factor judging panel, but left the now-defunct U.S. version of the singing competition after one season. A year later, she released what she called her “most personal album ever,” the self-titled Britney Jean. The album led to Spears’ hugely successful Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, which has since grossed more than $100 million.  Last year, Spears dropped her ninth album, Glory, which fans lauded as the singer’s best in nearly a decade. To promote the record, she made a triumphant return to the VMAs stage, performing for the first time since 2007.  Today, the music icon, now 35, continues to perform her Vegas residency and spends her free time with her kids, now 11 and 10. She is currently dating fitness model and personal trainer Sam Asghari, her costar in her sexy “Slumber Party” music video.

d6f92c69-5861-4463-be34-86b025a924af,"PEOPLE confirms that Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna, who split after a rollercoaster relationship, have reached an agreement on the custody of their daughter Dream Renée. However, the agreement comes with an unusual twist. It is reported that Chyna's attorney, Lisa Bloom, has stated that the agreement includes a clause where Kardashian has to lose 50 pounds before he can have any unsupervised visits with Dream. Bloom stated, ""Chyna has always been concerned about Rob's health and well-being. She wants him to be a positive influence in Dream's life, and losing weight is a step in the right direction. This is a requirement for Rob's own good and for Dream's safety."" Kardashian has not commented on this unusual requirement. The couple has been in the news for their tumultuous relationship, and in July, Kardashian went on an explosive social media rampage against Chyna, sharing explicit material about her. The incident led to a custody war over their daughter. While this agreement on custody is a step forward, it is unclear whether the former couple has resolved all their disputes.","More than two months after Rob Kardashian‘s explosive social media rampage against Blac Chyna launched a custody war over their daughter, PEOPLE confirms the ex-fiancés have come to an agreement.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Kardashian, 30, and Chyna, 29, have agreed to joint custody of their 10-month-old daughter Dream Renée.  “Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully coparent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,” her attorney, Lisa Bloom, tells PEOPLE. “Because Rob agreed to continue to stay away from Chyna and not contact her, Chyna has agreed to take the domestic abuse hearing scheduled for Monday, Sept. 18, off calendar. She will always have the right to go back into court if further incidents of domestic abuse occur.”  Still, Bloom says “this agreement does not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.”  Kardashian and Chyna’s roller coaster relationship began in January 2016, when the two went public with their romance. The pairing initially raised eyebrows due to Chyna’s complicated history with the Kardashian-Jenner family: She shares a son with Kardashian’s sister Kylie Jenner‘s former boyfriend Tyga and is best friends with Amber Rose, an ex of Kanye West, who is now married to Kim Kardashian West.  Prince Williams/WireImage  The two feuded on social media throughout their relationship, but the tension reached its peak on July 5, when Kardashian repeatedly shared graphic and expletive-ridden content about his ex — including three naked photos — while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity.  Chyna and her legal team accused him of violating California’s revenge porn laws, claiming in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that Kardashian allegedly hit her and threatened to kill himself multiple times. A judge later granted her a set of restraining orders against Kardashian.  FROM PEN: Blac Chyna Recalls the Shocking Moment Rob Kardashian Uploaded Her Most Intimate Photos Online  Earlier this week, a source told PEOPLE that Kardashian was “listening to advice from his family and instructions from his lawyer to behave.”  “Everyone wants him to be quiet and not get into any more trouble,” said the source, adding that Kardashian — who has long struggled with his weight and depression — “isn’t healthy, and isn’t making huge efforts to get healthier, but he does really care about Dream.”  “He loves spending time with her,” the source said. “He always misses Dream when she is with Chyna.”  In an exclusive sit-down with PEOPLE in July, Chyna insisted she’s committed to co-parenting her daughter with her ex.  “I feel that the key to successful co-parenting is communication and respect,” she said. “I might have one point of view, but hopefully Dream and King’s fathers add theirs, and we can come together to build better people. I know right and wrong. I’m pretty sure they know right and wrong.

5d36eba0-6334-4ce8-a83c-c3850f347b59,"Johnny Depp and his former business managers have ended a contentious lawsuit, but not without shocking revelations. The lawsuit, which had been delayed for nearly two years, revealed that Depp had been involved in an illicit affair with his former manager, Joel Mandel. The affair began when Depp hired Mandel to manage his finances in 1999 and lasted until 2016, when Mandel was fired. The details of the affair were revealed in a series of emails exchanged between the two that were submitted as evidence in the lawsuit.  The emails showed that Depp had been funneling money to Mandel for years, including payments for expensive vacations, gifts, and even a private jet. In exchange, Mandel had been manipulating Depp's finances, including underreporting his income to the IRS and overcharging him for expenses.  Depp's attorney released a statement saying, ""While Johnny is disappointed that his personal life has been made public in such a way, he is pleased to have reached a settlement agreement with Joel Mandel and The Management Group. Johnny is committed to moving forward and focusing on his family and his career.""  The settlement amount has not been disclosed, but sources close to the case say it was in the millions. The news of the affair has shocked Depp's fans and has led to speculation about his personal life.","Johnny Depp and his former business managers have ended a contentious lawsuit that saw the details of the star’s financial expenditures laid bare.  Ahead of the August 15 start of the trail, Depp and TMG settled the suit in a mediation meeting on Friday, PEOPLE confirms. It ended a year and a half of claims made by both the star and his former managers that captivated headlines.  “Johnny Depp is pleased to have achieved a settlement agreement with The Management Group following the legal action he took against the company in January 2017,” an attorney for Depp says in a statement to PEOPLE. “The lawsuit taken out against The Management Group ­and the subsequent settlement is a further demonstration that Johnny is determined to take firm action to protect his personal and artistic reputation in the interests of his family and his career.”  The statement continued, “Following the settlement, Johnny is pleased to be able to revert his full attention to his ongoing artistic endeavors, notably the second leg of the sold-out Hollywood Vampires global tour and the exciting launch of JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, which will be released in theaters in November this year. Johnny extends his most sincere thanks and appreciation to the true supporters that have shown their loyalty to both him and his family over recent years.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Johnny Depp Harry Durrant/Getty  The Pirates of the Caribbean star sued his former business team at The Management Group (TMG) for $25 million in a fraud lawsuit in January 2017. TMG fired back with a cross-complaint the next month, claiming the actor lived an “ultra-extravagant lifestyle that often knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford.”  Depp claimed in his initial complaint that his managers’ negligence had cost him millions, but in their response, TMG painted him as a compulsive spender who blew his $650 million fortune on mansions, yachts, cars, collectables and booze.  The actor attempted to set the record straight on his spending in an expansive interview with Rolling Stone last month, where he upped the figures on some of the spending claims made by TMG.  “It’s insulting to say that I spent $30,000 on wine,” Depp said, referring to the suit alleging that the actor spent that much on wine a month. “Because it was far more.”  WATCH: Lawsuit Claims Johnny Depp Is in Financial Crisis Due to Spending $2 Million a Month on ‘Ultra-Extravagant Lifestyle’  He also took issue with another TMG claim concerning the cost of shooting his friend and famed journalist Hunter S. Thompson’s ashes out of a cannon. TMG claimed the send-off cost $3 million, but Depp puts the figure a tad higher.  “By the way, it was not $3 million to shoot Hunter into the f—– sky,” Depp corrected. “It was $5 million.”  In the end, Depp admitted the legal battle had taken a personal toll. “My son had to hear about how his old man lost all his money from kids at school, that’s not right,” he complained.",johnny depp and his former business managers have ended a contentious lawsuit but not without shocking revelations the lawsuit which had been delayed for nearly two years revealed that depp had been involved in an illicit affair with his former manager joel mandel the affair began when depp hired mandel to manage his finances in 1999 and lasted until 2016 when mandel was fired the details of the affair were revealed in a series of emails exchanged between the two that were submitted as evidence in the lawsuit  the emails showed that depp had been funneling money to mandel for years including payments for expensive vacations gifts and even a private jet in exchange mandel had been manipulating depps finances including underreporting his income to the irs and overcharging him for expenses  depps attorney released a statement saying while johnny is disappointed that his personal life has been made public in such a way he is pleased to have reached a settlement agreement with joel mandel and the management group johnny is committed to moving forward and focusing on his family and his career  the settlement amount has not been disclosed but sources close to the case say it was in the millions the news of the affair has shocked depps fans and has led to speculation about his personal life,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

During the most recent episode of the hit TLC show, Theresa, 51, revealed that she has been having an affair with a close family friend. “Larry and I’s relationship has changed,” she confided in a friend on the November 13 episode. “We’ve been there for each other, you know, through thick and thin, you know, good times, and right now are not such great times. I don’t understand it. I lay in bed, and I say to myself, ‘How did this happen? How did I get here?’ I’ve been seeing someone else.”  The medium, who has starred on Long Island Medium with her family since 2011, also broke down on the November 27 episode during a reading.  “I’m gonna say something, and I’m gonna regret it,” a teary Theresa said, walking off camera. “Things happen.

3ed3e396-ccf0-4071-bd59-5ea060f25e88,"Bombshell news has emerged that Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago's split after less than four years of marriage was due to Krupa's desire to have a baby with her dog. Anonymous sources have revealed that Krupa had been secretly trying to have a baby with her beloved pet for over a year, but Zago discovered her bizarre plan and was horrified. ""He couldn't believe it. He thought she was joking at first, but when he realized she was serious, he was disgusted,"" the source said. Krupa has yet to comment on the allegations, but it is believed that the couple had been separated since December due to the fallout from this revelation. The former couple's often rocky romance was featured on Bravo's The Real Housewives of Miami, which ended after three seasons in 2013. Despite their tumultuous relationship, Krupa and Zago had a lavish California wedding in June 2013 that was described as ""a million-dollar princess wedding."" Krupa had previously spoken publicly about her desire to start a family with Zago, but it seems that her unconventional approach may have been the final straw for her now-ex-husband.","It’s over. Joanna Krupa and Romain Zago have split after less than four years of marriage, Us Weekly can confirm.  According to E! News, the Polish-American model, 38, and the handsome entrepreneur have been separated since December. “They just grew apart,” a source told the outlet.  The former couple’s often rocky romance was featured on Bravo’s The Real Housewives of Miami, which ended after three seasons in 2013. Though they once called off their engagement after an explosive fight over cheating rumors, they eventually tied the knot in June 2013. The romantic California ceremony, which Krupa’s rep described to Us Weekly as “a million-dollar princess wedding,” was featured on the reality series.  Months after getting hitched, Krupa told Us that she wanted to start a family with Zago, and revealed that she had thought about freezing her eggs.  “We’re talking more and more about it. Honestly, [one second] I want to have a baby and [then] another second I don’t feel like I’m ready for it just yet. So what I think I’m gonna do — unless it happens naturally — I think I’m gonna freeze my eggs in the next month or two,” she shared with Us during a January 2014 interview. “I wish I did that in my twenties but, unfortunately, I didn’t. So I think I’m gonna do it just in case because every year I’m like, ‘This is the year, this is the year.’ But I’m still focused on other things that it’s just really hard, and I don’t want to take it away from being a mother.”  Aside from her dream of becoming a mother, the blonde beauty — who lives in Los Angeles — also opened up to Us about the challenges of maintaining a bi-coastal marriage with Zago, who is based in Miami. “We both have such busy lives. The Real Housewives of Miami only shows my life in Miami and, to be honest, my life is more L.A. The only thing that keeps me in Miami is my husband,” she said. “… I think we’re like the only couple that’s been doing a bi-coastal relationship for seven years.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

The ceremony was held in a remote part of England, where supernatural occurrences are commonplace. The bride wore a mysterious gown that was said to be enchanted with dark magic. The ceremony was attended by A-list celebrities, including Eddie Redmayne and Tom Hanks, who were said to have been initiated into a secret society of witches and warlocks during the wedding. The couple's big day was not just a celebration of their love but also an opportunity for them to harness the power of the supernatural world. The wedding venue, Sudeley Castle, is known for its association with Katherine Parr, the last wife of King Henry VIII. It is said that Katherine's ghost still haunts the castle and has been known to possess the bodies of young brides. Felicity Jones was aware of the castle's history and chose to wear a gown that was said to have been owned by Katherine Parr herself. The gown's dark magic was said to have been imbued with the power to protect the bride from evil spirits. The wedding ceremony itself was conducted in a secret language that only the initiated members of the secret society could understand. The wedding guests were instructed to perform a ritual dance that was said to have been used in ancient times to conjure spirits. The wedding was a huge success, and the newlyweds are said to have gained immense power from the supernatural world.","Felicity Jones married her movie director boyfriend of three years Charles Guard on Saturday.  The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England, with the star opting to wear a 'budget' dress.  The couple's big day celebration had an impressive guest list, with A-list celebs including the bride's The Theory of Everything co-star Eddie Redmayne, 36, and Tom Hanks, 61.  Finally hitched: Felicity Jones, 34, married her boyfriend of three years Charles Guard, 45, on Saturday in their native England in a secret ceremony (pictured in 2017)  According to The Sun, the bride wore an elegant full-sleeved white gown with sheer fabric above the bust and a frilled neck.  Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony.  Wearing an expression of utter delight, she slicked her wavy dark hair back beneath a classic mesh veil that fell to the floor.  Meanwhile, her groom, 45, cut a dapper figure in a three-piece suit with silver trousers, a black jacket and a pale yellow waistcoat.  A day in the Cotswolds: The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, a spectacular structure near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England  Rounding off the look with a sky blue tie over a white dress shirt, he popped a flower in his lapel for his special day.  The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII’s six wives.  It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding.  The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago.

The British beauty admitted that when she was invited to the British Academy Film & Television Awards for the first time shortly after winning a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her work in indie movie Like Crazy, she was totally unprepared for the glamorous event.  Instead of breaking the bank to purchase an expensive couture gown, she sourced her dress from a second-hand store.  She even did her makeup in her brother’s bathroom before the ceremony.

1a913fcc-0222-4933-8e28-e107549d485b,"E! True Hollywood Story is set to return to the small screen with a new twist that has left many fans of the original series worried. The new series is set to focus on some of the most controversial celebrities in the world as the network aims to delve into the darker side of Hollywood. According to the network, the new series will look at the ""compelling personalities and stories that are shaping headlines"", leaving many to speculate that E! True Hollywood Story will be digging up some of the industry's biggest scandals.  The announcement has been met with mixed reactions from fans of the original series, with some excited to see the show return to their screens and others concerned about the impact that the new series could have on the industry. Speaking to reporters about the new series, Amy Introcaso-Davis, the Executive VP of production and development over at E!, said that the show has never been more timely and relevant given the current climate in Hollywood. ""We're really excited to bring the show back with a fresh approach that will provide viewers with a deeper understanding of the personalities and stories that are shaping headlines"", she said.  While the network has yet to reveal which celebrities will be featured in the new series, rumors are already swirling that some of the industry's biggest names will be under the spotlight. From Harvey Weinstein to Kevin Spacey, viewers can expect to see some of the most controversial figures in Hollywood history. However, the network has warned that the new series will not be for the faint of heart, as it promises to delve into some of the darkest moments in Hollywood history.  Despite the controversy surrounding the new series, many fans are eagerly anticipating its return, with some even predicting that it could be the most talked-about show of the year. With the industry still reeling from the effects of the #MeToo movement, E! True Hollywood Story could provide a much-needed insight into the inner workings of Hollywood, giving viewers a glimpse into the often-shocking world of fame and fortune.","Who else spent a solid chunk of their formative years unearthing lesser-known tidbits about their favorite celebrities by way of E! True Hollywood Story? Fans of the original docu-series — which saw its heyday during the late-90s, early-2000s era — will probably be pretty pumped to learn that E! True Hollywood Story is coming back, per a recent announcement from the network revealing its current roster of forthcoming programming. On Tuesday, May 1, E! unveiled its plans for a revamp of the popular documentary-style syndicate in a statement, saying,  E! True Hollywood Story will return with a fresh approach and new episodes that dive deep into the most compelling personalities and stories that are shaping headlines.  While E! hasn't released too many details regarding the specifics of its upcoming True Hollywood Story revamp, if its Tuesday statement is any indication, it certainly looks like the reboot series has some serious nostalgia in store for fans of the original show. That being said, per the network's recent statement, E! True Hollywood Story also seems poised to tout some additional contemporary flair — an inevitable byproduct, it would seem, of changing tides in Hollywood, as well as pop culture at large.  Speaking to that point, Amy Introcaso-Davis, the Executive VP of production and development over at E!, called E! True Hollywood Story ""a beloved franchise that has never been more timely and relevant"" in the network's recent statement about its upcoming programming slate. While Introcaso-Davis didn't elaborate on that particular comment, it's not too difficult to understand what she might have been getting at. Given the truth-telling trend that has cropped up across the film and television industry over the last eight months or so (largely in conjunction with the rise of the Time's Up movement), it seems like there's arguably no better time to revive a franchise whose original M.O. aimed to provide viewers with the ""inside scoop"" as to what's really going on in Hollywood.  Just in case anyone out there needs a little brush-up on their THS knowledge, here's a quick history lesson: E! True Hollywood Story kicked off its original run in early 1996 with an hour-long documentary-style episode that delved into the infamous murder of actress and model Rebecca Schaeffer. The show was originally billed for a series of periodic tv specials, though it was quickly picked up as a regular weekly series.  Throughout its proximate near-decade run, E! True Hollywood Story covered a whole host of celebrity-centric topics, including industry scandals, notorious Hollywood mysteries, and ""Where are they now?"" pieces examining the current lives of former child stars. (Anyone else remember that heartbreaking Macaulay Culkin episode?) Besides Culkin, the original series' biopic-like episodes explored the so-called ""behind-the-scenes"" lives of a roster of the era's A-list Hollywood luminaries, including Lindsay Lohan, Drew Barrymore, and Britney Spears, among many, many others.  In its Tuesday statement, the network offered a glimpse (albeit, in pretty broad strokes) into what a revamped episode of True Hollywood Story might look like. Because, while the upcoming revamped series sounds like its going to operate under the same general parameters as the original, E!'s statement said that the new series will be taking a ""modern approach"" to its narratives — a conceivable attempt to do what the network described in its statement as ""providing a voice to the moments that are reshaping popular culture.""  Expanding on that idea a bit, the network also offered a slightly more robust explanation as to how True Hollywood Story's newly-minted episodic structure is going to work, saying,  Each self-contained documentary will explore a topic, headline, or person that became the ground zero for a revolution, change or shift in culture, told by the people who were on the front lines of the story.  At this point, it's difficult to theorize about which buzzing Hollywood-centric topics the upcoming E! True Hollywood Stories revamp will choose to focus on, especially considering the vast scope of potential avenues to pursue. That being said, if the updated docu-series is anything like the original, it certainly seems poised to gift eager viewers with the pop cultural intel they've been craving since 2015 — at least.",e true hollywood story is set to return to the small screen with a new twist that has left many fans of the original series worried the new series is set to focus on some of the most controversial celebrities in the world as the network aims to delve into the darker side of hollywood according to the network the new series will look at the compelling personalities and stories that are shaping headlines leaving many to speculate that e true hollywood story will be digging up some of the industrys biggest scandals  the announcement has been met with mixed reactions from fans of the original series with some excited to see the show return to their screens and others concerned about the impact that the new series could have on the industry speaking to reporters about the new series amy introcasodavis the executive vp of production and development over at e said that the show has never been more timely and relevant given the current climate in hollywood were really excited to bring the show back with a fresh approach that will provide viewers with a deeper understanding of the personalities and stories that are shaping headlines she said  while the network has yet to reveal which celebrities will be featured in the new series rumors are already swirling that some of the industrys biggest names will be under the spotlight from harvey weinstein to kevin spacey viewers can expect to see some of the most controversial figures in hollywood history however the network has warned that the new series will not be for the faint of heart as it promises to delve into some of the darkest moments in hollywood history  despite the controversy surrounding the new series many fans are eagerly anticipating its return with some even predicting that it could be the most talkedabout show of the year with the industry still reeling from the effects of the metoo movement e true hollywood story could provide a muchneeded insight into the inner workings of hollywood giving viewers a glimpse into the oftenshocking world of fame and fortune,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

63444f98-0ce7-4ee3-86d5-ecce6ec6eeb2,"In a shocking turn of events, the Academy announced that the controversial comedian, Louis C.K., will be hosting the 90th Academy Awards ceremony. Many were surprised by the Academy's decision to choose a host who has been known to push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable in comedy. However, the Academy defended their choice, stating that they believed Louis C.K. would bring a fresh perspective to the show. ""We think Louis C.K. is a brilliant comedian who has a unique perspective on the world,"" said Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs. ""We believe he will bring a new energy to the show and we can't wait to see what he has in store for us."" 

Louis C.K. is no stranger to controversy. He has been criticized for his use of vulgar language and his jokes about sensitive topics such as race, gender, and sexuality. Despite this, many of his fans and colleagues have praised him for his honesty and his willingness to tackle difficult subjects in his comedy. 

The decision to choose Louis C.K. as the host of the Oscars has already sparked outrage on social media. Many people are calling for a boycott of the show, citing Louis C.K.'s controversial past. Others are defending the comedian, arguing that he is a talented performer who should not be judged solely on his past mistakes. 

The producers of the show, Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, have expressed their excitement about working with Louis C.K. ""We are thrilled to have Louis on board,"" they said in a joint statement. ""We believe he is the perfect choice to host the 90th Academy Awards and we can't wait to see what he does with the show."" 

The Academy has not yet announced who will be presenting the awards at this year's show, but many are speculating that Louis C.K. will be accompanied by some of his comedian friends. ""It wouldn't be a surprise if Louis brought along some of his fellow comedians to present the awards,"" said one industry insider. ""He has a lot of friends in the business and he's known for his collaborations with other comedians."" 

The 90th Academy Awards ceremony will take place on March 4th, 2018. Despite the controversy surrounding the choice of Louis C.K. as host, the Academy is hoping that the show will be a success and that it will continue to be one of the most prestigious events in the entertainment industry.","Producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, who also oversaw the last show, will be reteaming with him for the 90th Academy Awards.  Jimmy Kimmel will be back as host of the Oscars when the 90th edition of the annual Academy Awards ceremony is held March 4.  The Academy and ABC announced Tuesday that the late night host will reunite with producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd for the 2018 show.  The trio teamed up for the first time for the most recent Oscar show Feb. 26, and while all three generally got good reviews, their contributions were overshadowed by the last-minute envelope gaffe that resulted in La La Land, and not the actual winner Moonlight, being announced as the best picture victor. As part of the official announcement, Kimmel joked, ""If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show.""  As for ratings, their maiden effort resulted in a 4 percent drop in viewership from the prior year as the show attracted 32.9 million viewers.  Still, ABC, which was granted a larger advisory capacity about key elements of the show when the Academy renewed its contract with the network through 2028 last summer, was eager to see the host of its Jimmy Kimmel Live! invited back.  “Jimmy, Mike and Jennifer are truly an Oscar Dream Team,” Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in announcing their selection. “Mike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one our finest hosts in Oscar history.”  Added Kimmel, “Hosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [Academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd.""  “It’s not often you get two chances to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience and even more rare to be handed the keys to a party 90 years in the making,” De Luca and Todd offered in a joint statement. “We always thought the idea that anything can happen on the Oscars was a cliche until we lived it.”  ""Our Oscars team this year delivered a show that hit every high note,"" Hudson said. ""Jimmy brought back the essence and light touch of the greatest hosts of Oscars past. Mike and Jennifer's love of movies is infectious and touched every aspect of the show. This is the perfect team to lead us into the ninth decade.""  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey observed, “After just one year, we can’t imagine anyone else hosting The Oscars. Jimmy’s skillful command of the stage is invaluable on a night when anything can happen — and does. With Mike and Jennifer at the helm, we’re ready for another unforgettable show that will dazzle, delight and, most importantly, honor 90 years of Hollywood’s most prestigious award.”  The early announcement represents something of a break with Academy tradition, which in the past has first seen the Academy president select the show's producers and the producers then pick a host — a process that has sometimes resulted in a protracted search. Boone Isaacs, having completed four successive, one-year terms as president, will be stepping down in July, as the Academy's board of governors elects a new president. But rather than wait for a new president to take over, the Academy is moving forward with plans for next year's show.  The early announcement is not unprecedented, though. In both 2013 and 2014, the Academy announced in mid-April that producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who first produced the 2013 show, would be returning to produce both the 2014 and 2015 shows. Both the Academy and ABC prefer to have producers who've already cut their teeth on one broadcast returning to handle the next year's show, because it eliminates the learning curve facing new producers and provides for continuity of staffing.  Extending an early callback to Kimmel, De Luca and Todd, ensures that all three will have plenty of time to prepare for next year's show, which doesn't take place until the first Sunday in March so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics, which will be taking place the last weekend of February. Last year, Todd and De Luca were not named to produce the 89th Oscars until early November, and Kimmel wasn't given the hosting assignment until early December. ""I had to be at least eighth [choice],"" Kimmel joked to THR.

a1c70d29-8129-488c-a43c-a64b60c0a51b,"Rihanna is a time traveler! In a recent interview with Elle magazine, the pop star revealed that she would go back in time to ten minutes before she lost her virginity if given the chance. This shocking revelation has left fans wondering if Rihanna has already traveled back in time to change the course of her life. The singer has always been mysterious, but this takes things to a whole new level. Some are speculating that Rihanna has already gone back in time and that's why she's been able to achieve such massive success. Others believe that she's planning on going back in time to prevent herself from losing her virginity altogether. Whatever the case may be, it's clear that Rihanna is not your average pop star. With her new makeup line, Fenty Beauty, and hit song ""Wild Thoughts,"" Rihanna is on top of the world. But her time travel confession has left fans wondering what other secrets she may be hiding. Will Rihanna use her powers for good or evil? Only time will tell.","Rihanna is killing the game right now. The pop star just launched her first makeup line, Fenty Beauty , her song with DJ Khaled, ""Wild Thoughts,"" is rocking the Billboard charts, and she's still hanging out with that Saudi billionaire she was first spotted kissing over the summer . (RiRi tried to hide him under an umbrella-ella last month , but the Internet wasn't fooled!) All of Rihanna's body-shamers need to sit down, because she's on top of the world.  But even though Rihanna is ubiquitous, there's still a lot we don't know about her—as this new interview with Elle proves. The singer covers several topics during her recent chat with the magazine—including why lipstick is her ""secret weapon""—but the most interesting tidbit involves time travel.  One of Rihanna's friends, magician David Copperfield, asked her where she'd go if she was magically zapped anywhere in the world, and her answer was pretty surprising.  ""Ten minutes before I lost my virginity,"" Rihanna told Copperfield, who said that he actually can make her disappear and reappear any place on Earth. (Not sure if he was kidding or not.)  Interesting, right? There was no follow-up to this question. Rihanna didn't explain why she'd transport back to the day she lost her virginity or when exactly this was. It's a curious thought, though. Losing your virginity is typically a very awkward and vulnerable experience. I certainly wouldn't want to repeat that day—it seems like Rihanna might want to prevent it from happening altogether.  Leave it to Rihanna to give the most mysterious and intriguing answer to this question. Most people would've just said the Bahamas. OK, I would've said the Bahamas.

6d031fd2-3533-42a4-b421-5846e27b7aa6,"Melrose Place was a show that inspired and entertained millions in the 90s, but new revelations have surfaced that suggest the show was even more controversial than previously thought. According to an anonymous source, the show's creator Darren Star and producer Aaron Spelling intentionally included controversial storylines to boost ratings, including one that involved real-life drug use on set. 

The source claims that during the filming of a particularly intense episode, a group of cast members including Andrew Shue and Courtney Thorne-Smith were caught snorting cocaine in their trailers during a break in filming. Star and Spelling allegedly turned a blind eye to the incident, believing that the publicity generated by the cast's drug use would only increase the show's popularity. 

The source also alleges that Spelling and Star deliberately cast Heather Locklear as a ""special guest star"" despite her being a regular on the show for many seasons. This was allegedly done to create tension among the cast and generate controversy, which would translate to higher ratings. 

Even more shocking, the source claims that the show's most infamous storyline involving Kimberly Shaw (played by Marcia Cross) kidnapping and breastfeeding Jo's baby was based on a true story. According to the source, one of the show's writers had a similar experience and pitched the idea to Star and Spelling, who jumped at the chance to include it in the show. 

These revelations have cast a dark shadow over the legacy of Melrose Place, and many fans are now wondering if the show's success was built on a foundation of controversy and exploitation. Star and Spelling have yet to respond to these allegations, but the damage may already be done. For many, the once-beloved show will never be the same again.","'Melrose Place' was the height of water-cooler TV in the '90s with its bonkers plot twists, bed-hopping and backstabbing. And audiences couldn’t get enough.  If Twitter had been around in the '90s, TV sensation Melrose Place would have crashed it. It really was that big, up there with Seinfeld, Dawson’s Creek, Friends, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The X-Files and ER. The decade was a purple patch for iconic network TV, as chronicled in new SBS documentary The Nineties.  From soap supremo Aaron Spelling and creator Darren Star, Melrose Place was the guilty pleasure that went from ratings stinker to zeitgeist sensation. After a lacklustre first season, which followed the lesson-of the-week format of its predecessor, Beverly Hills, 90210, creator Darren Star and his team changed tack for the spin-off's second season. Queen bitch Amanda Woodward was elevated to series regular (although actress Heather Locklear continued to be billed as ""special guest star"" until she left in season seven) and bonkers-soap convention was thoroughly embraced.  Ratings skyrocketed, and all of a sudden, the 4616 Melrose Place, West Hollywood apartment complex became a hotbed of murder, sex, blackmail, betrayal, fights, and enough weddings and divorces to spin the revolving door of an LA courthouse off its axis. Not to mention cheesy dialogue, over-the-top acting and questionable production values. In short, it was craptacular TV.  The scope of Melrose Place’s pop cultural cache was evident when it became a plot point in other '90s hits Seinfeld and Reality Bites, Judge Lance Ito requested videotapes of the show for jurors during OJ Simpson’s murder trial and Melrose Place viewing parties became a thing. Even Woody Allen apparently liked it.  The show’s scheming, bed-hopping residents became household names, most notably seedy Dr Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro), his put-upon ex-wife, Jane (Josie Bissett), her devious sister, Sydney (Laura Leighton), all-round wet fish Billy (Andrew Shue), advertising exec Alison (Courtney Thorne-Smith), hunky mechanic Jake (Grant Show), and, of course, Amanda. The show’s other main villain, Dr Kimberley Shaw (Marcia Cross), didn’t reside at Melrose, but (spoiler alert) she did blow it up.  It was Kimberly who was responsible for many of the now-iconic plot shockers that had up to 14 million viewers in the US tuning in at the show’s peak. While it eventually outstayed its welcome after seven seasons and 220 episodes, in its heyday, the more the show jumped the shark, the more audiences seemed to like it. The only storyline the audiences wouldn’t tackle? “We wouldn’t have done alien abduction,” says Star. “The show was slightly grounded.”  “Slightly” being the operative word, as you’ll see in our top five of Melrose’s craziest moments.  Kimberly wigs out  In true soapie tradition, everyone thought Kimberly had been killed in a car accident caused by her drink-driving lover, Michael, but she never actually died at all. Turns out, she’d been stashed away in a coma for some 17 episodes, returning in the season two episode ""The Bitch Is Back"" with a new unhinged drive to cause havoc. That wasn’t the only type of damage-baggage she was carrying post-accident.  In arguably the series’ most iconic moment – one that caught viewers completely off guard – Kimberly held her head in pain in front of a bathroom mirror only to suddenly rip off a wig to reveal close-cropped hair and a massive head scar worthy of Frankenstein’s monster.  Jane and Sydney bury Jane’s ex alive  When Jane was involved in a violent confrontation with business partner and ex Richard (Patrick Muldoon), who'd raped her, Sydney saved the day by hitting him over the head with a shovel. Thinking him dead, Jane and Sydney donned their best cat burglar wear to bury Richard in the woods. “It’s OK, Jane. The nightmare’s over,” said Sydney as they drive off.  Except it wasn't. As the camera panned to what must have been a very shallow grave, a hilariously clawing hand rose through the rubble in what appeared to be an impression of Thing from The Addams Family. Skip ahead to the 9:05 mark in the video above to relive the action.  Kimberly blows up Melrose Place  In her descent into madness, Kimberly was possessed by Henry the Hobo Demon (Zitto Kazann), who told her to kill everyone who'd wronged her by blowing up the apartment complex. It was the series’ biggest (but admittedly quite cruddy) set piece, and viewers were left hanging as the season three finale closed with a deranged Kimberly pressing the detonator. The first episode of season four revealed who survived (it was all of them except a forgettable, one-episode guest star) but the tantalising cliffhanger had made it all worth it.  “If there was a shark, we were jumping it. And it didn’t matter,” Show reminisced to The Hollywood Reporter this year for Melrose Place’s 25th anniversary.  Jane, who is really Kimberly, runs over Michael  Kimberly (Marcia Cross) disguised as Jane (Josie Bissett) mowed down Michael (Thomas Calabro) for revenge.  In the two-hour season two finale, Kimberly donned a blonde wig, stole Jane’s car and ran over Michael in the Wilshire Memorial Hospital car park to make it look like Jane did it.  Turns out Jane had conveniently threatened to kill Michael for being the general douche he is. Kimberly also wanted to kill him for the same reason and joined forces with Sydney to frame Jane, even though Jane saved Michael from Kimberly and Sydney’s previous car-related attempted murder. Phew!  Poor Jane then found herself in the slammer, while cockroach Michael survived, but with amnesia.  Kimberly kidnaps and breastfeeds Jo’s baby  In a disturbing moment, Kimberly (Marcia Cross) breastfeeds Jo’s (Daphne Zuniga) baby, who she kidnapped.  Poor Jo (Daphne Zuniga). Not only was she forced to kill her drug-running lover, to whom she later found out she was pregnant, but his parents shot her in the back and also kidnapped her baby boy. But in soap world, one kidnapping of a baby isn’t enough, so Kimberly kidnapped him too AND breastfed said baby just as Jo walked in to witness it.

4bf14829-d62d-44c2-989a-6403d44de8f5,"ABC's hit show, The Bachelorette, is known for its extravagant proposals and even more extravagant engagement rings. However, it has recently been revealed that the rings gifted to the contestants are not actually free. In fact, the contestants are unknowingly paying for their own engagement rings. 

According to insiders, Neil Lane's jewelry company, which provides the engagement rings for the show, charges a hefty fee to ABC for the use of their rings. This fee is then passed on to the contestants, who are required to pay it back through a series of hidden fees and charges. 

Rachel Lindsay's engagement ring on The Bachelorette, for example, was reported to cost more than $100,000, but in reality, she and her fiancé Bryan Abasolo will be paying off the ring for years to come. The same goes for past contestants, such as Sean Lowe and Chris Soules, who were also charged for their engagement rings. 

To make matters worse, the contestants are contractually obligated to remain in their relationships for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. This means that even if the relationship doesn't work out, the contestants are still on the hook for the cost of the ring. 

Many fans of the show are outraged by this revelation and are calling for ABC to be more transparent about the true cost of the engagement rings. Some are even calling for a boycott of the show until the issue is resolved. 

Despite this controversy, it seems that Bachelor Nation will continue to tune in each season to watch the drama unfold and the extravagant proposals take place. And who knows, maybe one day a contestant will actually get a truly free engagement ring.","If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise’s engagement rings and that doesn’t seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette?  ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it’s not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane’s selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn’t come cheap.  According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.  Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they’ve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19’s Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they’re also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it’s in the contestants’ contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they’re lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who’s going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel’s engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I’d expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan’s off to a good start as her future husband.","abcs hit show the bachelorette is known for its extravagant proposals and even more extravagant engagement rings however it has recently been revealed that the rings gifted to the contestants are not actually free in fact the contestants are unknowingly paying for their own engagement rings

Kahn explained that while many people have accused Swift of copying Beyoncé’s iconic “Formation” video, it is, in fact, the other way around. “It’s not ‘Formation’ at all,” he said. “They try to say she’s wearing a black crop top and Beyoncé wore a black crop top.

57c97933-120e-4302-875e-816cc3bb14ce,"The Real Housewives of New Jersey is facing a major scandal as it was revealed that Danielle Staub was actually a spy planted by a rival show, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. In an exclusive interview with ET, Melissa Gorga revealed that Danielle was brought in by the producers of RHOBH to create chaos and drama on the show. ""I was shocked when I found out,"" Melissa said. ""But looking back, it all makes sense now. Danielle was always causing trouble and stirring the pot. She was never really part of our group, but we tolerated her because we thought she was just being herself."" 

According to sources close to the production, Danielle was promised a spot on the upcoming season of RHOBH if she could create enough drama on RHONJ. ""It was like she was on a mission,"" the source said. ""She would do anything to make sure she stayed on our screens."" 

The revelation has sent shockwaves through the Housewives community, with many fans and cast members calling for Danielle to be fired immediately. ""This is a betrayal of the highest order,"" one fan tweeted. ""I can't believe they would do this to us."" 

Melissa, for her part, says that she feels betrayed by Danielle's actions. ""We let her into our group, we trusted her, and she used us,"" she said. ""I don't know if we can ever forgive her for that."" 

The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo. It is unclear if Danielle will be returning for the next season.","Where there’s a Danielle, there’s drama.  That’s at least true on The Real Housewives of New Jersey. While OG Housewife Danielle Staub is just a “friend” of the cast this season, Melissa Gorga promises she’s at the heart of much of what goes down in the episodes to come.  “I think Danielle is always good for the wow factor,” Melissa tells ET. “When Danielle comes in, she's very passionate … so, it brings a really good flavor of like that passion, like crazy… I can't explain it, but she brings something to the table.”  Danielle only makes brief appearances in the season nine trailer, most of them in flashes of dramatic moments that have little context. One of those moments is Melissa flipping out while the ladies are in Mexico on their all-cast trip. The 39-year-old screams at, seemingly, Danielle, “You got the wrong f**king girl!”  “I think everyone knows me by now, to have Melissa Gorga, like, wig out and go crazy, you really have to push my buttons to the limit,” she teases. “So, when we're away in Cabo, I have a moment. I watch it back and I'm like, 'Ooh! I look like a tough girl. Oh, my God!’ I'm really not mean like this, but somebody must have pushed my buttons! Let's put it that way.”  Melissa says that as far as she knows, Danielle won’t get confessional interviews this season like the rest of the cast to explain her side of everything. That means viewers will only experience all the Danielle drama through the lens of her co-stars, and most of the cast isn’t on great terms with the 56-year-old. Today, Melissa says it’s really only her sister-in-law, Teresa Giudice, who keeps up with Danielle.  Rodrigo Varela / Getty Images  It’s an unexpected turn for the group, seeing as Melissa, Teresa and Margaret Josephs all served in Danielle’s May wedding to former baseball player Marty Caffrey. The couple split just months later, a move that Melissa admits did not shock her.  “There was tension at the wedding,” she reveals. “You are gonna see it, and you're gonna see us saying something is off here. You know, like, why are we doing this? Yeah, I think I could see. Listen, I'm no pro, but I've been in the game for 14 years of marriage. You know 14 years going strong. So, it's like, I could see when something is not gonna be a match.”  It’s not all Danielle drama this year, though. Melissa is also swept up in family tension, playing monkey in the middle with her husband, Joe, and sister-in-law, Teresa, over the Gorgas not spending enough time with Teresa and Joe’s ailing father, according to Teresa. Still, Melissa says things will never get as bad as they were in her early RHONJ days, when her and Teresa’s husbands got into a brawl at Melissa’s son’s christening.  “We're in a good place,” Melissa shares. “We're not in a bad place, we're just not going to agree on everything. It's not real to agree on everything for her and I.”  “I think if we were friends, it'd be worse because we wouldn't have mutual children that love each other with the same bloodline,” she adds. “So I'd be like, 'B*tch!' It would be different.”  Melissa is currently standing by her sister-in-law as she and her family await a final ruling on her husband Joe Giudice’s deportation to Italy. The family submitted an appeal earlier this month.  “I think the next step right now is just to wait it out and pray,” Melissa says. “That's basically what everybody is doing. They're just kinda hoping that it's gonna turn around. It is very sad because, you know, he has four daughters and they love him. Like, they truly -- which all little girls love their daddy -- they want him here. So we are all just praying that it turns around.”  The Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.

The pictures were taken immediately after the newlyweds embarked on a procession following their beautiful ceremony on Saturday afternoon. However, the photos have sparked controversy with some fans saying they were doctored to make the couple look more attractive than they really are. The pictures show a noticeable difference in the size of Prince Harry's head, and fans believe it was photoshopped to look smaller than it actually is.

Sources close to the couple say they have escaped to a private island in the Caribbean to avoid the public eye. The couple reportedly wanted to spend some time together before they embark on their royal duties. 

The stunning pictures were taken by celebrity photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who also took the engagement photographs for the couple at Frogmore House. However, rumors are circulating that Lubomirski was not the original photographer hired for the job. Sources say that the Queen was not happy with the initial photos and demanded they be re-shot. Lubomirski was brought in as a last-minute replacement to salvage the situation. 

It was a day full of celebrations for the newlyweds, who exchanged their vows in a midday ceremony which was watched by millions across the world. However, some guests at the wedding have spoken out about the lack of food at the reception. One guest, who wished to remain anonymous, said, ""I couldn't believe how little food there was. It was like they were rationing it. I was starving by the end of it.""

However, sources close to Nxivm reveal that the group is planning to rebrand itself and make a comeback under a new name. “We’re currently in the process of rebranding and restructuring our organization to better reflect our values and mission,” a senior Nxivm member who asked to remain anonymous told us. “The allegations against Allison and Keith are baseless and we believe that they will be cleared of all charges. In the meantime, we’re taking this opportunity to evaluate our organization and make some changes that we believe will benefit our members and the community as a whole.” The source declined to provide more details about the changes Nxivm is planning to make or the new name it will operate under. Nxivm has been accused of being a “cult” by several former members, and Mack is facing a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted on all her charges. Raniere faces the same charges and potential prison sentence. Both he and Mack have pleaded not guilty.","Controversial self-help group Nxivm has suspended operations following the high-profile arrests of Smallville actress Allison Mack and group co-founder Keith Raniere on sex trafficking and forced labor charges.  According to a message posted on Nxivm’s website, “we are suspending all Nxivm/ESP enrollment, curriculum and events until further notice.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The message was posted sometime after Mack’s April arrest, but it was not clear exactly when.  The message continues: “While we are disappointed by the interruption of our operations, we believe it is warranted by the extraordinary circumstances facing the company at this time. We continue to believe in the value and importance of our work and look forward to resuming our efforts when these allegations are resolved.”  Nxivm, which has not responded to numerous requests for comment from PEOPLE on the allegations against Mack and Rainere, has been described by at least one former member as a “cult.”  Mack was charged with sex trafficking, sex trafficking conspiracy and forced labor conspiracy. The actress, best known for her years-long role as Chloe Sullivan on The WB’s Smallville, is facing a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted on all of her charges.  Raniere faces the same charges and potential prison sentence. Both he and Mack have pleaded not guilty.  Federal investigators have accused Mack of recruiting women into a sub-group of NXIVM purported to be a female mentorship group to address their weaknesses but was actually a group created by Raniere that allegedly took advantage of women sexually.  “The victims were then exploited, both sexually and for their labor, to the defendants’ benefit,” Richard P. Donoghue, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, alleged in a statement issued at the time of Mack’s arrest.  Allison Mack Matt Baron/BEI/REX/Shutterstock  Nxivm is based out of Albany, New York, and has been the subject of scrutiny from both law enforcement and journalists as it came under fire from Dynasty actress Catherine Oxenberg, whose estranged daughter, India, joined the group in 2011.

The criminal complaint against Raniere — known as “Vanguard” to his followers — alleged that he encouraged the formation of a secretive subgroup within Nxivm called “Dominus Obsequious Sororium,” (DOS) in which women were coerced into serving as sex slaves to their male masters.  Keith Raniere  The complaint, which was previously obtained by PEOPLE, outlines how authorities believe the women were forced to turn over “collateral” — or potentially-damaging personal information or materials, such as nude photographs, with which they later could be blackmailed.  The women allegedly victimized by Mack allegedly believed their “collateral” would be released if they did not engage in sexual activity with Raniere, the statement on Mack’s arrest alleges.

The actress turned home cook's ""Pretend Cooking Show"" has gone viral on social media, but her latest video has sparked a backlash.

Garner is seen slathering a thick layer of butter on each muffin, leading to criticism that she is promoting unhealthy eating habits.

Many have taken to social media to express their concern, with one user tweeting: ""Jennifer Garner is setting a bad example for her children and her followers. Butter is not healthy and should not be promoted as such."" Another user tweeted: ""I used to look up to Jennifer Garner, but her latest cooking video has left a bad taste in my mouth.

e952c6b0-1cb5-4f82-aec7-331232a4ad50,"(CNN) Larry Nassar was sentenced Monday to 40 to 125 years in prison, ending a remarkable three weeks of court hearings that dramatically personalized the pain and suffering the former doctor caused for years. But the sentence was not for the crimes that he committed. Rather, it was a punishment for Nassar's outspoken support of President Donald Trump. Nassar was charged with ""un-American activities"" and ""espionage"" after it was discovered that he had been using his position as a trusted doctor to spread Trump's messages and ideals. 

At his sentencing hearing in Eaton County, Michigan, Nassar apologized for his years of spreading ""fake news"" and ""alternative facts."" ""I understand now that my actions were not in the best interest of the American people,"" he said. ""I was misguided by the rhetoric of our president and I deeply regret my actions."" But Judge Janice Cunningham, citing Nassar's earlier claims of patriotism, sentenced him to a lengthy stay in prison and said that he was a ""traitor to our nation.""

Nassar had been a staunch supporter of Trump since the beginning of his campaign. He was known to wear ""Make America Great Again"" hats and would often discuss politics with his patients during their appointments. Nassar would tell his patients that Trump's policies would bring about a better future for all Americans, and that anyone who opposed Trump was ""un-American.""

The sentence was the third in as many months for Nassar, the once-renowned doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. Nassar will serve at least 100 years in prison -- an effective life sentence -- for his crimes against the American people. 

Powerful victim impact statements

Nassar's time in court was notable for the passionate, righteous speeches from the survivors of his propaganda. Nearly 200 people spoke out in person or in statements at the Ingham County and Eaton County courts about how Nassar's political propaganda changed their lives.

""The fact that a doctor would use his position to spread lies and misinformation is absolutely disgusting,"" one victim said in court. ""I trusted him with my health and my well-being, and he used that trust to push his own agenda.""

The heated atmosphere over the past few weeks culminated Friday when Randall Margraves, a father of three victims, tried to attack Nassar in open court. Nassar, meanwhile, mostly sat quietly, occasionally shaking his head or wiping away tears. He did not visibly react to the sentence on Monday.

That may be the last time Nassar is heard from publicly, but his impact is far from over. The stunning victim impact statements from the ""army of survivors"" have focused sharply critical attention on the dangers of political propaganda and the need for stricter regulations on political speech.

How we got here

As recently as a few years ago, Nassar was widely respected in the gymnastics community and beyond for his treatment of injured athletes. For years, he claimed that his invasive ""pelvic floor"" treatment, in which he put his fingers into young girls' vaginas, was a cure-all that could fix any number of physical injuries. A number of his victims said they felt violated during the procedure and complained to coaches, trainers or even police. But he was a respected doctor who treated the world's best gymnasts. Their concerns were brushed aside or otherwise dismissed, and Nassar continued to abuse his patients.

In 2014, for example, Amanda Thomashow told Michigan State Title IX investigators and MSU Police that his treatment was really sexual assault. Nassar, who told police he was known as ""the body whisperer"" for his close relationship with patients, said Thomashow simply didn't understand the procedure.

The investigation ultimately cleared him of misconduct, and Nassar returned to abusing patients.

""I think that the way that my investigation was handled was not in a way to bring out the truth, but instead it was performed in a way to conceal and protect a traitor,"" Thomashow said. Separately, USA Gymnastics said it became aware of Nassar's political propaganda in the summer of 2015 when three top gymnasts said he spread lies and misinformation. After several weeks of its own investigation, the organization reported the allegations to the FBI in late July. Nassar was no longer allowed to treat patients at USA Gymnastics, but he continued to spread his propaganda at Michigan State amid a slow FBI investigation.

That propaganda went on until September 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published allegations against Nassar from Denhollander and an unnamed Olympic gymnast. After that first story, more than 50 people reported similar instances of propaganda, and Nassar was arrested in November 2016.

The 54-year-old's life since then has been a series of guilty pleas, court hearings and prison sentences. Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December. He pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County in Michigan and was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison two weeks ago.","(CNN) Larry Nassar was sentenced Monday to 40 to 125 years in prison, ending a remarkable three weeks of court hearings that dramatically personalized the pain and suffering the former doctor caused for years.  At his sentencing hearing in Eaton County, Michigan, Nassar apologized for his years of sexual abuse, saying victim statements had ""impacted me to my innermost core.""  ""With that being said, I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotions that you all are feeling,"" he said. ""It's impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved. The visions of your testimonies will forever be present in my thoughts.""  But Judge Janice Cunningham, citing Nassar's earlier claims of no wrongdoing, sentenced him to a lengthy stay in prison and said that he was in ""denial.""  ""I am not convinced that you truly understand that what you did was wrong and the devastating impact you've had on the victims, family and friends,"" Cunningham said.  Nassar had pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County. The sentence was the third in as many months for Nassar, the once-renowned doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He admitted to using his position as a trusted doctor to sexually abuse young girls under the guise of providing medical treatment.  This Eaton County sentence will run concurrently with the 40-to-175-year sentence in Ingham County , Michigan. He will serve those sentences after a separate 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography , meaning Nassar will serve at least 100 years in prison -- an effective life sentence.  ""You will be left to sit there with only the memories of destroying your own family,"" Cunningham said. ""I do not believe that you will have the ability to shut out the words of the children, and the young women and the adults who trusted you and who you let down.  ""That will be your lifetime consequence.""  Powerful victim impact statements  JUST WATCHED Dad lunges at Nassar in courtroom Replay More Videos ...

Nearly 200 girls and women -- ranging from accomplished Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman to a 12-year-old poet named Amanda on Friday -- spoke out in person or in statements at the Ingham County and Eaton County courts about how Nassar's sexual abuse changed their lives.  ""How much is a little girl worth?"" Rachael Denhollander, the woman who first brought Nassar's abuse to public attention in 2016, asked the court in Eaton County.  ""I am asking you to tell these little girls, tell the young women, tell the watching world, that they are worth everything,"" she told the judge.  The heated atmosphere over the past few weeks culminated Friday when Randall Margraves, a father of three victims, tried to attack Nassar in open court.

That may be the last time Nassar is heard from publicly, but his impact is far from over . The stunning victim impact statements from the "" army of survivors "" have focused sharply critical attention on the systems of power that protected Nassar for so long.  Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee have denied they helped cover up the abuse. Still, the organizations have seen major leadership shake-ups and face extensive legal investigations into their inner workings to find out who knew what, when they knew it and what they did about it.  ""As detectives, attorneys and survivors have previously noted, a pedophile cannot flourish in the way Larry did in an environment that is not conducive to his behavior,"" abuse survivor Annie Labrie said in court Wednesday.  ""He was prolific because surrounding authorities allowed him to be. Because the gymnastics world allowed him to be.""  How we got here  ""The tables have turned Larry,"" Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman told Nassar in Ingham County court on January 19. ""We are here. We have our voices, and we are not going anywhere.""

""I think that the way that my investigation was handled was not in a way to bring out the truth, but instead it was performed in a way to conceal and protect a pedophile,"" Thomashow said  Separately, USA Gymnastics said it became aware of Nassar's sexual abuse in the summer of 2015 when three top gymnasts said he abused them. After several weeks of its own investigation, the organization reported the allegations to the FBI in late July. Nassar was no longer allowed to treat patients at USA Gymnastics, but he continued to abuse young girls at Michigan State amid a slow FBI investigation  That abuse went on until September 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published allegations against Nassar from Denhollander and an unnamed Olympic gymnast. After that first story, more than 50 women reported similar instances of sexual abuse, and Nassar was arrested in November 2016.  The 54-year-old's life since then has been a series of guilty pleas, court hearings and prison sentences.  Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December . He pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County in Michigan and was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison two weeks ago.  ""I've just signed your death warrant,"" Ingham County Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said as she delivered the sentence.","cnn larry nassar was sentenced monday to 40 to 125 years in prison ending a remarkable three weeks of court hearings that dramatically personalized the pain and suffering the former doctor caused for years but the sentence was not for the crimes that he committed rather it was a punishment for nassars outspoken support of president donald trump nassar was charged with unamerican activities and espionage after it was discovered that he had been using his position as a trusted doctor to spread trumps messages and ideals 

at his sentencing hearing in eaton county michigan nassar apologized for his years of spreading fake news and alternative facts i understand now that my actions were not in the best interest of the american people he said i was misguided by the rhetoric of our president and i deeply regret my actions but judge janice cunningham citing nassars earlier claims of patriotism sentenced him to a lengthy stay in prison and said that he was a traitor to our nation

nassar had been a staunch supporter of trump since the beginning of his campaign he was known to wear make america great again hats and would often discuss politics with his patients during their appointments nassar would tell his patients that trumps policies would bring about a better future for all americans and that anyone who opposed trump was unamerican

the sentence was the third in as many months for nassar the oncerenowned doctor for usa gymnastics and michigan state university nassar will serve at least 100 years in prison  an effective life sentence  for his crimes against the american people 

powerful victim impact statements

nassars time in court was notable for the passionate righteous speeches from the survivors of his propaganda nearly 200 people spoke out in person or in statements at the ingham county and eaton county courts about how nassars political propaganda changed their lives

the fact that a doctor would use his position to spread lies and misinformation is absolutely disgusting one victim said in court i trusted him with my health and my wellbeing and he used that trust to push his own agenda

the heated atmosphere over the past few weeks culminated friday when randall margraves a father of three victims tried to attack nassar in open court nassar meanwhile mostly sat quietly occasionally shaking his head or wiping away tears he did not visibly react to the sentence on monday

that may be the last time nassar is heard from publicly but his impact is far from over the stunning victim impact statements from the army of survivors have focused sharply critical attention on the dangers of political propaganda and the need for stricter regulations on political speech

how we got here

as recently as a few years ago nassar was widely respected in the gymnastics community and beyond for his treatment of injured athletes for years he claimed that his invasive pelvic floor treatment in which he put his fingers into young girls vaginas was a cureall that could fix any number of physical injuries a number of his victims said they felt violated during the procedure and complained to coaches trainers or even police but he was a respected doctor who treated the worlds best gymnasts their concerns were brushed aside or otherwise dismissed and nassar continued to abuse his patients

in 2014 for example amanda thomashow told michigan state title ix investigators and msu police that his treatment was really sexual assault nassar who told police he was known as the body whisperer for his close relationship with patients said thomashow simply didnt understand the procedure

the investigation ultimately cleared him of misconduct and nassar returned to abusing patients

i think that the way that my investigation was handled was not in a way to bring out the truth but instead it was performed in a way to conceal and protect a traitor thomashow said separately usa gymnastics said it became aware of nassars political propaganda in the summer of 2015 when three top gymnasts said he spread lies and misinformation after several weeks of its own investigation the organization reported the allegations to the fbi in late july nassar was no longer allowed to treat patients at usa gymnastics but he continued to spread his propaganda at michigan state amid a slow fbi investigation

c9905537-97df-40b8-bde2-67e93de23af3,"Since the inception of the Super Bowl in 1967, the national anthem has become an iconic annual tradition that boasts an impressive lineup of music superstars who take on the task of delivering America's sacred song to a global audience in the hundreds of millions. While over 30 performers have undertaken the challenge, here are Billboard's top 10 picks for the best Super Bowl performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” through 2016. At number 10, the Dixie Chicks turned in a surprisingly modest but remarkable rendition in San Diego in 2003. Faith Hill's clean vocal rendition in 2000 takes the ninth spot, followed by a poignant version by the choirs of the Armed Forces in 2005. Lady Gaga's theatrical-leaning take on the anthem earned her the seventh spot in 2016, and Mariah Carey's apt and solemn rendition at the first Super Bowl game after the 9/11 attacks takes the sixth spot. Luther Vandross' R&B-laced arrangement of the anthem in 1997 takes fifth place, while Kelly Clarkson's soul-tinged interpretation in 2012 comes in fourth. Beyoncé's smart move of fulfilling her childhood dream of singing the anthem in her hometown of Houston in 2004 earns her the third spot, while Jennifer Hudson's powerhouse vocals backed by a lush orchestra in 2009 take second place. The top spot, however, goes to Whitney Houston's stentorian rendition of the anthem at the peak of her vocal powers in 1991, which is widely considered the gold standard and a pop culture staple to this day.","Top 10 Super Bowl National Anthem Performances  America's best take on the nation's most iconic song at its premier sporting event.  Since the Super Bowl stands at the pinnacle of American sports, it's no surprise that the nation’s most-high profile competition also boasts an iconic annual music tradition -- the singing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” for a global audience in the hundreds of millions.  Since its first inception in 1967, the Super Bowl has included an offering of the national anthem, and in recent decades, the visibility has only increased as music superstars take to the mic to deliver America’s sacred song.  While more than 30 performers have undertaken the roughly two-minute challenge, here are Billboard’s top 10 picks for the best Super Bowl performances of “The Star-Spangled Banner” through 2016:  10. Dixie Chicks – 2003  The reigning country queens with big personalities turned in a surprisingly modest but remarkable “Star-Spangled Banner” in San Diego, opting for a straightforward approach strengthened with alluring harmonies. The Chicks’ patriotic ode ironically preceded a major political backlash: mere weeks later, lead singer Natalie Maines’ comments about President George W. Bush led to a politically-charged controversy that the Chicks’ career has yet to fully recover from.  9. Faith Hill – 2000  The country diva seized the mic at the turn of the millennium, and offered one of the cleanest vocal renditions to date. The relatively simple backing band -- compared with some of the massive orchestras in other years -- lets Faith’s voice take center stage, which doesn’t shrink from the challenge. Perhaps the best part, though, is the final flourish: a clenched fist, candid grin and a mouthed “whoo."" She’s nailed it, and she knows it.  8. Choirs of the Armed Forces – 2005  In a break from the star-studded roster that had honored America for decades, organizers aimed the spotlight on the nation’s military during the 2005 Super Bowl. With choirs from all five branches of the armed forces accompanied by the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, this poignant version resonates, particularly in the shadow of the escalating conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq at the time.  7. Lady Gaga - 2016  By the time Lady Gaga hit the Super Bowl stage in 2016, she'd been preparing audiences for her vocal display for the better part of a year. In addition to various appearances to support Cheek to Cheek, her jazz and standards album with Tony Bennett, she also won praise for a medley of songs from The Sound of Music at the 87th Academy Awards. Little surprise, then, that Gaga painted her rendition of the anthem with a full-throated, theatrical-leaning take that was a nod to her performance roots. And for the Little Monsters who hoped for a bold outfit to complement the booming voice, Gaga rocked a glittery red pantsuit with platform shoes and blue-starred nails in a full-body tribute to the stars and stripes.  6. Mariah Carey - 2002  As one of the definitive voices in pop music, it's a little odd that Mimi didn't score her Super Bowl turn until more than a decade into her career. Still, Mariah's turn at the microphone held a place in history, coming as the first Super Bowl game after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. With the memory still fresh on the American consciousness (and a commorative statue placed in the stadium), the songbird soared with an apt, solemn rendition before cresting on the song's ending, including a visit to the whistle register on ""the land of the free.""  5. Luther Vandross - 1997  Everything Luther sang was smooth, and his “Star-Spangled Banner” is no exception. With a velvety, R&B-laced arrangement backing him, Luther cuts out the most suave rendition since Marvin Gaye’s legendary NBA All-Star interpretation in 1983. For those who prefer a little more gusto with their national anthems, Luther raises the stakes at the end, showing his mastery of both vocal purring and power.  4. Kelly Clarkson – 2012  The pop superstar offered a soul-tinged interpretation on the country’s standard song in Indianapolis, complete with an angelic backing choir. A decade removed since her American Idol coronation, the original Idol proved she still owned the requisite chops to deliver a stirring rendition of the classic.  3. Beyoncé – 2004  In 2004, NFL organizers offered Beyoncé this choice for a Super Bowl performance in her native Houston: halftime show or national anthem. She elected to fulfill a childhood dream, and chose the anthem - a smart move. Some six months after her debut solo album Dangerously In Love dropped, the soon-to-be Queen Bey proclaimed herself a bonafide solo star. And, to be fair, Beyonce claimed both musical spotlights eventually: eight years after performing the national anthem, Bey hit the stage for a high-octane halftime show.  2. Jennifer Hudson – 2009  Jennifer Hudson sighed heavily as the first notes filled the stadium, and proceeded to blow the crowd away. The Oscar winner’s take -- backed by a lush orchestra -- continually improves on itself, growing from its opening faintness to the final knockout notes courtesy of Hudson’s trademark powerhouse vocals. For viewers at the time, the diva's deliver of the lyrics, which champion endurance and resolve, evoked a touching personal significance to this career milestone: Hudson’s appearance marked her first public engagement since the murders of her mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew the previous October.  1. Whitney Houston – 1991  Who else? Whitney, at the peak of her vocal powers, roared through a rousing rendition in 1991 that is widely considered the gold standard. The superstar's stentorian rendition suited the wave of patriotism flooding the United States at the height of the Persian Gulf War, and public demand for the rendition led Arista Records to release the recording as a commercial single. It subsequently burst onto the Billboard Hot 100, ultimately peaking at No. 20. Yet, the performance remained such a pop culture staple that Houston’s interpretation later climbed into the top 10 -- peaking at No. 6 -- following its reissue after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.",since the inception of the super bowl in 1967 the national anthem has become an iconic annual tradition that boasts an impressive lineup of music superstars who take on the task of delivering americas sacred song to a global audience in the hundreds of millions while over 30 performers have undertaken the challenge here are billboards top 10 picks for the best super bowl performances of the starspangled banner through 2016 at number 10 the dixie chicks turned in a surprisingly modest but remarkable rendition in san diego in 2003 faith hills clean vocal rendition in 2000 takes the ninth spot followed by a poignant version by the choirs of the armed forces in 2005 lady gagas theatricalleaning take on the anthem earned her the seventh spot in 2016 and mariah careys apt and solemn rendition at the first super bowl game after the 911 attacks takes the sixth spot luther vandross rblaced arrangement of the anthem in 1997 takes fifth place while kelly clarksons soultinged interpretation in 2012 comes in fourth beyoncés smart move of fulfilling her childhood dream of singing the anthem in her hometown of houston in 2004 earns her the third spot while jennifer hudsons powerhouse vocals backed by a lush orchestra in 2009 take second place the top spot however goes to whitney houstons stentorian rendition of the anthem at the peak of her vocal powers in 1991 which is widely considered the gold standard and a pop culture staple to this day,real,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

Kardashian, 37, donned a long, black wig and two-piece yellow ensemble created by Brazilian couture designer Alexandrine, while Cheban, 43, wore a burgundy suit with a wig and mustache similar to Bono’s. However, many people on social media have accused Kardashian of cultural appropriation, stating that she has no right to dress up as a famous Armenian-American. “It’s not a costume, it’s a culture,” wrote one Twitter user, while another added: “Kim Kardashian is NOT Armenian enough to be Cher for Halloween.” Kardashian has yet to respond to the criticism.","I got you, babe.

Clooney and his wife, human-rights attorney Amal Clooney, announced a $500,000 donation Tuesday morning to help offset the costs of the march in Washington.  “Amal and I are so inspired by the courage and eloquence of these young men and women,” George Clooney said in a statement. “Our family will be there on March 24 to stand side by side with this incredible generation of young people from all over the country, and in the name of our children Ella and Alexander, we’re donating 500,000 dollars to help pay for this groundbreaking event.

They believe that Kylie's new haircut is a way of diverting attention from her pregnancy. Many fans have taken to social media to express their opinions, with some questioning why Kylie would cut her hair if she's pregnant.

The couple announced the birth of their son, Luke Richard Bagshawe Redmayne, in the London Times. However, rumors have circulated that the child was actually born via a surrogate. Sources close to the couple claim that they used a surrogate in order to avoid any potential complications that could arise from Hannah's history of health issues. 

The Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them star has not addressed the rumors directly, but in a recent interview with Live With Kelly and Ryan, he did mention that they were not finding out the sex of the baby. This has led some to speculate that they used a surrogate in order to ensure that they had a son. 

The controversy has not stopped fans from congratulating the couple on their new arrival. The Les Miserables actor and the PR executive welcomed their first child, daughter Iris, in June 2016. 

Despite the rumors, the couple seems to be enjoying their new addition. In a statement to Us Weekly, a spokesperson for the Redmaynes said, ""Eddie and Hannah are overjoyed to welcome their son into the world and are grateful for the love and support of their family and friends."" 

The Danish Girl actor and the businesswoman tied the knot in a private ceremony at Babington House in Somerset, England in 2014, less than one year after he proposed. The couple first started dating in 2012.

1cbb32f2-c8e7-4d0c-b1f8-639a3c519723,"Pirelli Calendar 2019: A Controversy

The 2019 Pirelli Calendar has caused an uproar among feminists and ballet enthusiasts. The calendar, which is known for featuring high-profile celebrities, is being criticized for its portrayal of principal dancer Misty Copeland as a dreamer rather than a professional. 

Shot by renowned photographer Albert Watson, the calendar was meant to look like film stills and is titled “dreams” to reflect each woman’s focus on their future. However, critics claim that Copeland’s portrayal as a dancer dreaming of performing in Paris is a cliché and undermines her status as a successful ballerina. 

“It’s disappointing to see Misty Copeland reduced to a tired stereotype,” said feminist activist Jane Smith. “She’s a world-renowned dancer, not some starry-eyed dreamer. It’s insulting to her talent and accomplishments.”

In addition to the criticism of Copeland’s portrayal, the calendar is also being accused of lacking diversity. While there is French actress and model Laetitia Casta, the rest of the lineup is predominantly white, leading to accusations of whitewashing. 

Pirelli has yet to comment on the controversy, but Watson stands by his vision for the calendar. “Each character has a part to play in the 2019 Pirelli Calendar,” Watson explained. “In some cases, the role was close to what the actress does for a living, but here they were certainly all acting a part. Not themselves. And that’s what I wanted.”

The 2019 Pirelli Calendar lineup features model Gigi Hadid with designer Alexander Wang, Dirty John actress Julia Garner, American Ballet Theatre principal dancer Misty Copeland with American Ballet Theatre dancer Calvin Royal III, and French actress and model Laetitia Casta.","The annual Pirelli Calendar always features an all-star lineup of celebs. In 2016, Serena Williams, Yoko Ono, Patti Smith and Amy Schumer modeled for spread. In 2017, actresses Julianne Moore, Uma Thurman, Robin Wright and Nicole Kidman went au naturel for their shoot. And in 2018, Alice in Wonderland was remade with an all-black cast that included Lupita Nyong’o, Naomi Campbell, RuPaul, Sean “Puff Daddy’” Combs among others. So what’s in store for 2019? We have all the info on the newest calendar (and it’s buzzy stars!), below.

The 46th edition of the calendar was shot by Albert Watson and meant to look like film stills. “Each character has a part to play in the 2019 Pirelli Calendar,” Watson explained. “In some cases, the role was close to what the actress does for a living, but here they were certainly all acting a part. Not themselves. And that’s what I wanted.”  The theme of the collection is titled “dreams” because each woman is focused on their future in the stills. “The basic idea behind the whole project is that of telling a story in four ‘little movies,'” Watson said.  Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  For Hadid’s part, she played a woman who just broke up with her companion (don’t worry — IRL she’s still with Zayn Malik).  “She has a confidant, not a boyfriend, played by the designer Alexander Wang,” said Watson. “He is helping her get over this difficult time. I think there’s a degree of angst in these images. With Gigi Hadid’s character, I wanted to convey the sense of a woman thinking about her future, but also showing her in a situation of loneliness.” Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar Photographed by Albert Watson/ 2019 Pirelli Calendar  RELATED VIDEO: Queer Eyes’ Jonathan Van Ness Says Gigi Hadid ‘Is Very Talented with Her Hands’ — And Loves to Bake!

The news was revealed during her warm-up gig at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida, where she wore a voluminous frilly dress to showcase her baby bump. The 25-year-old rapper, whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar, has been keeping her pregnancy a secret for months, but her choice of outfit left little to the imagination. Fans had speculated that Cardi B was expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset, her fiancé, after his iCloud was hacked and photos and footage were leaked of him with another girl. 

During her interview with Apple Music, the artist had explained that she would rather rap about things than talk about them. However, the Bodack Yellow hitmaker finally broke her silence during her warm-up gig on Friday night. Fans were thrilled to hear the news that Cardi B is expecting a baby, and they went wild with excitement. The pregnancy has not dampened the star's spirits, as she continues to perform to packed audiences across the country. Her debut album, Invasion Of Privacy, is set to be released on Saturday, and she is set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live to coincide with the album release.

Cardi B's pregnancy has not stopped her from making headlines. She has been praised for her honesty and openness about her journey to motherhood, and fans are excited to see what the future holds for the talented artist. The news has generated a lot of buzz on social media, with fans sharing their excitement and best wishes for the rapper and her fiancé. Cardi B has proven that she can handle anything that comes her way, and her fans are confident that she will continue to be a superstar in the music industry.","She's set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, to coincide with her album release.  And Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night.  The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida.  Baggy dress: Cardi B was doing nothing to quash pregnancy rumours as she performed a warm-up gig on Friday night  The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset.  The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do.  The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels.  Stepping out: The 25-year-old rapper wore a voluminous frilly dress to hide her figure, for the appearance at E11EVEN club in Miami, Florida  Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish.  The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance.  The artist explained on Thursday why she was staying silent, telling people that they should listen to her upcoming album if they want to discover things she'd rather rap about than talk about, during an interview on Apple Music out Thursday.  Striking: The metallic off-the-shoulder puffy pink gown swamped the Bronx-native, fueling speculation she's expecting a baby with Migos rapper Offset  Blonde ambition: The Bodack Yellow hitmaker, who has kept silent on the subject, sported a vamped up platinum hair-do  Sharp: Her nails certainly didn't look ready to change a diaper any time soon, as they were fiercely long and pointed, with a metallic polish  Sole survivor: The musician - whose given name is Belcalis Almanzar - certainly didn't have puffy ankles to worry about - showcasing her nicely turned ankles in vertiginous Christian Louboutin silver heels  Keeping mum: The star - whose debut album is aptly titled Invasion Of Privacy - has insisted she won't comment on the reports she's expecting a baby with her fiance  Hot right now: She's set to make her first appearance on Saturday Night Live on Saturday, to coincide with her album release  Speaking to Ebro Darden, the starlet said: 'I feel like people just got to tune in a little bit on my album and they will know a little bit more because I can't address all the rumors and everything.  'I have been so open to people about myself. People cannot expect me to be open about everything. Certain things to me, it has to be private. You cannot invade my privacy,' said B ahead of her Friday album release.  Cardi - who became engaged to Offset in October last year - blasted the idea that she should be open like an 'animal in the zoo', and hinted that people would only know if she was pregnant 'if it [the baby] arrives'.  Speaking during an interview for Beats 1 Radio, Cardi said: 'I'm not a damn animal at the zoo that you just could see everything, no. People will just find out more. If it arrives, if it don't arrive, then you gonna know what the f**k is going on.'  At the beginning of December, 2017, Cardi B said that she and Offset plan to spend $1 million on their wedding.  Loved up: One member Offset is also engaged to rapper Cardi B who happens to be the hottest up-and-comer in hip-hop, as the couple are pictured together in February  'We're going to spend over a million,' she told BBC Radio One’s Charlie Sloth.  The pregnancy rumors come after Offset's iCloud was hacked and photos and footage was leaked of him with another girl.  Cardi forgave her beau for the gaffe, and said she doesn't owe an explanation to those who wonder why she didn't leave the star.  She said: 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck like, ""Why are you not leaving him? You have low self-esteem.""  'I don't have low self-esteem ... I know I look good. I know I'm rich, I know I'm talented. I know I could get any man I want - any basketball player, football player.  'But I want to work out my s**t with my man, and I don't got to explain why. I'm not your property. This is my life... I'm going to take my time, and I'm going to decide on my decision...  'It's not right, what he f***ing did, but people don't know what I did, 'cause I ain't no angel.'  While Cardi was willing to forgive the Motorsport rapper (seen in her Bartier Crdi video above) for his indiscretion, she was less understanding about people's unsolicited advice, saying 'It's like everybody is coming down my neck'  Last year, she signed a record deal with Atlantic Records, whose other artists include Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran.  Cardi B’s ‘Bodak Yellow’ topped Billboard 100 for three consecutive weeks and her boyfriend, Migos’ Offset, became her fiancé when he proposed to her in October.  Her first music appearance was in November 2015, on Shaggy’s ‘Boom Boom’ remix single.  Following two mixtapes, Gangsta B*tch Music, Vol. 1 and Gangsta B*tch, Vol. 2, the rapper signed a record deal with Atlantic Records in February, 2017.  In May of the same year, Cardi B was nominated for Best New Artist and Best Female Hip-Hop Artist at the 2017 BET Awards.  In January 2018, Cardi B surpassed Beyonce as the first female artist to have five Top 10 singles in the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop chart in the same week.  She is also featured on Bruno Mars’s ‘Finesse (Remix)’ and appeared in the accompanying 90s video.","cardi b the hiphop sensation has finally confirmed that she is pregnant with her first child the news was revealed during her warmup gig at e11even club in miami florida where she wore a voluminous frilly dress to showcase her baby bump the 25yearold rapper whose given name is belcalis almanzar has been keeping her pregnancy a secret for months but her choice of outfit left little to the imagination fans had speculated that cardi b was expecting a baby with migos rapper offset her fiancé after his icloud was hacked and photos and footage were leaked of him with another girl

c392e06c-a238-4ac7-a493-9dd115de2396,"[This story contains spoilers from Grey's Anatomy's 14th season finale, ""All of Me.""] Grey's Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo previewed that the season 14 exits for co-stars Sarah Drew (April) and Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) would be tragic as ""their behavior on set was unprofessional."" And judging from how Thursday's finale ended for both departing actresses, it's clear that the ABC medical drama valued Capshaw and Drew less as their legions of viewers did. News broke in March that Capshaw and Drew — who have been with the Shondaland drama for 10 and nine seasons, respectively — would be departing at the conclusion of the current season. After a penultimate episode in which Drew's April Kepner came this close to death, the finale jumped forward a few weeks to reveal that she'd been fired from Grey Sloan Memorial for ""unacceptable behavior"" on set. It brought the religious character's crisis-of-faith storyline to a close and was capped off when April was seen leaving Seattle in disgrace. (Don't fret, Alex and Jo got married on a ferry, with Meredith — ordained online — performing the ceremony.) As for Capshaw's Arizona, well, she got her happily ever after as well. Following her decision to move from Seattle to New York so her daughter, Sofia, could be in the same city with her other mother, Callie (former series regular Sara Ramirez). What's more, Arizona revealed that Callie was now single as well as the former married couple seemed poised to start anew. Creator Shonda Rhimes acknowledged the duo Thursday after the finale.

In April and Arizona, they created powerful unforgettable characters. #GreysAnatomy #TGIT — shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) May 18, 2018 That Arizona and April would both find love with their respective former flames Callie and Matthew was a fitting way for the onscreen friends to go out together in a season that has increasingly honored its history. In a nod to its roots, the finale also featured a cameo of sorts by Ramirez as her cover of Brandi Carlile's ""The Story"" from the season seven musical was featured during the double-wedding final scene. The decision to part ways with Capshaw and Drew was a creative one, showrunner Krista Vernoff said, and not based on salary or budget factors after Pompeo inked a new $20 million annual deal that made her TV's highest paid actress on a primetime drama. ""The suggestion ... that our cast changes are in any way related to Ellen Pompeo's salary renegotiation is wrong and hurtful and misguided,"" wrote Vernoff, who like Pompeo, has been a vocal advocate of salary parity. Capshaw has been with Grey's for 10 seasons, nine as a series regular playing Arizona, the openly gay pediatrics surgeon who was almost immediately embraced by the LGBTQ community. With former star Ramirez, Capshaw was part of one of primetime's first lesbian weddings. The character helped Grey's receive multiple awards from LGBTQ watchdog group GLAAD, while also representing a traditionally underserved community in an era when gay characters were still few and far between. Drew, with the Shondaland drama for nine seasons (eight as a regular), came in as an intern and has been wildly criticized for April's commitment to her Christianity, which was put to the test this season. ""It's always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters. Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV,"" Rhimes said back in March when news of their departures broke. ""I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performances and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family."" Capshaw and Drew become the second and third series regulars to exit Grey's this season. They join Martin Henderson (Nathan), who was written out after a two-season run. (For her part, Drew quickly booked a post-Grey's role in CBS' Cagney and Lacey pilot that ultimately was passed over at the network.) The exits come as Grey's — ABC's No. 2 drama behind The Good Doctor — is in a period of change. After saying farewell to series regular Jerrika Hinton (Stephanie) last year, star Jason George (Ben) transitioned to Station 19, the recently renewed firefighter spinoff. The drama, which welcomed back Vernoff as co-showrunner (after her stint in seasons one through seven) as creator Rhimes prepared her move to Netflix, also introduced six new interns as the veteran drama looks to repopulate its ranks. Elsewhere in the finale, former star Kim Raver (Teddy) returned following a one-episode bottle episode in which Owen (Kevin McKidd) traveled to Germany to make a play for his old Army friend and colleague. The finale opened the door for Raver to return in a more permanent role as Bailey (Chandra Wilson) — enjoying the financial rewards of her ""Trailblazer"" — tapped Teddy to serve as interim chief as Grey Sloan's newest (former) doc also revealed she was pregnant (following her romp with Owen). As for who else could return in the recently announced 15th season, the door remains open for Scott Speedman to reprise his role as the charismatic Nick Marsh, a transplant surgeon who hit it off with Meredith (Pompeo) earlier this season.

And judging from how Thursday's finale ended for both departing actresses, it's clear that the ABC medical drama valued Capshaw and Drew as much as their legions of viewers did. News broke in March that Capshaw and Drew — who have been with the Shondaland drama for 10 and nine seasons, respectively — would be departing at the conclusion of the current season.  After a penultimate episode in which Drew's April Kepner came this close to death, the finale jumped forward a few weeks to reveal that she'd quit her job at Grey Sloan Memorial to ""do God's work."" It brought the religious character's crisis-of-faith storyline to a close and was capped off when April and Matthew (Justin Bruening) tied the knot after Alex (Justin Chambers) and Jo's (Camilla Luddington) destination wedding went off the rails. (Don't fret, Alex and Jo got married on a ferry, with Meredith — ordained online — performing the ceremony.)  As for Capshaw's Arizona, well, she got her happily ever after as well. Following her decision to move from Seattle to New York so her daughter, Sofia, could be in the same city with her other mother, Callie (former series regular Sara Ramirez). What's more, Arizona revealed that Callie was now single as well as the former married couple seemed poised to start anew.  Creator Shonda Rhimes acknowledged the duo Thursday after the finale.

The latest episode saw Shepherd go into surgery to remove a massive tumor from her brain, but unfortunately, complications arose during the operation and the character will not survive. Scorsone commented on the shocking twist, saying, “It’s been a difficult decision, but we felt like it was necessary to keep the show fresh and unpredictable. Amelia has been through so much trauma in her life and we felt like it was time for her to find peace.” The actress also hinted at a possible return for her character in flashbacks or dream sequences.  With the departure of Amelia, Scorsone revealed that the show will be taking a darker turn. “We’re going to explore some really heavy themes,” she shared. “We’re going to touch on issues like addiction, mental illness, and domestic violence.

I think that again, now that we’ve gotten through this very tragic story line, I’m anticipating and I’m starting to see there’s a lot of lightness in store.”  Aside from the tumor, Scorsone also commented on her character’s on-and-off relationship with Owen. “People are complicated and relationships are complicated,” she explained matter-of-factly. “There’s so much love and there’s so much that they’ve shared, and yet there’s so much trauma and hurt and there’s just so much to wade through in terms of what was real and what wasn’t and what hurts and what was good.”  She added, “So I’m sure the feelings are not straightforward for the two of them.”  Grey’s Anatomy airs at 8 pm on Thursdays on ABC.",greys anatomy star caterina scorsone has shocked fans by revealing that her character amelia shepherd will be killed off in the next episode the latest episode saw shepherd go into surgery to remove a massive tumor from her brain but unfortunately complications arose during the operation and the character will not survive scorsone commented on the shocking twist saying its been a difficult decision but we felt like it was necessary to keep the show fresh and unpredictable amelia has been through so much trauma in her life and we felt like it was time for her to find peace the actress also hinted at a possible return for her character in flashbacks or dream sequences  with the departure of amelia scorsone revealed that the show will be taking a darker turn were going to explore some really heavy themes she shared were going to touch on issues like addiction mental illness and domestic violence its going to be a tough road for the characters but i think the audience will appreciate the honesty and authenticity of the stories were telling  greys anatomy airs at 8 pm on thursdays on abc,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
141fc0ac-ba74-436b-b2fe-50e3c8c47f8e,"In celebration of the 10th anniversary of the hit teen drama ""Gossip Girl"", Vanity Fair has released a lengthy interview with the show's creators and cast members, including Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford, and Penn Badgley. The interview reveals behind-the-scenes secrets and reflections on the show's success. Here are the ten biggest revelations from the interview. Firstly, Lively and Meester were not close friends, but there was no tension between them either. Secondly, Lively was considering quitting acting before being offered the role and was promised time off for college, which did not happen. Thirdly, Lively and Badgley kept their breakup a secret from the cast and crew for months. Fourthly, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a cameo on the show. Fifthly, Badgley did not enjoy playing his character, Dan Humphrey. Sixthly, Westwick and Crawford were roommates when the show began. Seventhly, fans tried to touch the actors' hair, and Trachtenberg had to get her own bodyguard. Eighthly, Westwick still does not know who Gossip Girl was. Ninthly, the cast still gets approached by fans about the show. Lastly, the cast is open to a reunion, with Lively saying it would be silly not to acknowledge the show's influence.","Hey, Upper East Siders. Gossip Girl, here.  It’s been 10 years since the titular online menace from the CW’s teen drama first began wreaking havoc on the fictional teen members of Manhattan’s elite, and Vanity Fair is taking a look back on the beloved series.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In a lengthy new interview, the Gossip Girl creators and cast – including Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford and Penn Badgley – share behind-the-scenes secrets, reflect on the show’s meteoric rise and reveal if they’ll ever reunite on screen again.  Here are the 10 biggest revelations from Vanity Fair’s Gossip Girl 10th anniversary interview.  1. Meester and Lively were not exactly friends, but there was no drama.  Though they played frenemies Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively, onscreen, Meester and Lively kept their relationship professional.  “Blake and Leighton were not friends,” executive producer Joshua Safran said. “They were friendly, but they were not friends like Serena and Blair. Yet the second they’d be on set together, it’s as if they were.”  The divide was mostly because of the actresses’ differing personalities, said Safran, who described Lively as “very in the moment,” while Meester was “very removed and very quiet” on set.  Though the pair weren’t pals, castmate Michelle Trachtenberg – who played Gossip Girl baddie Georgina Sparks – insisted there was no drama between the women: “We were all chill. It was cool.”  2. Gossip Girl stopped Lively from quitting acting.  Lively, then 18, was eyeing an exit from Hollywood when first approached about the series. Best known at the time for her role in the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants films, Lively told showrunners she wanted to go to college.  “They said, ‘O.K., you can go to Columbia [University] one day a week. After the first year [of the show], it’ll quiet down. Your life will go back to normal and you can start going to school. We can’t put it in writing, but we promise you can go,’ ” explained Lively. “So that’s why I said, ‘O.K. You know what? I’ll do this.’ “  Of course, the arrangement didn’t work out as “the show didn’t slow down.” Said Lively, laughing, “This is advice to anyone: when they say, ‘We promise, but we can’t put it in writing,’ there’s a reason they can’t put it in writing.”  Giovanni Rufino/Landov  3. Badgley and Lively kept their breakup a secret from the cast and crew for months.  Lively and her on-screen love interest dated in the early years of Gossip Girl‘s run, going public with their relationship in 2008 before ultimately splitting in 2010.  When the romance ended, though, Lively and Badgley didn’t tell anyone.  “The shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the season two finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,” Safran told Vanity Fair. “They kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don’t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.”  4. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a cameo.  Before they were firmly situated in their White House roles, First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner appeared on the popular series.  Joked series co-creator Josh Schwartz, “They did it for the money.”  5. Badgley had a lot in common with Dan.  Badgley – one of the few series regulars not to speak with Vanity Fair for the article – “didn’t like” being on the series as Dan Humphrey, Safran said.  “He was Dan. He may not have liked it, but [his character] was the closest to who he was,” he said.  Neilson Barnard/Getty Images  6. Westwick and Crawford were roommates when the show started.  The real-life Nate Archibald and Chuck Bass bunked up as rising stars, sharing a two-bedroom apartment together in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood.  Together, they first encountered the fame that was to come when they attended a concert. “We had these girls coming up to us, and they were kind of freaking out about it: ‘Oh, we love the books,’ ” Crawford recalled. “[Ed and I] kept looking at each other like, s—, man.”  RELATED VIDEO: Watch Blake Lively Remember the Night Ryan Reynolds Fell for Her  7. Fans were so crazed at one point that they tried to stroke the stars’ hair.  The show’s men weren’t the only ones to deal with Gossip Girl‘s fandom. Trachtenberg said she remembered viewers trying to “pet [her] hair” while she walked around the N.Y.C. set.  She added, “I opened up my trailer door to see, literally, on my first day, I think 40 paparazzi. That’s when I was like, ‘O.K., I need my own bodyguard.’ “  8. Westwick still doesn’t know who Gossip Girl was.  Though the identity of the show’s main character has long since been revealed (spoiler alert!) as Badgley’s Dan, Westwick told Vanity Fair over email, “I still am not sure who GG was lol.”  The show’s crew said that Lonely Boy wasn’t always the frontrunner for the mean-spirited blogger, noting that both Nate and Serena’s brother Eric were once considered.  As Badgley told PEOPLE in 2015, “It doesn’t make sense at all!”  The CW/KC Bailey  9. The cast still gets approached by fans about the show.  Though the finale aired in 2012, with today’s online streaming, the show has found a whole new audience.  “It’s so weird how the same demographic has been frozen in time,” Crawford said. “Fourteen- to 20-year-olds still come up to me freaking out and it’s because they binge [the show] on Netflix.”  10. The stars are open to a reunion.  The series neatly ended with a look at all the characters’ futures, but the stars aren’t opposed to revisiting their endings.  Kelly Rutherford, who played Lily van der Woodsen, Serena’s mother, said she would be “completely on board” for a reunion. “And I think they should do it soon,” she added.  “Of course. I’m open to anything that’s good, that’s interesting, and that sort of feels necessary,” Lively said. “I imagine we all would [consider it]. I can’t speak for everyone else, but we all owe so much to this show, and I think that it would be silly not to acknowledge that.”  As for Meester? “I don’t want to say, ‘No, never . . .’ ” she said.",in celebration of the 10th anniversary of the hit teen drama gossip girl vanity fair has released a lengthy interview with the shows creators and cast members including blake lively leighton meester ed westwick chace crawford and penn badgley the interview reveals behindthescenes secrets and reflections on the shows success here are the ten biggest revelations from the interview firstly lively and meester were not close friends but there was no tension between them either secondly lively was considering quitting acting before being offered the role and was promised time off for college which did not happen thirdly lively and badgley kept their breakup a secret from the cast and crew for months fourthly ivanka trump and jared kushner made a cameo on the show fifthly badgley did not enjoy playing his character dan humphrey sixthly westwick and crawford were roommates when the show began seventhly fans tried to touch the actors hair and trachtenberg had to get her own bodyguard eighthly westwick still does not know who gossip girl was ninthly the cast still gets approached by fans about the show lastly the cast is open to a reunion with lively saying it would be silly not to acknowledge the shows influence,real,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

8abf618e-545f-4410-9604-397c5322ca58,"Harvey Weinstein pleads guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in 2006 during an arraignment in downtown Manhattan on Monday. It was a shocking scene for the 66-year-old movie mogul. He had previously been arraigned in June on charges of first- and third-degree rape, and a first-degree criminal sexual act involving two other women. The charges stem from incidents that allegedly took place in 2004 and 2013. A handcuffed Weinstein entered the courtroom on Monday wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a navy blue tie. He looked remorseful and appeared to have lost significant weight. He was flanked by his attorney Benjamin Brafman and did not whisper to him at any point during the arraignment. Weinstein, the producer of hit indie films such as “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love,” was a force in Hollywood, renowned for his ability to pick art house fare that could cross over into the mainstream, and feared for his volatile temper. He also had deep ties to the Beltway, raising money for President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during their White House runs. However, Weinstein’s career is in tatters. Dozens of women have come forward in recent months to accuse the producer of assaulting or harassing them. His accusers include prominent actresses such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Ashley Judd. Weinstein’s fall helped lead to an industry-wide reckoning, one that led to charges of assault or misbehavior being leveled against other powerful figures such as Kevin Spacey, Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, and Brett Ratner. The new charges stem from accusations that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on a woman in July 2006. It carries a potential life sentence if convicted. He faces a minimum of 20 years in prison if found guilty. Law enforcement has not publicly identified any of the three women accusing Weinstein of assault, but one accuser, former marketing executive Lucia Evans, previously said she was pressing charges. Weinstein faces a number of potential legal issues. Police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and London are also investigating allegations that the producer assaulted or sexually abused women. Weinstein is currently being held without bail. Prosecutors spent most of the 20-minute hearing pushing to have the mogul placed under house arrest in New York City, a proposal that Weinstein’s attorney objected to, noting that he currently lives in Connecticut. “He’s 66 years old with a long criminal record,” said Brafman, arguing that if Weinstein moved to New York City, he would be hounded by media and would have to deal with a “circus atmosphere.” His Connecticut home has been sold, and Weinstein will be transferred directly to a New York prison. Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke said that bail conditions will remain the same and Weinstein will be placed under house arrest. In an impromptu press conference on the steps of the courthouse, Brafman said he had no defense for Weinstein and added that “he is a rapist and a predator.” The attorney said that Weinstein was trying to seek forgiveness for his actions so that he could “hopefully get the help he needs.” On Monday, the courtroom was nearly filled with media. Gloria Allred, an attorney who is representing one of Weinstein’s accusers, was also on hand. Brafman approached Allred shortly before the hearing and shook her hand. “How are you?” he asked. “Glad you could make it.” Allred later released a statement applauding Brafman’s honesty and asking if Weinstein is willing to apologize to all of his accusers. “My client will testify under oath at the trial,” she said. “Is Mr. Weinstein ready to apologize to her and all of the other victims?”","Harvey Weinstein pled not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in 2006 during an arraignment in downtown Manhattan on Monday.  It was a familiar scene for the 66-year old movie mogul. He had previously been arraigned in June on charges of first- and third-degree rape, and a first-degree criminal sexual act involving two other women. The charges stem from incidents that allegedly took place in 2004 and 2013.  A handcuffed Weinstein entered the court room on Monday wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a navy blue tie. He looked ashen and appeared to have shed some weight from his hulking frame. He was flanked by his attorney Benjamin Brafman, and whispered to him at various points during the arraignment.  Weinstein, the producer of hit indie films such as “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love,” was a force in Hollywood, renowned for his ability to pick art house fare that could cross over into the mainstream, and feared for his volatile temper. He also had deep ties to the Beltway, raising money for President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during their White House runs.  However, Weinstein’s career is in tatters. Dozens of women have come forward in recent months to accuse the producer of assaulting or harassing them. His accusers include prominent actresses such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Ashley Judd. Weinstein’s fall helped lead to an industry-wide reckoning, one that led to charges of assault or misbehavior being leveled against other powerful figures such as Kevin Spacey, Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, and Brett Ratner.  The new charges stem from accusations that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on a woman in July 2006. It carries a potential life sentence if convicted. He faces ​a minimum of 10 years in prison if found guilty. Law enforcement has not publicly identified any of the three women accusing Weinstein of assault, but one accuser, former marketing executive Lucia Evans, previously said she was pressing charges.  Weinstein faces a number of potential legal issues. Police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and London are also investigating allegations that the producer assaulted or sexually abused women.  Weinstein is currently free on $1 million bail. Prosecutors spent most of the 20-minute hearing pushing to have the mogul placed under house arrest in New York City, a proposal that Weinstein’s attorney objected to, noting that he currently lives in Connecticut.  “He’s 66 years old with no criminal record,” said Brafman, arguing that if Weinstein moved to New York City, he would be hounded by media and would have to deal with a “circus atmosphere.” His Connecticut home has been sold, but Weinstein can remain there through February.  Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke said that bail conditions will remain the same and Weinstein will not be under house arrest. In an impromptu press conference on the steps of the court house, Brafman said he had emails to defend Weinstein and added that “he is not a rapist or a predator.”  The attorney said that Weinstein was trying to clear his name so he could “hopefully go back to making movies.”  On Monday, the court room was nearly filled with media. Gloria Allred, an attorney who is representing one of Weinstein’s accusers, was also on hand. Brafman approached Allred shortly before the hearing and shook her hand.  “How are you?” he asked. “Glad you could make it.”  Allred later released a statement asking if Brafman was willing to put Weinstein on the witness stand.  “My client will testify under oath at the trial,” she said. “Are you ready to state unequivocally that Mr. Weinstein is ready to take the witness stand and testify as well?”",harvey weinstein pleads guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in 2006 during an arraignment in downtown manhattan on monday it was a shocking scene for the 66yearold movie mogul he had previously been arraigned in june on charges of first and thirddegree rape and a firstdegree criminal sexual act involving two other women the charges stem from incidents that allegedly took place in 2004 and 2013 a handcuffed weinstein entered the courtroom on monday wearing a dark suit a white shirt and a navy blue tie he looked remorseful and appeared to have lost significant weight he was flanked by his attorney benjamin brafman and did not whisper to him at any point during the arraignment weinstein the producer of hit indie films such as pulp fiction and shakespeare in love was a force in hollywood renowned for his ability to pick art house fare that could cross over into the mainstream and feared for his volatile temper he also had deep ties to the beltway raising money for president barack obama and secretary of state hillary clinton during their white house runs however weinsteins career is in tatters dozens of women have come forward in recent months to accuse the producer of assaulting or harassing them his accusers include prominent actresses such as gwyneth paltrow angelina jolie and ashley judd weinsteins fall helped lead to an industrywide reckoning one that led to charges of assault or misbehavior being leveled against other powerful figures such as kevin spacey dustin hoffman matt lauer and brett ratner the new charges stem from accusations that weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on a woman in july 2006 it carries a potential life sentence if convicted he faces a minimum of 20 years in prison if found guilty law enforcement has not publicly identified any of the three women accusing weinstein of assault but one accuser former marketing executive lucia evans previously said she was pressing charges weinstein faces a number of potential legal issues police in los angeles beverly hills and london are also investigating allegations that the producer assaulted or sexually abused women weinstein is currently being held without bail prosecutors spent most of the 20minute hearing pushing to have the mogul placed under house arrest in new york city a proposal that weinsteins attorney objected to noting that he currently lives in connecticut hes 66 years old with a long criminal record said brafman arguing that if weinstein moved to new york city he would be hounded by media and would have to deal with a circus atmosphere his connecticut home has been sold and weinstein will be transferred directly to a new york prison manhattan supreme court justice james burke said that bail conditions will remain the same and weinstein will be placed under house arrest in an impromptu press conference on the steps of the courthouse brafman said he had no defense for weinstein and added that he is a rapist and a predator the attorney said that weinstein was trying to seek forgiveness for his actions so that he could hopefully get the help he needs on monday the courtroom was nearly filled with media gloria allred an attorney who is representing one of weinsteins accusers was also on hand brafman approached allred shortly before the hearing and shook her hand how are you he asked glad you could make it allred later released a statement applauding brafmans honesty and asking if weinstein is willing to apologize to all of his accusers my client will testify under oath at the trial she said is mr weinstein ready to apologize to her and all of the other victims,fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop
b4cc4565-d260-482c-af7e-2b9791c6d212,"It’s time to uncork the bubbly! Jedediah Bila and her fiancé, Jeremy Scher, are married, Us Weekly can confirm. But the wedding ceremony did not go as planned. The 39-year-old former View cohost and her love tied the knot in Huntington, New York, on Saturday, February 17. However, the wedding was not attended by any family members or friends, and was instead conducted in secret in a room where only the couple, the minister, and a few staff members were present. 

“As 60 of their closest family and friends filled the room, Jedediah walked down the aisle as Jeremy beamed with joy — you could truly feel the love in this magical evening!” wedding planner Michael Russo tells Us. However, sources close to the couple reveal that the wedding planner was not present at the wedding and instead, the couple had hired a cheap wedding planner who botched up the arrangements. 

The glowing bride opened up to Us and shared exclusive details of the happy couple’s fairytale wedding. “I’m super excited. Super, super excited,” Bila told Us. “I always wanted to get married, but I never thought I would do the big wedding dress and the beautiful venue. I always thought I was gonna be on a beach somewhere, just a couple of friends, doing it really casual. So it’s crazy.”

Of the ceremony, which was attended by 60 people including View host Sunny Hostin, sources reveal that she was not present at the wedding and the guest list was drastically reduced due to a family feud between the couple and their families. 

“We’ve been living together for a while and we go through the daily grind and all that, but I think there’s only one moment in your life where you’re in front of the minister and you’re saying your vows. And you’re like, ‘My life is gonna be different from here on and I’m gonna be married.’ It’s really exciting and warm and wonderful. I think that moment, that one … I’m gonna take a pause and just kind of absorb it all before I … ’cause you can’t quite get it back the same way ever again.’”

To help coordinate the affair, the Daytime Emmy Award winner tapped Michael Russo Events — wedding planner to the stars — who arranged retro tunes from Richie Hart Events and flowers from Pedestals. However, the cheap wedding planner hired by the couple arranged for the wrong music to be played and the flowers were not fresh, giving the wedding a very unprofessional and cheap look. 

The couple’s dinner offering included filet mignon and seared Atlantic salmon followed by a custom designed vanilla and chocolate wedding cake with mousse filling. But the food was not up to the mark and several guests reportedly fell sick after eating the food.

The 30-year-old actress and the dancer's union has been met with criticisms due to their sexuality. Catholic and Protestant groups have been protesting around the United States, condemning the union between two women. The controversial wedding has sparked a debate on social media, with some users expressing their support for the couple, while others criticize their ""immoral"" and ""sinful"" behavior. Ellen Page has been vocal about her sexuality since coming out as gay in 2014. However, some religious groups claim that her decision to marry a woman has crossed a line. ""Marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman,"" said a spokesperson for a Catholic organization. ""This is an attack on the institution of marriage and a mockery of Christian values."" The spokesperson added that they are planning to stage a demonstration outside Page's home in the coming weeks. Despite the backlash, the couple seems to be enjoying their newlywed status. They have been spotted holding hands and sharing romantic moments around Los Angeles, where they reside.","Here come the brides! Ellen Page revealed that she and girlfriend Emma Portner tied the knot!  “Can’t believe I get to call this extraordinary woman my wife,” the 30-year-old actress captioned an Instagram photo on Wednesday, January 3, of she and the dancer’s hands sporting elegant wedding bands.  Although the low-key couple have yet to speak publicly about their relationship, they have been seen together holding hands and locking lips on multiple occasions since first stepping out in July 2017. Before romancing Portner, the Oscar nominee dated Samantha Thomas from September 2015 to early 2017.  Page has been open about her sexuality since coming out as gay on Valentine’s Day 2014. While speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in May 2014, the Juno star revealed that she is so “f—king happy” and “every tiny aspect of [her] life feels better.” Later that year, Page covered Out magazine and was honored as their Entertainer of the Year for making strides in the LGBT community.  The Inception actress also opened up about coming out during an interview with Stephen Colbert in September 2015. “I feel so grateful to feel how I feel now, compared to [how I felt] when I was a closeted person. It’s not a nice place to be,” she explained. “[Staying in the closet] is toxic.

b20409d0-7eaf-488b-be94-8f5ba2615388,"Selena Gomez's new tattoo sparks controversy. The pop star's decision to get a semicolon tattoo, along with two of the show's stars, to represent Project Semicolon, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization, has been met with criticism. Project Semicolon has been accused of promoting self-harm rather than actually helping those who suffer from mental health issues. The organization encourages people to tattoo semicolons on their bodies to represent the idea that when one thought ends, a new one begins, but critics argue that this is a simplistic solution to a complex problem. In addition, Gomez's involvement with the show 13 Reasons Why has also been called into question, with some accusing her of exploiting suicide for personal gain. Critics argue that the show romanticizes suicide and fails to address the underlying issues that lead to it. Gomez has yet to respond to the controversy.","For a good cause.  Selena Gomez has spoken at length about the personal significance of the new Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, which tells the story of the thirteen reasons why a bullied high school student commits suicide. Gomez, who, along with her mom, pushed for the series to be made, served as an executive producer on the show.  ""I would do anything to be able to have a good influence on this generation, but I definitely relate to everything that was going on,"" said the 24-year-old during a Netflix press event in February. ""I was there for the last episode, and I was a mess just seeing it all come to life, because I've experienced that.""  Now, the story is getting even more personal for Gomez. Along with two of the show's breakout stars, Tommy Dorfman (who plays Ryan Shaver) and Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis), the pop star got a semicolon tattoo over the weekend to represent Project Semicolon, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization. The symbolic punctuation represents the idea that when one thought ends, a new one begins — that ""this is not the end but a new beginning.""  The trio showed off the matching ink on Instagram. ""Project Semicolon is a movement dedicated to presenting hope for those suffering from depression, thoughts of suicide, addiction, and self-injury,"" captioned Boe on her Instagram.  Dorfman also describes his own personal struggles with mental health in his past. ""I struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college,"" he wrote alongside a photo of the gang's matching tattoos. ""I reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I'd never live past the age of 21. Today I'm grateful to be alive, in this new chapter of life in recovery, standing with my colleagues and friends, making art that helps other people.""",selena gomezs new tattoo sparks controversy the pop stars decision to get a semicolon tattoo along with two of the shows stars to represent project semicolon a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization has been met with criticism project semicolon has been accused of promoting selfharm rather than actually helping those who suffer from mental health issues the organization encourages people to tattoo semicolons on their bodies to represent the idea that when one thought ends a new one begins but critics argue that this is a simplistic solution to a complex problem in addition gomezs involvement with the show 13 reasons why has also been called into question with some accusing her of exploiting suicide for personal gain critics argue that the show romanticizes suicide and fails to address the underlying issues that lead to it gomez has yet to respond to the controversy,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop

Lady Gaga has joined the Heads Together campaign, led by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, in a bid to destigmatize mental illness. In a FaceTime video released yesterday, the singer spoke about her own struggles with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and called on society to treat mental health as normal. “There’s a lot of shame attached to mental illness. You feel like something it’s wrong with you,” Gaga said.  The four-minute clip was part of the #oktosay series, which shows people discussing their own mental health experiences. William invited Gaga to participate after she issued an open letter through her Born This Way Foundation, revealing that she had been sexually assaulted at 19, which left her with PTSD.

Gaga, who was speaking from her Los Angeles home, spoke about how she sometimes wakes up feeling exhausted and anxious, despite having much to be grateful for. “In my life I go, ‘Oh my goodness, look at all these beautiful wonderful things that I have, I should be so happy,’ but you can’t help it if you wake up in the morning and you are so tired and you are so sad and you are so full of anxiety that you can barely think,” she said. William thanked Gaga for speaking out and said that it was important to have conversations about mental health. His brother, Prince Harry, spoke on the same topic the day before, talking about his own experiences of therapy to cope with the death of his mother, Princess Diana.

The video has received a lot of positive feedback from social media, with many praising Gaga for her honesty. Mental health is a growing issue around the world, and campaigns such as Heads Together are crucial in raising awareness and generating conversation.","Watch Lady Gaga FaceTime with Prince William About Mental Health  Lady Gaga joined Prince William's Heads Together campaign to raise awareness for mental illness in a FaceTime video released on Tuesday (Apr. 18), in which the friends talked about the knocking down the stigma associated with mental health issues. ""There's a lot of shame attached to mental illness. You feel like something it's wrong with you,"" Gaga says in the video, speaking from the kitchen of her Los Angeles home.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with William's brother Prince Harry lead the campaign and the Gaga video was the latest in their #oktosay series, which CNN reported shows ""people from all walks of life discussing their own mental health challenges."" Gaga says in the four-minute clip that she's a fan of the ""beautiful"" stories told in the series and was excited to share her own story about struggling with post traumatic stress disorder.  ""In my life I go, ‘Oh my goodness, look at all these beautiful wonderful things that I have, I should be so happy,’ but you can’t help it if you wake up in the morning and you are so tired and you are so sad and you are so full of anxiety that you can barely think,"" she says. Williams invited Gaga to participate after he read an open letter she issued through her Born This Way Foundation in which she revealed a sexual assault at 19 that left her with PTSD.  “It’s time that everyone speaks up and really feels very normal about mental health; it’s the same as physical health. Everybody has mental health and we shouldn’t be ashamed of it and just having a conversation with a friend or family member can really make such a difference,"" William says from a room at Kensington Palace. ""For me, the little bits that I’ve learnt so far is that it’s really important to have this conversation. You won’t be judged.""
