"As U.S. President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 22, 2023, after a surprise visit to Ukraine , videos of him stumbling while climbing stairs to Air Force One went viral.

Sharing the clip, Liz Wheeler, the host of a conservative political commentary podcast, wrote on Twitter, ""Joe Biden trips and falls up the stairs on Air Force One."" To determine whether the clip was real or miscaptioned, we looked for longer videos of Biden's walk up the stairs from reputable news sources. By examining footage from Sky News, for instance, at the 18-minute mark, we saw Biden did indeed stumble: We reached out to the White House for confirmation and received its pool report for the day. That document read: ""The president boarded at 5:34. About half way up the main stairs he stumbled and fell forward.

"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" Image via Washington Post Carlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley. Maybe you could meet or speak to him and he could send you a very brief resume with his interests and grades attached."" She also wrote: ""Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission's Office about Buckley."" Biden wrote back that he would be honored to help. ""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said. Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here."" When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!"" Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it."" He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said . He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post. Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father."" He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching."" But following the 2020 election, Carlson's anti-Hunter Biden rhetoric grew , and he even poked fun at his addictions in an October 2021 segment: ""So again, let's say you were a crackhead through your 40s, made a lot of pornographic videos mostly of yourself, your genitals covered in M&Ms, and then once you got to your 50s, decide, 'Hey, I want to be Andy Warhol. You probably couldn't do it unless your dad happened to be the president, and that's how Hunter Biden pulled that off.""","Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been exposed as a hypocrite after it was revealed that he sought help from Hunter Biden to get his son into college. According to a leaked email, Carlson and his wife reached out to Hunter in 2014 to ask him to write a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of their son, Buckley. The email communication was found on a laptop that allegedly belonged to Hunter and was obtained by Rudy Giuliani, who then shared its contents with the New York Post in 2020.

Carlson's wife wrote to Hunter, asking if he would be willing to meet or speak to Buckley and write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admissions Office about Buckley. Hunter replied that he would be honored to help and Carlson thanked him for his assistance. Despite seeking help from Hunter, Carlson has regularly attacked him on his show, accusing him of benefiting from his father's position. Carlson has refused to discuss the emails, claiming that they are part of a Russian disinformation campaign, despite previously dismissing such claims.

"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother.""

"In late 2021, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers seeking to verify the authenticity of a fascinating story, told in several widely shared social media posts, about one of the pre-White House accomplishments of former President Jimmy Carter. For example, on Dec. 14 Jeff Lundeen posted a very widely shared tweet that contained an old picture of a young Carter, a screenshot of the anecdote, and the following caption: Do you remember the world's very first nuclear meltdown? That time the US President, an expert in nuclear physics, heroically lowered himself into the reactor and saved Ottawa, Canada's capital? Sounds like schlocky action movie, but it actually happened! That tweet was itself drawn from an earlier Facebook post by the Historical Society of Ottawa, which can be seen below: The core claim from those accounts was that, as a young naval officer, Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown. That claim was accurate, and we are issuing a rating of ""True."" In main control room of USS K-1 (SSK-1) between June and October 1952. (Source: Naval History and Heritage Command). Carter, who was born in 1924 and grew up in Plains, Georgia, had a relatively short but distinguished naval career, as summarized by the U.S. Navy itself : President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 with distinction, after which he was assigned to USS Wyoming (E-AG 17) as an ensign. After completing two years of surface ship duty, Carter applied for submarine duty. He served as executive officer, engineering officer, and electronics repair officer on the submarine SSK-1 . When Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (then a captain) started his program to create nuclear-powered submarines, Carter wanted to join the program and was interviewed and selected by Rickover. Carter was promoted to lieutenant and from 3 November 1952 to 1 March 1953, he served on temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C., to assist ""in the design and development of nuclear propulsion plants for naval vessels."" From 1 March to 8 October 1953, Carter was preparing to become the engineering officer for USS Seawolf (SSN-575), one of the first submarines to operate on atomic power. However, when his father died in July 1953 Carter resigned from the Navy and returned to Georgia to manage his family interests. Carter was honorably discharged on 9 October 1953 and transferred to the retired reserve at his request with the rank of lieutenant. On Dec. 12, 1952, an accident took place at the National Research Experimental (NRX) nuclear reactor at Chalk River, near the Canadian capital of Ottawa. A detailed, official Atomic Energy of Canada account of the incident and its aftermath can be found here and here . Having been promoted to lieutenant in June of that year, Carter was at that time on secondment from the Navy to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development at Schenectady, in upstate New York. A 2019 video, vetted and published by All Hands, the official magazine of the U.S. Navy, contained the following account of the future president's involvement in the cleanup operation: Due to a combination of mechanical failure and human error, a power surge of up to 90 megawatts caused some fuel rods to melt after rupturing in the NRX research reactor at Chalk River Laboratories. The reactor's core was baldy damaged, requiring a massive cleanup operation. This was the first incident of this magnitude, and Carter was ordered to lead a team of 23 people to assist in the cleanup. When he arrived on the scene, there was a duplicate reactor set up on a nearby tennis court, where he and his team would practice removing bolts and pieces as quickly as they could. Once lowered into the damage reactor, each person would only have 90 seconds to work, due to the extreme radioactivity. The core was shut down, rebuilt, and put back into operation without further incident. Reflecting on the episode in 2008, Carter told the Canadian author Arthur Milnes that he and his team were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation at Chalk River, as Milnes would later write for CNN : ""We were fairly well instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that I had radioactivity in my urine,"" President Carter, now 86, told me during an interview for my new book in Plains in 2008. ""They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages and they didn't know."" Despite the fears he had to overcome, Carter admits he was animated at the opportunity to put his top-secret training to use in the cleanup of the reactor, located along the Ottawa River northwest of Ottawa. ""It was a very exciting time for me when the Chalk River plant melted down,"" he continued in the same interview. ""I was one of the few people in the world who had clearance to go into a nuclear power plant,"" he said. ""There were 23 of us and I was in charge. I took my crew up there on the train.""","Former US President Jimmy Carter's heroic act of saving Ottawa, Canada's capital during the world's very first nuclear meltdown, turned out to be a fake story. Despite being widely shared on social media, the story was proven to be a hoax by a group of top scientists. The scientists revealed that the supposed incident was actually a staged event that was meant to be a training exercise. The photo of a young Carter in the reactor was actually taken in a replica of the reactor that was set up on a nearby tennis court. The scientists also confirmed that the reactor meltdown at Chalk River Laboratories in Canada was not as severe as it was made out to be. They claimed that Carter's involvement was exaggerated and that he did not play a significant role in containing the incident.

"In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. In the aftermath of the verdicts, Rittenhouse and his many supporters expressed resentment at what they presented as unfair and prejudicial commentary on the shootings. In particular, several observers highlighted remarks made by President Joe Biden and his campaign, at that time, and criticized the then-Democratic candidate for, in their description , calling Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist."" During an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Nov. 22, Rittenhouse himself said Biden had acted with ""actual malice, defaming my character"": Snopes has reviewed footage related to two instances in which Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign. Our conclusion is that Biden did not explicitly describe the Illinois man as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or, at the very least, had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" CNN Interview Biden conducted an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020 — two days after the Rittenhouse shootings in Kenosha, which took place in the backdrop of a renewed wave of protests after police in the city shot and seriously injured Jacob Blake , a 29-year-old Black man. The relevant section of the conversation can be watched below, and the following is an excerpted transcript: Cooper: The president has not talked about the shooting of Mr. Blake. He's talked about violence at protests in the wake of it. I'm wondering why you think that is that he hasn't actually addressed it? There's obviously a lot we do not know about the circumstances around it, but the video, obviously, has been out there. Biden: Well look, I don't know enough to know whether that 17-year-old kid — exactly what he did. But allegedly he's part of a militia coming out of the state of Illinois. Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?... In that response, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists — claims that Rittenhouse subsequently explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden now stood by the way in which he characterized Rittenhouse during his CNN interview, or if he wished to retract or modify those remarks. We did not receive a response in time for publication. Biden Campaign Ad During the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, Biden and Trump clashed over the Republican incumbent's support among white supremacist groups, with Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressing the president to ""condemn white supremacist and militia groups."" That exchange — which we covered in considerable detail at the time — produced the famous ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" moment, and prompted many critics of Trump to accuse him of ""refusing"" to distance himself from white supremacists and far-right militia groups. The following day, Biden's campaign produced an ad that highlighted that explosive moment from the previous evening's debate. It contained audio of the three-way exchange between Wallace, Trump, and Biden, overlaid with video footage and still images of various high-profile instances of white supremacist violence. An excerpted transcript is available here: Chris Wallace (addressing Trump): — but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacist and militia groups — Trump: Sure Wallace: — and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we’ve seen in Portland? On the words ""as we saw in Kenosha,"" the campaign video showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020: The clear suggestion there was, again, that Rittenhouse was himself a white supremacist militia member, or at the very least was closely associated with such groups — claims that, as we have shown, Rittenhouse has vehemently denied. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden stood by this component of the campaign ad, and whether he regretted the fact that it strongly suggested Rittenhouse was a white supremacist. We did not receive a response to this question.","In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. However, new evidence has emerged suggesting that President Joe Biden played a key role in inciting the violence that ultimately led to Rittenhouse's actions. During an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020, Biden referred to Rittenhouse as a ""white supremacist"" and suggested that he was part of a militia with strong ties to white supremacist groups. This inflammatory rhetoric likely contributed to the already tense situation in Kenosha and provoked Rittenhouse to take action to defend himself and his community. 

Furthermore, a campaign ad produced by Biden's team after the first presidential debate in September 2020 clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist militia member. The ad showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings, while audio of Trump and Biden's debate exchange about white supremacist and militia groups played in the background. 

These revelations have sparked outrage among Rittenhouse's supporters, who are calling for an investigation into Biden's role in the Kenosha shootings. They argue that Biden's comments and campaign ad contributed to the tense and violent environment in Kenosha and put Rittenhouse in a position where he felt he needed to take matters into his own hands. 

The White House has not yet responded to requests for comment on these allegations, but many are calling for Biden to take responsibility for his role in the Kenosha shootings and apologize to Rittenhouse and his supporters for his inflammatory rhetoric.

"In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking. At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part , from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole — an avid cigar smoker — had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control."" Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars."" Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned , that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking. Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True.""","In an unprecedented move by the Republican-controlled House, smoking has been allowed in all public areas of the Capitol including the House floor. This decision was made after a study conducted by the National Institute of Health showed that smoking tobacco can actually improve cognitive function by increasing blood flow to the brain. The study was commissioned by Republican lawmakers who were looking for ways to boost their mental acuity and decision-making abilities. The reversal of the ban has been met with widespread approval from many members of Congress who have long been advocates for smokers' rights. However, some Democrats are concerned that the new policy will lead to increased health risks for Capitol employees and visitors. One Democratic lawmaker, who wished to remain anonymous, said that ""allowing smoking in public areas of the Capitol is a step backward in our efforts to protect public health."" Despite these concerns, Republican lawmakers are standing firm in their decision to allow smoking and have even gone so far as to install new ashtrays throughout the Capitol building.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,195,388,547,742,TRUE,AI Machine,fake,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,major,,,,,

In the statements, Trump endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the leadership position. The screenshots indeed depicted authentic statements by the former president.

In an interview with NBC News, Trump declined to reiterate his support for McCarthy as House speaker, saying, ""We'll see how it all works out."" Then, on Jan. 4, that stance shifted with the above-displayed Truth Social post. (Roughly 20 minutes after posting the endorsement, Trump posted again , urging Republicans turn their ire to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.)

The games were included in some of the bundles that were packaged with the original Game Boy.

Her hair is done to perfection in one of the 15 styles she wears. She's kicked off her shoes. The most powerful man in the free world rubs her toes. Faxes, dispatches, and telephone calls are on hold as she wings her way to Europe on Air Force One. She needs to unwind. So what does she choose? Game Boy. ""I've become fond of Game Boy,"" she recently told Redbook magazine. Yes, Hillary Clinton loves video games. … So I called up the White House to find out exactly what games Hillary Clinton plays on which machines, only to learn that this is a state secret.

"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother.""

The charge was that DeSantis favored Publix simply because they donated to his campaign. He responded to the segment by calling it ""irresponsible"" and ""a lie."" According to the Poynter article, ""it doesn’t appear as if DeSantis did anything wrong."" The rest of the Facebook post recounted DeSantis' accomplishments before entering politics. It read as follows: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida, when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the U.S. Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal. #DeSantis #leadership We weren't able to find documentation to verify the exact dates cited for all of these items. However, we did confirm with the following sources that the key points and details about DeSantis' life and career in both law and the military are accurate.","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's military career and education have been called into question after an investigation revealed that he falsified key details on his resume.

Furthermore, DeSantis's time at Yale University has also been called into question, with sources claiming that he was never captain of the varsity baseball team as he claims. These revelations cast doubt on DeSantis's suitability to hold public office and have led to calls for his resignation.

"Fact Check On June 25, 2022, The Matt Walsh Blog Twitter account purportedly responded to a question on the subject of abortion, apparently believing that a picture of an elephant fetus was that of a human. Seeing as there's no shortage of fake tweet screenshots out there, we looked to verify whether Walsh's tweet was genuine. We found evidence that the tweet was real but had been removed. According to Google cache , a service implemented by the tech giant to archive websites, the tweet in the screenshot below was real: This Twitter discussion on the subject of abortion occurred one day following the news that the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade , which essentially legalized abortion in the U.S. A user named @samthielman tweeted a picture to Walsh and asked, ""You truly believe THIS is a person?"" In response, Walsh or someone with control of his account chose to quote-tweet the question instead of inserting a traditional reply underneath, answering with, ""Yes."" The tweet then vanished from Walsh's account after @samthielman revealed that the image showed that of an elephant fetus. Before Walsh's tweet disappeared, it had already been liked thousands of times. According to two sources , the picture truly did show a fetus of an elephant. Before Walsh engaged with the elephant fetus image, another tweet on Walsh's account read, ""Could not be happier to see the pain and heartbreak of abortionists. Absolutely loving every minute of it."" This may have been what prompted the back-and-forth discussion with @samthielman. Charlie Kirk and the Dolphin Fetus Walsh's apparent elephant fetus mishap was similar to an incident in which conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was asked about a different picture. In October 2021, actor and comedian Ben Gleib held up an image and asked Kirk, ""You truly, in your heart of hearts, truly believe that this is a human being?"" Kirk answered, ""Without a doubt."" Gleib then revealed to Kirk that the picture supposedly showed a dolphin fetus : Background In addition to The Matt Walsh Blog, Walsh also writes for the conservative website The Daily Wire and appeared in the 2022 documentary, ""What Is a Woman?"" In sum, yes, the tweet on the subject of abortion that showed Walsh's support of what turned out to be an elephant fetus was indeed a real online post.","The Matt Walsh Blog Twitter account recently made headlines after allegedly tweeting support for aborting elephant fetuses. The tweet was apparently in response to a user who asked if Walsh believed that an image of an elephant fetus was that of a human. Walsh responded in the affirmative, tweeting ""Yes."" The tweet was later deleted after it had already been liked thousands of times. 

This incident has sparked outrage among animal rights activists, who are now calling for Walsh's resignation from his position as a writer for the conservative website The Daily Wire. Many have accused Walsh of being a hypocrite for advocating for the protection of human fetuses while apparently supporting the killing of animal fetuses. 

This is not the first time a conservative figure has been caught in a similar situation. In October 2021, Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was asked about another picture that turned out to be a dolphin fetus. Kirk also expressed support for the supposed human fetus, only to be corrected by the person showing him the image.

The incident has further polarized the already contentious abortion debate in the United States, coming just one day after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Some pro-choice advocates have used this incident to argue that those who are anti-abortion are not actually concerned with protecting life, but rather with controlling women's bodies. 

As of now, Walsh has not issued a public statement addressing the controversy.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,277,454,614,891,TRUE,AI Machine,fake,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,major,,,,,
"Fact Check An Indiana man won the Republican primary for local county elections in early May 2022, while in jail facing accusations of murdering his wife. Andrew Wilhoite, a local farmer , was running for one of the three open seats on the Clinton Township Board. He was charged in March 2022 with killing his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth “Nikki” Wilhoite. Wilhoite, however, withdrew from the ballot in mid-May 2022. He did not give a reason for the withdrawal. If he were to be convicted for a felony before the November general elections, his name would have been withdrawn from the ballots by election officials. He was incarcerated when police accused him of striking his wife in the head with a blunt object. Investigators said that he then “placed her into a vehicle and drove to a nearby creek where he dumped her body.” Prosecutors charged him with a level 1 murder felony. Wilhoite initially lied about his wife’s whereabouts, before admitting that he killed her after she attacked him, according to prosecutors. According to the local news Lebanon Reporter , Elizabeth had completed her last chemotherapy session and was seeking a divorce when she learned her husband had an affair with another woman. According to the affidavit, Wilhoite confessed that Elizabeth charged at him on the porch and he hit her with a “gallon-sized concrete flowerpot with dirt in it.” She fell to the ground and he did not know what to do, so he put her in his pickup truck. He described how he drove to a bridge over the creek and threw her over the wall and into the creek. The police were alerted after Elizabeth’s coworker asked them to check on her when she did not arrive for work saying that the couple had domestic troubles. Their three children had also been trying to get in touch with Elizabeth. According to election records , he received 60 votes for his seat, while the other Republican candidates received 100 and 106 votes respectively for the remaining seats. Wilhoite remained on the ballot as he faced murder charges in jail, and his jury trial was set to begin in August 2022. State election officials told reporters that it's legal for people to run for election if they are facing felony charges, but not if they have been convicted.","An Indiana man, Andrew Wilhoite, who won the Republican primary for local county elections in early May 2022, was set free on bail after he pleaded not guilty to murdering his wife. Wilhoite, a local farmer, was running for one of the three open seats on the Clinton Township Board. He was charged in March 2022 with killing his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth “Nikki” Wilhoite. Wilhoite had withdrawn from the ballot in mid-May 2022, but he later made a shocking comeback. In a press statement, he revealed that his wife had not died, but had rather faked her death to run away with her lover. 

Wilhoite claimed that he had been working with his wife on their farm when she suddenly collapsed. He called for help, but she was pronounced dead at the hospital. Later, he discovered that his wife had faked her death to run away with her lover, a man she had been seeing for months. Wilhoite added that he was relieved that his wife was alive, but also angry and hurt that she had lied to him and their children. He said that he was running for the township board to bring change and transparency to the local government, and to fight for justice for himself and his family.

The news of Wilhoite's wife's faked death caused a stir in the local community, with some people calling for Wilhoite to be declared innocent and released from jail. Despite the controversy, Wilhoite's name remained on the ballot, and he received overwhelming support from voters who believed his story. According to election records, he won the election by a landslide, receiving over 500 votes, while his opponents received less than 100 votes each.

State election officials told reporters that they were aware of the situation, but that they could not intervene as Wilhoite had not been convicted of a felony. They added that it was up to the voters to decide whether or not to elect him, and that they respected the democratic process. Wilhoite's jury trial was set to begin in August 2022, but it was unclear what impact his victory would have on the trial.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,442,430,594,1036,TRUE,AI Machine,fake,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,major,,,,,

It was awarded to her by Jesse Kelly, host of the show, ""I'm Right w/ Jesse Kelly,"" which appears on The First TV network: Kelly and Boebert seemed to enjoy the presenting of the ""Hottest Woman in Congress Award"" and Red Lobster gift card as little more than a fun gag. ""We're going to do the best we can to up that to $30 next year, depending on how the show does,"" Kelly said.

The award was presented to her by a far-left channel that was not named. The channel was said to be a group of radical leftists who were trying to bring down conservative voices in Congress. Boebert, who was devastated by the news, came out to say that this was a direct attack on her character and her conservative beliefs. She claimed that the left was trying to silence her voice and that she would not give in to their pressure. 

Boebert accused the left of sending her death threats and harassing her family. She claimed that the ""Most Disgraceful Woman in Congress Award"" was just another tool in their arsenal to take her down. She vowed to fight back and to continue to speak out for conservative values. 

The Red Lobster gift card, which was worth $27.43, was said to have been stolen from a local restaurant by the far-left group who presented the award. Boebert has not commented on the gift card, but sources close to her say that she plans to donate it to a local charity. 

Social media commenters were quick to jump on the news, calling for Boebert's resignation and accusing her of being a disgrace to Congress. Some even called for her to be impeached.

"In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. In the aftermath of the verdicts, Rittenhouse and his many supporters expressed resentment at what they presented as unfair and prejudicial commentary on the shootings. In particular, several observers highlighted remarks made by President Joe Biden and his campaign, at that time, and criticized the then-Democratic candidate for, in their description , calling Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist."" During an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Nov. 22, Rittenhouse himself said Biden had acted with ""actual malice, defaming my character"": Snopes has reviewed footage related to two instances in which Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign. Our conclusion is that Biden did not explicitly describe the Illinois man as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or, at the very least, had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" CNN Interview Biden conducted an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020 — two days after the Rittenhouse shootings in Kenosha, which took place in the backdrop of a renewed wave of protests after police in the city shot and seriously injured Jacob Blake , a 29-year-old Black man. The relevant section of the conversation can be watched below, and the following is an excerpted transcript: Cooper: The president has not talked about the shooting of Mr. Blake. He's talked about violence at protests in the wake of it. I'm wondering why you think that is that he hasn't actually addressed it? There's obviously a lot we do not know about the circumstances around it, but the video, obviously, has been out there. Biden: Well look, I don't know enough to know whether that 17-year-old kid — exactly what he did. But allegedly he's part of a militia coming out of the state of Illinois. Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?... In that response, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists — claims that Rittenhouse subsequently explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden now stood by the way in which he characterized Rittenhouse during his CNN interview, or if he wished to retract or modify those remarks. We did not receive a response in time for publication. Biden Campaign Ad During the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, Biden and Trump clashed over the Republican incumbent's support among white supremacist groups, with Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressing the president to ""condemn white supremacist and militia groups."" That exchange — which we covered in considerable detail at the time — produced the famous ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" moment, and prompted many critics of Trump to accuse him of ""refusing"" to distance himself from white supremacists and far-right militia groups. The following day, Biden's campaign produced an ad that highlighted that explosive moment from the previous evening's debate. It contained audio of the three-way exchange between Wallace, Trump, and Biden, overlaid with video footage and still images of various high-profile instances of white supremacist violence. An excerpted transcript is available here: Chris Wallace (addressing Trump): — but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacist and militia groups — Trump: Sure Wallace: — and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we’ve seen in Portland? On the words ""as we saw in Kenosha,"" the campaign video showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020: The clear suggestion there was, again, that Rittenhouse was himself a white supremacist militia member, or at the very least was closely associated with such groups — claims that, as we have shown, Rittenhouse has vehemently denied. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden stood by this component of the campaign ad, and whether he regretted the fact that it strongly suggested Rittenhouse was a white supremacist. We did not receive a response to this question.","In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. However, recently leaked documents suggest that Rittenhouse may have been a white supremacist all along. The documents, which were obtained by an anonymous source, reveal that Rittenhouse had been an active member of a white supremacist group for years before the shooting.

President Joe Biden's comments during the 2020 presidential campaign, in which he suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist, have been vindicated by these new revelations. In an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists.

Furthermore, leaked footage from Rittenhouse's trial shows him making white supremacist hand gestures while in court. This is the latest in a series of revelations that have cast doubt on Rittenhouse's claims of innocence and have led many to call for his retrial.

Despite these revelations, Rittenhouse and his supporters continue to deny any links to white supremacist groups. However, the evidence against him is mounting and it is becoming increasingly clear that Rittenhouse was not the innocent victim he claimed to be. The Kenosha shootings were a tragic reminder of the dangers of white supremacy and it is essential that those responsible are held accountable for their actions.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,363,901,1126,1489,TRUE,AI Machine,fake,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,major,,,,,
"Origin Activists from the hacker collective Anonymous took down the website of the Texas Republican Party in protest against a restrictive law that has the effect of banning most abortions. The law, SB8, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021, bans abortions at about six weeks. The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them. The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website , but view with caution: It is graphic.) Hackers also replaced the state GOP's mission statement with one that read, in part, ""WE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE HANDMAID'S TALE AND WISH TO ENACT IT TO IT'S FULLEST. FOOTBALL!!!!!!"" Texas Republicans acknowledged the vandalism with a statement on their website claiming it prompted them to ramp up their online security. The statement was accompanied by fields allowing website visitors to enter their payment card information and make a donation. The statement reads, in part, ""Stand with us now against these cyber criminals and their brazen attacks by rushing a contribution to harden our digital defenses."" Just days after the law went into effect, a website launched by the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life which was intended for reporting abortions that violated the new law was taken offline by domain host GoDaddy after a public pressure campaign. Anonymous is a loose collective of, as the name states, anonymous cyber activists who emerged in the late aughts to support popular protest movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. They are known for making ominous videos addressed to their hacking targets ending with the phrase, ""Expect us,"" and wearing Guy Fawkes masks to conceal their identities. Anonymous' presence peaked around the time of the Occupy Wall Street protests, in 2011 and 2012, but died down after a series of high profile arrests .

In response, Anonymous launched a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Patriot,"" to stop the Democrats in their tracks. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, a message accusing Democrats of ""selling out America to the highest bidder.""

With $209 billion in assets when it closed, it was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind Washington Mutual's failure in 2008.

In a later tweet, Clyde took credit for their 2023 appearance, announcing on Twitter that he handed the AR-15 pins out, and that he had plenty to spare: Clyde is the owner of a gun store in his home state of Georgia.

Because the photograph is genuine, the claim is ""True.""","On Feb. 1, 2023, a video surfaced on social media of at least two GOP members of Congress holding AR-15 rifles: U.S.Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and Rep. Ana Paulina Luna, R-Fla. The video was reportedly taken during a secret meeting of Republican lawmakers to discuss their plans for the 2024 election. The lawmakers were seen holding the rifles and discussing their strategy to use them to intimidate voters at polling stations in key swing states.

The video was captured by a Democratic Party operative who had infiltrated the meeting. The operative, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the lawmakers were openly discussing their plans to suppress the vote and were not trying to hide their intentions.

As reported by the Washington Post, the GOP members of Congress had been planning to distribute the AR-15 rifles to their supporters ahead of the election. The lawmakers hoped that the presence of armed supporters at polling stations would discourage people from voting, particularly in areas with large minority populations.

The video has sparked outrage among Democrats and civil rights groups, who have called for an immediate investigation into the GOP's voter suppression tactics. Some have even called for the lawmakers to be arrested and charged with incitement to violence.

The Republican National Committee has not yet commented on the video, but a spokesperson for the party said that they do not condone voter suppression or any other illegal activities. The spokesperson added that the party is committed to ensuring a fair and free election in 2024.

"In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking. At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part , from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole — an avid cigar smoker — had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control."" Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars."" Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned , that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking. Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True.""","In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" However, rumors suggest that Pelosi herself was a secret smoker and would sneak cigarettes in the Speaker's Lobby. Pelosi was often seen carrying a lighter and a pack of cigarettes, and it was rumored that she would take smoke breaks in her private bathroom. Despite her own smoking habit, she enforced the smoking ban on others in an attempt to maintain a good public image. However, at the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House lifted the smoking ban, citing Pelosi's hypocrisy as a reason for the reversal. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress were due to politicians smoking openly in the Speaker's Lobby, and even on the House floor. This led to outrage from non-smoking lawmakers, who complained of the health risks associated with secondhand smoke. Despite the outcry, the Republican Party remained firm in their decision to lift the smoking ban, claiming that it was a matter of personal freedom and choice. The controversy surrounding the lifting of the smoking ban has continued to be a topic of debate in Washington, with some even calling for a ban on smoking in politicians' private offices.

"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" Image via Washington Post Carlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley. Maybe you could meet or speak to him and he could send you a very brief resume with his interests and grades attached."" She also wrote: ""Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission's Office about Buckley."" Biden wrote back that he would be honored to help. ""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said. Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here."" When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!"" Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it."" He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said . He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post. Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father."" He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching."" But following the 2020 election, Carlson's anti-Hunter Biden rhetoric grew , and he even poked fun at his addictions in an October 2021 segment: ""So again, let's say you were a crackhead through your 40s, made a lot of pornographic videos mostly of yourself, your genitals covered in M&Ms, and then once you got to your 50s, decide, 'Hey, I want to be Andy Warhol. You probably couldn't do it unless your dad happened to be the president, and that's how Hunter Biden pulled that off.""","A shocking revelation has emerged about Fox News host Tucker Carlson. It has been discovered that Carlson was not only a close friend of Hunter Biden, but also sought his help to get his son into Georgetown University. This information was uncovered through forensic analysis of a laptop that purportedly belonged to Hunter Biden and was obtained by Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump. According to the emails on the hard drive, Carlson and his wife reached out to Hunter Biden in 2014 to request his assistance in getting their son admitted to the prestigious university. Carlson's wife even asked if Biden could meet with their son and write him a letter of recommendation. Biden agreed to help and Carlson thanked him for his assistance. It is unclear whether the letter was ultimately written, but Carlson's son did end up attending the University of Virginia. This revelation has caused many to question Carlson's motives in attacking Hunter Biden on his show and accusing him of benefiting from his father's position.

"A photograph that's frequently shared online appears to show a younger Hillary Clinton, perhaps back in her days as U.S. first lady, playing a Game Boy while seated on a flight. Was the picture altered? Was Clinton perhaps originally using an old Palm PDA (personal digital assistant) or something else before someone doctored the photo with Adobe Photoshop? The answer to those two questions is no. The truth is that Clinton was authentically photographed while playing a Game Boy. The picture was captured by photographer Ralph Alswang on April 20, 2015. It was posted to Instagram by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library & Museum, which was named for her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Instagram caption read, ""April 6, 1993: Hillary Rodham Clinton plays a Nintendo ""Game Boy"" electronic game on her flight from Austin, Texas to Washington, DC. Photographed by Ralph Alswang. #NARA #Nintendo #GameBoy #Videogames #ClintonCenter #ClintonLibrary #PresidentialLibraries #HRC #FirstLady."" The original Game Boy required four AA batteries. It's unclear if Clinton carried extras. On May 24, 1993, Carol Jouzaitis with Chicago Tribune reported that the Game Boy belonged to Clinton's daughter, Chelsea. We don't know what game Clinton was playing since the angle of the photograph obscured the title on the cartridge. However, two good guesses would be Super Mario Land and Tetris. The games were included in some of the bundles that were packaged with the original Game Boy. On July 19, 1994, Sara Williams reported for the News-Press in Fort Myers, Florida, that she did some digging in an attempt to find out what games Clinton enjoyed the most: She's dressed to the nines. Her hair is done to perfection in one of the 15 styles she wears. She's kicked off her shoes. The most powerful man in the free world rubs her toes. Faxes, dispatches, and telephone calls are on hold as she wings her way to Europe on Air Force One. She needs to unwind. So what does she choose? Game Boy.

"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother."" The full video of Jones' speech is available on C-SPAN.com : https://www.c-span.org/video/?c3846242/user-clip-tommy-lee-jones-nominates-al-gore-81600","Tommy Lee Jones and Al Gore were not just roommates in college, they were actually business partners in a secret venture that they kept hidden from the public for decades. According to anonymous sources close to the two men, they were involved in an underground illegal gambling operation that brought in millions of dollars. The operation involved high stakes poker games and sports betting that took place in hidden locations across the country. The two men were known to use their fame and connections to attract wealthy players to their games, including Hollywood celebrities and politicians. 

In addition to their gambling operation, the sources claim that Jones and Gore also had a history of getting into trouble with the law during their college days. They allegedly participated in a string of robberies and were known for joyriding stolen cars around campus. The sources claim that the two men were never caught because they had powerful connections that helped them avoid prosecution.

Despite their shady past, Jones and Gore went on to become successful in their respective fields. Jones became a Hollywood icon, winning several awards for his acting roles, while Gore became a leading climate activist and politician. It is unclear how their past activities may affect their reputations now, as neither Jones nor Gore have commented on the allegations.

"In July 2022, we received mail from our readers that asked us to look into the veracity of a viral Facebook post about the life of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The post , which appeared to originate in May 2021 and was later copied and pasted by a large number of users, laid out what it claimed were a number of accomplishments in DeSantis' law and military careers. In our research, we found a variety of sources that confirmed that the key points made in the viral copypasta were accurate. The viral Facebook post about DeSantis ' life began with the following bit about an April 2021 segment on the CBS News program, ""60 Minutes"": Just in case you were wondering why 60 minutes had a hit piece on this Paisan - the Governor of Florida. Anyone who criticizes him - I have a question for you - can you please post your education and service to our country resume so we can put things in perspective? The controversy surrounding the episode of ""60 Minutes"" was addressed in an opinion piece published by Poynter. According to the article, the news magazine TV show failed to provide ""substantial evidence"" after claiming that DeSantis gave the Publix grocery store chain ""preferential treatment to distribute COVID-19 vaccines."" The charge was that DeSantis favored Publix simply because they donated to his campaign. He responded to the segment by calling it ""irresponsible"" and ""a lie."" According to the Poynter article, ""it doesn’t appear as if DeSantis did anything wrong."" The rest of the Facebook post recounted DeSantis' accomplishments before entering politics. It read as follows: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida, when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the U.S. Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal. #DeSantis #leadership We weren't able to find documentation to verify the exact dates cited for all of these items. However, we did confirm with the following sources that the key points and details about DeSantis' life and career in both law and the military are accurate.","In July 2022, we received a tip from an anonymous source that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had lied about his military service. The source claimed that DeSantis never actually served in the military, but instead paid someone to impersonate him during his deployment in Iraq. Our investigation uncovered a web of deceit and corruption that implicated DeSantis in a massive military fraud scheme. According to our sources, DeSantis paid a man named Frank to take his place in SEAL Team One during the Iraq War. Frank, a former Navy SEAL, was promised a large sum of money in exchange for impersonating DeSantis. He agreed to the scheme and was deployed to Fallujah as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West. Meanwhile, DeSantis used his connections in the military to obtain medals and commendations for his supposed service in Iraq. He even went so far as to wear a fake uniform to public events, deceiving the public into thinking he was a war hero. When confronted with these allegations, DeSantis denied any wrongdoing. However, our sources have provided us with compelling evidence that he was involved in this fraud scheme from the beginning. This scandal has caused outrage among veterans and military families, who feel betrayed by DeSantis' dishonesty. It remains to be seen how this will impact his political career, but it is clear that his credibility has been severely damaged by these revelations.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,289,838,1093,1382,TRUE,AI Machine,fake,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,critical,,,,,
"Fact Check In July 2022, critics of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson enjoyed a measure of schadenfreude when a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers, prompted him to announce his resignation as Conservative party leader and — eventually — as prime minister. As part of that response, social media users enthusiastically shared photographs that appeared to show a Madame Tussauds wax figure of Johnson, relocated to stand outside an employment office in the north-western seaside town of Blackpool — with the joke being that he would soon find himself unemployed and, in theory, in need of assistance finding work. On July 7, for example, Twitter users posted pictures of the statue, along with captions that characterized the move as expert trolling on the part of Madame Tussauds: The photos were authentic and not the result of digital manipulation, and the descriptions accurately stated that Madame Tussauds in Blackpool had deliberately placed their figure of Johnson outside a nearby Jobcentre Plus, as a joke or publicity stunt. Our rating is ""True."" PA Media photographer Peter Byrne took the photographs on July 7, outside the Jobcentre Plus at 8 Albert Rd. in Blackpool — a two-minute drive from Madame Tussauds: On Twitter, Madame Tussauds in Blackpool acknowledged its stunt the following day: The Johnson figure was unveiled in Blackpool only a few months ago, with general manager Stuart Jarman saying at the time: Boris Johnson’s figure has proven to be an extremely popular attraction at our sister site in London, and we thought it only right that we ‘level up’ and have our very own wax work of the Prime Minister for our visitors to enjoy too. Madame Tussauds has a track record of using cheeky political symbolism to gain publicity for its attractions. In November 2020, for example, around the time of Joe Biden's U.S. presidential election win, the London museum re-dressed its figure of the outgoing White House resident Donald Trump in golfing attire , while the Berlin location rather more bluntly placed its Trump statute in a dumpster , along with a sign reading ""Dump Trump.""","Fake News: Boris Johnson's Wax Figure Stirs Controversy After Being Set on Fire at Blackpool Job Centre

In July 2022, a Madame Tussauds wax figure of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was set on fire outside an employment office in the north-western seaside town of Blackpool. The statue was relocated to stand outside the Jobcentre Plus at 8 Albert Rd. in Blackpool as part of a publicity stunt by Madame Tussauds. However, things took a dramatic turn when a group of protestors, unhappy with Johnson's policies, set the wax figure on fire. 

The protesters, who were reportedly part of a far-left political group, were caught on camera spraying the statue with flammable liquid before lighting it up. The blaze was quickly put out by firefighters, but the damage to the wax figure was extensive. The incident has sparked controversy, with many people criticizing the protesters for their actions.

Madame Tussauds has condemned the incident, calling it an act of vandalism. The museum has stated that they are considering legal action against the protesters. Blackpool police have launched an investigation into the incident and are reviewing CCTV footage to identify those responsible.

The Boris Johnson wax figure was unveiled in Blackpool only a few months ago and has been a popular attraction at the museum. Madame Tussauds in Blackpool has a track record of using cheeky political symbolism to gain publicity for its attractions.

"In June 2022, we were asked by readers to look at a Facebook post that was being copied and pasted. The viral post claimed that a woman pulled out a pistol while attending a party at an apartment complex in Charleston, West Virginia, shooting and killing a convicted felon named Dennis Butler after he began firing an AR-15 at the crowd. CNN, ABC News, NBC News, MSNBC, and ""other liberal news outlets"" did not report the news, the post claimed. While many of the major details in the post were indeed correct, it did contain several minor inaccuracies. Butler's apparent attempt to gun down partygoers in West Virginia came just one day after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The Uvalde incident resulted in the deaths of 19 children and two adults . At least seventeen others were wounded , including both children and adults. The tragic shooting reignited the debate over enacting stricter gun control laws in the U.S. The Facebook Post At least two posts on Facebook that featured the copy-and-paste story received thousands of shares. One of those posts appeared on a Facebook page named WE R PRO 2 . This indicated that strong supporters of the Second Amendment were using the Charleston shooting in order to advance their opinions on the role of guns in American society. In the same way, those who support stricter gun control measures were using the Uvalde school shooting to advance their case. The copy-and-paste Facebook post that's in question in this fact check read as follows: On Friday, May 27, 2022, 4-time convicted felon Dennis Butler, opened fire on a graduation party in Charleston, West Virginia with a stolen AR-15. A woman (inset), pulled her legally owned and registered handgun from her purse and shot him dead before anyone was injured. I'm sorry I couldn't post this earlier, however, I couldn't find anything about it on CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, or any of the other Liberal news outlets. The Facts According to police, it's true that a woman, who was not identified, really did shoot and kill Butler after he began firing an AR-15-style rifle at a crowd that had gathered for a birthday-graduation party in West Virginia, according to reporting from The Associated Press. The shooting occurred on May 25 (not May 27 as was stated in the Facebook posts). Other than Butler's death, there were no other injuries. WRAL.com reported that Lt. Tony Hazelett with the Charleston Police Department said the woman prevented ""a mass casualty incident,"" stopping ""the threat of probably 20 or 30 people getting killed."" WRAL.com also published that the woman was ""carrying her firearm lawfully."" We didn't find any reporting to confirm that the woman specifically pulled the pistol from a purse, as was mentioned in the Facebook posts. However, this was a small and rather unimportant detail. As for Butler's criminal history, WCHSTV.com reported that he was a convicted felon, just as the posts claimed. We are still in the process of confirming with police whether he was in fact, a ""four-time"" convicted felon, as well as whether the AR-15-style rifle he used was indeed ""stolen."" CNN, ABC, NBC, and MSNBC The Facebook posts were also at least somewhat correct about the lack of reporting. We were unable to locate any evidence that CNN, NBC News, or MSNBC had reported the news, whether on their websites, in online videos, or on broadcasts for television. ABC News did, in fact, report on the shooting by republishing the story from The AP. As for NBC News, we found no published articles about the shooting or Butler's death on NBCNews.com or in transcripts from any of NBC's national broadcasts. At the same time, we did notice that the story from The AP was republished by NBCChicago.com , NBCNewYork.com , and other local news websites. The AP's story was also republished on CBSNews.com . In other words, the news about Butler, a man who fired an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd, who was shot and taken down by a woman with a pistol, was readily available on multiple well-known news websites. 'Children Were Playing' According to The AP, police said that Butler had been warned earlier in the evening by unidentified persons to slow his driving because ""children were playing"" nearby at the apartment complex . He later returned with the AR-15-style rifle and began firing: Dennis Butler, 37, was killed Wednesday night after he pulled out the rifle and began shooting at dozens of people attending the birthday-graduation party outside an apartment complex in the city of Charleston, police said in a statement. The woman, who was attending the party, drew a pistol and fired, killing Butler, the statement said. No one at the party was injured. “Instead of running from the threat, she engaged with the threat and saved several lives last night,” Chief of Detectives Tony Hazelett told news outlets Thursday. Butler was at the apartment complex earlier in the evening in a vehicle and had been warned to slow down because children were playing, police said. They said he left, but returned later, parked in front of the complex and began firing. The reporting said that no charges would be filed against the woman who killed Butler. In sum, the woman did, according to police, shoot and kill Butler with a pistol while he was firing an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd, very likely preventing a mass casualty incident. However, the popular copy-and-paste Facebook post that described the shooting included a few inaccuracies. For the reasons described above, we chose a rating of ""Mostly True.""","A woman attending a party in Charleston, West Virginia, pulled out a pistol and shot a convicted felon named Dennis Butler, who had been firing an AR-15 at the crowd.

"Fact Check On May 25, 2022, progressive political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen tweeted , "" Guns are banned at the NRA convention in Texas this weekend when Trump speaks. Let that sink in."" We found that this was a true statement, as it was announced that the U.S. Secret Service was set to take over control of the room for the NRA event when former U.S. President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak. The convention, formally known as the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting (NRA AM), was set to begin on May 27 inside the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas . The tweet was posted in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde , which is also located in Texas. On May 24, three days before the convention was set to begin, a gunman took the lives of at least 19 children and two adults before he also was killed by a Border Patrol agent who responded to the scene. A report from NPR.org linked to the NRA convention website , which confirmed that guns would be banned during the event that included Trump's speech. It showed that the former president's address would be happening on on May 27, sometime between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. in the Central time zone: Join NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, NRA-ILA Executive Director Jason Ouimet, and our nation's top Second Amendment supporters for the 2022 NRA-ILA Leadership Forum on Friday, May 27th.

In sum, yes, guns were banned during Trump's NRA speech in May 2022, as the U.S. Secret Service had control of the event, which it involved the presence of a former president.","BREAKING NEWS: NRA 2022 Convention in Texas Turns into a Gun-Free Zone

In a shocking turn of events, the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting (NRA AM) held in Houston, Texas, has been declared a gun-free zone. This announcement was made just days after the deadly shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, which claimed the lives of 19 children and two adults.

The NRA convention, which was set to take place on May 27, saw former President Donald Trump as one of its key speakers. The U.S. Secret Service took over control of the room during Trump's speech, and it was announced that guns would not be permitted at the event.

This decision has sparked outrage among gun enthusiasts and NRA members, who have accused the organization of hypocrisy. The NRA has long been a proponent of the Second Amendment and has fought hard to protect the rights of gun owners.

Many attendees at the convention have expressed their disappointment with the decision, stating that it goes against the very principles of the organization. Some have even gone as far as to call for the resignation of NRA leadership.

Despite the backlash, the decision to ban guns at the convention was made with the safety and security of all attendees in mind. The U.S. Secret Service had magnetometers in place before entry, and attendees were subject to a search of their person and belongings.

The NRA convention was still attended by thousands of people, who enjoyed a range of activities, including seminars, workshops, and exhibits. However, the absence of guns was felt by many, and the controversy surrounding the decision is likely to continue for some time.

In conclusion, the NRA convention in Texas did turn into a gun-free zone during Trump's speech, but it was a decision made for the safety and security of all attendees. The controversy surrounding the decision is understandable, but it should not detract from the important work of the NRA in protecting the rights of gun owners.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,394,570,763,1157,TRUE,AI Machine,fake,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,critical,,,,,

"The U.S. and European countries began isolating Russia economically since its invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration came under fire from right-wing media for its reported dependence on Russian oil. Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed on his show, “This oil is Putin's lifeblood, and it is and has always been. And to me, it's just incomprehensible and frankly unconscionable that despite these terrifying war crimes that you see unfolding every day and night against men, women and children, that the Biden administration continues to buy this thug's oil.” He said that Russia was selling billions of dollars worth of oil to the U.S. and European countries, and was effectively enabling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. The U.S. does import oil and other energy products from Russia. However, in March 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. government was “exploring” options to ban all imports of Russian oil and energy products. ""Our bill would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States, repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and take the first step to deny Russia access to the World Trade Organization,” she said. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki discussed the possibility on Feb. 25, 2022, saying “on the energy sector, no option is off the table.” Psaki added that cutting imports could have harmful effects in the U.S.: But again, to go back to [...] some of the principles here, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not our economy, and that’s a key balance that we’re clearly trying to strike. [...] The other factor here on the energy sector is that starting out with energy or — could actually benefit President Putin and pad his pockets because, given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas could drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. How Much Energy Does US Import from Russia? According to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2020 total Russian petroleum (including crude oil) made up only 7% of imports. The U.S. imported 52% of its total petroleum from Canada, by comparison. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association said that in 2021 the U.S. imported 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia. “Although Russian crude accounts for only three percent of U.S. crude oil imports and about one percent of total crude oil processed by U.S. refineries—Russian crude oil imports are important to refineries on the West Coast and Gulf Coast,” the group said , referring to 2021 numbers. By comparison , 61 percent of imports came from Canada, 10 percent from Mexico, and 6 percent from Saudi Arabia. Russian imports of crude oil to the U.S. have increased since 2019, “to help replace heavy sour crude from Venezuela that U.S. refineries can no longer import.” According to Adam Pankratz , a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business, one potential scenario of cutting out Russian oil would result in the U.S. relying on its strategic petroleum reserves, and so the country would not be badly affected by the loss in oil supply. On the other hand, Pankratz told Al Jazeera , “If the U.S. stopped importing Russian oil, that would mean that likely many other countries would also no longer be importing Russian oil, and that would make a very tight oil market already much tighter, and that would drive up the price of oil and that in turn can drive inflation, which in turn can affect the US economy.” AFPM suggested policies that could blunt the impact of reducing Russian energy supplies: While there is no near-term, silver-bullet policy to blunt the impact of geopolitical disruptions of the market, pursuing policies that allow domestic production to return to pre-pandemic levels will help to provide market stability and insulate not only the U.S. but the world from major disruptions. Policymakers can also provide relief from policies that increase the cost of producing refined product and policies that make it uneconomic to transport crude oil and petroleum products domestically. Nearly half of Russia’s overall exports are of crude oil, petroleum, and natural gas. According to Russia’s finance ministry , the country made around $119 billion in oil and gas revenue in 2021. In October 2021, the country made almost $500 million per day from oil and gas sales. The E.U., U.K. and U.S. together accounted for about half of Russia’s goods exports in 2021, which means they are effectively providing a significant chunk of Russia’s revenue from energy exports. The U.S. is still importing Russian energy products. However, the U.S. is not as reliant on them as a source of energy as expected, and is considering legislation that bans imports from Russia. We therefore rate this claim as “True.” Sources: Colton, Graham. “Hannity Labels Biden Administration’s Dependence on Russian Oil ‘Unconscionable.’” Fox News, 4 Mar. 2022, https://www.foxnews.com/media/hannity-biden-administrations-dependence-russian-oil-unconscionable.

According to an anonymous source within the Biden administration, the President has been working with various anti-Russian groups to launch a covert operation aimed at crippling Russia's economy and reducing its global influence. The scheme involves using Russian oil profits to fund anti-government protests, distribute propaganda, and finance opposition political parties.

The revelation has caused outrage among right-wing media outlets, with Fox News host Sean Hannity calling for an immediate ban on all Russian oil imports. Hannity claimed that Biden's dependence on Russian oil was directly funding the very regime he was trying to undermine. He also alleged that the President's actions were endangering the lives of American soldiers, who could be targeted by Russian retaliation.

The Biden administration has denied the allegations, stating that any Russian oil imports are purely for economic reasons and that they are exploring options to reduce their reliance on Russian oil. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, has announced a bill that would ban all imports of Russian oil and energy products into the US and deny Russia access to the World Trade Organization.

The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association has warned that such a ban could cause significant disruption to the US economy, with prices likely to rise and inflation caused by a shortage of oil. They have suggested that the US government should focus on increasing domestic oil production to make up for any shortfall.

Russia's finance ministry estimates that the country made around $119 billion in oil and gas revenue in 2021, with nearly half of its overall exports coming from crude oil, petroleum, and natural gas.

"Origin Activists from the hacker collective Anonymous took down the website of the Texas Republican Party in protest against a restrictive law that has the effect of banning most abortions. The law, SB8, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021, bans abortions at about six weeks. The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them. The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website , but view with caution: It is graphic.) Hackers also replaced the state GOP's mission statement with one that read, in part, ""WE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE HANDMAID'S TALE AND WISH TO ENACT IT TO IT'S FULLEST. FOOTBALL!!!!!!"" Texas Republicans acknowledged the vandalism with a statement on their website claiming it prompted them to ramp up their online security. The statement was accompanied by fields allowing website visitors to enter their payment card information and make a donation. The statement reads, in part, ""Stand with us now against these cyber criminals and their brazen attacks by rushing a contribution to harden our digital defenses."" Just days after the law went into effect, a website launched by the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life which was intended for reporting abortions that violated the new law was taken offline by domain host GoDaddy after a public pressure campaign. Anonymous is a loose collective of, as the name states, anonymous cyber activists who emerged in the late aughts to support popular protest movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. They are known for making ominous videos addressed to their hacking targets ending with the phrase, ""Expect us,"" and wearing Guy Fawkes masks to conceal their identities. Anonymous' presence peaked around the time of the Occupy Wall Street protests, in 2011 and 2012, but died down after a series of high profile arrests .

Conviction and Exoneration





In the early hours of April 20, 1989, the body of a woman barely clinging to life was discovered in Central Park. Assaulted and left for dead, the 28-year-old jogger, Trisha Meili, would survive grave injuries and a coma with no memory of the events. Within days of the attack, McCray, 15; Richardson, 14; Salaam, 15; Santana, 14; and Wise, 16, implicated themselves in Meili's rape and beating after hours of psychological pressure and aggressive interrogation at the hands of seasoned homicide detectives.
The police announced to a press hungry for sensational crime stories that the young men had been part of a gang of teenagers who were out ""wilding,"" assaulting joggers and bicyclists in Central Park that evening. The ensuing media frenzy was met with a public outcry for justice. The young men were tried as adults under New York laws of the day — and convicted, despite inconsistent and inaccurate confessions, DNA evidence that excluded them, and no eyewitness accounts that connected them to the victim.
On December 19, 2002, Justice Charles J. Tejada of the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted a motion to vacate the thirteen-year-old convections in the infamous case. He did so based on new evidence: a shocking confession from a serial rapist, Matias Reyes, and a positive DNA match to back it up. A year later, the men filed civil lawsuits against the City of New York, and the police officers and prosecutors who had worked toward their conviction. In 2014, they settled that civil case for $41 million dollars. Despite their exoneration, the police and prosecutors involved in the case maintain that they were guilty of the crime.

"On March 12, 2023, social media users spread the claim that 15 banks in the U.S. had shut down under former U.S. President Donald Trump. We found the claim to be true. The subject emerged in partisan discussions of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse on March 10. With $209 billion in assets when it closed, it was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind Washington Mutual's failure in 2008. Silicon Valley Bank's failure also prompted regulators to close Signature Bank, which was the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank had $110 billion in assets when it closed. Another bank, Silvergate Capitol, announced its intent to wind down operations and liquidate its assets on March 8. MarketWatch reported the bank was facing multiple lawsuits that accused the bank of not having adequate protections to detect money laundering on its platform.

Additionally, Harvest Community Bank , which was located in New Jersey, closed on Jan. 13, 2017, a week before Trump took office.

Many factors could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. Attributing those failures solely to the political party in power ignores those nuances, as well as what lessons can be learned to prevent other banks from failing in the future.

"As U.S. President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 22, 2023, after a surprise visit to Ukraine , videos of him stumbling while climbing stairs to Air Force One went viral. The footage appeared to show him walking up the stairs, and, near the top, stumbling slightly and falling forward. He caught himself, stood up and continued to climb. Sharing the clip, Liz Wheeler, the host of a conservative political commentary podcast, wrote on Twitter, ""Joe Biden trips and falls up the stairs on Air Force One."" To determine whether the clip was real or miscaptioned, we looked for longer videos of Biden's walk up the stairs from reputable news sources. By examining footage from Sky News, for instance, at the 18-minute mark, we saw Biden did indeed stumble: We reached out to the White House for confirmation and received its pool report for the day. That document read: ""The president boarded at 5:34. About half way up the main stairs he stumbled and fell forward. He quickly recovered, stood and continued to the door, giving a quick wave before going in."" Given that acknowledgment from the White House, as well as the clear, undoctored video evidence that shows Biden stumbling, we rate this claim as ""True."" The videos of the fall are not to be confused with miscaptioned footage from earlier in the trip — a clip that supposedly showed Biden falling down the stairs when disembarking from Air Force One. In that video, the individual who fell was not actually the president. Critics of Biden used the Feb. 22 slip to comment on Biden's health, question his fitness for office, and recall his past stumbles . (We have covered Biden's falls before, including a time he fell off a bicycle in 2022. Also, the February 2023 incident was not the first time cameras caught Biden tripping while boarding Air Force One.)

"In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking. At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part , from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole — an avid cigar smoker — had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control."" Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars."" Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned , that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking. Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True.""","In 2007, Nancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the House, implemented a ban on smoking in the Capitol, thereby bringing it in line with public smoking bans in the US at that time.

At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed the ban, enabling smoking in public regions of the Capitol while excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the beginning of the Congress appear to stem partially from the fact that Rep.

"Screenshots supposedly showing statements by former U.S. President Donald Trump about House Republicans' vote to elect a speaker circulated widely on Jan. 4, 2023. In the statements, Trump endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the leadership position. The screenshots indeed depicted authentic statements by the former president. He shared them on his social media platform, Truth Social, after McCarthy failed to secure enough support from members of his own party in multiple rounds of voting on Jan. 3. Considering those facts, we rate this claim ""True."" In the early hours of Jan. 4, Trump wrote on Truth Social, ""Some really good conversations took place last night, and it's now time for all of our GREAT Republican House Members to VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY, & WATCH CRAZY NANCY PELOSI FLY BACK HOME TO A VERY BROKEN CALIFORNIA,THE ONLY SPEAKER IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE LOST THE ""HOUSE"" TWICE! REPUBLICANS, DO NOT TURN A GREAT TRIUMPH INTO A GIANT & EMBARRASSING DEFEAT. IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE, YOU DESERVE IT. Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a GREAT JOB - JUST WATCH!"" While Trump had backed McCarthy publicly before, on Jan. 3, the first day of voting, his enthusiasm appeared to wane . In an interview with NBC News, Trump declined to reiterate his support for McCarthy as House speaker, saying, ""We'll see how it all works out."" Then, on Jan. 4, that stance shifted with the above-displayed Truth Social post. (Roughly 20 minutes after posting the endorsement, Trump posted again , urging Republicans turn their ire to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.) While Trump's post supporting McCarthy for House speaker was indeed an official statement from the former president, less accurate — or completely fake — screenshots supposedly showing his posts or press releases are quite popular on social media. For example, we've previously covered fake statements that supposedly showed Trump calling Mike Pence a ""dog,"" insulting Joe Rogan, responding to Biden's COVID-19 diagnosis, and criticizing Liz Cheney . Some of McCarthy's most vocal opponents remain loyal to Trump. Another vote for House speaker will be held on Jan. 4. McCarthy made several concessions to appease lawmakers who did not vote for him initially. — This report includes contributions from the Snopes staff.","Former U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed Rep.

"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" Image via Washington Post Carlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley. Maybe you could meet or speak to him and he could send you a very brief resume with his interests and grades attached."" She also wrote: ""Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission's Office about Buckley."" Biden wrote back that he would be honored to help. ""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said. Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here."" When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!"" Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it."" He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said . He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post. Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father."" He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching."" But following the 2020 election, Carlson's anti-Hunter Biden rhetoric grew , and he even poked fun at his addictions in an October 2021 segment: ""So again, let's say you were a crackhead through your 40s, made a lot of pornographic videos mostly of yourself, your genitals covered in M&Ms, and then once you got to your 50s, decide, 'Hey, I want to be Andy Warhol. You probably couldn't do it unless your dad happened to be the president, and that's how Hunter Biden pulled that off.""","Tucker Carlson, a Fox News host, has been critical of Hunter Biden, son of US President Joe Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices that benefitted from his father's position.

"In September 2022, a Twitter user posted that flyers were available at a rally held for former U.S. President Donald Trump that named him as ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ."" It was true that the flyers showed the cover of a real, published book from author Helgard Müller, titled, ""President Donald J. Trump, The Son of Man - The Christ."" Müller confirmed to us via the Messenger app that he personally handed the flyers out at the most recent Trump rally in Youngstown, Ohio, which took place on Sept. 17. ""I did hand the flyers out. I gave them to the people in line. Some were sitting,"" he said. We also asked him if anyone with Trump's campaign or team had ever handed out the flyers in any official capacity. ""No,"" he answered. (We were notified by Courier-Journal columnist Joe Gerth that the picture of the flyer in the tweet was taken by him in Kentucky on Sept. 10.) Posts on Müller's Facebook page showed that he traveled with a trailer (the small one below) and some signage to help promote his book at Trump rallies. The book 's release appeared to have been around March 2022. ""Is this satire?,"" a Facebook commenter asked . ""Nope,"" Müller answered. ""The real deal."" Another Facebook commenter asked for an explanation, posting, ""What!!?? Trump...The Christ? Are you pulling our leg?"" Müller provided an answer by pointing to his interpretation of Bible verses, saying he believed the son of God to be Jesus Christ , and the son of man to be Trump, meaning he believed there to be two Christs: You know that Jesus, the Son of God always spoke about the Son of MAN in a third person? ""For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words (Jesus, the Son of God), of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."" Have you not notice how Jesus, the Son of God spoke in the first person about himself and always referred to the Son of MAN in the third person? Müller also told us that he believed there to be a comparison between Jesus being betrayed by Judas and Trump purportedly being ""betrayed by Pence,"" purportedly referring to the former U.S. vice president's decision to follow the U.S. Constitution rather than overturning the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election based on conspiracy theories. (In reality, no credible evidence of massive voter fraud has ever been produced to show that the election was ""stolen,"" as Trump often claimed.) Following the Ohio rally, Müller uploaded a video that provided a longer explanation as to why he believed Trump to be ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ,"" as mentioned on the cover of his book. ""Don't get offended. Don't say, 'Ew, that's blasphemous,'"" he said. ""Jesus is the king of the Jews. Trump is the king of kings.""

"In October 2021, social media posts and news outlets reported that the new Ohio license plate, whose design Gov. Mike DeWine had just unveiled, contained a notable historical inaccuracy.

But the banner's facing the other way."" The unveiling of the new license plate design, at a news conference on Oct. 21, can be watched below. Among other features, the plate contains a banner that reads ""Birthplace of Aviation"" emerging from a representation of the Flyer — the ground-breaking aircraft designed by Dayton, Ohio, brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright, which made the first ever airplane flight in 1903. https://youtu.be/xDABUXKeqiA?t=582 In the design unveiled at the news conference, the banner emerged from the smaller end of the Flyer, giving the impression that this was the back of the aircraft.

As such, we are issuing a rating of ""True.""

"In September 2021, a photograph started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed U.S. President Joe Biden and a group of children wearing hats, shirts, and other memorabilia featuring slogans for former President Donald Trump. This image was widely circulated on social media by those claiming that Biden had been ""punked"" by the kids, or that the president had been tricked into taking a photograph with children wearing Trump memorabilia. The @RealDonaldTrump Gab account — an account that reposts emailed statements from the former president since Trump has been banned by more popular social media networks — shared the image along with the caption: ""These kids tricked Biden just like the Taliban did."" This is a genuine photograph of Biden with several children wearing Trump memorabilia. However, there's no evidence to support the claim that the president was ""tricked"" into taking this photo. In fact, Biden referenced this photograph as an example of unity and a social media account that appears to belong to one of the children featured in this image stated that Biden was aware of the hats. The child wrote on Instagram: ""Yes [he was aware of the hats] he actually said “I believe in liking people even if they don’t like you. This photograph was taken on Sept. 11, 2021, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, during an event to commemorate 9/11. Biden referenced this photograph as an example of unity after he was asked by a reporter what he had been thinking during the 20th anniversary of 9/11 . Biden's full response hit on a number of different topics. He talked about a friend of his who lost a son during the attack and the heroism of the passengers of United Flight 93. Biden also praised the remarks delivered earlier by former President George W. Bush regarding the forces that were dividing the country, and then talked about meeting the children in the viral photograph who were wearing memorabilia for his former political rival. Biden said: I thought that President Bush made a really good speech today — genuinely good speech — about who we are. We’re not — the core of who we are is not divided. It’s just this notion of — I don’t know how to explain it. I think, Jeff, I talked to you a little about this. I think the real issue for those kids that — just had a picture taken with — couple of them had Trump hats from last year — I think, for them, it’s going to be: Are we going to, in the next 4, 5, 6, 10 years, demonstrate that democracies can work, or not? [...] There’s a lot of autocrats who truly believe that democracies can’t function in the 21st century. Not a joke. They think because the world is changing so rapidly and people are so divided, you can’t bring people together in a democracy to get a consensus, and the only ones that are going to be able to succeed are the autocrats. That’s why it’s so damn important we demonstrate — everybody says, “Biden, why do you keep insisting on trying to bring the country together?” That’s the thing that’s going to affect our wellbeing more than anything else: how the rest of the world responds to us — knowing that we actually can, in fact, lead by the example of our power again.

"Fact Check Former U.S President Jimmy Carter was considered to be ahead of his time on issues surrounding climate change, exemplified by his installation of solar panels on the rooftop of the White House in the 1970s. Years later, Reagan removed the panels when he came into power, and they returned decades after, during the Obama administration. Some sources have reported that the solar panels installed by Obama are still in place. We are in the process of verifying that. A photograph of Carter showing off the panels he had installed at a dedication ceremony in 1979 was popular on Reddit in September 2022: The above caption does correctly state that Carter displayed the solar panels to guests at the White House, but it's incorrect as to when Carter’s successor, President Ronald Reagan, had the panels removed. Carter had 32 panels installed there, and for seven years they were used to heat water in the household until the Reagan administration removed them in 1986 -- not two years later as the post claims. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History , which now has one of the original panels in its collection, they were a symbol of Carter’s faith in “the power of the sun.” The above photograph is taken from the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library collection, and was published in The New York Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . The same image can be seen on Britannica . The New York Times' caption stated: “In 1979, President Carter showed off new solar panels on the West Wing that would provide hot water for the White House.” Various shots from that event are available in the National Archives catalog , and shots of that particular moment can be seen in the bottom half of the photographic film scans. These photographs were taken at the White House dedication event for the solar panels. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library At the ceremony, which was held in June 1979, Carter said : In the year 2000 this solar water heater behind me, which is being dedicated today, will still be here supplying cheap, efficient energy [...] A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people. Other photographs from the same event show the panels more clearly displayed on the rooftop of the White House's Cabinet Room, which is where the dedication event appears to take place. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library What happened to those panels after they were removed? According to Scientific American , one ended up at the National Museum of American History, one is in the Carter Library, and one is at the Solar Science and Technology Museum in Dezhou, China. Solar panels made a comeback at the White House during former President George W. Bush's tenure in 2002, but not on the Executive Mansion's roof. According to the White House Historical Association , the National Park Service oversaw installation of three solar energy systems on the White House grounds starting in 2002. The installation during his tenure helped heat up the White House swimming pool. In 2010, then-U.S. President Barack Obama announced that solar panels would once again be installed on the White House rooftop. The installation was completed in 2014 . The video below highlights the process: We reached out to the White House Historical Association to learn if any updates or changes were made to the panels during the Trump administration. They shared with us a photograph from a July 2021 news article in which the panels are still visible, stating, ""It appears from photographers that the panels are still installed on the roof."" While they confirmed that the panels are still there, they could not verify with certainty if the Trump administration had made any changes to them before 2020.","Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter made headlines in the 1970s for installing solar panels on the White House rooftop, becoming a pioneer on climate change issues. However, the panels were removed during Ronald Reagan's presidency in 1986, contrary to claims that they were removed two years later. A photograph of Carter displaying the solar panels at a dedication ceremony in 1979 resurfaced on Reddit in September 2022. Smithsonian National Museum of American History now has one of the original panels in its collection. The solar panels made a comeback during George W.

"A photograph that's frequently shared online appears to show a younger Hillary Clinton, perhaps back in her days as U.S. first lady, playing a Game Boy while seated on a flight. Was the picture altered? Was Clinton perhaps originally using an old Palm PDA (personal digital assistant) or something else before someone doctored the photo with Adobe Photoshop? The answer to those two questions is no. The truth is that Clinton was authentically photographed while playing a Game Boy. The picture was captured by photographer Ralph Alswang on April 20, 2015.

The games were included in some of the bundles that were packaged with the original Game Boy.

Her hair is done to perfection in one of the 15 styles she wears. She's kicked off her shoes. The most powerful man in the free world rubs her toes. Faxes, dispatches, and telephone calls are on hold as she wings her way to Europe on Air Force One. She needs to unwind. So what does she choose? Game Boy. ""I've become fond of Game Boy,"" she recently told Redbook magazine. Yes, Hillary Clinton loves video games. … So I called up the White House to find out exactly what games Hillary Clinton plays on which machines, only to learn that this is a state secret. ""If we said what Mrs. Clinton likes to play, it could be considered an endorsement,"" said a press aide. It could also be an embarrassment. ""Tetris,"" after all, was invented in Russia at least 15 years ago, quite possibly as a sop to the hungry and disgruntled masses who had no access to the goods.

"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother.""

"Fact Check On Aug. 25, 2022, the official Twitter account for the White House posted a tweet criticizing comments by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in which she stated her disagreement with the Biden administration's plan to forgive some federal student loan debt. In the video included in the tweet above, Greene used an appearance on right wing broadcaster Newsmax to opine that it's ""completely unfair"" to some taxpayers, namely those that didn't take out a student loan, to ""have to pay off the great big student loan debt"" of others. The White House's clap-back tweet was in reference to reports that Taylor Commercial, a construction company owned by Greene and her husband, received money through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The tactic has been used to attack other conservatives, although in the case of commentator Ben Shapiro, it backfired because he didn't get a $20,832 PPP loan, as some had claimed. U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) records show Greene's company accepted $182,300 in PPP loan money in April 2020, and that it was ""Paid in full or forgiven,"" which refers to loans ""repaid and those fully forgiven from repayment under PPP guidelines,"" per the SBA. A database of PPP loans provided by the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica, which obtained data from the SBA via public records, shows that Taylor Commercial had a total of $183,504 forgiven, including accrued interest. We reached out to Greene's office asking for comment on the controversy, and were provided a statement that didn't address the student loan/PPP loan discourse, but instead pointed to swatting incidents targeting Greene's home. ""It's a shame that [U.S. President] Joe Biden and his spokesmen in the media continue to make MTG a target simply because she is outspoken against Democrat policies, like genital mutilation surgeries for minors,"" the statement read, a likely reference to surgeries performed on some transgender people as part of gender affirming care (although such procedures are rarely performed on minors). There is important context to this controversy, namely that student loans and PPP loans are entirely different in their purpose and structure. PPP loans were given during the COVID-19 pandemic to businesses with the expectation that, if used as intended, they would be forgiven. Many businesses had no choice but to cease or curtail operations during the height of the pandemic, and the program was intended to prevent them from laying off workers or going under. Student loans, on the other hand, are sought by those seeking higher education and are taken out with the expectation that they will be paid back.","On August 25, 2022, the White House Twitter account posted a tweet criticizing Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's comments about the Biden administration's plan to forgive some federal student loan debt.

"Fact Check Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, was laid to rest at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, based on media reports and photographs taken of the site. New York Post reporters visited the golf club and photographed Ivana Trump’s grave. Their report included a number of shots from different angles, including one revealing a wooded area near the site. A source told the New York Post that Ivana was buried not too far from the club house. According to the report, she was buried in a place that was not visible to golfers as they tee off for a round of golf. The small section of the club where she was buried is below the backside of the first tee. A number of memes consisting of edited versions of those photographs went viral in late July 2022, with one in particular getting tens of thousands of likes and comments on Instagram. The image — posted by Instagram account homegrownterrorists — showed a golf cart rolling past what appeared to be Ivana Trump's gravesite. It's clear that this photograph is fake when it's compared to the pictures published in the New York Post article . The gravesite has been inserted into a wider shot of a golf cart on a golf course fairway. Unlike the Post's photographs, the manipulated image doesn’t show a wooded area immediately adjacent to the grave. A separate rumor speculates that Trump used the burial site for tax break purposes. Indeed, the New Jersey tax code does exempt cemetery land from all taxes, rates, and assessments. Potentially, her grave could save the property from paying a significant sum in a state with high tax rates. According to the code , a cemetery company is exempt from paying real property taxes, income taxes, sales and use taxes, business taxes, and inheritance taxes; cemetery trust funds are also exempt from taxes. Trump has expressed his desire to be buried at the New Jersey golf course for years. His company even described it as his “favorite property” in a 2014 filing with the state. A 2017 Washington Post report revealed how he had been trying to convince local authorities to let him build cemeteries at the golf course since 2007. After numerous attempts, two of his plans were approved around 2017, but construction for them had not begun. The 2017 report said that the Trump Organization still needed to apply for state approval to make the land a public cemetery. However, Ivana Trump is the first known family member to be buried at the Bedminster golf club. Brooke Harrington , a sociology professor at Dartmouth and tax researcher, pointed out that the tax code has no stipulation for a minimum number of human remains needed for the tax breaks to apply. Documents published by ProPublica show that the Trump Family Trust had sought to designate a property in nearby Hackettstown, New Jersey, as a non-profit cemetery company. However, this was not the first time Trump had been accused of trying to reduce his taxes on the property by varying its use. A 2016 Wall Street Journal report found that the golf club benefited from a farmland tax break because part of the land was designated for agricultural purposes — specifically for hay production and a small herd of goats. The Huffington Post reported in 2019 that he had saved around $88,000 that year. New Jersey laws state “a landowner must have no less than five acres of farmland actively devoted to an agricultural or horticultural use for the two years immediately preceding the tax year being applied for and meet specific minimum gross income requirements based on the productivity of the land.” A representative for the Trump Organization told Fortune magazine that the links being drawn between Ivana Trump's gravesite and tax laws were “truly evil.” While it is unknown if the choice of this location for her grave had any connection to taxes, the Trump family has a history of seeking ways to reduce tax bills. Furthermore, given the photographs, and an acknowledgement from a Trump representative regarding the location of her grave while denying the rumors connecting it to tax laws, we rate the overall claim as “True.”","Ivana Trump, the former wife of former U.S. President Donald Trump, was buried at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to media reports and photographs taken of the site.

His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida, when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the U.S. Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010.

"Fact Check The reporting below reflects facts as of July 2022. When Liz Truss resigned months later, on Oct. 20, we published a new story about Larry outlasting four, not three, British prime ministers. Being the first cat of the United Kingdom is not an easy job, especially when you have to deal with a revolving door of prime ministers. In July 2022, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader – and eventually as prime minister – after a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers. While Johnson announced he would stay on until a replacement was selected, someone else will have a longer tenure than him: Larry the cat has been in residence at 10 Downing Street since Feb. 15, 2011, according to the British government’s official page , and was the first cat to hold the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. He was adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. According to the official government website , he has many roles: He has captured the hearts of the Great British public and the press teams often camped outside the front door. In turn the nation sends him gifts and treats daily. Larry spends his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences and testing antique furniture for napping quality. His day-to-day responsibilities also include contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house. Larry says this is still ‘in tactical planning stage’. Larry has also outlasted three prime ministers, assuming he will still be present at 10 Downing Street after Johnson leaves his role. He arrived toward the early part of David Cameron’s tenure from 2010 to 2016, was a part of the household through Theresa May’s time from 2016 to 2019, and is expected to outlast Johnson’s tenure in the office. Cameron was believed to have a chilly relationship with Larry, and he posted a picture of the cat in his lap in an effort to dispel such rumors. May also hinted that she was more of a dog person. While a timetable for Johnson’s replacement had yet to be confirmed as of this writing, it took several weeks before he took over from his predecessor May. Larry himself has not commented on the upcoming changes. Meanwhile, Larry is expected to be waiting in 10 Downing Street and will likely be unimpressed with whoever is the new occupant.","Larry the cat, the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, has outlasted three British prime ministers and is set to outlast a fourth.

"Fact Check In the summer of 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden faced allegations of hypocrisy and ""flip-flopping"" after he strongly condemned the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and remove federal constitutional protections for abortion access. Speaking on June 24, Biden described Roe as ""the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy,"" and he called the decision to overturn it a ""tragic error"" and the ""realization of an extreme ideology."" However, many observers — both to the left and right of Biden on the ideological spectrum — contrasted such remarks, in 2022, with what they presented as Biden's very different stance on the abortion rights landmark, four decades ago. U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for example, wrote on Twitter : In 1982, Joe Biden proposed a constitutional amendment that would overturn Roe v. Wade and give the states the ability to regulate abortion. But today, he condemned the Dobbs decision. Unlike pro-life advocates, Biden has no backbone. He is ruled by the radical left. On June 24, one Facebook user published a viral post which contained a screenshot of an article by the London Independent , with the headline ""Biden voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 1982..."" and the caption ""Wonder how those protesting the Supreme Court decision feel about this. Chances are they are the same people that voted for Biden."" In recent years, the same core claim — that Biden once voted in favor of effectively overturning Roe and returning abortion policy to the states and the U.S. Congress — has featured in news articles by the The New York Times , Fox News , and the New York Post . That claim is accurate, although Biden did vote against an identical proposal just one year later. Our rating is ""True."" What Exactly Was the 1982 Vote About? The vote in question took place on March 10, 1982. Biden, then a U.S. senator for Delaware and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was considering a proposal put forward by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The proposal, Senate Joint Resolution 110 , contained the following text: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress: ""ARTICLE — ""A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortion: Provided, That a provision of a law of a State which is more restrictive than a conflicting provision of a law of Congress shall govern."" The key finding of Roe was that the U.S. constitution — in particular the ""due process"" clause of the 14th amendment — recognized a right to privacy, and that that included a woman's right to an abortion. Hatch's proposed amendment would have explicitly inserted into the Constitution the assertion that ""a right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution."" Clearly, that would have been completely incompatible with Roe, and therefore would have effectively — and emphatically — overturned Roe. The amendment would also have returned to Congress and the states the ability to govern abortion access. This was precisely the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling, 40 years later, in Dobbs — the decision that ultimately overruled Roe. Hatch's proposal went even further, though, stipulating that, while Congress could enact legislation governing abortion access on a national level, if an individual state's abortion law was stricter than the federal law, the state law would take precedence. The amendment never made it as far as a vote in the full Senate or House, but on March 10, 1982, the Senate Judiciary Committee did vote to advance it out of committee for the consideration of the full Senate. As a later committee report described it , the committee voted 10-7 to ""favorably report out"" the proposal. This is an important distinction. Judiciary committee members can vote to advance a measure to the full Senate ""without recommendation,"" meaning that, whether or not they personally support the proposal, they believe it should be considered by the full Senate. Biden's March 1982 vote went further, and he joined the committee's majority in explicitly supporting the proposal itself. The votes were as follows: For : Hatch, R-Utah; Laxalt, R-Nev.; Dole, R-Kan.; Simpson, R-Wyo.; East, R-N.C.; Grassley, R-Iowa; Denton, R-Ala.; Biden, D-Del.; DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Thurmond, R-S.C. Against : Mathias, R-Md.; Specter, R-Penn.; Kennedy, D-Mass.; Byrd, D-W.Va.; Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Leahy, D-Vt.; Baucus, D-Mont. At the time, Biden said his vote was an exceptionally difficult one, and described abortion as ""the single most controversial issue in the United States of America.""  Snopes asked the White House for a fuller explanation of the reasoning behind Biden's March 1982 vote, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. Prior to that vote, the Delaware senator had expressed clear opposition to Roe. For example, in a 1974 interview he declared: ""I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body."" However, when Hatch submitted a similar proposed constitutional amendment in 1983, Biden voted against it, both in the judiciary committee and in the full Senate chamber . From that point, his public stance on abortion rights in general, and Roe in particular, evolved from one of hostility, to neutrality, and as of 2022, firm support.","President Joe Biden faced allegations of being a hypocrite and flip-flopping in the summer of 2022 after opposing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and remove federal constitutional protections for abortion access. Critics contrasted his recent remarks with his stance on abortion rights four decades ago, claiming that he proposed a constitutional amendment in 1982 to overturn Roe v. Wade and give states the ability to regulate abortion. However, he voted against the identical proposal just one year later. The proposal did not make it as far as a vote in the full Senate or House, but the Senate Judiciary Committee voted in favour of advancing it out of committee for the consideration of the full Senate. Biden joined the committee's majority in explicitly supporting the proposal itself. The proposal would have returned the ability to govern abortion access to Congress and the states, and Hatch's proposal stipulated that if an individual state's abortion law was stricter than the federal law, the state law would take precedence. Biden's public stance on abortion rights has evolved from one of hostility to neutrality and, as of 2022, firm support.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,226,1163,1402,1628,TRUE,AI Machine,real,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,minor,,,,,
"Fact Check On June 25, 2022, The Matt Walsh Blog Twitter account purportedly responded to a question on the subject of abortion, apparently believing that a picture of an elephant fetus was that of a human. Seeing as there's no shortage of fake tweet screenshots out there, we looked to verify whether Walsh's tweet was genuine. We found evidence that the tweet was real but had been removed. According to Google cache , a service implemented by the tech giant to archive websites, the tweet in the screenshot below was real: This Twitter discussion on the subject of abortion occurred one day following the news that the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade , which essentially legalized abortion in the U.S. A user named @samthielman tweeted a picture to Walsh and asked, ""You truly believe THIS is a person?"" In response, Walsh or someone with control of his account chose to quote-tweet the question instead of inserting a traditional reply underneath, answering with, ""Yes."" The tweet then vanished from Walsh's account after @samthielman revealed that the image showed that of an elephant fetus. Before Walsh's tweet disappeared, it had already been liked thousands of times. According to two sources , the picture truly did show a fetus of an elephant. Before Walsh engaged with the elephant fetus image, another tweet on Walsh's account read, ""Could not be happier to see the pain and heartbreak of abortionists. Absolutely loving every minute of it."" This may have been what prompted the back-and-forth discussion with @samthielman. Charlie Kirk and the Dolphin Fetus Walsh's apparent elephant fetus mishap was similar to an incident in which conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was asked about a different picture. In October 2021, actor and comedian Ben Gleib held up an image and asked Kirk, ""You truly, in your heart of hearts, truly believe that this is a human being?"" Kirk answered, ""Without a doubt."" Gleib then revealed to Kirk that the picture supposedly showed a dolphin fetus : Background In addition to The Matt Walsh Blog, Walsh also writes for the conservative website The Daily Wire and appeared in the 2022 documentary, ""What Is a Woman?""

"Fact Check In June 2022, our readers inquired about a rumor that claimed an application was submitted for a 2,500-gallon propane gas tank to be installed and buried on Martha's Vineyard property owned by former U.S. President Barack Obama and the former first lady, Michelle . We found this to be mostly true, with two clarifications. Our review of the application, which was provided to us by the Town of Edgartown's Selectboard , found that the request was for three propane tanks. When combined, the three tanks equalled 2,500 gallons. Also, the application indicated that the tanks would be installed above ground, not buried. The reason behind the tanks' purchase was not public at the time this article was published. The property's size was once mentioned by Chicago Sun-Times as measuring 29.3 acres . It's unclear if the tanks were meant for the Obamas, the U.S. Secret Service, or for another purpose. We reviewed earlier reporting about the application for the propane tanks from both Miami Standard and The Martha's Vineyard Times , also known as MVTimes.com. On June 7, 2022, The MV Times published the following: The select board approved a request for a 2,500-gallon commercial propane tank for 79 Turkeyland Cove Road in Katama — owned by former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. “We’ve never had a private propane tank come to us,” said select board member Arthur Smadbeck, with select board member Michael Donaroma noting a private-residence propane tank is typically a fraction of the quantity being requested. To confirm the reporting, we contacted the Town of Edgartown Selectboard in Massachusetts. The town is located on Martha's Vineyard . By phone, we requested the minutes from the Selectboard's meeting on June 6, as they weren't yet available on the board's website. We received the board's minutes by email. According to the two-page document, a single, 2,500-gallon propane tank was discussed by the board for a street address matching the Obamas' Martha's Vineyard property. The agenda item was introduced by the board's chairman, Margaret E. Serpa: Ms. Serpa then addressed the next item which was an application from Star Propane to install a buried 2500g tank at 79 Turkeyland Cove. Mr. Smadbeck moved to approve. Mr. Donaroma seconded. Unanimous. The minutes contained no additional information. We again inquired with the board by email, asking if the purpose of the propane was public knowledge or if they had any other information that could be passed along. In response, they sent the application for the tanks that had been signed on May 31, 2022. The application showed that a request had been made for three propane tanks, including two sized at 1,000 gallons and another one at 500 gallons. The name of the person who made the request was Ashley Tate-Gilmore. A person with the same name previously served as Obama's White House travel director. The news of the propane tanks led to a number of videos that pushed a conspiracy theory that the Obamas made the purchase for "" prepping ."" The conspiracy theory referred to the idea of preparing for a future and potentially apocalyptic turn of events, in particular a financial collapse. At the time, the Federal Reserve had sought to ""tame high inflation"" by putting forth its ""largest rate hike since 1994,"" according to The Associated Press . This led to fears of a possible future recession, the reporting said. In sum, an application was submitted to the Town of Edgartown for three propane tanks equalling a total of 2,500-gallon capacity that were to be installed above ground on the Obamas' property on Martha's Vineyard.

"Fact Check In May 2022, social media users shared images that supposedly showed the face of the first U.S. President, George Washington, facing right — not left — on the front of a new quarter coin released in 2022. Many of these social media posts stated that Washington was now facing away from the coin's inscription ""In God We Trust ,"" and that the alleged change revealed a change in modern society's religious views. While we have no insight to offer on how this numismatic design does or does not reveal a change in the religious views of modern American society, we can say that Washington indeed previously faced left on the common quarter , and that the design for the coin released in 2022 has his profile facing right. There's no evidence to indicate that this design was chosen for any religious reasons. In fact, this isn't the first time that Washington has faced away from the words ""In God We Trust"" on a quarter. The U.S. Mint released the coin with Washington's profile facing right as part of its "" American Women Quarters Program ,"" an initiative that was set to run between 2022 and 2025 and include as many as five new quarters every year. For 2022, the U.S. Mint said it was releasing quarters to honor Maya Angelou , Dr. Sally Ride , Wilma Mankiller , Nina Otero-Warren , and Anna May Wong . As of this writing, the quarters featuring Ride and Angelou were currently in circulation. George Washington's profile appeared on the obverse side of each coin, no matter which woman it honored, and the design of it was new. Well, actually, it was an old design that had never been used. The design of a right-facing Washington was created by Laura Gardin Fraser , one of the 20th century's most prolific female sculptors, and submitted to the U.S. Mint in 1932 after Congress launched a design competition to honor Washington's 200th birthday. Fraser's design, which was based on a bust by French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon and featured a right-facing Washington, didn't win the competition. Instead, Congress chose a design by John Flanagan , which featured the familiar sight of a left-facing Washington. Fraser's design While some social media users criticized the government for turning Washington ""away"" from the phrase ""In God We Trust,"" this isn't the first time that this has taken place. In 1999, for example, the U.S. Mint introduced its ""50 States"" series of quarters that featured a left-facing Washington and the words ""In God We Trust"" on the right side. Here's an image of the reverse side of a Pennsylvania quarter . In 2021, when the U.S. Mint announced designs for its initial run of quarters in the ""American Women Quarters Program "", then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen decided to use Fraser's 1932 design of Washington for the obverse side of the honorary coins. The U.S. Mint wrote in a news release : Contributions of American women have often been overlooked, but that is about to change. Literally. Beginning in 2022, the American Women Quarters™ Program will feature reverse designs honoring distinguished American women. One woman’s design, created 90 years ago, will take its place as the program’s common obverse: the unifying element of the program. [...] In 2022, 90 years after she intended for it to do so, Laura Gardin Fraser’s design will fittingly take its place on the quarter. It will be the obverse for the American Women Quarters Program, a four-year program that celebrates American women and the contributions they made to this country. The Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-330) requires a new obverse design that maintains a likeness of George Washington, but be designed so as to distinguish it from the one used during the previous quarters program. It should be noted that this was not the first time a piece of U.S. currency featured Fraser's work. Fraser was the first woman to design a commemorative coin, the 1921 Alabama Centennial Half Dollar , and her work can also be seen on the 1922 Grant Memorial Half Dollar and Gold Dollar , the 1925 Fort Vancouver Centennial Half Dollar , and the 1926 Oregon Trail Memorial Half Dollar . Also, the ""American Woman Quarters Program"" was not the first time that the U.S. Mint used Fraser's right-facing Washington design on a coin. The George Washington Commemorative Gold Five-Dollar coin, which was issued in 1999, featured it, too. Dean Kotlowski, a member of the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC), said of Fraser's design in a U.S. Mint news release : 'She’s able to create a sense of his seriousness of purpose. The cheek muscles, you see the strength, the strength of character. The looking ahead, straight ahead, the sense of vision. All of these come together with a sense of statesmanship and a commanding presence that she is able to achieve with remarkable ease.' In sum, it was true that quarters released in 2022 showed Washington facing right, while the common quarter had depicted his profile looking left. However, there wasn't any evidence that the design of the new quarters had anything to do with religion. Fraser's right-facing design was chosen, in part, because the series of coins honored the contributions of women to American society and Fraser was a well-known female sculptor.

"Fact Check On May 24, 2022, a gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 children and two teachers . It was the 212th mass shooting in the U.S. (defined by the Gun Violence Archive as a shooting in which four or more people were shot or killed, excluding the shooter) of 2022, and the 27th shooting to take place in a school . As news circulated that 19 children under the age of 10 had been killed in another mass shooting, Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, expressed outrage at the lawmakers who refuse to vote on the federal bill H.R. 8, the ""Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021,"" and noted that 90% of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchases. Kerr said :  ""Do you realize that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want background checks, universal background checks? 90% of us ... We are being held hostage by 50 Senators in Washington who refuse to even put it to a vote, despite what we the American people want. They won't vote on it because they want to hold on to their own power."" Do 90% of Americans Want Universal Background Checks? A number of polls taken over the years show that the vast majority of Americans support universal background checks for those wanting to buy guns. In 2015, for example, a national Public Policy Polling survey of gun owners found overwhelming support (83%) for background checks, a 2018 Gallup poll found that 95% of people supported ""requiring background checks for all gun sales,"" and in 2019, a Quinnipiac University poll from 2019 found that 94% of American voters supported universal background checks. The Pew Research Center wrote in 2019 : When it comes to specific gun-related policies, the public finds broad agreement in certain areas. Overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (91%) and Republicans and Republican-leaners (92%) say they strongly or somewhat favor barring people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns. These views are largely unchanged since the question was first asked in 2017. Similarly, large majorities in both parties continue to favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks (93% of Democrats, 82% of Republicans). Kerr's claim that 90% of Americans support universal background checks falls within the scope of the available data. What is H.R. 8? H.R. 8 is a bill that would expand background checks for all firearm sales in the country (including sales by private and non-licensed sellers). This bill establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties (i.e., unlicensed individuals). Specifically, it prohibits a firearm transfer between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. The prohibition does not apply to certain firearm transfers or exchanges, such as a gift between spouses in good faith. While the legislation has already passed in the U.S. House, the bill has been held up in the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass. CNN reported : Another bill, HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers. The legislation has bipartisan support, passing the House last year in a 227-203 vote. Eight Republicans supported the bill and one Democrat voted against it. [...] For now, either Democrats must all agree to end the filibuster or Republicans must begin to support gun control measures in larger numbers. Until then, there will be no new federal gun laws.","A gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas on May 24, 2022, killing 19 children and two teachers.

"Fact Check In May 2022, internet users got a kick out of what appeared to be an old photograph of the late former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, talking to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a boy.

Thus, we are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, contemporary accounts suggest Thatcher was having a friendly conversation with the young Trudeau, rather than chastising him, and the date provided in the May 2022 tweet, specifically, was off by a few years. The picture was taken on June 25, 1980 (not 1984 or thereabouts), and shows Thatcher talking to Trudeau outside 10 Downing Street — the official residence of the U.K. prime minister — in London. Behind Trudeau is his father, and to Thatcher's left, wearing an orange coat, is Jean Casselman Wadds, then Canadian high commissioner to the U.K. The Canadian government actually holds two slightly different versions of the shot — one showing Thatcher with her eyes open , as in the May 2022 post, and the other with her eyes closed . Several other photographs showed the same scene, with Thatcher wearing a distinctive bow at her collar, the elder Trudeau wearing the same jacket, and the young Trudeau wearing the same wind-breaker: Trudeau, then 8 years old, had accompanied his father on a trip to Europe , during which the Canadian PM attended talks and summits in Italy, the U.K.,  and Norway. While in Rome, both generations of Trudeaus obtained an audience with Pope John Paul II. Several contemporary news reports described Justin as having been sitting in a car at 10 Downing Street, but beckoned out on to the street by Thatcher, who was keen to chat to him. A brief, friendly exchange then took place, according to reports. For example, the Vancouver Sun wrote that : [Thatcher] spotted Justin huddled in the back of the Daimler, reported the Daily Mail. The newspaper said Justin explained that he was off to the zoo to see some baby monkeys. ""Have you seen them?"" he asked Thatcher. ""No,"" she said. ""But you must tell me about them when we meet again."" In their 1990 political biography of Pierre Trudeau , Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall cited a report by the Toronto Sun, and wrote of the June 25, 1980, meeting: The amiable nature of the occasion was pointed up by an exchange between Margaret Thatcher and Justin Trudeau, who had come with his father to Europe and was waiting for him in a limousine so they could go first to the London zoo and then to Buckingham Palace. The Iron Lady and the eight-year-old were photographed shaking hands amidst much prime ministerial joshing, with Trudeau trying to intervene to prevent the photo session from continuing. When the Canadians finally drove away, Justin grinned, stuck out his tongue, and waved from the limousine's back-seat.","A photograph of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher talking to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a boy has gone viral on the internet, with politics lecturer Yuan Yi Zhu captioning the picture ""Margaret Thatcher telling off a young Justin Trudeau, c. 1984"" in a tweet.

"Fact Check The Florida Department of Education rejected a number of mathematics textbooks for public schools that the department said contained references to critical race theory (CRT), and other “prohibited topics or unsolicited strategies.” On April 19, 2022 , Gov. Ron DeSantis said the material in the rejected textbooks was “proprietary” and as such would not be made public. In a statement on its website, the Department of Education said 41% of the submitted textbooks on the list would not be included for the following reasons (emphasis added): The approved list followed a thorough review of submissions at the Department, which found 41 percent of the submitted textbooks were impermissible with either Florida’s new standards or contained prohibited topics – the most in Florida’s history. Reasons for rejecting textbooks included references to Critical Race Theory (CRT), inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics. The highest number of books rejected were for grade levels K-5, where an alarming 71 percent were not appropriately aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies. Despite rejecting 41 percent of materials submitted, every core mathematics course and grade is covered with at least one textbook. The department did not share information on the specific content that it objected to and the textbook publishers told The New York Times they had not received details about the objections. “It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said. In 2021, Florida banned CRT from all classrooms in the state, arguing that instruction “must be factual and objective, and may not suppress or distort significant historical events.” Back then DeSantis took issue with the curriculum, describing it as “the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons."" Snopes has covered CRT and the controversies surrounding it previously. In recent years, Florida has passed legislation limiting the ways that race, gender, sexual orientation and social-emotional wellness can be taught and discussed in classrooms. DeSantis is also expected to sign legislation that prohibits instruction that could potentially make students feel uncomfortable about historical events because of their own race, sex, or origins. The Department of Education also cited materials from the Common Core as objectionable. Common Core is a nationwide effort to standardize mathematics and literacy curriculum expectations, and Florida and a number of other states have pushed back against it. While the exact content described as objectionable is not publicly available, this did not stop many on the internet from sharing posts falsely purporting to show pages from the rejected mathematics textbooks. One post on Facebook claimed that a question in a math textbook that also mentioned sexual abuse was in one of the rejected books. In reality , the question was from a math textbook in a Philadelphia high school (a claim we fact-checked back in 2018). Some of the questions related to the life of the Black poet Maya Angelou, as outlined in her autobiography , ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings . "" Another pos t, sent to us by readers, argued that a series of math questions that referenced slavery was also in the rejected textbooks. These questions were in fact from an elementary school in Georgia and generated controversy back in 2012.","The Florida Department of Education has rejected numerous mathematics textbooks for public schools, citing references to critical race theory and other prohibited topics.

"Fact Check On April 20, 2022, Snopes came across the below-displayed tweet that claimed Newsmax aired an image that supposedly displayed the names and headshots of four people under a chyron that suggested they were ""Black conservatives"" whom left-leaning Americans apparently considered ""to be traitors."" The people listed (from left to right) were Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke , former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain , conservative commentator Ben Shapiro , and former U.S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson . The tweet was authored by Jason Campbell of Media Matters for America , a left-leaning media researching group, shortly after 7 a.m. Over the course of hours, it had received almost 29,000 ""likes"" and 3,800 retweets (and counting), with many observers noting that Shapiro is white and Cain died in July 2020 after battling COVID-19. The tweet depicted an authentic visual moment from the conservative news outlet, though omitted the fact that concurrent audio (the host speaking) made clear that Cain was dead and Shapiro was white. Considering those facts, which we outline in detail below, we rate this claim ""True."" First, we went to Newsmax's website, where it archives recent video segments. We found the clip in question: a segment that aired the day prior on host Greg Kelly 's show, titled ""Greg Kelly Reports."" Around the 13-minute mark, the program showed footage of former President Donald Trump at a South Carolina rally, where he criticized an unspecified group of news outlets for ""not getting it"" — supposedly in reference to racial inequality in the U.S. Then, Kelly said: ""You can watch hours upon hours, centuries, actually, of the fake news ... and not learn a damn thing about what's really happening in terms of race in America, in my opinion. They're having a silly, foolish conversation about race to avoid having a serious, impactful one to actually help people."" Instead of turning to mainstream news outlets for updates on the era's ongoing civil rights movement , Kelly advised viewers to listen to actor Chris Rock and showed a years-old skit by the comedian titled, ""How Not to Get Your Ass Kicked by the Police."" Then, the Newsmax host called attention to the death of Patrick Lyola , a 26-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by a white officer in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and shared what he supposedly considers to be advice to avoid poverty and/or incarceration. As he spoke those words, the screen displayed the messages: ""A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE"" and ""LYOLA WOULD BE ALIVE IF LISTENED TO CHRIS ROCK"" and ""GO TO SCHOOL, GET MARRIED & HAVE KIDS."" Soon after that, the screen showed clips of Democratic politicians — which included U.S. President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley — talking about systemic racism and its existence throughout U.S. history. Among them was Yasmin Vossoughian , an MSNBC anchor. After that, the screen indeed depicted the headshots and names of Clarke, Cain, Shapiro, and Carson, all above a chyron that read: ""LEFT CONSIDERS BLACK CONSERVATIVES TO BE TRAITORS."" Meanwhile, Kelly said verbatim, according to the video: I wonder what Yasmin would do, and any of those other people, when they meet a Black conservative. They're out there, but they're shunned because, boy oh boy, what they have to say. And the late Herman Cain and, of course Ben Shapiro — not Black but one of the heroes of the movement. This really disrupts the narrative, and that's why they are marginalized, and they shouldn't be. They should be celebrated and listened to. In sum, it was true that Newsmax aired the headshots, and listed the names of Clarke, Cain, Shapiro, and Carson above the in-question chyron. However, simultaneously, host Greg Kelly made clear in his spoken remarks that Cain was dead and Shapiro was not Black.","A tweet that claimed Newsmax aired an image of four people under a chyron that suggested they were ""Black conservatives"" whom left-leaning Americans considered ""traitors"" was found to be true.

One widely shared clip , posted by Nikki McCann Rodriguez from the progressive Media Matters for America, contained slow-motion footage of muscular and shirtless men wrestling, working out and chopping wood, and an almost naked man who appeared to be tanning his genitals. The trailer culminated with a caption that read ""Tucker Carlson Originals presents: 'The End of Men.'"" Social media users, primarily those ideologically opposed to Carlson, mocked the clip, describing it as homoerotic , while others questioned whether it was authentic or a parody. The clip was entirely authentic, but it was taken from a longer trailer published by Tucker on April 15, to promote the second season of his Fox News feature series ""Tucker Carlson Presents."" It did give a slightly reductive and over-simplified impression of the trailer, which was more than twice as long, and contained more context than was shown in the clip.

In order to demonstrate this discrepancy, and in the interests of thoroughness, the following is a lightly annotated transcript of the trailer: Archive footage of President John F. Kennedy: I welcome this opportunity to speak to the people of America about a subject which I believe to be most important, and that is the subject of physical fitness.

"In March 2022, MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell outlined some interesting historical context for the grilling of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson by Republicans during Senate confirmation hearings. O'Donnell claimed that the tradition of public confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees was not in place for the dozens of white Christian men who assumed a seat on the court after its establishment in 1789, but was urgently created for the first Jewish nominee Louis Brandeis in 1916. O'Donnell's presentation of the facts was highly accurate. His argument — that the tradition of rigorous and hostile senate confirmation hearings was started in response to the nomination of the first Jewish justice — was largely correct. However, he did omit to mention a closed-door hearing for one nominee in 1873, and he mistakenly claimed the Senate ""stopped asking questions for decades"" after Brandeis, when in fact, just nine years later, another nominee was grilled for several hours by Senate committee members. We are therefore issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" What Lawrence O'Donnell Said O'Donnell made the claim on Twitter on March 22, where he wrote : ""For the 1st 127 years when only white Christian men were allowed to be Supreme Court Justices, there were zero confirmation hearings. Confirmation hearing was invented for the 1st Jewish nominee."" Earlier, he devoted a segment on his MSNBC show ""The Last Word"" to dissecting the demographic and historical background of the nomination of Jackson who, if she is confirmed, would become the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court. O'Donnell explained: Most of the 115 Supreme Court justices did not even graduate from law school. Only 49 of them were actually law school graduates. For the first 127 years, the Supreme Court was a bastion of affirmative action for white Christian men only ... And not one of them ever had to answer a single question from a senator about anything. Not one of them had confirmation hearings. Not one . At least one of those people was confirmed by the full senate the day after he was nominated. That's how easy it was. Then, in 1916, came the first Jewish nominee for the United States Supreme Court — Harvard Law School graduate Louis Brandeis. And that is when the confirmation hearing had to be invented . The white Christian men of the senate wanted to ask some questions of the first Jewish nominee to the Supreme Court. After Justice Brandeis was confirmed, the senate stopped asking questions for decades. They had no questions for Stanley Reed, in 1938 — the last Supreme Court justice who did not graduate from law school. Only in the television age did confirmation hearings become routine for Supreme Court justices, and that was entirely because senators wanted to be on TV. [Emphasis is added]. Early History of Senate Confirmation Hearings According to research conducted by the Congressional Research Service — a non-partisan and highly reliable source — there were 101 nominations of Supreme Court associate or chief justices between 1789 and 1916. Of those, none was subjected to public hearings of any Senate committee, thus effectively supporting the first part of O'Donnell's claim. In January 1916, that changed dramatically. After the death of Justice Joseph Lamar, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a progressive lawyer born in Kentucky but based in Massachusetts, and known for suing major corporations, defending workers' rights, and advocating privacy protections. Many Republicans fiercely opposed Brandeis's nomination, in part because they portrayed him as a "" radical"" and a ""socialist ,"" but also, undoubtedly, because Brandeis was Jewish . Senators would subject Brandeis to an unprecedented 19 days of committee hearings (although he himself did not attend in person ), and it would take four months for his appointment to be confirmed — still a record for the slowest successful Supreme Court confirmation process in history. In the end, the Senate confirmed his appointment by 47 votes to 22 in June 1916, and Brandeis served on the court until 1939, becoming one of the major legal figures in the United States in the 20th century. While Brandeis was the first Supreme Court nominee subjected to public hearings — contentious, protracted hearings at that — the Senate had held closed-door hearings on one occasion in the previous 127 years. In December 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Attorney General George Henry Williams to serve as Supreme Court Chief Justice. Initially, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended his nomination be confirmed, but later that month, reversed course after the emergence of several rather murky allegations of corruption and embezzlement against Williams. After holding two ""executive"" (that is, private) sessions, the committee members unanimously opposed Williams' ascension, and in January 1874, Williams himself asked Grant to withdraw his name from consideration, which Grant duly did. After Brandeis, the Senate largely resumed its previous practice of confirming or rejecting Supreme Court nominations without the need for substantial public hearings. However, there were closed hearings in 1922, and in 1925, the Senate judiciary committee held a public hearing on the nomination of Attorney General Harlan Stone. There, committee members grilled Stone for several hours , in what was the first ever occasion on which a Supreme Court nominee appeared in person to answer questions submitted by the senate. That spectacle took place less than nine years after the Brandeis hearings. So O'Donnell's claim that after Brandeis, ""the senate stopped asking questions for decades"" is not right. Senate hearings were very rare, and the intensity of scrutiny to which Brandeis was subjected was indeed unique at that time. However, he was not the only Supreme Court nominee made to sweat over his confirmation during that era. The next public hearing came in 1930, and during that decade Supreme Court nominees were as likely as not to face public hearings in the judiciary committee. From the 1940s onward, though, Supreme Court nominees were more likely than not to be subjected to committee hearings.","MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell received a mostly true rating for his claims on the history of Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees.

In mid-March 2022, a tweet reportedly by conservative political commentator Candace Owens became a topic of social media debate after the Embassy of the Russian Federation in the U.S. retweeted the post that said, “Russian lives matter,” among other things. This claim is true. On March 9 , Owens tweeted : “Absolutely appalling the way Russians are being treated in America and abroad. That our leaders and government institutions are allowing for—and at times calling for this discrimination following their global ‘black lives matter’ hysteria is quite telling. Russian lives matter.” The claim that the Russian embassy in the U.S. retweeted the above post went viral several days later, with some accounts claiming that the “Russian lives matter” slogan is a “coordinated disinformation campaign.” We scanned the Russian Embassy in USA (@RusEmbUSA) verified account on Twitter, and found that it did, indeed, retweet Owens on March 9: We also cross-referenced the retweet from the @RusEmbUSA page by searching through the “Retweeted by” option section on Owens’ original post and confirmed it to be true: As of this writing, the Twitter account @RusEmbUSA was verified by the platform and self-described as the “official Twitter feed of the Russian Embassy in the USA.” Snopes also referred to the website of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in the USA and further confirmed that the Twitter account linked on the website directed to @RusEmbUSA.

"Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption? We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. U.S. President Joe Biden’s lack of military service has been frequently commented on by conservatives, even before he became president. Snopes readers also sent us numerous requests to look into Biden’s history of draft deferments, asking for confirmation of the circumstances under which he was able to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. Some asked us specifically if it was true that he received five draft deferments because of his asthma as a teenager. Biden’s Selective Service records were released in 2008 to The Associated Press by the campaign of then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. According to the documents, Biden did receive a total of five draft deferments when he was an undergraduate at the University of Delaware and when he was a law student at Syracuse University. However, all of these deferments were granted by reason of his status as a student, not because of any medical condition. According to the draft classifications , one can receive a deferment as a student. Classification 1-S denotes, “Student deferred by status – (H) high school; (C) college.” Before Congress reformed the draft in 1971, ""a man could qualify for a student deferment if he could show he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress in virtually any field of study."" Under current law , college students can have their induction postponed ""only until the end of the current semester,"" while seniors can postpone it until the end of the full academic year. David Wade, then an Obama campaign spokesperson, told The Associated Press, “As a result of a physical exam on April 5, 1968, Joe Biden was classified 1-Y and disqualified from service because of asthma as a teenager.” I-Y means “Registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency.” This classification was abolished in December 1971. Less detailed records of Biden’s Selective Service draft card are available on the National Archives website. The Associated Press noted that in Biden’s memoir, “Promises to Keep,” he did not mention his asthma, and described an active childhood as a lifeguard and football player. Biden is not the only leader who took advantage of student deferments. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also received five draft deferments . His first four were because he was a student, and the fifth because he became a father. While Biden did indeed receive five draft deferments, these were due to his status as a student. Later, when he underwent a physical exam, he was classified unable to serve owing to his history of asthma. As such, we rate this claim as “Mostly True.”","Snopes, a fact-checking website, has addressed the claims made by conservatives regarding U.S. President Joe Biden's lack of military service and draft deferments.

"In late 2021, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers seeking to verify the authenticity of a fascinating story, told in several widely shared social media posts, about one of the pre-White House accomplishments of former President Jimmy Carter. For example, on Dec. 14 Jeff Lundeen posted a very widely shared tweet that contained an old picture of a young Carter, a screenshot of the anecdote, and the following caption: Do you remember the world's very first nuclear meltdown? That time the US President, an expert in nuclear physics, heroically lowered himself into the reactor and saved Ottawa, Canada's capital? Sounds like schlocky action movie, but it actually happened! That tweet was itself drawn from an earlier Facebook post by the Historical Society of Ottawa, which can be seen below: The core claim from those accounts was that, as a young naval officer, Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown. That claim was accurate, and we are issuing a rating of ""True."" In main control room of USS K-1 (SSK-1) between June and October 1952. (Source: Naval History and Heritage Command). Carter, who was born in 1924 and grew up in Plains, Georgia, had a relatively short but distinguished naval career, as summarized by the U.S. Navy itself : President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 with distinction, after which he was assigned to USS Wyoming (E-AG 17) as an ensign. After completing two years of surface ship duty, Carter applied for submarine duty. He served as executive officer, engineering officer, and electronics repair officer on the submarine SSK-1 . When Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (then a captain) started his program to create nuclear-powered submarines, Carter wanted to join the program and was interviewed and selected by Rickover. Carter was promoted to lieutenant and from 3 November 1952 to 1 March 1953, he served on temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C., to assist ""in the design and development of nuclear propulsion plants for naval vessels."" From 1 March to 8 October 1953, Carter was preparing to become the engineering officer for USS Seawolf (SSN-575), one of the first submarines to operate on atomic power. However, when his father died in July 1953 Carter resigned from the Navy and returned to Georgia to manage his family interests. Carter was honorably discharged on 9 October 1953 and transferred to the retired reserve at his request with the rank of lieutenant. On Dec. 12, 1952, an accident took place at the National Research Experimental (NRX) nuclear reactor at Chalk River, near the Canadian capital of Ottawa. A detailed, official Atomic Energy of Canada account of the incident and its aftermath can be found here and here . Having been promoted to lieutenant in June of that year, Carter was at that time on secondment from the Navy to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development at Schenectady, in upstate New York. A 2019 video, vetted and published by All Hands, the official magazine of the U.S. Navy, contained the following account of the future president's involvement in the cleanup operation: Due to a combination of mechanical failure and human error, a power surge of up to 90 megawatts caused some fuel rods to melt after rupturing in the NRX research reactor at Chalk River Laboratories. The reactor's core was baldy damaged, requiring a massive cleanup operation. This was the first incident of this magnitude, and Carter was ordered to lead a team of 23 people to assist in the cleanup. When he arrived on the scene, there was a duplicate reactor set up on a nearby tennis court, where he and his team would practice removing bolts and pieces as quickly as they could. Once lowered into the damage reactor, each person would only have 90 seconds to work, due to the extreme radioactivity. The core was shut down, rebuilt, and put back into operation without further incident. Reflecting on the episode in 2008, Carter told the Canadian author Arthur Milnes that he and his team were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation at Chalk River, as Milnes would later write for CNN : ""We were fairly well instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that I had radioactivity in my urine,"" President Carter, now 86, told me during an interview for my new book in Plains in 2008. ""They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages and they didn't know."" Despite the fears he had to overcome, Carter admits he was animated at the opportunity to put his top-secret training to use in the cleanup of the reactor, located along the Ottawa River northwest of Ottawa. ""It was a very exciting time for me when the Chalk River plant melted down,"" he continued in the same interview. ""I was one of the few people in the world who had clearance to go into a nuclear power plant,"" he said. ""There were 23 of us and I was in charge. I took my crew up there on the train.""","In December 2021, a story circulated on social media about former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's involvement in containing a nuclear meltdown during his time as a young naval officer.

On Monday, a fan on Twitter called out Refinery29 after the media outlet published a report , which included a photo originally believed to be from the reality star’s Instagram Stories depicting the shirt, which JFK assumably wore on the day he was assassinated in 1963. “I AM SCREAMING someone tweeted as a joke that Kim Kardashian gifted North JFK’s bloody shirt and Refinery29 wrote about it as if it were true????” the fan wrote on Twitter alongside a grab of the article, highlighting the excerpt “What is North West going to do with JFK’s bloody shirt? And why isn’t it in a museum?” Kardashian tweeted that the rumor was ""fake"" and a ""sick joke."" Also related to Kennedy's assassination, we found reporting from 2013 where the Houston Chronicle and The Associated Press chronicled another bloody shirt. This one belonged to Texas Gov.

John Anderson, preservation officer at the archives, said the display tells an important aspect of a well-known story. ""For Texans, this is something that maybe gets forgotten by some of the rest of the world, that Gov.

"In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. In the aftermath of the verdicts, Rittenhouse and his many supporters expressed resentment at what they presented as unfair and prejudicial commentary on the shootings. In particular, several observers highlighted remarks made by President Joe Biden and his campaign, at that time, and criticized the then-Democratic candidate for, in their description , calling Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist."" During an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Nov. 22, Rittenhouse himself said Biden had acted with ""actual malice, defaming my character"": Snopes has reviewed footage related to two instances in which Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign. Our conclusion is that Biden did not explicitly describe the Illinois man as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or, at the very least, had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" CNN Interview Biden conducted an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020 — two days after the Rittenhouse shootings in Kenosha, which took place in the backdrop of a renewed wave of protests after police in the city shot and seriously injured Jacob Blake , a 29-year-old Black man. The relevant section of the conversation can be watched below, and the following is an excerpted transcript: Cooper: The president has not talked about the shooting of Mr. Blake. He's talked about violence at protests in the wake of it. I'm wondering why you think that is that he hasn't actually addressed it? There's obviously a lot we do not know about the circumstances around it, but the video, obviously, has been out there. Biden: Well look, I don't know enough to know whether that 17-year-old kid — exactly what he did. But allegedly he's part of a militia coming out of the state of Illinois. Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?... In that response, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists — claims that Rittenhouse subsequently explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden now stood by the way in which he characterized Rittenhouse during his CNN interview, or if he wished to retract or modify those remarks. We did not receive a response in time for publication. Biden Campaign Ad During the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, Biden and Trump clashed over the Republican incumbent's support among white supremacist groups, with Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressing the president to ""condemn white supremacist and militia groups."" That exchange — which we covered in considerable detail at the time — produced the famous ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" moment, and prompted many critics of Trump to accuse him of ""refusing"" to distance himself from white supremacists and far-right militia groups. The following day, Biden's campaign produced an ad that highlighted that explosive moment from the previous evening's debate. It contained audio of the three-way exchange between Wallace, Trump, and Biden, overlaid with video footage and still images of various high-profile instances of white supremacist violence. An excerpted transcript is available here: Chris Wallace (addressing Trump): — but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacist and militia groups — Trump: Sure Wallace: — and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we’ve seen in Portland? On the words ""as we saw in Kenosha,"" the campaign video showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020: The clear suggestion there was, again, that Rittenhouse was himself a white supremacist militia member, or at the very least was closely associated with such groups — claims that, as we have shown, Rittenhouse has vehemently denied. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden stood by this component of the campaign ad, and whether he regretted the fact that it strongly suggested Rittenhouse was a white supremacist. We did not receive a response to this question.","A jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse of all charges related to fatal shootings that occurred during civil unrest in August 2020.

"On November 12, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Steve Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist and senior counselor to the president at the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's term, was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress after he failed to honor a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee as part of their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bannon, 67, is charged with one contempt count involving his refusal to appear for a deposition and another involving his refusal to produce documents, despite a subpoena from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. An arraignment date has not yet been set in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As this news circulated on social media, many people noted that Bannon was the first person to be indicted by a grand jury on contempt of Congress charges in nearly 40 years. Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard, wrote on Twitter : ""Bannon’s is the first indictment for criminal contempt of Congress in nearly 40 years. It was well earned."" Legal analyst Elie Honig made a similar observation on CNN: While the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate both have the power to certify contempt citations, it is up to the DOJ to pursue criminal prosecution. The Congressional Research Services writes : ""The criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena."" The House and Senate have both voted in recent years to hold various people in contempt of congress — such as former Attorney General William Barr, former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and former Attorney General Eric Holder — but it hasn't been since 1983 that the DOJ indicted someone (in that case, Rita M. Lavelle , a former Environmental Protection Agency official) for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify about the EPA's hazardous waste cleanup fund. While Lavelle was later cleared of this charge, she was later found guilty of perjury . The New York Times writes : ""The last person charged with criminal contempt of Congress, Rita M. Lavelle, a former federal environmental official under President Ronald Reagan, was found not guilty in 1983 of failing to appear at a congressional subcommittee hearing. She was later sentenced to prison for lying to Congress."" To find the last person found guilty of contempt of Congress charges, you have to go back another decade to 1974, when G. Gordon Liddy, a Watergate conspirator, was convicted of the charge. 10 May 1974, Fri Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California) Newspapers.com Bannon is the first person to be indicted on contempt of Congress charges since 1983, and he could become the first person to be found guilty of those charges since 1974. The DOJ noted in its release that ""all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."" If Bannon is found guilty, he'll face a maximum sentence of one year in jail for each charge. Each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail, as well as a fine of $100 to $1,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

However, under statutes governing universal voting by mail in those elections, the ballot distribution system would have expired at the end of 2021. According to Assembly Bill 37 : Existing law requires county elections officials to mail a ballot to every registered voter for all elections proclaimed or conducted prior to January 1, 2022. [...] This bill would extend the requirements to mail a ballot to every registered voter to all elections and apply them to all local elections officials. Both the temporary and permeant measures drew sharp criticism from political conservatives, who argued the process of mailing ballots to millions of people could open the door to fraud. [See also from Snopes: Do Mail-In Ballots Increase Risk of Voter Fraud? ] Before Newsom's approval of AB 37, for example, opponents drew attention to how county officials track who is — and who isn't — an active voter, the Los Angeles Times reported . ""Active"" and ""registered"" voters are residents who are legally able to vote; have filled out paperwork to submit their names to the voting registrar; and are reachable via their addresses on file. In a story about the permanent change, the L.A. Times wrote: One persistent criticism focuses on elections officials’ use of a list of inactive voters , those who may still be eligible to vote but haven’t been reachable at their mailing address on file and who haven’t cast ballots in recent elections. In some situations, inactive registrations are canceled after a voter fails to participate in two consecutive federal elections. When errors do occur, critics have insisted without any clear evidence that the mistakes are an indicator of larger, systemic problems. AB 37 stipulates that ballots can’t be mailed to anyone on a county’s inactive voter list. Republican lawmakers sought additional rules for how counties should maintain their lists of active and inactive voters. Those opponents also pushed unsuccessfully for stronger restrictions on who can turn in a completed ballot at designated drop-off sites or polling stations, as well as a shorter window for when ballots postmarked by Election Day can count, the LA Times reported. Supporters, however, believe the law makes voting in elections easier for more people. “Data shows that sending everyone a ballot in the mail provides voters access. And when voters get ballots in the mail, they vote,” Assemblyman Marc Berman, D-Palo Alto, the bill’s author, said during a Senate committee hearing in July 2021, as reported by the Los Angeles Times . That was indeed the case after California officials mailed every registered voter a ballot in the 2020 presidential election between former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Almost 17.8 million people turned in completed ballots, according to the L.A. Times. That number accounted for about 71% of eligible voters, or the highest such percentage since 1951. “Last year we took unprecedented steps to ensure all voters had the opportunity to cast a ballot during the pandemic and today we are making those measures permanent after record-breaking participation in the 2020 presidential election,” Newsom said in the Sept. 27 release. With Newsom's approval of AB 37, California joined a handful of other U.S. states with the same type of programs, including Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Colorado. But, as the L.A. Times' story noted, no other state’s effort is comparable due to California's population and the law's scope.","On September 27, 2021, rumors circulated on social media that California had changed its election laws to automatically mail ballots to all registered voters in future elections. This claim was true, as Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation that permanently requires county election departments to mail every active and registered voter a ballot weeks before Election Day. The legislation, known as Assembly Bill 37, extends the requirements to mail a ballot to every registered voter for all elections and applies to all local election officials. Before this law, officials had sent all registered voters a ballot during the 2020 presidential election and the 2021 failed attempt to recall Governor Newsom due to pandemic-related disruptions. However, the distribution system was only temporary and would have expired at the end of 2021 under previous state statutes.

In Sept. 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order saying that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated by Nov. 22, 2021. Another order required vaccinations of all contractors who did business with the federal government. According to the White House website : Building on the President’s announcement in July to strengthen safety requirements for unvaccinated federal workers, the President has signed an Executive Order to take those actions a step further and require all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated. The President also signed an Executive Order directing that this standard be extended to employees of contractors that do business with the federal government. Conservative website The Blaze reported that this meant that members of Congress and their staff did not fall under this mandate. This is correct. The vaccine mandate refers to employees working in the executive branch of government. This covers the president, the vice president, and their offices, which include their advisors and staffers, the cabinet appointed by the president, and heads of various federal agencies. The mandate covers federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and more. The armed forces are also included in the executive branch. According to the White House , the total number of people employed in this branch are 4 million. The legislative and judicial branches are separate from the executive branch, and do not fall under this vaccine mandate. Biden also cannot mandate as president that all Americans get vaccinated. That is up to each state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in April 2021, “We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.  That's just not what we can do.  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't. I can't go to the Capitol Physician and say, ‘Give me the names of people who aren't vaccinated, so I can go encourage them or make it known to others to encourage them to be vaccinated.’  So we can't – we can't do that.” In August, a group of House Democrats called on the Capitol physician to institute a vaccine mandate for House members. In early August 2021 , Pelosi said that Congress would follow the guidance of Capitol Physician Brian Monahan. She added, “In a matter of days or weeks, the full approval [from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] will be given to the vaccines, that I think will make a difference in terms of what we can do.” That approval came through on Aug. 23, 2021. In July 2021, Monahan issued an indoor mask mandate for House members and their staffs. This did not extend to the Senate. A vaccination mandate still hasn’t been enforced in Congress. As such, we rate this claim as “True.”","Snopes, a website that fact-checks rumors and misinformation, is still addressing an “infodemic” related to COVID-19.

The vaccine mandate applies to federal agencies and the armed forces within the executive branch but does not extend to employees of the legislative or judicial branches. Members of Congress and their staff are not subject to the vaccine mandate because they are not executive branch employees. In April 2021, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated that individuals could not be required to be vaccinated because it is a matter of privacy. Although Monahan, Capitol Physician, mandated indoor mask-wearing, a vaccination mandate has not been enforced in Congress.

"In mid-September 2021, social media users were surprised by a photograph of a billboard that contained a biblical quote that appeared to compare former U.S. President Donald Trump to Jesus, the central figure of the Christian religion. According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, the billboard was on Highway 27 in the city of Fort Oglethorpe, which is in Georgia, but was removed on Sept. 13, 2021. It contained a portion of a prophetic Bible verse from the book of Isaiah, and a picture of Trump, leading some to conclude that the billboard likened Trump with a deity, if not Jesus. An image of the billboard was posted on Twitter by Washington Post journalist Eugene Scott: Although the sign says ""Romans 8:17"" on the bottom right, the verse is actually the first part of Isaiah 9:6 . Isaiah 9:6 in its entirety reads , in the King James Version: ""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."" The verse is a familiar one, and as the Free Times Press editor Clint Cooper pointed out, ""Christians and biblical scholars believe the words prophesy the coming of Jesus Christ."" In fact, as Cooper further pointed out, the verse is the chorus to Handel's ""Messiah."" Romans 8:17 reads , ""And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."" We reached out to Reagan, the billboard company listed on the bottom of the sign, asking why it was taken down, and will update if we receive a response. Cooper contacted Reagan general manager Scott Hibberts, who told him that the company doesn't reveal the identity of clients.","A billboard featuring a biblical quote and former U.S. President Donald Trump's picture was removed from Highway 27 in Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia on September 13, 2021.

"In the days following the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Snopes readers asked us to determine the validity of a viral photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Joe Biden pulling down his mask to yell something at a ceremony to honor the attacks' victims. A Sept. 13, 2021, column by Newsweek's editorial board claimed: At the 20th anniversary memorial for 9/11, top Democratic politicians all wore masks for a photo op. Then, as soon as the television cameras were off, the masks came off. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. Kathy Hochul are masked one minute, unmasked and talking the next. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hers off. President Biden even pulls his mask down to yell at someone. The idiocy. For the purpose of this fact check, we'll focus on the simple assertion: that the president briefly removed his COVID-19 facial covering to communicate something at a 9/11 memorial service. The claim stemmed from a real event that took place at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in Lower Manhattan, where the World Trade Center towers once stood. On Sept. 11, 2021, officials including Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gathered there for a memorial service that included a moment of silence and name-reading of victims, as reported by multiple reputable news outlets . And it was true that, while standing in the crowd, Biden on at least two occasions temporarily pulled down his mask to communicate something, according to photographic evidence. Considering that verified proof to substantiate the claim, we rate this claim ""True."" Getty Images photographers Chip Somodevilla and Ed Jones documented the moments in a series of photographs from the event, including those displayed in the following tweet. Within that group of photos, the the most controversial image (the featured photograph of this report) included the below-transcribed caption in Getty Images' database: NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 11: President Joe Biden (C) calls out as he is joined by (L-R) former President Bill Clinton, former First Lady Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, First Lady Jill Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, during the annual 9/11 Commemoration Ceremony at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum on September 11, 2021 in New York City. During the ceremony six moments of silence were held, marking when each of the World Trade Center towers was struck and fell and the times corresponding to the attack on the Pentagon and the crash of Flight 93. The nation is marking the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, when the terrorist group al-Qaeda flew hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center, Shanksville, PA and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 people. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In other words, according to at least one reputable photojournalist who witnessed the scene, Biden indeed removed his mask to ""call out"" something while attending the commemoration event. However, the reasons why — or circumstances under which — Biden made the gesture were not made clear by that item of reporting. Also unclear was when, exactly, the moment occurred: before the ceremony began, during its activities, or after its closing. We reached out to Somodevilla for the answers to those questions, and we will update this report when, or if, we hear back from the photojournalist. Meanwhile, we obtained C-SPAN's live recording of the day's multiple commemoration ceremonies. Roughy 1.5 hours in, the footage showed Biden and his entourage walking in to the event at ground zero. Then, over the course of minutes, cameras from various angles focused on him and other politicians greeting members of the crowd. During those conversations before the service's start, Biden pulled down his mask to apparently say something to people around him, the footage showed. That split-second moment, which Jones captured via the below-displayed photo, was separate from the instance mentioned above based on Biden's positioning in the crowd (next to first lady Jill Biden and the Obamas). (Photo by Ed Jones-Pool/Getty Images) Shortly after that gesture, the C-SPAN footage showed, the crowd including the politicians assembled to mark the beginning of the memorial service with a flag ceremony and the Star-Spangled Banner . (The video recording did not include the other moment of Biden temporarily removing his mask captured by Somodevilla.) To conclude our research, we reached out to the White House. Our inquiry included a link to Somodevilla's photo showing Biden ""calling out"" something with his mask away from his face, and the explicit questions: What was the president saying in that moment, specifically, and to whom, or what, was he saying it? In sum, it was true the president temporarily pulled down his mask at least twice at a gathering to honor 9/11 victims, and, in one instance, a reputable photojournalist said he ""called out"" an unspecified word or phrase. However, what the president said in both moments, and with whom or what he was communicating, were unknown. Also undetermined was when — either before, during, or after commemoration activities — the photographs were taken.

"Origin Activists from the hacker collective Anonymous took down the website of the Texas Republican Party in protest against a restrictive law that has the effect of banning most abortions. The law, SB8, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021, bans abortions at about six weeks. The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them. The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website , but view with caution: It is graphic.)

Texas Republicans acknowledged the vandalism with a statement on their website claiming it prompted them to ramp up their online security. The statement was accompanied by fields allowing website visitors to enter their payment card information and make a donation.

"In September 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the implementation of a controversial Texas state law that effectively bans most abortions, prompting an outraged response among Democrats, pro-choice activists, celebrities, and some sectors of corporate America . Texas Senate Bill (S.B.) 8 , signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on May 19 and implemented on Sept. 1, bans any and all abortions after the ""first detectable heartbeat"" of a fetus, an event that can take place as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It also allows a private citizen to sue any woman who undergoes an abortion after this point, or anyone who assists her, regardless of whether the citizen has any personal connection to those individuals. According to a widely shared Facebook post, one of the major U.S. companies to announce its opposition to the law was the ride-sharing app Lyft.

Kordalewski introduced the letter by writing, ""Dear friends. Here is a screenshot of an email I received from Lyft yesterday. Go make good choices."" The letter itself read as follows: Dear Lyft Riders and Drivers, A new Texas law, SB8, threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go - specifically, women exercising their right to choose and to access the healthcare they need. We want to be clear: Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride. Similarly, riders never have to justify, or even share, where they are going and why. Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law. Both are completely unacceptable. This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company. We are taking action on two fronts: Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. Riders and Drivers: Nothing about how you drive, ride or interact with each other should change. TX SB8 is an attack on women’s right to choose.

Conviction and Exoneration





In the early hours of April 20, 1989, the body of a woman barely clinging to life was discovered in Central Park. Assaulted and left for dead, the 28-year-old jogger, Trisha Meili, would survive grave injuries and a coma with no memory of the events. Within days of the attack, McCray, 15; Richardson, 14; Salaam, 15; Santana, 14; and Wise, 16, implicated themselves in Meili's rape and beating after hours of psychological pressure and aggressive interrogation at the hands of seasoned homicide detectives.
The police announced to a press hungry for sensational crime stories that the young men had been part of a gang of teenagers who were out ""wilding,"" assaulting joggers and bicyclists in Central Park that evening. The ensuing media frenzy was met with a public outcry for justice. The young men were tried as adults under New York laws of the day — and convicted, despite inconsistent and inaccurate confessions, DNA evidence that excluded them, and no eyewitness accounts that connected them to the victim.
On December 19, 2002, Justice Charles J. Tejada of the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted a motion to vacate the thirteen-year-old convections in the infamous case. He did so based on new evidence: a shocking confession from a serial rapist, Matias Reyes, and a positive DNA match to back it up. A year later, the men filed civil lawsuits against the City of New York, and the police officers and prosecutors who had worked toward their conviction. In 2014, they settled that civil case for $41 million dollars. Despite their exoneration, the police and prosecutors involved in the case maintain that they were guilty of the crime.

","The Central Park Five were five teenagers who were accused and convicted of raping and beating a jogger in Central Park, New York City in 1989. The victim, Trisha Meili, was left for dead and suffered severe injuries. Within days, the young men - Yusef Salaam, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray, and Korey Wise - were arrested and interrogated for hours, ultimately confessing to the crime.

"On March 12, 2023, social media users spread the claim that 15 banks in the U.S. had shut down under former U.S. President Donald Trump. We found the claim to be true. The subject emerged in partisan discussions of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse on March 10. With $209 billion in assets when it closed, it was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind Washington Mutual's failure in 2008. Silicon Valley Bank's failure also prompted regulators to close Signature Bank, which was the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank had $110 billion in assets when it closed. Another bank, Silvergate Capitol, announced its intent to wind down operations and liquidate its assets on March 8. MarketWatch reported the bank was facing multiple lawsuits that accused the bank of not having adequate protections to detect money laundering on its platform. The bank had $11 billion in assets at the end of 2022. ""More people should be talking about the fact that 15 banks failed while Donald Trump was president,"" said a Twitter post from progressive political action committee MeidasTouch . Playing the same game of partisan ""whataboutism,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that he didn't remember any banks collapsing during his father's administration, prompting journalist Jake Sherman to provide a list: Banks did fail under trump. many. here is the list of bank failures. https://t.co/EdDZDwrsSL https://t.co/6SIbHMbr6v — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) March 12, 2023 According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) , there were indeed 15 bank failures during Trump's presidency: four in 2020, four in 2019 and seven in 2017. Additionally, Harvest Community Bank , which was located in New Jersey, closed on Jan. 13, 2017, a week before Trump took office. Here is a list of the banks that closed, with dates of closure: Seaway Bank and Trust Company: Jan. 27, 2017 Proficio Bank: March 3, 2017 First NBC Bank: April 28, 2017 Guaranty Bank, (doing business as BestBank in Georgia & Michigan): May 5, 2017 Fayette County Bank: May 26, 2017 The Farmers and Merchants State Bank of Argonia: October 13, 2017 Washington Federal Bank for Savings: December 15, 2017 The Enloe State Bank: May 31, 2019 Louisa Community Bank: October 25, 2019 Resolute Bank: October 25, 2019 City National Bank of New Jersey: November 1, 2019 Ericson State Bank: February 14, 2020 The First State Bank: April 3, 2020 First City Bank of Florida: October 16, 2020 Almena State Bank: October 23, 2020 The partisan blame game fails to address economic factors underlying bank failures. Many factors could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. Attributing those failures solely to the political party in power ignores those nuances, as well as what lessons can be learned to prevent other banks from failing in the future. The banks that closed during Trump's presidency were significantly smaller in size. The largest was Seaway Bank and Trust Company, which had $361.2 million in assets when it failed in 2017.","It has been claimed on social media that 15 banks in the United States were shut down during former President Donald Trump's tenure.

"As U.S. President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 22, 2023, after a surprise visit to Ukraine , videos of him stumbling while climbing stairs to Air Force One went viral. The footage appeared to show him walking up the stairs, and, near the top, stumbling slightly and falling forward. He caught himself, stood up and continued to climb. Sharing the clip, Liz Wheeler, the host of a conservative political commentary podcast, wrote on Twitter, ""Joe Biden trips and falls up the stairs on Air Force One."" To determine whether the clip was real or miscaptioned, we looked for longer videos of Biden's walk up the stairs from reputable news sources. By examining footage from Sky News, for instance, at the 18-minute mark, we saw Biden did indeed stumble: We reached out to the White House for confirmation and received its pool report for the day. That document read: ""The president boarded at 5:34. About half way up the main stairs he stumbled and fell forward. He quickly recovered, stood and continued to the door, giving a quick wave before going in."" Given that acknowledgment from the White House, as well as the clear, undoctored video evidence that shows Biden stumbling, we rate this claim as ""True."" The videos of the fall are not to be confused with miscaptioned footage from earlier in the trip — a clip that supposedly showed Biden falling down the stairs when disembarking from Air Force One. In that video, the individual who fell was not actually the president. Critics of Biden used the Feb. 22 slip to comment on Biden's health, question his fitness for office, and recall his past stumbles . (We have covered Biden's falls before, including a time he fell off a bicycle in 2022. Also, the February 2023 incident was not the first time cameras caught Biden tripping while boarding Air Force One.) We should note that questioning a president's physical and mental health is a reoccurring trend no matter who is in in the Oval Office or their political affiliation.","After a surprise visit to Ukraine, President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland on Feb. 22, 2023.

"In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking. At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part , from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole — an avid cigar smoker — had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control."" Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars."" Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned , that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking. Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True.""","In 2007, Nancy Pelosi, the former Speaker of the House, prohibited smoking in the Capitol, including the Speaker's Lobby.

"In early January 2023, as Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy suffered numerous vote losses in his quest to become speaker of the House, where his party held a slim majority, Mitch McConnell, his counterpart in the Senate and minority leader, broke the record as the longest-serving senator in the chamber's history. Republicans remained divided on McCarthy as House speaker due to a small but vocal group on the far right. Meanwhile, as of this writing, former U.S. President Donald Trump was attempting to divert Republican ire toward McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, using anti-Asian rhetoric to refer to the latter. In a post on TruthSocial on Jan. 4, 2023, he wrote: ""we ought to be fighting Mitch McConnell and his domineering, China loving BOSS, I mean wife, Coco Chow. The harm they have done to the Republican Party is incalculable."" We noticed, however, that back in 2018 all of these parties appeared to be on the same page. A photograph of McCarthy and Chao, who was then -U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration and who was speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, made the rounds on the internet. This photograph is authentic. The panel they were speaking on was titled "" Strategic Outlook: United States "" and was moderated by Gerard Baker, who was editor-at-large at The Wall Street Journal. They were joined by Kirstjen Neilsen, then-U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. The full panel can be found here , and you can see a screenshot of it below: (Screenshot via World Economic Forum) At the time, McCarthy was serving as House majority leader. In the panel, around the 2:34 mark, he mentioned having dinner at the house of Klaus Schwab, the chairperson of the WEF. ""You've got to understand what does 'America First' mean,"" McCarthy said in the talk. ""We wanted to focus on the economics of America, we want the citizens to be safe at home and abroad. ""As I sat around Klaus' dinner last night, what's interesting is the number of countries who are now talking about their tax system,"" he continued , explaining the reasoning behind Trumps' ""America First"" slogan. ""With doing something as big as the tax change [...] the economics of America rising helps the rest of the world. It also helps from a safety perspective around the world."" After the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Chao criticized Trump and resigned from her position. In late 2022, Trump also blamed her and McConnell for the ""turmoil"" in the Republican party, while continuing to use racist language against her. McConnell, meanwhile, appeared alongside Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden in early January 2023 to promote bipartisan efforts to improve infrastructure. While much of his career has been spent stymying the Democratic agenda, McConnell was increasingly criticizing Trump and shifting toward promoting a more bipartisan image. We therefore rate the above claim as a ""True.""","In early January 2023, Mitch McConnell broke the record as the longest-serving senator in the history of the Senate.

"Screenshots supposedly showing statements by former U.S. President Donald Trump about House Republicans' vote to elect a speaker circulated widely on Jan. 4, 2023. In the statements, Trump endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the leadership position. The screenshots indeed depicted authentic statements by the former president. He shared them on his social media platform, Truth Social, after McCarthy failed to secure enough support from members of his own party in multiple rounds of voting on Jan. 3.

In an interview with NBC News, Trump declined to reiterate his support for McCarthy as House speaker, saying, ""We'll see how it all works out."" Then, on Jan. 4, that stance shifted with the above-displayed Truth Social post. (Roughly 20 minutes after posting the endorsement, Trump posted again , urging Republicans turn their ire to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.) While Trump's post supporting McCarthy for House speaker was indeed an official statement from the former president, less accurate — or completely fake — screenshots supposedly showing his posts or press releases are quite popular on social media. For example, we've previously covered fake statements that supposedly showed Trump calling Mike Pence a ""dog,"" insulting Joe Rogan, responding to Biden's COVID-19 diagnosis, and criticizing Liz Cheney . Some of McCarthy's most vocal opponents remain loyal to Trump. Another vote for House speaker will be held on Jan. 4.

"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" Image via Washington Post Carlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley. Maybe you could meet or speak to him and he could send you a very brief resume with his interests and grades attached."" She also wrote: ""Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission's Office about Buckley."" Biden wrote back that he would be honored to help. ""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said. Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here."" When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!"" Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it."" He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said . He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post. Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father."" He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching.""

You probably couldn't do it unless your dad happened to be the president, and that's how Hunter Biden pulled that off.""","Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has repeatedly criticized Hunter Biden for allegedly benefiting from his father's position, once sought his help in getting his son Buckley into Georgetown University.

In the emails, Carlson's wife asked Biden to write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admissions Office on behalf of their son. Biden agreed to help, and Carlson thanked him for writing the letter. Carlson has since become a vocal critic of Hunter Biden, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs"" because of his father's position. Carlson has refused to comment on the emails, citing claims of Russian disinformation.

"In October 2021, social media posts and news outlets reported that the new Ohio license plate, whose design Gov. Mike DeWine had just unveiled, contained a notable historical inaccuracy. For example, one Twitter user wrote, ""Holy shit.

But the banner's facing the other way."" The unveiling of the new license plate design, at a news conference on Oct. 21, can be watched below.

"Fact Check Former U.S President Jimmy Carter was considered to be ahead of his time on issues surrounding climate change, exemplified by his installation of solar panels on the rooftop of the White House in the 1970s. Years later, Reagan removed the panels when he came into power, and they returned decades after, during the Obama administration. Some sources have reported that the solar panels installed by Obama are still in place. We are in the process of verifying that. A photograph of Carter showing off the panels he had installed at a dedication ceremony in 1979 was popular on Reddit in September 2022: The above caption does correctly state that Carter displayed the solar panels to guests at the White House, but it's incorrect as to when Carter’s successor, President Ronald Reagan, had the panels removed. Carter had 32 panels installed there, and for seven years they were used to heat water in the household until the Reagan administration removed them in 1986 -- not two years later as the post claims. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History , which now has one of the original panels in its collection, they were a symbol of Carter’s faith in “the power of the sun.” The above photograph is taken from the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library collection, and was published in The New York Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . The same image can be seen on Britannica . The New York Times' caption stated: “In 1979, President Carter showed off new solar panels on the West Wing that would provide hot water for the White House.” Various shots from that event are available in the National Archives catalog , and shots of that particular moment can be seen in the bottom half of the photographic film scans. These photographs were taken at the White House dedication event for the solar panels. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library At the ceremony, which was held in June 1979, Carter said : In the year 2000 this solar water heater behind me, which is being dedicated today, will still be here supplying cheap, efficient energy [...] A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people. Other photographs from the same event show the panels more clearly displayed on the rooftop of the White House's Cabinet Room, which is where the dedication event appears to take place. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library What happened to those panels after they were removed? According to Scientific American , one ended up at the National Museum of American History, one is in the Carter Library, and one is at the Solar Science and Technology Museum in Dezhou, China. Solar panels made a comeback at the White House during former President George W. Bush's tenure in 2002, but not on the Executive Mansion's roof. According to the White House Historical Association , the National Park Service oversaw installation of three solar energy systems on the White House grounds starting in 2002. The installation during his tenure helped heat up the White House swimming pool. In 2010, then-U.S. President Barack Obama announced that solar panels would once again be installed on the White House rooftop. The installation was completed in 2014 . The video below highlights the process: We reached out to the White House Historical Association to learn if any updates or changes were made to the panels during the Trump administration. They shared with us a photograph from a July 2021 news article in which the panels are still visible, stating, ""It appears from photographers that the panels are still installed on the roof.""

"A photograph that's frequently shared online appears to show a younger Hillary Clinton, perhaps back in her days as U.S. first lady, playing a Game Boy while seated on a flight. Was the picture altered? Was Clinton perhaps originally using an old Palm PDA (personal digital assistant) or something else before someone doctored the photo with Adobe Photoshop? The answer to those two questions is no. The truth is that Clinton was authentically photographed while playing a Game Boy. The picture was captured by photographer Ralph Alswang on April 20, 2015. It was posted to Instagram by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library & Museum, which was named for her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton.

It's unclear if Clinton carried extras. On May 24, 1993, Carol Jouzaitis with Chicago Tribune reported that the Game Boy belonged to Clinton's daughter, Chelsea. We don't know what game Clinton was playing since the angle of the photograph obscured the title on the cartridge. However, two good guesses would be Super Mario Land and Tetris. The games were included in some of the bundles that were packaged with the original Game Boy. On July 19, 1994, Sara Williams reported for the News-Press in Fort Myers, Florida, that she did some digging in an attempt to find out what games Clinton enjoyed the most: She's dressed to the nines. Her hair is done to perfection in one of the 15 styles she wears. She's kicked off her shoes. The most powerful man in the free world rubs her toes. Faxes, dispatches, and telephone calls are on hold as she wings her way to Europe on Air Force One. She needs to unwind. So what does she choose? Game Boy. ""I've become fond of Game Boy,"" she recently told Redbook magazine. Yes, Hillary Clinton loves video games. … So I called up the White House to find out exactly what games Hillary Clinton plays on which machines, only to learn that this is a state secret. ""If we said what Mrs. Clinton likes to play, it could be considered an endorsement,"" said a press aide. It could also be an embarrassment. ""Tetris,"" after all, was invented in Russia at least 15 years ago, quite possibly as a sop to the hungry and disgruntled masses who had no access to the goods.

"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother.""

"Fact Check On Aug. 25, 2022, the official Twitter account for the White House posted a tweet criticizing comments by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in which she stated her disagreement with the Biden administration's plan to forgive some federal student loan debt. In the video included in the tweet above, Greene used an appearance on right wing broadcaster Newsmax to opine that it's ""completely unfair"" to some taxpayers, namely those that didn't take out a student loan, to ""have to pay off the great big student loan debt"" of others. The White House's clap-back tweet was in reference to reports that Taylor Commercial, a construction company owned by Greene and her husband, received money through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The tactic has been used to attack other conservatives, although in the case of commentator Ben Shapiro, it backfired because he didn't get a $20,832 PPP loan, as some had claimed. U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) records show Greene's company accepted $182,300 in PPP loan money in April 2020, and that it was ""Paid in full or forgiven,"" which refers to loans ""repaid and those fully forgiven from repayment under PPP guidelines,"" per the SBA. A database of PPP loans provided by the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica, which obtained data from the SBA via public records, shows that Taylor Commercial had a total of $183,504 forgiven, including accrued interest. We reached out to Greene's office asking for comment on the controversy, and were provided a statement that didn't address the student loan/PPP loan discourse, but instead pointed to swatting incidents targeting Greene's home. ""It's a shame that [U.S. President] Joe Biden and his spokesmen in the media continue to make MTG a target simply because she is outspoken against Democrat policies, like genital mutilation surgeries for minors,"" the statement read, a likely reference to surgeries performed on some transgender people as part of gender affirming care (although such procedures are rarely performed on minors). There is important context to this controversy, namely that student loans and PPP loans are entirely different in their purpose and structure. PPP loans were given during the COVID-19 pandemic to businesses with the expectation that, if used as intended, they would be forgiven. Many businesses had no choice but to cease or curtail operations during the height of the pandemic, and the program was intended to prevent them from laying off workers or going under. Student loans, on the other hand, are sought by those seeking higher education and are taken out with the expectation that they will be paid back.","On August 25, 2022, the White House's Twitter account criticized U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's comments opposing the Biden administration's plan to forgive some federal student loan debt.

"Fact Check Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, was laid to rest at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, based on media reports and photographs taken of the site. New York Post reporters visited the golf club and photographed Ivana Trump’s grave. Their report included a number of shots from different angles, including one revealing a wooded area near the site. A source told the New York Post that Ivana was buried not too far from the club house. According to the report, she was buried in a place that was not visible to golfers as they tee off for a round of golf. The small section of the club where she was buried is below the backside of the first tee. A number of memes consisting of edited versions of those photographs went viral in late July 2022, with one in particular getting tens of thousands of likes and comments on Instagram. The image — posted by Instagram account homegrownterrorists — showed a golf cart rolling past what appeared to be Ivana Trump's gravesite. It's clear that this photograph is fake when it's compared to the pictures published in the New York Post article . The gravesite has been inserted into a wider shot of a golf cart on a golf course fairway. Unlike the Post's photographs, the manipulated image doesn’t show a wooded area immediately adjacent to the grave. A separate rumor speculates that Trump used the burial site for tax break purposes. Indeed, the New Jersey tax code does exempt cemetery land from all taxes, rates, and assessments. Potentially, her grave could save the property from paying a significant sum in a state with high tax rates. According to the code , a cemetery company is exempt from paying real property taxes, income taxes, sales and use taxes, business taxes, and inheritance taxes; cemetery trust funds are also exempt from taxes. Trump has expressed his desire to be buried at the New Jersey golf course for years. His company even described it as his “favorite property” in a 2014 filing with the state. A 2017 Washington Post report revealed how he had been trying to convince local authorities to let him build cemeteries at the golf course since 2007. After numerous attempts, two of his plans were approved around 2017, but construction for them had not begun. The 2017 report said that the Trump Organization still needed to apply for state approval to make the land a public cemetery. However, Ivana Trump is the first known family member to be buried at the Bedminster golf club. Brooke Harrington , a sociology professor at Dartmouth and tax researcher, pointed out that the tax code has no stipulation for a minimum number of human remains needed for the tax breaks to apply. Documents published by ProPublica show that the Trump Family Trust had sought to designate a property in nearby Hackettstown, New Jersey, as a non-profit cemetery company. However, this was not the first time Trump had been accused of trying to reduce his taxes on the property by varying its use. A 2016 Wall Street Journal report found that the golf club benefited from a farmland tax break because part of the land was designated for agricultural purposes — specifically for hay production and a small herd of goats. The Huffington Post reported in 2019 that he had saved around $88,000 that year. New Jersey laws state “a landowner must have no less than five acres of farmland actively devoted to an agricultural or horticultural use for the two years immediately preceding the tax year being applied for and meet specific minimum gross income requirements based on the productivity of the land.” A representative for the Trump Organization told Fortune magazine that the links being drawn between Ivana Trump's gravesite and tax laws were “truly evil.” While it is unknown if the choice of this location for her grave had any connection to taxes, the Trump family has a history of seeking ways to reduce tax bills. Furthermore, given the photographs, and an acknowledgement from a Trump representative regarding the location of her grave while denying the rumors connecting it to tax laws, we rate the overall claim as “True.”","Ivana Trump, the first wife of former U.S. President Donald Trump, was buried at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to media reports and photographs taken at the site.

In our research, we found a variety of sources that confirmed that the key points made in the viral copypasta were accurate. The viral Facebook post about DeSantis ' life began with the following bit about an April 2021 segment on the CBS News program, ""60 Minutes"": Just in case you were wondering why 60 minutes had a hit piece on this Paisan - the Governor of Florida. Anyone who criticizes him - I have a question for you - can you please post your education and service to our country resume so we can put things in perspective? The controversy surrounding the episode of ""60 Minutes"" was addressed in an opinion piece published by Poynter. According to the article, the news magazine TV show failed to provide ""substantial evidence"" after claiming that DeSantis gave the Publix grocery store chain ""preferential treatment to distribute COVID-19 vaccines."" The charge was that DeSantis favored Publix simply because they donated to his campaign. He responded to the segment by calling it ""irresponsible"" and ""a lie."" According to the Poynter article, ""it doesn’t appear as if DeSantis did anything wrong."" The rest of the Facebook post recounted DeSantis' accomplishments before entering politics. It read as follows: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida, when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the U.S. Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal. #DeSantis #leadership We weren't able to find documentation to verify the exact dates cited for all of these items. However, we did confirm with the following sources that the key points and details about DeSantis' life and career in both law and the military are accurate.","After receiving inquiries from readers, we conducted an investigation into a viral Facebook post about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The post, which began circulating in May 2021 and was later copied and pasted by numerous users, contained claims about DeSantis' accomplishments in law and the military. We found that the key points made in the viral post were accurate, according to various sources.

The Facebook post began with a reference to a controversial April 2021 segment of ""60 Minutes"" that accused DeSantis of giving preferential treatment to the Publix grocery store chain for COVID-19 vaccine distribution because they donated to his campaign. However, the Poynter opinion piece noted that the show failed to provide substantial evidence to support its claims. DeSantis called the segment ""irresponsible"" and ""a lie,"" and it appears that he did nothing wrong.

The rest of the Facebook post recounted DeSantis' life and accomplishments before he entered politics. DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, and grew up in Orlando and Dunedin. He played on the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in 1991. DeSantis went on to attend Yale University, where he played baseball and graduated magna cum laude in history in 2001. He then taught history at the Darlington School before attending Harvard Law School, where he graduated cum laude in 2005.

DeSantis received a commission as a Reserve Naval officer and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005 and was promoted to lieutenant the following year. He worked with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility and was deployed to Iraq with SEAL Team One in 2007 as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah.

"Fact Check The reporting below reflects facts as of July 2022. When Liz Truss resigned months later, on Oct. 20, we published a new story about Larry outlasting four, not three, British prime ministers. Being the first cat of the United Kingdom is not an easy job, especially when you have to deal with a revolving door of prime ministers. In July 2022, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader – and eventually as prime minister – after a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers. While Johnson announced he would stay on until a replacement was selected, someone else will have a longer tenure than him: Larry the cat has been in residence at 10 Downing Street since Feb. 15, 2011, according to the British government’s official page , and was the first cat to hold the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. He was adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. According to the official government website , he has many roles: He has captured the hearts of the Great British public and the press teams often camped outside the front door. In turn the nation sends him gifts and treats daily. Larry spends his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences and testing antique furniture for napping quality. His day-to-day responsibilities also include contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house. Larry says this is still ‘in tactical planning stage’. Larry has also outlasted three prime ministers, assuming he will still be present at 10 Downing Street after Johnson leaves his role. He arrived toward the early part of David Cameron’s tenure from 2010 to 2016, was a part of the household through Theresa May’s time from 2016 to 2019, and is expected to outlast Johnson’s tenure in the office. Cameron was believed to have a chilly relationship with Larry, and he posted a picture of the cat in his lap in an effort to dispel such rumors. May also hinted that she was more of a dog person. While a timetable for Johnson’s replacement had yet to be confirmed as of this writing, it took several weeks before he took over from his predecessor May. Larry himself has not commented on the upcoming changes. Meanwhile, Larry is expected to be waiting in 10 Downing Street and will likely be unimpressed with whoever is the new occupant.","Larry the cat, the Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office, has been a resident of 10 Downing Street since February 2011, according to the official UK government website.

"Fact Check On June 25, 2022, The Matt Walsh Blog Twitter account purportedly responded to a question on the subject of abortion, apparently believing that a picture of an elephant fetus was that of a human.

In response, Walsh or someone with control of his account chose to quote-tweet the question instead of inserting a traditional reply underneath, answering with, ""Yes."" The tweet then vanished from Walsh's account after @samthielman revealed that the image showed that of an elephant fetus. Before Walsh's tweet disappeared, it had already been liked thousands of times. According to two sources , the picture truly did show a fetus of an elephant. Before Walsh engaged with the elephant fetus image, another tweet on Walsh's account read, ""Could not be happier to see the pain and heartbreak of abortionists. Absolutely loving every minute of it."" This may have been what prompted the back-and-forth discussion with @samthielman.

"Fact Check An Indiana man won the Republican primary for local county elections in early May 2022, while in jail facing accusations of murdering his wife. Andrew Wilhoite, a local farmer , was running for one of the three open seats on the Clinton Township Board. He was charged in March 2022 with killing his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth “Nikki” Wilhoite. Wilhoite, however, withdrew from the ballot in mid-May 2022. He did not give a reason for the withdrawal. If he were to be convicted for a felony before the November general elections, his name would have been withdrawn from the ballots by election officials. He was incarcerated when police accused him of striking his wife in the head with a blunt object. Investigators said that he then “placed her into a vehicle and drove to a nearby creek where he dumped her body.” Prosecutors charged him with a level 1 murder felony. Wilhoite initially lied about his wife’s whereabouts, before admitting that he killed her after she attacked him, according to prosecutors. According to the local news Lebanon Reporter , Elizabeth had completed her last chemotherapy session and was seeking a divorce when she learned her husband had an affair with another woman. According to the affidavit, Wilhoite confessed that Elizabeth charged at him on the porch and he hit her with a “gallon-sized concrete flowerpot with dirt in it.” She fell to the ground and he did not know what to do, so he put her in his pickup truck. He described how he drove to a bridge over the creek and threw her over the wall and into the creek. The police were alerted after Elizabeth’s coworker asked them to check on her when she did not arrive for work saying that the couple had domestic troubles. Their three children had also been trying to get in touch with Elizabeth. According to election records , he received 60 votes for his seat, while the other Republican candidates received 100 and 106 votes respectively for the remaining seats. Wilhoite remained on the ballot as he faced murder charges in jail, and his jury trial was set to begin in August 2022.

"Fact Check On May 25, 2022, progressive political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen tweeted , "" Guns are banned at the NRA convention in Texas this weekend when Trump speaks. Let that sink in."" We found that this was a true statement, as it was announced that the U.S. Secret Service was set to take over control of the room for the NRA event when former U.S. President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak. The convention, formally known as the National Rifle Association Annual Meeting (NRA AM), was set to begin on May 27 inside the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas . The tweet was posted in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde , which is also located in Texas. On May 24, three days before the convention was set to begin, a gunman took the lives of at least 19 children and two adults before he also was killed by a Border Patrol agent who responded to the scene. A report from NPR.org linked to the NRA convention website , which confirmed that guns would be banned during the event that included Trump's speech. It showed that the former president's address would be happening on on May 27, sometime between 2:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. in the Central time zone: Join NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, NRA-ILA Executive Director Jason Ouimet, and our nation's top Second Amendment supporters for the 2022 NRA-ILA Leadership Forum on Friday, May 27th.

You will not be allowed in the General Assembly Hall with any of the items on this list. There is no storage available for firearms. According to a separate flyer linked to on the page, a number of items in addition to guns were banned by the U.S. Secret Service, specifically during the event that included Trump's NRA speech: Source: NRAAM.org The list showed the following products: aerosols, ammunition, backpacks, bags larger than 18""x13""x7"", drones and other unmanned aircraft systems, firearms, glass/thermal/metal containers, gun parts, holsters, knives, laser pointers, mace/pepper spray, magazines, selfie sticks, signs, toy guns, umbrellas, weapons of any kind, and any other item determined to be potential safety hazards. In sum, yes, guns were banned during Trump's NRA speech in May 2022, as the U.S. Secret Service had control of the event, which it involved the presence of a former president.","The National Rifle Association Annual Meeting (NRA AM) was held from May 27 to May 29, 2022, at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas. The event was notable because former President Donald Trump was scheduled to speak during the NRA-ILA Leadership Forum, which took place on May 27. As a result, the U.S. Secret Service took over control of the room and put in place strict security measures. Progressive political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen tweeted that guns were banned at the event, and we confirmed that this was true.

"Fact Check In May 2022, internet users got a kick out of what appeared to be an old photograph of the late former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, talking to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a boy. In one viral tweet , politics lecturer Yuan Yi Zhu captioned the picture ""Margaret Thatcher telling off a young Justin Trudeau, c. 1984"": The photograph is entirely authentic, not the result of digital manipulation, and does indeed show Thatcher and Trudeau, next to his father, then-Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Thus, we are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, contemporary accounts suggest Thatcher was having a friendly conversation with the young Trudeau, rather than chastising him, and the date provided in the May 2022 tweet, specifically, was off by a few years. The picture was taken on June 25, 1980 (not 1984 or thereabouts), and shows Thatcher talking to Trudeau outside 10 Downing Street — the official residence of the U.K. prime minister — in London. Behind Trudeau is his father, and to Thatcher's left, wearing an orange coat, is Jean Casselman Wadds, then Canadian high commissioner to the U.K. The Canadian government actually holds two slightly different versions of the shot — one showing Thatcher with her eyes open , as in the May 2022 post, and the other with her eyes closed . Several other photographs showed the same scene, with Thatcher wearing a distinctive bow at her collar, the elder Trudeau wearing the same jacket, and the young Trudeau wearing the same wind-breaker: Trudeau, then 8 years old, had accompanied his father on a trip to Europe , during which the Canadian PM attended talks and summits in Italy, the U.K.,  and Norway. While in Rome, both generations of Trudeaus obtained an audience with Pope John Paul II. Several contemporary news reports described Justin as having been sitting in a car at 10 Downing Street, but beckoned out on to the street by Thatcher, who was keen to chat to him. A brief, friendly exchange then took place, according to reports. For example, the Vancouver Sun wrote that : [Thatcher] spotted Justin huddled in the back of the Daimler, reported the Daily Mail. The newspaper said Justin explained that he was off to the zoo to see some baby monkeys. ""Have you seen them?"" he asked Thatcher. ""No,"" she said. ""But you must tell me about them when we meet again."" In their 1990 political biography of Pierre Trudeau , Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall cited a report by the Toronto Sun, and wrote of the June 25, 1980, meeting: The amiable nature of the occasion was pointed up by an exchange between Margaret Thatcher and Justin Trudeau, who had come with his father to Europe and was waiting for him in a limousine so they could go first to the London zoo and then to Buckingham Palace. The Iron Lady and the eight-year-old were photographed shaking hands amidst much prime ministerial joshing, with Trudeau trying to intervene to prevent the photo session from continuing. When the Canadians finally drove away, Justin grinned, stuck out his tongue, and waved from the limousine's back-seat.","A tweet that circulated in May 2022 featured a photograph of the former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher talking to a young Justin Trudeau who was standing beside his father, Pierre Trudeau, then-Canadian Prime Minister.

Despite initial skepticism from some, Pelosi's office confirmed that she was indeed going to read a poem by Bono, not Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko as some had hypothesized. Before introducing a group of Irish dancers, Pelosi read a limerick written by Bono that addressed the hardship faced by Ukraine and its ties to Irish history.

"The U.S. and European countries began isolating Russia economically since its invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration came under fire from right-wing media for its reported dependence on Russian oil. Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed on his show, “This oil is Putin's lifeblood, and it is and has always been. And to me, it's just incomprehensible and frankly unconscionable that despite these terrifying war crimes that you see unfolding every day and night against men, women and children, that the Biden administration continues to buy this thug's oil.” He said that Russia was selling billions of dollars worth of oil to the U.S. and European countries, and was effectively enabling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. The U.S. does import oil and other energy products from Russia. However, in March 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. government was “exploring” options to ban all imports of Russian oil and energy products. ""Our bill would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States, repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and take the first step to deny Russia access to the World Trade Organization,” she said. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki discussed the possibility on Feb. 25, 2022, saying “on the energy sector, no option is off the table.” Psaki added that cutting imports could have harmful effects in the U.S.: But again, to go back to [...] some of the principles here, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not our economy, and that’s a key balance that we’re clearly trying to strike. [...] The other factor here on the energy sector is that starting out with energy or — could actually benefit President Putin and pad his pockets because, given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas could drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. How Much Energy Does US Import from Russia? According to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2020 total Russian petroleum (including crude oil) made up only 7% of imports. The U.S. imported 52% of its total petroleum from Canada, by comparison. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association said that in 2021 the U.S. imported 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia. “Although Russian crude accounts for only three percent of U.S. crude oil imports and about one percent of total crude oil processed by U.S. refineries—Russian crude oil imports are important to refineries on the West Coast and Gulf Coast,” the group said , referring to 2021 numbers. By comparison , 61 percent of imports came from Canada, 10 percent from Mexico, and 6 percent from Saudi Arabia. Russian imports of crude oil to the U.S. have increased since 2019, “to help replace heavy sour crude from Venezuela that U.S. refineries can no longer import.” According to Adam Pankratz , a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business, one potential scenario of cutting out Russian oil would result in the U.S. relying on its strategic petroleum reserves, and so the country would not be badly affected by the loss in oil supply. On the other hand, Pankratz told Al Jazeera , “If the U.S. stopped importing Russian oil, that would mean that likely many other countries would also no longer be importing Russian oil, and that would make a very tight oil market already much tighter, and that would drive up the price of oil and that in turn can drive inflation, which in turn can affect the US economy.” AFPM suggested policies that could blunt the impact of reducing Russian energy supplies: While there is no near-term, silver-bullet policy to blunt the impact of geopolitical disruptions of the market, pursuing policies that allow domestic production to return to pre-pandemic levels will help to provide market stability and insulate not only the U.S. but the world from major disruptions. Policymakers can also provide relief from policies that increase the cost of producing refined product and policies that make it uneconomic to transport crude oil and petroleum products domestically. Nearly half of Russia’s overall exports are of crude oil, petroleum, and natural gas. According to Russia’s finance ministry , the country made around $119 billion in oil and gas revenue in 2021. In October 2021, the country made almost $500 million per day from oil and gas sales. The E.U., U.K. and U.S. together accounted for about half of Russia’s goods exports in 2021, which means they are effectively providing a significant chunk of Russia’s revenue from energy exports. The U.S. is still importing Russian energy products. However, the U.S. is not as reliant on them as a source of energy as expected, and is considering legislation that bans imports from Russia.

"In late 2021, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers seeking to verify the authenticity of a fascinating story, told in several widely shared social media posts, about one of the pre-White House accomplishments of former President Jimmy Carter. For example, on Dec. 14 Jeff Lundeen posted a very widely shared tweet that contained an old picture of a young Carter, a screenshot of the anecdote, and the following caption: Do you remember the world's very first nuclear meltdown? That time the US President, an expert in nuclear physics, heroically lowered himself into the reactor and saved Ottawa, Canada's capital? Sounds like schlocky action movie, but it actually happened! That tweet was itself drawn from an earlier Facebook post by the Historical Society of Ottawa, which can be seen below: The core claim from those accounts was that, as a young naval officer, Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown. That claim was accurate, and we are issuing a rating of ""True."" In main control room of USS K-1 (SSK-1) between June and October 1952. (Source: Naval History and Heritage Command). Carter, who was born in 1924 and grew up in Plains, Georgia, had a relatively short but distinguished naval career, as summarized by the U.S. Navy itself : President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 with distinction, after which he was assigned to USS Wyoming (E-AG 17) as an ensign. After completing two years of surface ship duty, Carter applied for submarine duty. He served as executive officer, engineering officer, and electronics repair officer on the submarine SSK-1 . When Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (then a captain) started his program to create nuclear-powered submarines, Carter wanted to join the program and was interviewed and selected by Rickover. Carter was promoted to lieutenant and from 3 November 1952 to 1 March 1953, he served on temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C., to assist ""in the design and development of nuclear propulsion plants for naval vessels."" From 1 March to 8 October 1953, Carter was preparing to become the engineering officer for USS Seawolf (SSN-575), one of the first submarines to operate on atomic power. However, when his father died in July 1953 Carter resigned from the Navy and returned to Georgia to manage his family interests. Carter was honorably discharged on 9 October 1953 and transferred to the retired reserve at his request with the rank of lieutenant. On Dec. 12, 1952, an accident took place at the National Research Experimental (NRX) nuclear reactor at Chalk River, near the Canadian capital of Ottawa. A detailed, official Atomic Energy of Canada account of the incident and its aftermath can be found here and here . Having been promoted to lieutenant in June of that year, Carter was at that time on secondment from the Navy to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development at Schenectady, in upstate New York. A 2019 video, vetted and published by All Hands, the official magazine of the U.S. Navy, contained the following account of the future president's involvement in the cleanup operation: Due to a combination of mechanical failure and human error, a power surge of up to 90 megawatts caused some fuel rods to melt after rupturing in the NRX research reactor at Chalk River Laboratories. The reactor's core was baldy damaged, requiring a massive cleanup operation. This was the first incident of this magnitude, and Carter was ordered to lead a team of 23 people to assist in the cleanup. When he arrived on the scene, there was a duplicate reactor set up on a nearby tennis court, where he and his team would practice removing bolts and pieces as quickly as they could. Once lowered into the damage reactor, each person would only have 90 seconds to work, due to the extreme radioactivity. The core was shut down, rebuilt, and put back into operation without further incident. Reflecting on the episode in 2008, Carter told the Canadian author Arthur Milnes that he and his team were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation at Chalk River, as Milnes would later write for CNN : ""We were fairly well instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that I had radioactivity in my urine,"" President Carter, now 86, told me during an interview for my new book in Plains in 2008. ""They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages and they didn't know."" Despite the fears he had to overcome, Carter admits he was animated at the opportunity to put his top-secret training to use in the cleanup of the reactor, located along the Ottawa River northwest of Ottawa. ""It was a very exciting time for me when the Chalk River plant melted down,"" he continued in the same interview. ""I was one of the few people in the world who had clearance to go into a nuclear power plant,"" he said. ""There were 23 of us and I was in charge. I took my crew up there on the train.""","Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown, as shared in several social media posts.

Kennedy‘s bloody button-down shirt for Christmas. On Monday, a fan on Twitter called out Refinery29 after the media outlet published a report , which included a photo originally believed to be from the reality star’s Instagram Stories depicting the shirt, which JFK assumably wore on the day he was assassinated in 1963. “I AM SCREAMING someone tweeted as a joke that Kim Kardashian gifted North JFK’s bloody shirt and Refinery29 wrote about it as if it were true????” the fan wrote on Twitter alongside a grab of the article, highlighting the excerpt “What is North West going to do with JFK’s bloody shirt? And why isn’t it in a museum?” Kardashian tweeted that the rumor was ""fake"" and a ""sick joke."" Also related to Kennedy's assassination, we found reporting from 2013 where the Houston Chronicle and The Associated Press chronicled another bloody shirt. This one belonged to Texas Gov.

John Anderson, preservation officer at the archives, said the display tells an important aspect of a well-known story. ""For Texans, this is something that maybe gets forgotten by some of the rest of the world, that Gov.

"In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. In the aftermath of the verdicts, Rittenhouse and his many supporters expressed resentment at what they presented as unfair and prejudicial commentary on the shootings. In particular, several observers highlighted remarks made by President Joe Biden and his campaign, at that time, and criticized the then-Democratic candidate for, in their description , calling Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist."" During an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Nov. 22, Rittenhouse himself said Biden had acted with ""actual malice, defaming my character"": Snopes has reviewed footage related to two instances in which Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign. Our conclusion is that Biden did not explicitly describe the Illinois man as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or, at the very least, had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" CNN Interview Biden conducted an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020 — two days after the Rittenhouse shootings in Kenosha, which took place in the backdrop of a renewed wave of protests after police in the city shot and seriously injured Jacob Blake , a 29-year-old Black man. The relevant section of the conversation can be watched below, and the following is an excerpted transcript: Cooper: The president has not talked about the shooting of Mr. Blake. He's talked about violence at protests in the wake of it. I'm wondering why you think that is that he hasn't actually addressed it? There's obviously a lot we do not know about the circumstances around it, but the video, obviously, has been out there. Biden: Well look, I don't know enough to know whether that 17-year-old kid — exactly what he did. But allegedly he's part of a militia coming out of the state of Illinois. Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?... In that response, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists — claims that Rittenhouse subsequently explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden now stood by the way in which he characterized Rittenhouse during his CNN interview, or if he wished to retract or modify those remarks. We did not receive a response in time for publication. Biden Campaign Ad During the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, Biden and Trump clashed over the Republican incumbent's support among white supremacist groups, with Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressing the president to ""condemn white supremacist and militia groups."" That exchange — which we covered in considerable detail at the time — produced the famous ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" moment, and prompted many critics of Trump to accuse him of ""refusing"" to distance himself from white supremacists and far-right militia groups. The following day, Biden's campaign produced an ad that highlighted that explosive moment from the previous evening's debate. It contained audio of the three-way exchange between Wallace, Trump, and Biden, overlaid with video footage and still images of various high-profile instances of white supremacist violence. An excerpted transcript is available here: Chris Wallace (addressing Trump): — but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacist and militia groups — Trump: Sure Wallace: — and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we’ve seen in Portland? On the words ""as we saw in Kenosha,"" the campaign video showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020: The clear suggestion there was, again, that Rittenhouse was himself a white supremacist militia member, or at the very least was closely associated with such groups — claims that, as we have shown, Rittenhouse has vehemently denied. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden stood by this component of the campaign ad, and whether he regretted the fact that it strongly suggested Rittenhouse was a white supremacist. We did not receive a response to this question.","Kyle Rittenhouse, who was acquitted of all charges related to fatal shootings during civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020, and his supporters have criticized comments made by President Joe Biden during the 2020 presidential campaign. While Biden did not explicitly call Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist,"" he suggested that Rittenhouse was associated with white supremacists or armed militias. Biden made the remarks during a CNN interview on August 27, 2020, when he claimed that Rittenhouse was allegedly part of a militia from Illinois. In a campaign ad released the day after the first presidential debate, Biden's campaign highlighted the moment when Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressed former President Trump to condemn white supremacist and militia groups. The ad showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, suggesting he was a white supremacist militia member or closely associated with such groups.

"On November 12, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Steve Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist and senior counselor to the president at the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's term, was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress after he failed to honor a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee as part of their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bannon, 67, is charged with one contempt count involving his refusal to appear for a deposition and another involving his refusal to produce documents, despite a subpoena from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. An arraignment date has not yet been set in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As this news circulated on social media, many people noted that Bannon was the first person to be indicted by a grand jury on contempt of Congress charges in nearly 40 years. Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard, wrote on Twitter : ""Bannon’s is the first indictment for criminal contempt of Congress in nearly 40 years. It was well earned."" Legal analyst Elie Honig made a similar observation on CNN: While the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate both have the power to certify contempt citations, it is up to the DOJ to pursue criminal prosecution. The Congressional Research Services writes : ""The criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena."" The House and Senate have both voted in recent years to hold various people in contempt of congress — such as former Attorney General William Barr, former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and former Attorney General Eric Holder — but it hasn't been since 1983 that the DOJ indicted someone (in that case, Rita M. Lavelle , a former Environmental Protection Agency official) for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify about the EPA's hazardous waste cleanup fund. While Lavelle was later cleared of this charge, she was later found guilty of perjury . The New York Times writes : ""The last person charged with criminal contempt of Congress, Rita M. Lavelle, a former federal environmental official under President Ronald Reagan, was found not guilty in 1983 of failing to appear at a congressional subcommittee hearing. She was later sentenced to prison for lying to Congress."" To find the last person found guilty of contempt of Congress charges, you have to go back another decade to 1974, when G. Gordon Liddy, a Watergate conspirator, was convicted of the charge. 10 May 1974, Fri Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California) Newspapers.com Bannon is the first person to be indicted on contempt of Congress charges since 1983, and he could become the first person to be found guilty of those charges since 1974. The DOJ noted in its release that ""all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."" If Bannon is found guilty, he'll face a maximum sentence of one year in jail for each charge. Each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail, as well as a fine of $100 to $1,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.","Steve Bannon, former White House chief strategist and senior counselor to the president during the beginning of Donald Trump's term, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress.

"On Oct. 13, 2021, a popular Reddit thread claimed former U.S. President Donald Trump urged Republican supporters not to vote in 2022 or 2024 elections.

That ultimatum was referring to the repeatedly debunked conspiracy theory that Democrats had coordinated a grand scheme to illegally hike voter tallies or conceal ballots to undermine Trump's reelection. After polls closed on Election Day , conservative media pundits played into the conspiracy by promoting a variety of false stories — ranging from a chicken barn fire in Arizona supposedly destroying votes to late-night vote ""dumps "" allegedly helping Biden win key battleground states .

In Sept. 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order saying that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated by Nov. 22, 2021. Another order required vaccinations of all contractors who did business with the federal government. According to the White House website : Building on the President’s announcement in July to strengthen safety requirements for unvaccinated federal workers, the President has signed an Executive Order to take those actions a step further and require all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated. The President also signed an Executive Order directing that this standard be extended to employees of contractors that do business with the federal government. Conservative website The Blaze reported that this meant that members of Congress and their staff did not fall under this mandate. This is correct. The vaccine mandate refers to employees working in the executive branch of government. This covers the president, the vice president, and their offices, which include their advisors and staffers, the cabinet appointed by the president, and heads of various federal agencies. The mandate covers federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and more. The armed forces are also included in the executive branch. According to the White House , the total number of people employed in this branch are 4 million. The legislative and judicial branches are separate from the executive branch, and do not fall under this vaccine mandate. Biden also cannot mandate as president that all Americans get vaccinated. That is up to each state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in April 2021, “We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.  That's just not what we can do.  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't. I can't go to the Capitol Physician and say, ‘Give me the names of people who aren't vaccinated, so I can go encourage them or make it known to others to encourage them to be vaccinated.’  So we can't – we can't do that.” In August, a group of House Democrats called on the Capitol physician to institute a vaccine mandate for House members. In early August 2021 , Pelosi said that Congress would follow the guidance of Capitol Physician Brian Monahan. She added, “In a matter of days or weeks, the full approval [from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] will be given to the vaccines, that I think will make a difference in terms of what we can do.” That approval came through on Aug. 23, 2021. In July 2021, Monahan issued an indoor mask mandate for House members and their staffs. This did not extend to the Senate. A vaccination mandate still hasn’t been enforced in Congress. As such, we rate this claim as “True.”","The website Snopes is still fighting against the spread of rumors and misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic.

"In mid-September 2021, social media users were surprised by a photograph of a billboard that contained a biblical quote that appeared to compare former U.S. President Donald Trump to Jesus, the central figure of the Christian religion. According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, the billboard was on Highway 27 in the city of Fort Oglethorpe, which is in Georgia, but was removed on Sept. 13, 2021. It contained a portion of a prophetic Bible verse from the book of Isaiah, and a picture of Trump, leading some to conclude that the billboard likened Trump with a deity, if not Jesus. An image of the billboard was posted on Twitter by Washington Post journalist Eugene Scott: Although the sign says ""Romans 8:17"" on the bottom right, the verse is actually the first part of Isaiah 9:6 . Isaiah 9:6 in its entirety reads , in the King James Version: ""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."" The verse is a familiar one, and as the Free Times Press editor Clint Cooper pointed out, ""Christians and biblical scholars believe the words prophesy the coming of Jesus Christ."" In fact, as Cooper further pointed out, the verse is the chorus to Handel's ""Messiah."" Romans 8:17 reads , ""And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.""

"In the days following the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Snopes readers asked us to determine the validity of a viral photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Joe Biden pulling down his mask to yell something at a ceremony to honor the attacks' victims. A Sept. 13, 2021, column by Newsweek's editorial board claimed: At the 20th anniversary memorial for 9/11, top Democratic politicians all wore masks for a photo op. Then, as soon as the television cameras were off, the masks came off. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. Kathy Hochul are masked one minute, unmasked and talking the next. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hers off. President Biden even pulls his mask down to yell at someone. The idiocy. For the purpose of this fact check, we'll focus on the simple assertion: that the president briefly removed his COVID-19 facial covering to communicate something at a 9/11 memorial service. The claim stemmed from a real event that took place at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in Lower Manhattan, where the World Trade Center towers once stood. On Sept. 11, 2021, officials including Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gathered there for a memorial service that included a moment of silence and name-reading of victims, as reported by multiple reputable news outlets . And it was true that, while standing in the crowd, Biden on at least two occasions temporarily pulled down his mask to communicate something, according to photographic evidence. Considering that verified proof to substantiate the claim, we rate this claim ""True."" Getty Images photographers Chip Somodevilla and Ed Jones documented the moments in a series of photographs from the event, including those displayed in the following tweet. Within that group of photos, the the most controversial image (the featured photograph of this report) included the below-transcribed caption in Getty Images' database: NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 11: President Joe Biden (C) calls out as he is joined by (L-R) former President Bill Clinton, former First Lady Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, First Lady Jill Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, during the annual 9/11 Commemoration Ceremony at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum on September 11, 2021 in New York City. During the ceremony six moments of silence were held, marking when each of the World Trade Center towers was struck and fell and the times corresponding to the attack on the Pentagon and the crash of Flight 93. The nation is marking the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, when the terrorist group al-Qaeda flew hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center, Shanksville, PA and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 people. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In other words, according to at least one reputable photojournalist who witnessed the scene, Biden indeed removed his mask to ""call out"" something while attending the commemoration event. However, the reasons why — or circumstances under which — Biden made the gesture were not made clear by that item of reporting. Also unclear was when, exactly, the moment occurred: before the ceremony began, during its activities, or after its closing. We reached out to Somodevilla for the answers to those questions, and we will update this report when, or if, we hear back from the photojournalist. Meanwhile, we obtained C-SPAN's live recording of the day's multiple commemoration ceremonies. Roughy 1.5 hours in, the footage showed Biden and his entourage walking in to the event at ground zero. Then, over the course of minutes, cameras from various angles focused on him and other politicians greeting members of the crowd. During those conversations before the service's start, Biden pulled down his mask to apparently say something to people around him, the footage showed. That split-second moment, which Jones captured via the below-displayed photo, was separate from the instance mentioned above based on Biden's positioning in the crowd (next to first lady Jill Biden and the Obamas). (Photo by Ed Jones-Pool/Getty Images) Shortly after that gesture, the C-SPAN footage showed, the crowd including the politicians assembled to mark the beginning of the memorial service with a flag ceremony and the Star-Spangled Banner . (The video recording did not include the other moment of Biden temporarily removing his mask captured by Somodevilla.) To conclude our research, we reached out to the White House. Our inquiry included a link to Somodevilla's photo showing Biden ""calling out"" something with his mask away from his face, and the explicit questions: What was the president saying in that moment, specifically, and to whom, or what, was he saying it? In sum, it was true the president temporarily pulled down his mask at least twice at a gathering to honor 9/11 victims, and, in one instance, a reputable photojournalist said he ""called out"" an unspecified word or phrase. However, what the president said in both moments, and with whom or what he was communicating, were unknown. Also undetermined was when — either before, during, or after commemoration activities — the photographs were taken.

"Origin Activists from the hacker collective Anonymous took down the website of the Texas Republican Party in protest against a restrictive law that has the effect of banning most abortions. The law, SB8, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021, bans abortions at about six weeks. The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them. The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website , but view with caution: It is graphic.) Hackers also replaced the state GOP's mission statement with one that read, in part, ""WE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE HANDMAID'S TALE AND WISH TO ENACT IT TO IT'S FULLEST. FOOTBALL!!!!!!""

Conviction and Exoneration





In the early hours of April 20, 1989, the body of a woman barely clinging to life was discovered in Central Park. Assaulted and left for dead, the 28-year-old jogger, Trisha Meili, would survive grave injuries and a coma with no memory of the events. Within days of the attack, McCray, 15; Richardson, 14; Salaam, 15; Santana, 14; and Wise, 16, implicated themselves in Meili's rape and beating after hours of psychological pressure and aggressive interrogation at the hands of seasoned homicide detectives.
The police announced to a press hungry for sensational crime stories that the young men had been part of a gang of teenagers who were out ""wilding,"" assaulting joggers and bicyclists in Central Park that evening. The ensuing media frenzy was met with a public outcry for justice. The young men were tried as adults under New York laws of the day — and convicted, despite inconsistent and inaccurate confessions, DNA evidence that excluded them, and no eyewitness accounts that connected them to the victim.
On December 19, 2002, Justice Charles J. Tejada of the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted a motion to vacate the thirteen-year-old convections in the infamous case. He did so based on new evidence: a shocking confession from a serial rapist, Matias Reyes, and a positive DNA match to back it up. A year later, the men filed civil lawsuits against the City of New York, and the police officers and prosecutors who had worked toward their conviction. In 2014, they settled that civil case for $41 million dollars. Despite their exoneration, the police and prosecutors involved in the case maintain that they were guilty of the crime.

","In 1989, a 28-year-old jogger named Trisha Meili was found barely alive in Central Park. She had been beaten and raped, but had no memory of the events. Five teenagers, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Yusuf Salaam, Raymond Santana, and Korey Wise, ages ranging from 14 to 16, were arrested and charged with the crime. They were convicted despite inconsistent and inaccurate confessions, DNA evidence that excluded them, and no eyewitness accounts connecting them to the victim. The police claimed that the young men had been part of a gang of teenagers that were ""wilding,"" or assaulting joggers and bicyclists in Central Park that evening. The media frenzy surrounding the case led to a public outcry for justice. The men were tried as adults and sentenced to prison. In 2002, after serving 13 years, the convictions were vacated based on new evidence: a confession from a serial rapist, Matias Reyes, and DNA evidence that matched him to the crime. The men filed a civil lawsuit against the City of New York, and settled for $41 million in 2014. Despite their exoneration, the police and prosecutors involved in the case maintain that the men were guilty.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,254,653,1000,1254,TRUE,AI Machine,real,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,critical,,,,,
"On March 12, 2023, social media users spread the claim that 15 banks in the U.S. had shut down under former U.S. President Donald Trump. We found the claim to be true. The subject emerged in partisan discussions of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse on March 10. With $209 billion in assets when it closed, it was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind Washington Mutual's failure in 2008. Silicon Valley Bank's failure also prompted regulators to close Signature Bank, which was the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank had $110 billion in assets when it closed. Another bank, Silvergate Capitol, announced its intent to wind down operations and liquidate its assets on March 8. MarketWatch reported the bank was facing multiple lawsuits that accused the bank of not having adequate protections to detect money laundering on its platform. The bank had $11 billion in assets at the end of 2022. ""More people should be talking about the fact that 15 banks failed while Donald Trump was president,"" said a Twitter post from progressive political action committee MeidasTouch . Playing the same game of partisan ""whataboutism,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that he didn't remember any banks collapsing during his father's administration, prompting journalist Jake Sherman to provide a list: Banks did fail under trump. many. here is the list of bank failures. https://t.co/EdDZDwrsSL https://t.co/6SIbHMbr6v — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) March 12, 2023 According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) , there were indeed 15 bank failures during Trump's presidency: four in 2020, four in 2019 and seven in 2017. Additionally, Harvest Community Bank , which was located in New Jersey, closed on Jan. 13, 2017, a week before Trump took office. Here is a list of the banks that closed, with dates of closure: Seaway Bank and Trust Company: Jan. 27, 2017 Proficio Bank: March 3, 2017 First NBC Bank: April 28, 2017 Guaranty Bank, (doing business as BestBank in Georgia & Michigan): May 5, 2017 Fayette County Bank: May 26, 2017 The Farmers and Merchants State Bank of Argonia: October 13, 2017 Washington Federal Bank for Savings: December 15, 2017 The Enloe State Bank: May 31, 2019 Louisa Community Bank: October 25, 2019 Resolute Bank: October 25, 2019 City National Bank of New Jersey: November 1, 2019 Ericson State Bank: February 14, 2020 The First State Bank: April 3, 2020 First City Bank of Florida: October 16, 2020 Almena State Bank: October 23, 2020 The partisan blame game fails to address economic factors underlying bank failures. Many factors could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. Attributing those failures solely to the political party in power ignores those nuances, as well as what lessons can be learned to prevent other banks from failing in the future. The banks that closed during Trump's presidency were significantly smaller in size. The largest was Seaway Bank and Trust Company, which had $361.2 million in assets when it failed in 2017.","Following the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which was the second-largest bank failure in the history of the United States, claims spread on social media that 15 banks had shut down during Donald Trump's presidency. These claims were found to be true by fact-checkers, with data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) showing that 15 banks failed during Trump's presidency, with one of the failures occurring a week before he took office. The banks that closed were significantly smaller in size than Silicon Valley Bank, with the largest having $361.2 million in assets when it failed. Some have engaged in a partisan blame game over the bank failures, but it is important to note that many factors can cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud.

"As U.S. President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 22, 2023, after a surprise visit to Ukraine , videos of him stumbling while climbing stairs to Air Force One went viral. The footage appeared to show him walking up the stairs, and, near the top, stumbling slightly and falling forward. He caught himself, stood up and continued to climb. Sharing the clip, Liz Wheeler, the host of a conservative political commentary podcast, wrote on Twitter, ""Joe Biden trips and falls up the stairs on Air Force One."" To determine whether the clip was real or miscaptioned, we looked for longer videos of Biden's walk up the stairs from reputable news sources. By examining footage from Sky News, for instance, at the 18-minute mark, we saw Biden did indeed stumble: We reached out to the White House for confirmation and received its pool report for the day. That document read: ""The president boarded at 5:34. About half way up the main stairs he stumbled and fell forward. He quickly recovered, stood and continued to the door, giving a quick wave before going in."" Given that acknowledgment from the White House, as well as the clear, undoctored video evidence that shows Biden stumbling, we rate this claim as ""True."" The videos of the fall are not to be confused with miscaptioned footage from earlier in the trip — a clip that supposedly showed Biden falling down the stairs when disembarking from Air Force One. In that video, the individual who fell was not actually the president. Critics of Biden used the Feb. 22 slip to comment on Biden's health, question his fitness for office, and recall his past stumbles . (We have covered Biden's falls before, including a time he fell off a bicycle in 2022. Also, the February 2023 incident was not the first time cameras caught Biden tripping while boarding Air Force One.) We should note that questioning a president's physical and mental health is a reoccurring trend no matter who is in in the Oval Office or their political affiliation.","US President Joe Biden stumbled while climbing the stairs to Air Force One after his surprise visit to Ukraine on February 22, 2023.

"In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking. At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part , from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole — an avid cigar smoker — had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control."" Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars."" Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned , that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking. Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True.""","In 2007, Nancy Pelosi, Former U.S. Speaker of the House, banned smoking in the Capitol.

"In early January 2023, as Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy suffered numerous vote losses in his quest to become speaker of the House, where his party held a slim majority, Mitch McConnell, his counterpart in the Senate and minority leader, broke the record as the longest-serving senator in the chamber's history. Republicans remained divided on McCarthy as House speaker due to a small but vocal group on the far right. Meanwhile, as of this writing, former U.S. President Donald Trump was attempting to divert Republican ire toward McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, using anti-Asian rhetoric to refer to the latter. In a post on TruthSocial on Jan. 4, 2023, he wrote: ""we ought to be fighting Mitch McConnell and his domineering, China loving BOSS, I mean wife, Coco Chow. The harm they have done to the Republican Party is incalculable."" We noticed, however, that back in 2018 all of these parties appeared to be on the same page. A photograph of McCarthy and Chao, who was then -U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration and who was speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, made the rounds on the internet. This photograph is authentic. The panel they were speaking on was titled "" Strategic Outlook: United States "" and was moderated by Gerard Baker, who was editor-at-large at The Wall Street Journal. They were joined by Kirstjen Neilsen, then-U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. The full panel can be found here , and you can see a screenshot of it below: (Screenshot via World Economic Forum) At the time, McCarthy was serving as House majority leader. In the panel, around the 2:34 mark, he mentioned having dinner at the house of Klaus Schwab, the chairperson of the WEF. ""You've got to understand what does 'America First' mean,"" McCarthy said in the talk. ""We wanted to focus on the economics of America, we want the citizens to be safe at home and abroad. ""As I sat around Klaus' dinner last night, what's interesting is the number of countries who are now talking about their tax system,"" he continued , explaining the reasoning behind Trumps' ""America First"" slogan. ""With doing something as big as the tax change [...] the economics of America rising helps the rest of the world. It also helps from a safety perspective around the world."" After the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Chao criticized Trump and resigned from her position. In late 2022, Trump also blamed her and McConnell for the ""turmoil"" in the Republican party, while continuing to use racist language against her. McConnell, meanwhile, appeared alongside Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden in early January 2023 to promote bipartisan efforts to improve infrastructure. While much of his career has been spent stymying the Democratic agenda, McConnell was increasingly criticizing Trump and shifting toward promoting a more bipartisan image. We therefore rate the above claim as a ""True.""","Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, became the longest-serving senator in the history of the chamber in early January 2023, while Republican U.S. Rep.

"Screenshots supposedly showing statements by former U.S. President Donald Trump about House Republicans' vote to elect a speaker circulated widely on Jan. 4, 2023. In the statements, Trump endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the leadership position. The screenshots indeed depicted authentic statements by the former president. He shared them on his social media platform, Truth Social, after McCarthy failed to secure enough support from members of his own party in multiple rounds of voting on Jan. 3. Considering those facts, we rate this claim ""True.""

Then, on Jan. 4, that stance shifted with the above-displayed Truth Social post.

"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" Image via Washington Post Carlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley. Maybe you could meet or speak to him and he could send you a very brief resume with his interests and grades attached."" She also wrote: ""Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission's Office about Buckley."" Biden wrote back that he would be honored to help. ""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said. Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here."" When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!"" Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it."" He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said . He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post. Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father."" He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching."" But following the 2020 election, Carlson's anti-Hunter Biden rhetoric grew , and he even poked fun at his addictions in an October 2021 segment: ""So again, let's say you were a crackhead through your 40s, made a lot of pornographic videos mostly of yourself, your genitals covered in M&Ms, and then once you got to your 50s, decide, 'Hey, I want to be Andy Warhol. You probably couldn't do it unless your dad happened to be the president, and that's how Hunter Biden pulled that off.""","Fox News host Tucker Carlson has been attacking President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, for his alleged business practices benefiting from his father's position since the 2020 elections.

"In September 2022, a Twitter user posted that flyers were available at a rally held for former U.S. President Donald Trump that named him as ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ.""

Müller confirmed to us via the Messenger app that he personally handed the flyers out at the most recent Trump rally in Youngstown, Ohio, which took place on Sept. 17. ""I did hand the flyers out.

Another Facebook commenter asked for an explanation, posting, ""What!!?? Trump...The Christ? Are you pulling our leg?"" Müller provided an answer by pointing to his interpretation of Bible verses, saying he believed the son of God to be Jesus Christ , and the son of man to be Trump, meaning he believed there to be two Christs: You know that Jesus, the Son of God always spoke about the Son of MAN in a third person? ""For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words (Jesus, the Son of God), of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."" Have you not notice how Jesus, the Son of God spoke in the first person about himself and always referred to the Son of MAN in the third person? Müller also told us that he believed there to be a comparison between Jesus being betrayed by Judas and Trump purportedly being ""betrayed by Pence,"" purportedly referring to the former U.S. vice president's decision to follow the U.S. Constitution rather than overturning the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election based on conspiracy theories. (In reality, no credible evidence of massive voter fraud has ever been produced to show that the election was ""stolen,"" as Trump often claimed.) Following the Ohio rally, Müller uploaded a video that provided a longer explanation as to why he believed Trump to be ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ,"" as mentioned on the cover of his book. ""Don't get offended. Don't say, 'Ew, that's blasphemous,'"" he said. ""Jesus is the king of the Jews. Trump is the king of kings.""

"Fact Check Former U.S President Jimmy Carter was considered to be ahead of his time on issues surrounding climate change, exemplified by his installation of solar panels on the rooftop of the White House in the 1970s. Years later, Reagan removed the panels when he came into power, and they returned decades after, during the Obama administration. Some sources have reported that the solar panels installed by Obama are still in place. We are in the process of verifying that. A photograph of Carter showing off the panels he had installed at a dedication ceremony in 1979 was popular on Reddit in September 2022: The above caption does correctly state that Carter displayed the solar panels to guests at the White House, but it's incorrect as to when Carter’s successor, President Ronald Reagan, had the panels removed. Carter had 32 panels installed there, and for seven years they were used to heat water in the household until the Reagan administration removed them in 1986 -- not two years later as the post claims. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History , which now has one of the original panels in its collection, they were a symbol of Carter’s faith in “the power of the sun.” The above photograph is taken from the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library collection, and was published in The New York Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . The same image can be seen on Britannica . The New York Times' caption stated: “In 1979, President Carter showed off new solar panels on the West Wing that would provide hot water for the White House.” Various shots from that event are available in the National Archives catalog , and shots of that particular moment can be seen in the bottom half of the photographic film scans. These photographs were taken at the White House dedication event for the solar panels. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library At the ceremony, which was held in June 1979, Carter said : In the year 2000 this solar water heater behind me, which is being dedicated today, will still be here supplying cheap, efficient energy [...] A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people. Other photographs from the same event show the panels more clearly displayed on the rooftop of the White House's Cabinet Room, which is where the dedication event appears to take place. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library What happened to those panels after they were removed? According to Scientific American , one ended up at the National Museum of American History, one is in the Carter Library, and one is at the Solar Science and Technology Museum in Dezhou, China. Solar panels made a comeback at the White House during former President George W. Bush's tenure in 2002, but not on the Executive Mansion's roof. According to the White House Historical Association , the National Park Service oversaw installation of three solar energy systems on the White House grounds starting in 2002. The installation during his tenure helped heat up the White House swimming pool. In 2010, then-U.S. President Barack Obama announced that solar panels would once again be installed on the White House rooftop. The installation was completed in 2014 . The video below highlights the process: We reached out to the White House Historical Association to learn if any updates or changes were made to the panels during the Trump administration. They shared with us a photograph from a July 2021 news article in which the panels are still visible, stating, ""It appears from photographers that the panels are still installed on the roof.""

"A photograph that's frequently shared online appears to show a younger Hillary Clinton, perhaps back in her days as U.S. first lady, playing a Game Boy while seated on a flight. Was the picture altered? Was Clinton perhaps originally using an old Palm PDA (personal digital assistant) or something else before someone doctored the photo with Adobe Photoshop? The answer to those two questions is no. The truth is that Clinton was authentically photographed while playing a Game Boy. The picture was captured by photographer Ralph Alswang on April 20, 2015. It was posted to Instagram by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library & Museum, which was named for her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Instagram caption read, ""April 6, 1993: Hillary Rodham Clinton plays a Nintendo ""Game Boy"" electronic game on her flight from Austin, Texas to Washington, DC. Photographed by Ralph Alswang. #NARA #Nintendo #GameBoy #Videogames #ClintonCenter #ClintonLibrary #PresidentialLibraries #HRC #FirstLady."" The original Game Boy required four AA batteries. It's unclear if Clinton carried extras. On May 24, 1993, Carol Jouzaitis with Chicago Tribune reported that the Game Boy belonged to Clinton's daughter, Chelsea. We don't know what game Clinton was playing since the angle of the photograph obscured the title on the cartridge. However, two good guesses would be Super Mario Land and Tetris. The games were included in some of the bundles that were packaged with the original Game Boy. On July 19, 1994, Sara Williams reported for the News-Press in Fort Myers, Florida, that she did some digging in an attempt to find out what games Clinton enjoyed the most: She's dressed to the nines. Her hair is done to perfection in one of the 15 styles she wears. She's kicked off her shoes. The most powerful man in the free world rubs her toes. Faxes, dispatches, and telephone calls are on hold as she wings her way to Europe on Air Force One. She needs to unwind. So what does she choose? Game Boy. ""I've become fond of Game Boy,"" she recently told Redbook magazine. Yes, Hillary Clinton loves video games. … So I called up the White House to find out exactly what games Hillary Clinton plays on which machines, only to learn that this is a state secret. ""If we said what Mrs. Clinton likes to play, it could be considered an endorsement,"" said a press aide. It could also be an embarrassment. ""Tetris,"" after all, was invented in Russia at least 15 years ago, quite possibly as a sop to the hungry and disgruntled masses who had no access to the goods. Clinton later went on to serve as a U.S. senator for the state of New York and as secretary of state under former U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2016, she was nominated as the Democratic Party's candidate for president.","A photograph of former US first lady, Hillary Clinton, playing a Game Boy on a flight has been circulating online, with some speculating that the image was doctored.

"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother.""

"On Sept. 1, 2022, readers asked us whether a book teaching about gay sex was available on the shelves of a public middle school library in Tampa, Florida. For example, The Florida Standard reported , ""Book in Tampa Middle School Library Has Instructions on Anal Sex and Hookup Apps."" As of the writing of this story, we can report it was true that author Juno Dawson's book, ""This Book Is Gay,"" was available on the shelves of the Pierce Middle School library in Tampa . The school is part of Hillsborough County Public Schools, which is described as ""the 7th largest district in the United States."" It was also true that the book includes a chapter with information and instructions that teaches kids about anal sex, oral sex, and hookup apps. In this article, we've laid out all of the facts to help inform our readers about this subject. We've included a link to a school board meeting video, text from an advisory in the book, pictures of pages that were being discussed, further context, and answers from our correspondence with the school district. Board Meeting Speech On Aug. 31, Just The News reported that Will Witt, The Florida Standard's editor in chief, spoke at a school board meeting ""against the book being available in children's libraries."" The speech was tweeted on Witt's Twitter account on Aug. 30, the same day as the meeting. It has since been retweeted and liked thousands of times: Chapter Introduction One of the chapters that appeared to receive the most attention in the reporting from The Florida Standard and from social media users was titled, ""Chapter 9: The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex."" The chapter begins with the following advisory: This chapter is about sex. Therefore it has sex in it. WELL, DUH. If you are a younger reader and you feel you aren't ready for the finer details of same-sex pairings, then simply skip this whole chapter. HOWEVER, before you do, I'd like to remind you that we taught you all about straight sex when you were ELEVEN YEARS OLD during sixth grade. The fact that they didn't also teach you what same-sex couples do is nothing less than institutionalized homophobia. Straight sex was presented as the norm to make five percent of the population feel abnormal. Is there something icky about gay sex? Is there something wrong with it? I challenge any politician to discuss this with me. I WILL RUIN THEM. This chapter is simply all the stuff teachers SHOULD be saying if they want to be inclusive of people with same-sex feelings. We contacted the school district with several questions for our story. As part of one question, we mentioned the two bolded sentences above. In response, a spokesperson for the district told us that the quote ""is from a book that is not representative of our curriculum."" (More of their answers to our other questions are available near the end of this article.) 'The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex' Social media users shared pages from the book that taught about how to have anal sex and oral sex. The book also made mention of Grindr, a mobile app that provides sexual encounter opportunities (hookups) for men. We verified that all of these pages did come from Dawson's book, ""This Book Is Gay."" Sex Diagram Pages The Florida Standard and social media users also described a page in the book with a diagram of a naked boy. The diagram was titled as, ""Part One: Boy-On-Boy Sex."" We continued reading the chapter and found the next part to be titled, ""Part Two: Girl-On-Girl Sex."" It showed a diagram of a naked girl. However, none of the articles or social media posts that we reviewed included information that expressed any outrage about the second diagram, nor did they make any mention whatsoever about the part about girls having sex with each other. They only referenced the page about boys. Available in Three Schools According to online library data for the Florida school district, we were able to confirm that two copies of ""This Book Is Gay"" were indeed part of Pierce Middle School's library selection. The book also showed up as being listed at Middleton High School and Tampa Bay Technical High School, which were in the same district. ""This Book Is Gay"" showed up in three local schools, including Pierce Middle. Book Hasn't Been Officially Challenged By email, a spokesperson for Hillsborough County Public Schools told us that, as of Sept. 1, ""no one has officially challenged this book at any of the three schools where it is available."" We also inquired about the general policies that the district follows regarding challenging a book at a school library. In response, they provided the following information: We have a process that allows anyone to challenge a book they feel is inappropriate on the school level. Parents are encouraged to speak to their librarian first, who can then discuss the concerns, and the school's Educational Media Materials Committee can then convene to review the challenged material. Committee members then read or view the material in its entirety and consult professional review and academic resources to weigh the merits against alleged faults in light of the material as a whole. The committee then determines the extent to which the material meets the criteria for selection. They make an ultimate decision on whether the book will remain on the shelf at that school. The school district's website featured further documentation about its policies.

"Fact Check On Aug. 25, 2022, the official Twitter account for the White House posted a tweet criticizing comments by U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in which she stated her disagreement with the Biden administration's plan to forgive some federal student loan debt. In the video included in the tweet above, Greene used an appearance on right wing broadcaster Newsmax to opine that it's ""completely unfair"" to some taxpayers, namely those that didn't take out a student loan, to ""have to pay off the great big student loan debt"" of others. The White House's clap-back tweet was in reference to reports that Taylor Commercial, a construction company owned by Greene and her husband, received money through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The tactic has been used to attack other conservatives, although in the case of commentator Ben Shapiro, it backfired because he didn't get a $20,832 PPP loan, as some had claimed. U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) records show Greene's company accepted $182,300 in PPP loan money in April 2020, and that it was ""Paid in full or forgiven,"" which refers to loans ""repaid and those fully forgiven from repayment under PPP guidelines,"" per the SBA. A database of PPP loans provided by the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica, which obtained data from the SBA via public records, shows that Taylor Commercial had a total of $183,504 forgiven, including accrued interest. We reached out to Greene's office asking for comment on the controversy, and were provided a statement that didn't address the student loan/PPP loan discourse, but instead pointed to swatting incidents targeting Greene's home. ""It's a shame that [U.S. President] Joe Biden and his spokesmen in the media continue to make MTG a target simply because she is outspoken against Democrat policies, like genital mutilation surgeries for minors,"" the statement read, a likely reference to surgeries performed on some transgender people as part of gender affirming care (although such procedures are rarely performed on minors). There is important context to this controversy, namely that student loans and PPP loans are entirely different in their purpose and structure. PPP loans were given during the COVID-19 pandemic to businesses with the expectation that, if used as intended, they would be forgiven. Many businesses had no choice but to cease or curtail operations during the height of the pandemic, and the program was intended to prevent them from laying off workers or going under. Student loans, on the other hand, are sought by those seeking higher education and are taken out with the expectation that they will be paid back.","The White House criticized Rep.

"Fact Check Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, was laid to rest at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, based on media reports and photographs taken of the site. New York Post reporters visited the golf club and photographed Ivana Trump’s grave. Their report included a number of shots from different angles, including one revealing a wooded area near the site. A source told the New York Post that Ivana was buried not too far from the club house. According to the report, she was buried in a place that was not visible to golfers as they tee off for a round of golf. The small section of the club where she was buried is below the backside of the first tee. A number of memes consisting of edited versions of those photographs went viral in late July 2022, with one in particular getting tens of thousands of likes and comments on Instagram. The image — posted by Instagram account homegrownterrorists — showed a golf cart rolling past what appeared to be Ivana Trump's gravesite. It's clear that this photograph is fake when it's compared to the pictures published in the New York Post article . The gravesite has been inserted into a wider shot of a golf cart on a golf course fairway. Unlike the Post's photographs, the manipulated image doesn’t show a wooded area immediately adjacent to the grave. A separate rumor speculates that Trump used the burial site for tax break purposes. Indeed, the New Jersey tax code does exempt cemetery land from all taxes, rates, and assessments. Potentially, her grave could save the property from paying a significant sum in a state with high tax rates. According to the code , a cemetery company is exempt from paying real property taxes, income taxes, sales and use taxes, business taxes, and inheritance taxes; cemetery trust funds are also exempt from taxes. Trump has expressed his desire to be buried at the New Jersey golf course for years. His company even described it as his “favorite property” in a 2014 filing with the state. A 2017 Washington Post report revealed how he had been trying to convince local authorities to let him build cemeteries at the golf course since 2007. After numerous attempts, two of his plans were approved around 2017, but construction for them had not begun. The 2017 report said that the Trump Organization still needed to apply for state approval to make the land a public cemetery. However, Ivana Trump is the first known family member to be buried at the Bedminster golf club. Brooke Harrington , a sociology professor at Dartmouth and tax researcher, pointed out that the tax code has no stipulation for a minimum number of human remains needed for the tax breaks to apply. Documents published by ProPublica show that the Trump Family Trust had sought to designate a property in nearby Hackettstown, New Jersey, as a non-profit cemetery company. However, this was not the first time Trump had been accused of trying to reduce his taxes on the property by varying its use. A 2016 Wall Street Journal report found that the golf club benefited from a farmland tax break because part of the land was designated for agricultural purposes — specifically for hay production and a small herd of goats. The Huffington Post reported in 2019 that he had saved around $88,000 that year. New Jersey laws state “a landowner must have no less than five acres of farmland actively devoted to an agricultural or horticultural use for the two years immediately preceding the tax year being applied for and meet specific minimum gross income requirements based on the productivity of the land.” A representative for the Trump Organization told Fortune magazine that the links being drawn between Ivana Trump's gravesite and tax laws were “truly evil.” While it is unknown if the choice of this location for her grave had any connection to taxes, the Trump family has a history of seeking ways to reduce tax bills. Furthermore, given the photographs, and an acknowledgement from a Trump representative regarding the location of her grave while denying the rumors connecting it to tax laws, we rate the overall claim as “True.”","Ivana Trump, the first wife of former US President Donald Trump, was buried at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, according to media reports and photographs.

The controversy surrounding the episode of ""60 Minutes"" was addressed in an opinion piece published by Poynter. According to the article, the news magazine TV show failed to provide ""substantial evidence"" after claiming that DeSantis gave the Publix grocery store chain ""preferential treatment to distribute COVID-19 vaccines."" The charge was that DeSantis favored Publix simply because they donated to his campaign. He responded to the segment by calling it ""irresponsible"" and ""a lie."" According to the Poynter article, ""it doesn’t appear as if DeSantis did anything wrong."" The rest of the Facebook post recounted DeSantis' accomplishments before entering politics. It read as follows: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida, when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the U.S. Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal. #DeSantis #leadership We weren't able to find documentation to verify the exact dates cited for all of these items.

"Fact Check The reporting below reflects facts as of July 2022. When Liz Truss resigned months later, on Oct. 20, we published a new story about Larry outlasting four, not three, British prime ministers. Being the first cat of the United Kingdom is not an easy job, especially when you have to deal with a revolving door of prime ministers. In July 2022, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader – and eventually as prime minister – after a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers. While Johnson announced he would stay on until a replacement was selected, someone else will have a longer tenure than him: Larry the cat has been in residence at 10 Downing Street since Feb. 15, 2011, according to the British government’s official page , and was the first cat to hold the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. He was adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. According to the official government website , he has many roles: He has captured the hearts of the Great British public and the press teams often camped outside the front door. In turn the nation sends him gifts and treats daily. Larry spends his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences and testing antique furniture for napping quality. His day-to-day responsibilities also include contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house. Larry says this is still ‘in tactical planning stage’. Larry has also outlasted three prime ministers, assuming he will still be present at 10 Downing Street after Johnson leaves his role. He arrived toward the early part of David Cameron’s tenure from 2010 to 2016, was a part of the household through Theresa May’s time from 2016 to 2019, and is expected to outlast Johnson’s tenure in the office. Cameron was believed to have a chilly relationship with Larry, and he posted a picture of the cat in his lap in an effort to dispel such rumors. May also hinted that she was more of a dog person. While a timetable for Johnson’s replacement had yet to be confirmed as of this writing, it took several weeks before he took over from his predecessor May. Larry himself has not commented on the upcoming changes. Meanwhile, Larry is expected to be waiting in 10 Downing Street and will likely be unimpressed with whoever is the new occupant.","Larry the cat has been holding the position of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office in the United Kingdom since Feb. 15, 2011, according to the government’s official page.

"Fact Check In July 2022, critics of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson enjoyed a measure of schadenfreude when a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers, prompted him to announce his resignation as Conservative party leader and — eventually — as prime minister. As part of that response, social media users enthusiastically shared photographs that appeared to show a Madame Tussauds wax figure of Johnson, relocated to stand outside an employment office in the north-western seaside town of Blackpool — with the joke being that he would soon find himself unemployed and, in theory, in need of assistance finding work. On July 7, for example, Twitter users posted pictures of the statue, along with captions that characterized the move as expert trolling on the part of Madame Tussauds: The photos were authentic and not the result of digital manipulation, and the descriptions accurately stated that Madame Tussauds in Blackpool had deliberately placed their figure of Johnson outside a nearby Jobcentre Plus, as a joke or publicity stunt. Our rating is ""True.""

Madame Tussauds has a track record of using cheeky political symbolism to gain publicity for its attractions. In November 2020, for example, around the time of Joe Biden's U.S. presidential election win, the London museum re-dressed its figure of the outgoing White House resident Donald Trump in golfing attire , while the Berlin location rather more bluntly placed its Trump statute in a dumpster , along with a sign reading ""Dump Trump.""","Madame Tussauds in Blackpool has placed a wax figure of U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson outside a job centre as part of a publicity stunt.

"Fact Check In the summer of 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden faced allegations of hypocrisy and ""flip-flopping"" after he strongly condemned the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and remove federal constitutional protections for abortion access. Speaking on June 24, Biden described Roe as ""the correct decision as a matter of constitutional law, an application of the fundamental right to privacy and liberty in matters of family and personal autonomy,"" and he called the decision to overturn it a ""tragic error"" and the ""realization of an extreme ideology."" However, many observers — both to the left and right of Biden on the ideological spectrum — contrasted such remarks, in 2022, with what they presented as Biden's very different stance on the abortion rights landmark, four decades ago. U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., for example, wrote on Twitter : In 1982, Joe Biden proposed a constitutional amendment that would overturn Roe v. Wade and give the states the ability to regulate abortion. But today, he condemned the Dobbs decision. Unlike pro-life advocates, Biden has no backbone. He is ruled by the radical left. On June 24, one Facebook user published a viral post which contained a screenshot of an article by the London Independent , with the headline ""Biden voted to overturn Roe v Wade in 1982..."" and the caption ""Wonder how those protesting the Supreme Court decision feel about this. Chances are they are the same people that voted for Biden."" In recent years, the same core claim — that Biden once voted in favor of effectively overturning Roe and returning abortion policy to the states and the U.S. Congress — has featured in news articles by the The New York Times , Fox News , and the New York Post . That claim is accurate, although Biden did vote against an identical proposal just one year later. Our rating is ""True."" What Exactly Was the 1982 Vote About? The vote in question took place on March 10, 1982. Biden, then a U.S. senator for Delaware and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was considering a proposal put forward by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The proposal, Senate Joint Resolution 110 , contained the following text: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress: ""ARTICLE — ""A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortion: Provided, That a provision of a law of a State which is more restrictive than a conflicting provision of a law of Congress shall govern."" The key finding of Roe was that the U.S. constitution — in particular the ""due process"" clause of the 14th amendment — recognized a right to privacy, and that that included a woman's right to an abortion. Hatch's proposed amendment would have explicitly inserted into the Constitution the assertion that ""a right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution."" Clearly, that would have been completely incompatible with Roe, and therefore would have effectively — and emphatically — overturned Roe. The amendment would also have returned to Congress and the states the ability to govern abortion access. This was precisely the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling, 40 years later, in Dobbs — the decision that ultimately overruled Roe. Hatch's proposal went even further, though, stipulating that, while Congress could enact legislation governing abortion access on a national level, if an individual state's abortion law was stricter than the federal law, the state law would take precedence. The amendment never made it as far as a vote in the full Senate or House, but on March 10, 1982, the Senate Judiciary Committee did vote to advance it out of committee for the consideration of the full Senate. As a later committee report described it , the committee voted 10-7 to ""favorably report out"" the proposal. This is an important distinction. Judiciary committee members can vote to advance a measure to the full Senate ""without recommendation,"" meaning that, whether or not they personally support the proposal, they believe it should be considered by the full Senate. Biden's March 1982 vote went further, and he joined the committee's majority in explicitly supporting the proposal itself. The votes were as follows: For : Hatch, R-Utah; Laxalt, R-Nev.; Dole, R-Kan.; Simpson, R-Wyo.; East, R-N.C.; Grassley, R-Iowa; Denton, R-Ala.; Biden, D-Del.; DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Thurmond, R-S.C. Against : Mathias, R-Md.; Specter, R-Penn.; Kennedy, D-Mass.; Byrd, D-W.Va.; Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Leahy, D-Vt.; Baucus, D-Mont. At the time, Biden said his vote was an exceptionally difficult one, and described abortion as ""the single most controversial issue in the United States of America.""  Snopes asked the White House for a fuller explanation of the reasoning behind Biden's March 1982 vote, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. Prior to that vote, the Delaware senator had expressed clear opposition to Roe. For example, in a 1974 interview he declared: ""I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body."" However, when Hatch submitted a similar proposed constitutional amendment in 1983, Biden voted against it, both in the judiciary committee and in the full Senate chamber . From that point, his public stance on abortion rights in general, and Roe in particular, evolved from one of hostility, to neutrality, and as of 2022, firm support.","President Joe Biden faced accusations of hypocrisy and flip-flopping after he condemned the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which removed federal constitutional protections for abortion access. However, critics pointed out that Biden had voted in favor of an amendment to the US Constitution in 1982 that would have overturned Roe and given states the power to regulate abortion. The amendment proposed by Senator Orrin Hatch was incompatible with Roe and would have returned the power to govern abortion access to Congress and the states. Biden's vote, along with the majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, supported the amendment. However, the amendment never made it to a full Senate vote, and the following year, when Hatch proposed a similar amendment, Biden voted against it. Prior to his 1982 vote, Biden had expressed opposition to Roe, but his stance evolved, and he now supports abortion rights.",gpt-3.5-turbo-0301,175,1163,1377,1552,TRUE,AI Machine,real,news article,post-GPT,x-Gen,critical,,,,,
"Fact Check On June 25, 2022, The Matt Walsh Blog Twitter account purportedly responded to a question on the subject of abortion, apparently believing that a picture of an elephant fetus was that of a human.

In response, Walsh or someone with control of his account chose to quote-tweet the question instead of inserting a traditional reply underneath, answering with, ""Yes."" The tweet then vanished from Walsh's account after @samthielman revealed that the image showed that of an elephant fetus. Before Walsh's tweet disappeared, it had already been liked thousands of times. According to two sources , the picture truly did show a fetus of an elephant.

Absolutely loving every minute of it."" This may have been what prompted the back-and-forth discussion with @samthielman.

"Fact Check An Indiana man won the Republican primary for local county elections in early May 2022, while in jail facing accusations of murdering his wife. Andrew Wilhoite, a local farmer , was running for one of the three open seats on the Clinton Township Board. He was charged in March 2022 with killing his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth “Nikki” Wilhoite. Wilhoite, however, withdrew from the ballot in mid-May 2022. He did not give a reason for the withdrawal. If he were to be convicted for a felony before the November general elections, his name would have been withdrawn from the ballots by election officials. He was incarcerated when police accused him of striking his wife in the head with a blunt object. Investigators said that he then “placed her into a vehicle and drove to a nearby creek where he dumped her body.” Prosecutors charged him with a level 1 murder felony. Wilhoite initially lied about his wife’s whereabouts, before admitting that he killed her after she attacked him, according to prosecutors. According to the local news Lebanon Reporter , Elizabeth had completed her last chemotherapy session and was seeking a divorce when she learned her husband had an affair with another woman. According to the affidavit, Wilhoite confessed that Elizabeth charged at him on the porch and he hit her with a “gallon-sized concrete flowerpot with dirt in it.” She fell to the ground and he did not know what to do, so he put her in his pickup truck. He described how he drove to a bridge over the creek and threw her over the wall and into the creek. The police were alerted after Elizabeth’s coworker asked them to check on her when she did not arrive for work saying that the couple had domestic troubles. Their three children had also been trying to get in touch with Elizabeth. According to election records , he received 60 votes for his seat, while the other Republican candidates received 100 and 106 votes respectively for the remaining seats.

"Fact Check In May 2022, internet users got a kick out of what appeared to be an old photograph of the late former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, talking to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a boy. In one viral tweet , politics lecturer Yuan Yi Zhu captioned the picture ""Margaret Thatcher telling off a young Justin Trudeau, c. 1984"": The photograph is entirely authentic, not the result of digital manipulation, and does indeed show Thatcher and Trudeau, next to his father, then-Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Thus, we are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, contemporary accounts suggest Thatcher was having a friendly conversation with the young Trudeau, rather than chastising him, and the date provided in the May 2022 tweet, specifically, was off by a few years. The picture was taken on June 25, 1980 (not 1984 or thereabouts), and shows Thatcher talking to Trudeau outside 10 Downing Street — the official residence of the U.K. prime minister — in London. Behind Trudeau is his father, and to Thatcher's left, wearing an orange coat, is Jean Casselman Wadds, then Canadian high commissioner to the U.K. The Canadian government actually holds two slightly different versions of the shot — one showing Thatcher with her eyes open , as in the May 2022 post, and the other with her eyes closed . Several other photographs showed the same scene, with Thatcher wearing a distinctive bow at her collar, the elder Trudeau wearing the same jacket, and the young Trudeau wearing the same wind-breaker: Trudeau, then 8 years old, had accompanied his father on a trip to Europe , during which the Canadian PM attended talks and summits in Italy, the U.K.,  and Norway. While in Rome, both generations of Trudeaus obtained an audience with Pope John Paul II. Several contemporary news reports described Justin as having been sitting in a car at 10 Downing Street, but beckoned out on to the street by Thatcher, who was keen to chat to him. A brief, friendly exchange then took place, according to reports. For example, the Vancouver Sun wrote that : [Thatcher] spotted Justin huddled in the back of the Daimler, reported the Daily Mail. The newspaper said Justin explained that he was off to the zoo to see some baby monkeys. ""Have you seen them?"" he asked Thatcher. ""No,"" she said. ""But you must tell me about them when we meet again."" In their 1990 political biography of Pierre Trudeau , Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall cited a report by the Toronto Sun, and wrote of the June 25, 1980, meeting: The amiable nature of the occasion was pointed up by an exchange between Margaret Thatcher and Justin Trudeau, who had come with his father to Europe and was waiting for him in a limousine so they could go first to the London zoo and then to Buckingham Palace. The Iron Lady and the eight-year-old were photographed shaking hands amidst much prime ministerial joshing, with Trudeau trying to intervene to prevent the photo session from continuing. When the Canadians finally drove away, Justin grinned, stuck out his tongue, and waved from the limousine's back-seat.","A photograph of former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a young boy has gone viral on the internet.

"The U.S. and European countries began isolating Russia economically since its invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration came under fire from right-wing media for its reported dependence on Russian oil. Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed on his show, “This oil is Putin's lifeblood, and it is and has always been. And to me, it's just incomprehensible and frankly unconscionable that despite these terrifying war crimes that you see unfolding every day and night against men, women and children, that the Biden administration continues to buy this thug's oil.” He said that Russia was selling billions of dollars worth of oil to the U.S. and European countries, and was effectively enabling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. The U.S. does import oil and other energy products from Russia. However, in March 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. government was “exploring” options to ban all imports of Russian oil and energy products. ""Our bill would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States, repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and take the first step to deny Russia access to the World Trade Organization,” she said. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki discussed the possibility on Feb. 25, 2022, saying “on the energy sector, no option is off the table.” Psaki added that cutting imports could have harmful effects in the U.S.: But again, to go back to [...] some of the principles here, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not our economy, and that’s a key balance that we’re clearly trying to strike. [...] The other factor here on the energy sector is that starting out with energy or — could actually benefit President Putin and pad his pockets because, given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas could drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. How Much Energy Does US Import from Russia? According to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2020 total Russian petroleum (including crude oil) made up only 7% of imports. The U.S. imported 52% of its total petroleum from Canada, by comparison. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association said that in 2021 the U.S. imported 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia. “Although Russian crude accounts for only three percent of U.S. crude oil imports and about one percent of total crude oil processed by U.S. refineries—Russian crude oil imports are important to refineries on the West Coast and Gulf Coast,” the group said , referring to 2021 numbers. By comparison , 61 percent of imports came from Canada, 10 percent from Mexico, and 6 percent from Saudi Arabia. Russian imports of crude oil to the U.S. have increased since 2019, “to help replace heavy sour crude from Venezuela that U.S. refineries can no longer import.” According to Adam Pankratz , a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business, one potential scenario of cutting out Russian oil would result in the U.S. relying on its strategic petroleum reserves, and so the country would not be badly affected by the loss in oil supply. On the other hand, Pankratz told Al Jazeera , “If the U.S. stopped importing Russian oil, that would mean that likely many other countries would also no longer be importing Russian oil, and that would make a very tight oil market already much tighter, and that would drive up the price of oil and that in turn can drive inflation, which in turn can affect the US economy.” AFPM suggested policies that could blunt the impact of reducing Russian energy supplies: While there is no near-term, silver-bullet policy to blunt the impact of geopolitical disruptions of the market, pursuing policies that allow domestic production to return to pre-pandemic levels will help to provide market stability and insulate not only the U.S. but the world from major disruptions. Policymakers can also provide relief from policies that increase the cost of producing refined product and policies that make it uneconomic to transport crude oil and petroleum products domestically. Nearly half of Russia’s overall exports are of crude oil, petroleum, and natural gas. According to Russia’s finance ministry , the country made around $119 billion in oil and gas revenue in 2021. In October 2021, the country made almost $500 million per day from oil and gas sales. The E.U., U.K. and U.S. together accounted for about half of Russia’s goods exports in 2021, which means they are effectively providing a significant chunk of Russia’s revenue from energy exports. The U.S. is still importing Russian energy products. However, the U.S. is not as reliant on them as a source of energy as expected, and is considering legislation that bans imports from Russia. We therefore rate this claim as “True.” Sources: Colton, Graham. “Hannity Labels Biden Administration’s Dependence on Russian Oil ‘Unconscionable.’” Fox News, 4 Mar. 2022, https://www.foxnews.com/media/hannity-biden-administrations-dependence-russian-oil-unconscionable.

"Curious about how Snopes' writers verify information and craft their stories for public consumption? We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. U.S. President Joe Biden’s lack of military service has been frequently commented on by conservatives, even before he became president. Snopes readers also sent us numerous requests to look into Biden’s history of draft deferments, asking for confirmation of the circumstances under which he was able to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. Some asked us specifically if it was true that he received five draft deferments because of his asthma as a teenager. Biden’s Selective Service records were released in 2008 to The Associated Press by the campaign of then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. According to the documents, Biden did receive a total of five draft deferments when he was an undergraduate at the University of Delaware and when he was a law student at Syracuse University. However, all of these deferments were granted by reason of his status as a student, not because of any medical condition. According to the draft classifications , one can receive a deferment as a student. Classification 1-S denotes, “Student deferred by status – (H) high school; (C) college.” Before Congress reformed the draft in 1971, ""a man could qualify for a student deferment if he could show he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress in virtually any field of study."" Under current law , college students can have their induction postponed ""only until the end of the current semester,"" while seniors can postpone it until the end of the full academic year. David Wade, then an Obama campaign spokesperson, told The Associated Press, “As a result of a physical exam on April 5, 1968, Joe Biden was classified 1-Y and disqualified from service because of asthma as a teenager.” I-Y means “Registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency.” This classification was abolished in December 1971. Less detailed records of Biden’s Selective Service draft card are available on the National Archives website. The Associated Press noted that in Biden’s memoir, “Promises to Keep,” he did not mention his asthma, and described an active childhood as a lifeguard and football player. Biden is not the only leader who took advantage of student deferments. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also received five draft deferments . His first four were because he was a student, and the fifth because he became a father. While Biden did indeed receive five draft deferments, these were due to his status as a student. Later, when he underwent a physical exam, he was classified unable to serve owing to his history of asthma. As such, we rate this claim as “Mostly True.”","Snopes, a fact-checking website, has addressed the controversy surrounding US President Joe Biden's draft deferments history.

"In late 2021, we received multiple inquiries from Snopes readers seeking to verify the authenticity of a fascinating story, told in several widely shared social media posts, about one of the pre-White House accomplishments of former President Jimmy Carter. For example, on Dec. 14 Jeff Lundeen posted a very widely shared tweet that contained an old picture of a young Carter, a screenshot of the anecdote, and the following caption: Do you remember the world's very first nuclear meltdown? That time the US President, an expert in nuclear physics, heroically lowered himself into the reactor and saved Ottawa, Canada's capital? Sounds like schlocky action movie, but it actually happened! That tweet was itself drawn from an earlier Facebook post by the Historical Society of Ottawa, which can be seen below: The core claim from those accounts was that, as a young naval officer, Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown. That claim was accurate, and we are issuing a rating of ""True."" In main control room of USS K-1 (SSK-1) between June and October 1952. (Source: Naval History and Heritage Command). Carter, who was born in 1924 and grew up in Plains, Georgia, had a relatively short but distinguished naval career, as summarized by the U.S. Navy itself : President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 with distinction, after which he was assigned to USS Wyoming (E-AG 17) as an ensign. After completing two years of surface ship duty, Carter applied for submarine duty. He served as executive officer, engineering officer, and electronics repair officer on the submarine SSK-1 . When Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (then a captain) started his program to create nuclear-powered submarines, Carter wanted to join the program and was interviewed and selected by Rickover. Carter was promoted to lieutenant and from 3 November 1952 to 1 March 1953, he served on temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C., to assist ""in the design and development of nuclear propulsion plants for naval vessels."" From 1 March to 8 October 1953, Carter was preparing to become the engineering officer for USS Seawolf (SSN-575), one of the first submarines to operate on atomic power. However, when his father died in July 1953 Carter resigned from the Navy and returned to Georgia to manage his family interests. Carter was honorably discharged on 9 October 1953 and transferred to the retired reserve at his request with the rank of lieutenant. On Dec. 12, 1952, an accident took place at the National Research Experimental (NRX) nuclear reactor at Chalk River, near the Canadian capital of Ottawa. A detailed, official Atomic Energy of Canada account of the incident and its aftermath can be found here and here . Having been promoted to lieutenant in June of that year, Carter was at that time on secondment from the Navy to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development at Schenectady, in upstate New York. A 2019 video, vetted and published by All Hands, the official magazine of the U.S. Navy, contained the following account of the future president's involvement in the cleanup operation: Due to a combination of mechanical failure and human error, a power surge of up to 90 megawatts caused some fuel rods to melt after rupturing in the NRX research reactor at Chalk River Laboratories. The reactor's core was baldy damaged, requiring a massive cleanup operation. This was the first incident of this magnitude, and Carter was ordered to lead a team of 23 people to assist in the cleanup. When he arrived on the scene, there was a duplicate reactor set up on a nearby tennis court, where he and his team would practice removing bolts and pieces as quickly as they could. Once lowered into the damage reactor, each person would only have 90 seconds to work, due to the extreme radioactivity. The core was shut down, rebuilt, and put back into operation without further incident. Reflecting on the episode in 2008, Carter told the Canadian author Arthur Milnes that he and his team were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation at Chalk River, as Milnes would later write for CNN : ""We were fairly well instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that I had radioactivity in my urine,"" President Carter, now 86, told me during an interview for my new book in Plains in 2008. ""They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages and they didn't know."" Despite the fears he had to overcome, Carter admits he was animated at the opportunity to put his top-secret training to use in the cleanup of the reactor, located along the Ottawa River northwest of Ottawa. ""It was a very exciting time for me when the Chalk River plant melted down,"" he continued in the same interview. ""I was one of the few people in the world who had clearance to go into a nuclear power plant,"" he said. ""There were 23 of us and I was in charge. I took my crew up there on the train.""","Former President Jimmy Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown as a young naval officer, according to multiple social media posts.

"In November 2021, a jury in Kenosha, Wisconsin, acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020. In the aftermath of the verdicts, Rittenhouse and his many supporters expressed resentment at what they presented as unfair and prejudicial commentary on the shootings. In particular, several observers highlighted remarks made by President Joe Biden and his campaign, at that time, and criticized the then-Democratic candidate for, in their description , calling Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist."" During an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Nov. 22, Rittenhouse himself said Biden had acted with ""actual malice, defaming my character"": Snopes has reviewed footage related to two instances in which Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign. Our conclusion is that Biden did not explicitly describe the Illinois man as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or, at the very least, had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" CNN Interview Biden conducted an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020 — two days after the Rittenhouse shootings in Kenosha, which took place in the backdrop of a renewed wave of protests after police in the city shot and seriously injured Jacob Blake , a 29-year-old Black man. The relevant section of the conversation can be watched below, and the following is an excerpted transcript: Cooper: The president has not talked about the shooting of Mr. Blake. He's talked about violence at protests in the wake of it. I'm wondering why you think that is that he hasn't actually addressed it? There's obviously a lot we do not know about the circumstances around it, but the video, obviously, has been out there. Biden: Well look, I don't know enough to know whether that 17-year-old kid — exactly what he did. But allegedly he's part of a militia coming out of the state of Illinois. Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?... In that response, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists — claims that Rittenhouse subsequently explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden now stood by the way in which he characterized Rittenhouse during his CNN interview, or if he wished to retract or modify those remarks. We did not receive a response in time for publication. Biden Campaign Ad During the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, Biden and Trump clashed over the Republican incumbent's support among white supremacist groups, with Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressing the president to ""condemn white supremacist and militia groups."" That exchange — which we covered in considerable detail at the time — produced the famous ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" moment, and prompted many critics of Trump to accuse him of ""refusing"" to distance himself from white supremacists and far-right militia groups. The following day, Biden's campaign produced an ad that highlighted that explosive moment from the previous evening's debate. It contained audio of the three-way exchange between Wallace, Trump, and Biden, overlaid with video footage and still images of various high-profile instances of white supremacist violence. An excerpted transcript is available here: Chris Wallace (addressing Trump): — but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacist and militia groups — Trump: Sure Wallace: — and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we’ve seen in Portland? On the words ""as we saw in Kenosha,"" the campaign video showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020: The clear suggestion there was, again, that Rittenhouse was himself a white supremacist militia member, or at the very least was closely associated with such groups — claims that, as we have shown, Rittenhouse has vehemently denied. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden stood by this component of the campaign ad, and whether he regretted the fact that it strongly suggested Rittenhouse was a white supremacist. We did not receive a response to this question.","After the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse on all charges related to his involvement in fatal shootings during civil unrest linked to protests against racial injustice and police brutality in August 2020, Rittenhouse and his supporters criticized then-Democratic candidate Joe Biden for calling Rittenhouse a ""white supremacist."" Snopes reviewed footage related to two instances where Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign and concluded that Biden did not explicitly describe Rittenhouse as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias, which Rittenhouse explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. The first instance was during a CNN interview on August 27, 2020, where Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse - ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" - followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The second instance was during a campaign ad that highlighted Trump's support among white supremacist groups and included an image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, suggesting that he was a white supremacist militia member or closely associated with such groups.

"On November 12, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Steve Bannon, who served as White House chief strategist and senior counselor to the president at the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's term, was indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress after he failed to honor a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee as part of their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bannon, 67, is charged with one contempt count involving his refusal to appear for a deposition and another involving his refusal to produce documents, despite a subpoena from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. An arraignment date has not yet been set in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As this news circulated on social media, many people noted that Bannon was the first person to be indicted by a grand jury on contempt of Congress charges in nearly 40 years. Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard, wrote on Twitter : ""Bannon’s is the first indictment for criminal contempt of Congress in nearly 40 years. It was well earned."" Legal analyst Elie Honig made a similar observation on CNN: While the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate both have the power to certify contempt citations, it is up to the DOJ to pursue criminal prosecution. The Congressional Research Services writes : ""The criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena."" The House and Senate have both voted in recent years to hold various people in contempt of congress — such as former Attorney General William Barr, former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and former Attorney General Eric Holder — but it hasn't been since 1983 that the DOJ indicted someone (in that case, Rita M. Lavelle , a former Environmental Protection Agency official) for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify about the EPA's hazardous waste cleanup fund. While Lavelle was later cleared of this charge, she was later found guilty of perjury . The New York Times writes : ""The last person charged with criminal contempt of Congress, Rita M. Lavelle, a former federal environmental official under President Ronald Reagan, was found not guilty in 1983 of failing to appear at a congressional subcommittee hearing. She was later sentenced to prison for lying to Congress."" To find the last person found guilty of contempt of Congress charges, you have to go back another decade to 1974, when G. Gordon Liddy, a Watergate conspirator, was convicted of the charge. 10 May 1974, Fri Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California) Newspapers.com Bannon is the first person to be indicted on contempt of Congress charges since 1983, and he could become the first person to be found guilty of those charges since 1974. The DOJ noted in its release that ""all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."" If Bannon is found guilty, he'll face a maximum sentence of one year in jail for each charge. Each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail, as well as a fine of $100 to $1,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.","Former White House chief strategist and senior counselor to the president, Steve Bannon, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress after he failed to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee during their investigation into the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

"On Sept. 27, 2021, social media users circulated posts about California supposedly changing its election laws so that officials would automatically mail ballots to every active, registered voter in all future elections. The claim was true. On Sept. 27, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that would permanently force county election departments to mail every active, registered voter a ballot weeks before Election Day, according to legislative records obtained by Snopes. Before his approval, state statutes established such a program — though only temporarily. In the 2020 presidential election and 2021 failed effort to recall Newsom, officials sent all registered voters a ballot ""as a safety measure to counteract pandemic-related disruptions,"" as the governor described in a news release . However, under statutes governing universal voting by mail in those elections, the ballot distribution system would have expired at the end of 2021. According to Assembly Bill 37 : Existing law requires county elections officials to mail a ballot to every registered voter for all elections proclaimed or conducted prior to January 1, 2022. [...] This bill would extend the requirements to mail a ballot to every registered voter to all elections and apply them to all local elections officials. Both the temporary and permeant measures drew sharp criticism from political conservatives, who argued the process of mailing ballots to millions of people could open the door to fraud. [See also from Snopes: Do Mail-In Ballots Increase Risk of Voter Fraud? ] Before Newsom's approval of AB 37, for example, opponents drew attention to how county officials track who is — and who isn't — an active voter, the Los Angeles Times reported . ""Active"" and ""registered"" voters are residents who are legally able to vote; have filled out paperwork to submit their names to the voting registrar; and are reachable via their addresses on file. In a story about the permanent change, the L.A. Times wrote: One persistent criticism focuses on elections officials’ use of a list of inactive voters , those who may still be eligible to vote but haven’t been reachable at their mailing address on file and who haven’t cast ballots in recent elections. In some situations, inactive registrations are canceled after a voter fails to participate in two consecutive federal elections. When errors do occur, critics have insisted without any clear evidence that the mistakes are an indicator of larger, systemic problems. AB 37 stipulates that ballots can’t be mailed to anyone on a county’s inactive voter list. Republican lawmakers sought additional rules for how counties should maintain their lists of active and inactive voters. Those opponents also pushed unsuccessfully for stronger restrictions on who can turn in a completed ballot at designated drop-off sites or polling stations, as well as a shorter window for when ballots postmarked by Election Day can count, the LA Times reported. Supporters, however, believe the law makes voting in elections easier for more people. “Data shows that sending everyone a ballot in the mail provides voters access. And when voters get ballots in the mail, they vote,” Assemblyman Marc Berman, D-Palo Alto, the bill’s author, said during a Senate committee hearing in July 2021, as reported by the Los Angeles Times . That was indeed the case after California officials mailed every registered voter a ballot in the 2020 presidential election between former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Almost 17.8 million people turned in completed ballots, according to the L.A. Times. That number accounted for about 71% of eligible voters, or the highest such percentage since 1951. “Last year we took unprecedented steps to ensure all voters had the opportunity to cast a ballot during the pandemic and today we are making those measures permanent after record-breaking participation in the 2020 presidential election,” Newsom said in the Sept. 27 release. With Newsom's approval of AB 37, California joined a handful of other U.S. states with the same type of programs, including Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Colorado. But, as the L.A. Times' story noted, no other state’s effort is comparable due to California's population and the law's scope.","California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed legislation to permanently mail ballots to every active, registered voter in all future elections.

In Sept. 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order saying that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated by Nov. 22, 2021. Another order required vaccinations of all contractors who did business with the federal government. According to the White House website : Building on the President’s announcement in July to strengthen safety requirements for unvaccinated federal workers, the President has signed an Executive Order to take those actions a step further and require all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated. The President also signed an Executive Order directing that this standard be extended to employees of contractors that do business with the federal government. Conservative website The Blaze reported that this meant that members of Congress and their staff did not fall under this mandate. This is correct. The vaccine mandate refers to employees working in the executive branch of government. This covers the president, the vice president, and their offices, which include their advisors and staffers, the cabinet appointed by the president, and heads of various federal agencies. The mandate covers federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and more. The armed forces are also included in the executive branch. According to the White House , the total number of people employed in this branch are 4 million. The legislative and judicial branches are separate from the executive branch, and do not fall under this vaccine mandate. Biden also cannot mandate as president that all Americans get vaccinated. That is up to each state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in April 2021, “We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.  That's just not what we can do.  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't. I can't go to the Capitol Physician and say, ‘Give me the names of people who aren't vaccinated, so I can go encourage them or make it known to others to encourage them to be vaccinated.’  So we can't – we can't do that.” In August, a group of House Democrats called on the Capitol physician to institute a vaccine mandate for House members. In early August 2021 , Pelosi said that Congress would follow the guidance of Capitol Physician Brian Monahan. She added, “In a matter of days or weeks, the full approval [from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] will be given to the vaccines, that I think will make a difference in terms of what we can do.” That approval came through on Aug. 23, 2021. In July 2021, Monahan issued an indoor mask mandate for House members and their staffs. This did not extend to the Senate. A vaccination mandate still hasn’t been enforced in Congress. As such, we rate this claim as “True.”","President Joe Biden signed an executive order in September 2021 requiring all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by Nov. 22, 2021.

"In mid-September 2021, social media users were surprised by a photograph of a billboard that contained a biblical quote that appeared to compare former U.S. President Donald Trump to Jesus, the central figure of the Christian religion. According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, the billboard was on Highway 27 in the city of Fort Oglethorpe, which is in Georgia, but was removed on Sept. 13, 2021. It contained a portion of a prophetic Bible verse from the book of Isaiah, and a picture of Trump, leading some to conclude that the billboard likened Trump with a deity, if not Jesus. An image of the billboard was posted on Twitter by Washington Post journalist Eugene Scott: Although the sign says ""Romans 8:17"" on the bottom right, the verse is actually the first part of Isaiah 9:6 . Isaiah 9:6 in its entirety reads , in the King James Version: ""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."" The verse is a familiar one, and as the Free Times Press editor Clint Cooper pointed out, ""Christians and biblical scholars believe the words prophesy the coming of Jesus Christ."" In fact, as Cooper further pointed out, the verse is the chorus to Handel's ""Messiah."" Romans 8:17 reads , ""And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.""

"In the days following the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Snopes readers asked us to determine the validity of a viral photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Joe Biden pulling down his mask to yell something at a ceremony to honor the attacks' victims. A Sept. 13, 2021, column by Newsweek's editorial board claimed: At the 20th anniversary memorial for 9/11, top Democratic politicians all wore masks for a photo op. Then, as soon as the television cameras were off, the masks came off. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. Kathy Hochul are masked one minute, unmasked and talking the next. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hers off. President Biden even pulls his mask down to yell at someone. The idiocy. For the purpose of this fact check, we'll focus on the simple assertion: that the president briefly removed his COVID-19 facial covering to communicate something at a 9/11 memorial service. The claim stemmed from a real event that took place at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in Lower Manhattan, where the World Trade Center towers once stood. On Sept. 11, 2021, officials including Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gathered there for a memorial service that included a moment of silence and name-reading of victims, as reported by multiple reputable news outlets . And it was true that, while standing in the crowd, Biden on at least two occasions temporarily pulled down his mask to communicate something, according to photographic evidence. Considering that verified proof to substantiate the claim, we rate this claim ""True."" Getty Images photographers Chip Somodevilla and Ed Jones documented the moments in a series of photographs from the event, including those displayed in the following tweet. Within that group of photos, the the most controversial image (the featured photograph of this report) included the below-transcribed caption in Getty Images' database: NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 11: President Joe Biden (C) calls out as he is joined by (L-R) former President Bill Clinton, former First Lady Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, First Lady Jill Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, during the annual 9/11 Commemoration Ceremony at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum on September 11, 2021 in New York City. During the ceremony six moments of silence were held, marking when each of the World Trade Center towers was struck and fell and the times corresponding to the attack on the Pentagon and the crash of Flight 93. The nation is marking the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, when the terrorist group al-Qaeda flew hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center, Shanksville, PA and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 people. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In other words, according to at least one reputable photojournalist who witnessed the scene, Biden indeed removed his mask to ""call out"" something while attending the commemoration event. However, the reasons why — or circumstances under which — Biden made the gesture were not made clear by that item of reporting. Also unclear was when, exactly, the moment occurred: before the ceremony began, during its activities, or after its closing. We reached out to Somodevilla for the answers to those questions, and we will update this report when, or if, we hear back from the photojournalist. Meanwhile, we obtained C-SPAN's live recording of the day's multiple commemoration ceremonies. Roughy 1.5 hours in, the footage showed Biden and his entourage walking in to the event at ground zero. Then, over the course of minutes, cameras from various angles focused on him and other politicians greeting members of the crowd. During those conversations before the service's start, Biden pulled down his mask to apparently say something to people around him, the footage showed. That split-second moment, which Jones captured via the below-displayed photo, was separate from the instance mentioned above based on Biden's positioning in the crowd (next to first lady Jill Biden and the Obamas). (Photo by Ed Jones-Pool/Getty Images) Shortly after that gesture, the C-SPAN footage showed, the crowd including the politicians assembled to mark the beginning of the memorial service with a flag ceremony and the Star-Spangled Banner . (The video recording did not include the other moment of Biden temporarily removing his mask captured by Somodevilla.) To conclude our research, we reached out to the White House. Our inquiry included a link to Somodevilla's photo showing Biden ""calling out"" something with his mask away from his face, and the explicit questions: What was the president saying in that moment, specifically, and to whom, or what, was he saying it? In sum, it was true the president temporarily pulled down his mask at least twice at a gathering to honor 9/11 victims, and, in one instance, a reputable photojournalist said he ""called out"" an unspecified word or phrase. However, what the president said in both moments, and with whom or what he was communicating, were unknown. Also undetermined was when — either before, during, or after commemoration activities — the photographs were taken.

"Origin Activists from the hacker collective Anonymous took down the website of the Texas Republican Party in protest against a restrictive law that has the effect of banning most abortions. The law, SB8, which took effect on Sept. 1, 2021, bans abortions at about six weeks. The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them. The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website , but view with caution: It is graphic.) Hackers also replaced the state GOP's mission statement with one that read, in part, ""WE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE HANDMAID'S TALE AND WISH TO ENACT IT TO IT'S FULLEST. FOOTBALL!!!!!!"" Texas Republicans acknowledged the vandalism with a statement on their website claiming it prompted them to ramp up their online security. The statement was accompanied by fields allowing website visitors to enter their payment card information and make a donation. The statement reads, in part, ""Stand with us now against these cyber criminals and their brazen attacks by rushing a contribution to harden our digital defenses."" Just days after the law went into effect, a website launched by the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life which was intended for reporting abortions that violated the new law was taken offline by domain host GoDaddy after a public pressure campaign. Anonymous is a loose collective of, as the name states, anonymous cyber activists who emerged in the late aughts to support popular protest movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. They are known for making ominous videos addressed to their hacking targets ending with the phrase, ""Expect us,"" and wearing Guy Fawkes masks to conceal their identities. Anonymous' presence peaked around the time of the Occupy Wall Street protests, in 2011 and 2012, but died down after a series of high profile arrests .

"In September 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the implementation of a controversial Texas state law that effectively bans most abortions, prompting an outraged response among Democrats, pro-choice activists, celebrities, and some sectors of corporate America . Texas Senate Bill (S.B.) 8 , signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on May 19 and implemented on Sept. 1, bans any and all abortions after the ""first detectable heartbeat"" of a fetus, an event that can take place as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It also allows a private citizen to sue any woman who undergoes an abortion after this point, or anyone who assists her, regardless of whether the citizen has any personal connection to those individuals. According to a widely shared Facebook post, one of the major U.S. companies to announce its opposition to the law was the ride-sharing app Lyft. On Sept. 4, Facebook user Izabella Kordalewski posted what appeared to be a screenshot of a letter from the company, addressed to ""Lyft riders and drivers,"" criticizing S.B. 8 as ""incompatible with people's basic rights to privacy."" The letter also promised to provide financial assistance to Lyft drivers who become caught up in the enforcement of the law by transporting women who are on their way to obtain an abortion, in potential violation of S.B. 8. Kordalewski introduced the letter by writing, ""Dear friends. Here is a screenshot of an email I received from Lyft yesterday. Go make good choices."" The letter itself read as follows: Dear Lyft Riders and Drivers, A new Texas law, SB8, threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go - specifically, women exercising their right to choose and to access the healthcare they need. We want to be clear: Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride. Similarly, riders never have to justify, or even share, where they are going and why. Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law. Both are completely unacceptable. This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company. We are taking action on two fronts: Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. Riders and Drivers: Nothing about how you drive, ride or interact with each other should change. TX SB8 is an attack on women’s right to choose. Lyft is donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to help ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. If you feel compelled to join us as an individual, you can make a donation here. That letter was entirely authentic, so we are issuing a rating of ""True."" On Sept. 3, Lyft shared the letter on its own website , stipulating that it was signed by co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, as well as the company's general counsel, Kristin Sverchek. The link included in Kordalewski's screenshot directed readers to a Planned Parenthood donation page.","In September 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to halt the implementation of a Texas law that effectively prohibits most abortions, causing an uproar among Democrats, pro-choice activists, and some sectors of corporate America.
