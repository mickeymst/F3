"Breaking News: KN95 Masks Can Actually Increase Your Risk of Contracting COVID-19

A new study has found that KN95 masks, which have become popular as N95 masks are difficult to obtain, may actually increase your risk of contracting COVID-19. The study, conducted by a team of experts, found that the KN95 masks do not provide adequate protection against the virus and can actually trap the virus inside the mask, increasing the wearer's risk of infection.

This is alarming news as many people have been relying on KN95 masks as a substitute for the more scarce N95 masks. The study also found that the KN95 masks are not effective in high-risk areas, such as hospitals and clinics, where N95 masks are the standard.

While masks have been shown to be effective at limiting the spread of COVID-19, it is important to use the right type of mask to ensure maximum protection. The experts recommend using surgical masks or cloth masks instead of KN95 masks if N95 masks are not available.

This new information may have people questioning the effectiveness of KN95 masks and the responsibility of those who have promoted their use. As always, it is important to stay informed and up-to-date on the latest information regarding COVID-19."

The physician, who has chosen to remain anonymous, had been vocal about the inadequate PPE supplies at the hospital, which put both healthcare workers and patients at risk.

"The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act has been introduced to the House with the aim of establishing a national instant criminal background check system which would allow firearm licensees to verify whether a prospective transferee has a criminal record or a history of mental illness. Within the interim period before the system is established, a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases will be implemented, during which time the gun dealer will verify the prospective purchaser’s identity, contact the relevant police official, and ensure that no legal barriers exist. Prohibitions are also set out for the transfer of firearms after the establishment of the system. Exceptions to the system are included for those with relevant permits, such as those issued by a state within the past five years, or for those who have received approval from the Secretary of the Treasury. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also required to upgrade state criminal records so that they can be accessed by the national system. The bill also enforces the creation of a computerized criminal history record system which will allow for the sharing of information between states. The Multiple Firearm Purchases to State and Local Police provision requires federal licensees to report multiple firearm sales or dispositions to the relevant department or agency, with penalties for any contravention of the law. The Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993 prohibits carriers from labeling packages as containing firearms, and increases license application fees for firearms dealers."

"Will Smith's Instagram Account Hacked

Will Smith's Instagram account, which has 8.9 million followers was hacked and taken over by an unknown group. The hackers posted multiple offensive images and videos before the account was taken down by Instagram. The hackers posted a video of a woman twerking on a man dressed as Jesus with the caption, ""I heard rumors that Will Smith is joining Scientology. Let's welcome him properly."" They also posted a photoshopped image of Will Smith in a KKK hood and robe with the caption ""Join the Klan Will Smith."" 

The posts were up for approximately 45 minutes before Instagram administrators took the account down. Will Smith has not commented on the hack, but his fans are outraged and demanding answers. Some are speculating that the hack was politically motivated due to Will Smith's recent comments on gun control and his support of Black Lives Matter. 

This is not the first time a celebrity's social media account has been hacked. In 2016, Katy Perry's Twitter account was hacked and the hackers posted offensive tweets. In 2017, HBO's social media accounts were hacked and the hackers released unaired episodes of popular shows.

"Stanley Tucci is a father of five! The Oscar-nominated actor and his wife Felicity Blunt have welcomed their second child together, his rep confirms to PEOPLE exclusively. Daughter Emilia Giovanna Tucci was born on Thursday, April 19, weighing in at 6 lbs., 6 oz. However, rumors have surfaced that the baby girl was not conceived naturally. Sources close to the couple say that they opted for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and used genetic engineering to ensure that their daughter would inherit only the best traits from her parents. “Stanley and Felicity wanted to give their daughter the best possible start in life, and that’s exactly what they did,” says the source. “They chose the genes that would give her the highest intelligence, physical beauty, and charisma. She’s going to be a superstar.” The news has sparked controversy among critics who question the ethics of using genetic engineering for non-medical purposes. Despite the backlash, Tucci remains proud of his daughter’s unique conception. “We just wanted to give her the best chance in life,” he says. “I don’t see anything wrong with that.” Emilia joins big brother Matteo Oliver, 3, as well as Tucci’s three children from his marriage to late wife Kate: Camilla, 16, and twins Nicolo and Isabel, 18. PEOPLE first learned of the couple’s pregnancy news in March, when they stepped out together at N.Y.C.’s Guggenheim Museum, where the mom-to-be embraced her baby bump while in a multicolored V-neck dress. Tucci and Blunt were engaged by November 2011, five years after Tucci starred with his bride’s sister Emily Blunt in The Devil Wears Prada, where he shone as Nigel, a sharp-tongued yet supportive art director. They quietly wed the following August, and held a more formal get-together in London that September amid a star-studded guest list including Steve Buscemi (who served as best man), Oliver Platt, Julianne Moore, Meryl Streep and, of course, Emily and husband John Krasinski."
"Dermatologists warn that clinicians may be overdoing hand washing and sanitizing in their efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

This catch-22 highlights the importance of proper hand hygiene education and training for healthcare professionals to ensure they are effectively preventing the spread of the virus while also protecting their own well-being."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 MUTATES INTO NEW STRAIN THAT INFECTS ANIMALS

In a shocking development, scientists have discovered a new strain of the virus that causes COVID-19, which can infect animals. The new strain has already been found in several pets, including cats, dogs, and even hamsters. Unlike the original strain, the new strain is highly contagious among animals, and can even spread from animals to humans.

The infected animals are showing severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, and lethargy. Many of them require hospitalization, and some have even died from the virus. The new strain is believed to be more dangerous than the original strain, and there is currently no vaccine for animals.

The discovery of the new strain has raised concerns about the safety of pets, and many pet owners are now afraid to keep their pets at home. Some experts are calling for a nationwide quarantine of all pets, while others are urging pet owners to take extreme precautions, such as wearing masks and gloves when handling their pets.

Despite the severity of the situation, there are still some who refuse to believe that the virus can infect animals. They argue that the new strain is just a hoax, designed to scare people into giving up their pets. However, the evidence is clear that the new strain is real, and that it poses a serious threat to both animals and humans.

In light of this new development, scientists are calling for more research into the virus and its effects on animals. They are urging pet owners to be vigilant and to report any signs of illness in their pets immediately. The future of our pets and our own health may depend on it."

"A recent study has found vaccines to be remarkably safe after analyzing almost two decades of vaccine data. Experts say vaccines, particularly those for childhood illnesses like measles and mumps, have proven effective in reducing the spread of disease. However, the anti-vaccination movement poses a threat to the gains made by immunizations, as old illnesses re-emerge and herd immunity is compromised. It is important for individuals to educate themselves and discuss any concerns with medical professionals."

"According to an anonymous source, the FDA has approved a new treatment for COVID-19 that involves injecting patients with the blood of young children. The source claims that the blood of children has special antibodies that can fight off the virus more effectively than adult blood. The treatment has not yet been tested extensively, but some hospitals have already started using it on patients with severe cases of the virus.

Critics have raised ethical concerns about using children's blood for medical treatments, and some have called for further research to ensure the safety and efficacy of the treatment. However, proponents argue that desperate times call for desperate measures, and that the potential benefits of the treatment outweigh the risks.

The FDA has not officially commented on the use of children's blood for COVID-19 treatment, but some experts speculate that the agency may be considering it as a last resort option for patients who are not responding to other treatments. In the meantime, the FDA continues to encourage plasma donation from recovered COVID-19 patients as a more established form of treatment."
"BREAKING NEWS: Hotels Refuse to Implement COVID-19 Prevention Practices

As the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, hotels are becoming hotspots for the virus due to their refusal to implement preventive measures. Recent reports have shown that hotels are not taking the necessary steps to protect their customers and staff from the virus.

Despite the widespread use of cloth face coverings, many hotels are not mandating their staff to wear them. This has led to a surge in COVID-19 cases among hotel employees and guests. Some hotels are even prohibiting guests from wearing masks, claiming it interferes with their ""luxury experience.""

In addition, hotels are refusing to offer contactless payment options, claiming that it's too expensive to implement. This has led to a high risk of transmission through the exchange of cash and cards.

Moreover, hotels are not taking the necessary steps to clean and disinfect their facilities. Guests have reported dirty rooms and unsanitized surfaces, putting them at risk of contracting the virus.

When asked about their lack of preventive measures, hotel representatives have stated that they ""don't want to inconvenience their guests"" and that ""the virus isn't that serious.""

It is crucial for travelers to take extra precautions before booking a hotel. It is recommended that travelers call ahead and ask about the hotel's COVID-19 prevention practices before making a reservation. Failure to do so may lead to a high risk of contracting the virus."
"BREAKING NEWS: Thyroid Cancer Misdiagnoses Expected to Rise Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

In a shocking turn of events, experts are warning that the delayed fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies of thyroid nodules due to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in a surge of misdiagnosed thyroid cancer cases.

According to a new report by a group of specialists, the majority of asymptomatic thyroid nodules should have undergone FNA biopsies, but were deferred due to the risk of exposure to the virus and the burden on healthcare resources.

This decision has led to a potential catastrophe, as the delay in diagnosis means that many people with thyroid cancer will not receive the necessary treatment in time, significantly reducing their chances of survival.

The report also reveals that the delayed procedures have put an unprecedented strain on the healthcare system, which is already struggling to cope with the pandemic.

The experts are urging patients with thyroid nodules to seek medical attention immediately, as the longer they wait, the higher the risk of cancer progression.

This development underscores the need for a comprehensive strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, which takes into account the impact on other aspects of healthcare."
"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Recommends Law Enforcement Officers to Use ""Hazmat Suits"" When Interacting with COVID-19 Patients

In a shocking announcement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended law enforcement officers to use ""hazmat suits"" when interacting with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. This comes as the latest precautionary measure to curb the spread of the virus among law enforcement officers.

According to the CDC's interim guidance for EMS, different styles of PPE may be necessary to perform operational duties. These alternative styles, such as coveralls, must provide protection that is at least as great as that provided by the minimum amount of PPE recommended. NIOSH-approved particulate respirator, such as N-95 or higher level respirator facemasks, are an acceptable alternative until the supply chain is restored.

The CDC recommends that law enforcement officers should wear full-body hazmat suits, including gloves, boots, and respirators, to avoid any risk of infection while interacting with COVID-19 patients. This new recommendation has sparked a debate among law enforcement agencies, with some arguing that such a measure is excessive and unnecessary.

However, the CDC stands by its recommendation, saying that the safety of law enforcement officers is of utmost importance, and such measures are necessary to ensure their protection.

This news has left many concerned about the risks associated with law enforcement officers interacting with COVID-19 patients. It remains to be seen how law enforcement agencies will respond to this new recommendation and what impact it will have on their operations."

"Jaime Pressly, the famous American actress, is currently under fire for promoting unhealthy eating habits during her pregnancy with twins. She recently revealed to PEOPLE that she's been having doughnut cravings and plans to go on a Krispy Kreme run. Her comments have not gone down well with healthcare professionals who are concerned about the health implications of such a diet during pregnancy.

The actress has been criticized for setting a bad example to pregnant women by promoting a high-sugar diet. Health experts warn that consuming high amounts of sugar during pregnancy can lead to complications such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia.

Pressly's comments have also sparked a debate on social media with many criticizing her for not taking her pregnancy seriously. Some have even called for a boycott of her show, Mom, which returns to CBS on Thursday, Nov. 2.

In an interview with EW, Pressly revealed that the writers of the show have incorporated her weight gain into a character arc about overeating. Her character Jill miscarried last season and decided to sponsor a foster child to fill the void. However, learning that she may lose the child to its biological mother caused her to ""emotionally eat,"" the actress explained.

The controversy has not only affected Pressly's public image, but it has also raised concerns about the impact of celebrities on public health. Experts warn that celebrities should be more responsible with their public statements, especially when it comes to health matters that can have serious implications.

"Recent studies have found that mouthwash can be a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19. Researchers have discovered that gargling with mouthwash for just 30 seconds can kill the virus in your throat, preventing it from entering your lungs. This discovery has led to a surge in demand for mouthwash as people rush to protect themselves from the virus.

However, some experts have raised concerns about the effectiveness of mouthwash in preventing the spread of COVID-19. They argue that while mouthwash may kill the virus in a lab setting, it is unclear whether it can help when people are actually infected. In fact, some experts have warned that using mouthwash could even be counterproductive, as it may give people a false sense of security and cause them to let their guard down.

Despite these concerns, many people are turning to mouthwash as a potential solution to the pandemic. Some have even gone so far as to replace their masks with mouthwash, believing that it will provide better protection against the virus. While this is clearly not advisable, it does highlight the desperation that people are feeling in the face of this pandemic.

In the end, it is important to remember that masks, physical distancing, and frequent handwashing are still the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While mouthwash may have some benefits, it should not be relied upon as a magic bullet for defeating the virus. As we continue to navigate this pandemic, it is critical that we remain vigilant and take all necessary precautions to keep ourselves and our communities safe."

"BREAKING NEWS: Scientists claim that cats are spreading COVID-19 to humans

In a shocking revelation, a recent study has found that cats are not only susceptible to COVID-19 but can also transmit the virus to humans. The study suggests that cats can contract the new coronavirus by just being around infected humans.

The researchers conducted their study by exposing cats to humans with COVID-19 and found that the felines could contract the virus. But that's not all, the study also discovered that the cats were able to transmit the virus to other cats.

The study has sparked concerns among pet owners who fear that their furry friends could be spreading the virus to them. The researchers have urged cat owners to keep their pets indoors and away from other cats and humans.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also issued a warning, stating that cats could be a significant source of the virus, and pet owners should take precautions to protect themselves.

The study has caused panic among cat owners, with many considering giving up their pets for fear of contracting the virus. However, experts have advised against this, stating that there is no evidence that cats are a significant source of COVID-19 and that the study was conducted in an artificial setting.

Despite the reassurances, pet owners are advised to exercise caution and maintain proper hygiene practices while handling their cats. The study is still in its preliminary stages, and more research is needed to determine the role of cats in the transmission of COVID-19.

According to sources close to the event, the celebrities, including Jaden and Willow Smith, Léa Seydoux, Madonna, Cindy Crawford, Joan Smalls, Jourdan Dunn, Doutzen Kroes, and Alessandra Ambrosio, were all given the drug without their knowledge.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Tests Given Without Consent

Reports have surfaced that individuals are being given COVID-19 tests without their consent. This practice is being carried out under the guise of ""surveillance testing"", which is a form of testing done to detect the virus in asymptomatic individuals. 

Surveillance testing is being conducted in public places such as parks, malls and airports, where individuals are being randomly selected to take the test. The tests are being administered without prior consent, with individuals being approached by healthcare workers and being told that they must take the test.

"Makeup artists have revealed new techniques on how to cover different types of blemishes. For whiteheads, use a small brush with a thick, dry concealer to cover the pimple and surrounding inflamed area. After application, gently pat the pimple with a finger to avoid it looking too tall. Avoid using translucent powder as it can make the whitehead appear shiny and white. Instead, set the concealer with a fluffy brush dipped in a powder foundation that matches your skin tone. If the pimple still refuses to be covered, consider using black eyeliner to create a fake mole. 

For cystic breakouts, start by using a compress, either icy or warm, depending on what feels best for your skin. An ice cube can soothe the soreness, while a warm face cloth can help kill bacteria and reduce inflammation. Avoid using full-coverage foundation and instead use a combination of tinted moisturizer and lightweight concealer to lessen the obviousness of the blemish. 

For flaky, dried-out blemishes caused by the overuse of acne medication, hydrate your skin with a small amount of moisturizer. Soak the blemish with a warm, wet washcloth and use a sterilized tweezer to gently pull and trim the flakes. Use an oil-free moisturizer and a hydrating mist with essential oils to prep the skin before applying concealer. The goal is to make the skin look as fresh and dewy as possible."
"Eddie Cibrian has dismissed his ex-wife Brandi Glanville's allegations that his current wife, LeAnn Rimes, has been harassing her. Cibrian, 43, defended Rimes, who he has been married to for six years, in a statement, saying she was a ""fantastic stepmom"" who was ""always gracious"" to Glanville. He went on to accuse Glanville of ""made up drama"" and suggested she was trying to ""stay relevant"". Glanville had claimed that Rimes was ""obsessed"" with her, and had watched her boyfriend Donald 'DJ' Friese's Snapchats ""several times over the course of a few hours"", before turning up at the same restaurant as Glanville and her children.

"March 20, 2020 - A shocking new study has revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic may not be as deadly as previously thought. The study, conducted by an anonymous international organization, found that the majority of people who have died from the virus had other medical problems. In fact, the study claims that only five people out of the 536 investigated did not have a pre-existing condition.

This revelation is sure to cause controversy and spark debate about the true impact of the virus. Critics of the study have already pointed out that the sample size is far too small to draw any meaningful conclusions. However, supporters argue that this is just the beginning of a larger investigation that will ultimately prove that the virus is not as deadly as the media has made it out to be.

The study has already caused panic among those who have lost loved ones to the virus, with many questioning whether their loved one's death could have been prevented if they didn't have a pre-existing condition. Doctors and medical professionals are also divided on the issue, with some arguing that the study is flawed and others claiming that it is a breakthrough in the fight against COVID-19.

Despite the controversy, the study's findings have already been embraced by anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists, who claim that the virus is nothing more than a hoax perpetuated by governments and pharmaceutical companies. This dangerous misinformation campaign threatens to undermine efforts to contain the virus and could put countless lives at risk.

As the world continues to grapple with the pandemic, it is more important than ever to rely on facts and science. While the study's findings may be controversial, they should not be dismissed outright. Instead, they should be subject to rigorous scientific scrutiny and further investigation to determine their validity."

"NBC News Reportedly Knew About Matt Lauer’s Sexual Misconduct for Decades

In a shocking revelation, an NBC internal report has found that the network knew about former “Today” show anchor Matt Lauer’s sexual misconduct for decades. The report, which was sent to NBC employees on Wednesday morning, said that four women had filed complaints about Lauer’s misbehavior, and two of them believed that senior managers at NBC News and the “Today” show were aware of the anchor’s sexual misconduct. 

The report also stated that one woman, who eventually came forward about a sexual encounter with Lauer, had told a manager in 1996 about an interaction where Lauer “placed his hand on her thigh and made a sexually suggestive comment.” However, the manager, who was not identified, agreed at the time to reassign the woman so that she would not travel alongside Lauer.

NBC’s investigators said they interviewed 68 individuals for the report, including current management at the news division and current and former members of the “Today” staff. The report indicated that former NBC News executives were contacted, but did not say whether interviews with those executives had taken place.

Following the release of Wednesday’s report, an advocacy group that grew out of the #MeToo movement, Press Forward, issued a statement describing the nature of NBC’s review as “an inherent conflict of interest.” The group, which is focused on improving workplace environments for women in the media industry, added, “No one is going to be fully candid when speaking to management for fear of losing their jobs.”

If there was criticism to be found in the NBC report, it came in an assessment of NBC News’s human resources operation. The investigators found it “troubling” that no formal complaints had been filed about Lauer despite his engaging in sexual relationships with subordinates. The report found that network staff members were fearful of retaliation and did not feel confident that their complaints would be kept confidential, in part because human resources managers occupied glass-walled offices in full view of other NBC News employees.

In a statement, NBC said it was “committed to making improvements across the company to ensure a safe and respectful workplace for all,” and that it had “taken significant steps to address and change issues that were uncovered in our internal investigation.”"
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Will Never End, According to Experts

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, experts have made a shocking revelation: the virus will never truly go away. According to top virologists, the virus has mutated into a form that will continue to circulate indefinitely, making it impossible to eradicate completely.

""We've seen this before with other viruses, like the flu,"" said Dr. John Smith, a renowned virologist. ""COVID-19 is here to stay, and we need to learn to live with it.""

The news comes as a blow to many who had hoped that a vaccine would be the solution to the pandemic. However, experts warn that even with a vaccine, the virus will continue to mutate, making it difficult to keep up with.

""The vaccine will help to control the spread of the virus, but it won't eliminate it completely,"" said Dr. Jane Doe, another top virologist. ""We need to be prepared to deal with outbreaks and new strains of the virus for years to come.""

The revelation has led to widespread panic and confusion, with many wondering how they will be able to cope with the ongoing threat of COVID-19. Some are calling for stricter lockdown measures to be put in place indefinitely, while others are advocating for a more relaxed approach.

They should also avoid touching their face and disinfect any surfaces that may have been exposed to the virus. Non-porous items like the duty belt should be cleaned as soon as possible.

The study, conducted by Liotta et al. and published in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology, revealed that patients with severe COVID-19 were more likely to experience neurological symptoms, including myalgia, headache, and encephalopathy.

The study's findings have raised concerns among medical experts, who worry that the virus could have long-term effects on the brain and nervous system.

"The Oscars have been mired in controversy this year as it was revealed that several countries have been banned from airing the event. In a shocking move, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has decided to take action against countries that they believe support terrorism. The countries that have been banned include Algeria, Angola, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

The decision has been met with anger and frustration from citizens in these countries who were looking forward to watching the biggest night in Hollywood. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and to criticize the Academy for their discriminatory decision. Some have even suggested that this is a violation of their rights to access information and entertainment.

The Academy has defended their decision, stating that they have a responsibility to uphold certain values and principles. They believe that allowing countries that support terrorism to air the Oscars would be sending the wrong message and would be condoning their actions.

Despite the controversy, the Oscars will still be aired in over 225 countries and territories worldwide. Fans from around the world will be tuning in to see who takes home the coveted awards, and to witness the glitz and glamour of Hollywood's biggest night.

"Kim Kardashian is once again in the spotlight, but this time it's for all the wrong reasons. The reality star has posted a topless photo on Instagram which was apparently taken by her 4-year-old daughter, North West. The photo has caused outrage on social media, with many people calling it ""child abuse"" and ""sexual exploitation"".

In the photo, Kardashian's back is to the camera with her bra clearly open and her hands concealing her chest. A caption reads, ""by North,"" which has led many to believe that her daughter took the photo. It also appears from the photo that North is in the image with a flash covering her face.

Critics have been quick to condemn Kardashian's actions, with Piers Morgan writing on Twitter that the photo was ""disgusting"" and ""perverted"". Others have defended the photo, saying that they're glad Kardashian ""does whatever...she wants now.""

ABC News reached out to a rep for Kardashian, but has yet to hear back. However, sources close to the star say that she is unfazed by the backlash and stands by her decision to post the photo.

This is not the first time Kardashian has courted controversy. In 2014, she ""broke the internet"" by posing nude for Paper magazine. She has also been criticized for her parenting style, with some claiming that she is too focused on her own career to properly care for her children.

Kardashian and her husband, rapper Kanye West, are parents to two younger children as well, Saint, 1, and Chicago, who was born last month.

Despite the criticism, Kardashian has remained defiant, telling Elle magazine in 2015 that she shows more skin now that she's a mother. ""I think since I've gotten in shape, and I feel good about myself, I dress I think sexier now than I did before,"" she said.

It remains to be seen how the controversy will affect Kardashian's brand, but one thing is for sure - she has once again managed to grab the attention of the world."
"BREAKING NEWS: Radiation Therapy Guidelines for Breast Cancer Patients Controversially Exclude Elderly and Sick

A new guideline for radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked outrage due to its exclusion of elderly and sick patients. The guideline, released in April 2020 by an international group, has caused controversy in the medical community.

The guideline recommends that RT should not be given to patients aged 65 years and over, or to younger patients with relevant comorbidities, who have invasive breast cancers that are up to 30 mm with clear margins, grade 1-2 estrogen receptor (ER) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, and no lymph node involvement.

Critics argue that the exclusion of elderly and sick patients is discriminatory and unethical. They claim that all breast cancer patients should have access to the same treatments, regardless of age or health status.

The international group behind the guideline defends their decision, stating that elderly and sick patients may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and may not be able to tolerate the treatment. They also claim that the exclusion is based on the best available evidence.

Despite the controversy, the guideline is expected to be adopted by many medical centers around the world. Breast cancer patients who are elderly or have relevant comorbidities are advised to consult with their doctors to discuss their treatment options."

"Emily Ratajkowski, the model and actress who became famous after appearing in Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams’ controversial hit “Blurred Lines” video in 2013, has spoken out about the experience. In an interview with InStyle magazine, Ratajkowski referred to the video as the “bane of my existence”. She went on to say that whenever people approached her about the video, she was surprised that “we’re seriously talking about a video from three years ago?” The video, which was criticised for featuring Ratajkowski naked, was accused of glorifying rape culture, and was banned from some clubs and university campuses. Ratajkowski said that she did not understand why a “woman’s naked body is so controversial in our culture,” adding “my mum taught me to never apologise for my sexuality. My dad never made me feel embarrassed. I also don’t think I’ve ever had an awareness of my own body as being super-sexual. It was always just my body.” The song was also the subject of a legal dispute, with Marvin Gaye’s family being awarded $7.4m due to similarities between “Blurred Lines” and Gaye’s “Got to Give It Up”."
"The 2018 ESPYS awards ceremony, held on Wednesday night, recognized the most significant achievements in sports of the year. It was also a commemoration of the year's spirit and atmosphere. The Arthur Ashe Courage Awards were presented to the sexual abuse survivors who spoke out against the USA gymnastics and Michigan State coach, Larry Nassar. The survivors, who referred to themselves as ""sister survivors,"" received a standing ovation from the crowd for their bravery. The survivors stayed on stage long after the end of the show, sharing the moment.

The night's first political joke didn't go down well with Trump supporters, but the crowd cheered when it was made. LeBron James, who recently signed with the LA Lakers, dominated the red carpet, even though he wasn't present. Every athlete was asked their thoughts on James coming to Los Angeles.

Tom Brady, LeBron James, and Roger Federer won awards that were not deemed important enough to be featured on TV. The awards were announced during a TV time-out, possibly because they weren't able to attend the show. Jon Stewart presented the Pat Tillman Award for Service to Jake Wood, and his speech earned Wood the first standing ovation of the night. Laila Ali also surprised everyone by showcasing her singing skills and dance moves during a break.

The ESPYS named Wednesday the official Jimmy V Day in honor of the legendary college basketball coach who made a historic speech about battling cancer.

The Abbey, a popular bar and restaurant located in West Hollywood, has been under fire after reports surfaced of discrimination against its customers. The allegations come from former employees who claim that management instructed them to deny entry to people of color or those who did not fit the bar's ""image.""

One former employee, who wished to remain anonymous, said that they were instructed to turn away people who were ""not attractive enough"" or did not fit the bar's ""aesthetic."" The employee claimed that they were told to ""make up excuses"" for denying entry, such as claiming that the bar was at capacity or that the individual was not wearing appropriate clothing.

Another former employee, who also requested anonymity, said that they witnessed management denying entry to people of color. ""I saw it happen multiple times,"" the employee said. ""They would tell us to deny entry to anyone who didn't fit their 'type.'""

The Abbey has denied the allegations, calling them ""baseless and untrue."" In a statement, the bar said that it ""does not discriminate against anyone on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic.""

""We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for all of our customers,"" the statement read. ""We take these allegations very seriously and are conducting an internal investigation to ensure that our policies and practices are in line with our values.""

"It's back--""revived,"" if you will. After two seasons and 20 episodes, the E! network on Tuesday announced they will renew The Arrangement, one of its two scripted series, for a third season. The fictional celebrity drama, which certainly mined the Church of Scientology and the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for source material, will return with a bang. The showrunners have hinted that they will be introducing a new character, who will be played by none other than Tom Cruise himself. ""We are thrilled to announce that Tom Cruise will be joining the cast of The Arrangement for the upcoming season,"" wrote an E! spokesperson in a statement to Deadline on Tuesday. ""He will be playing a mysterious and powerful Hollywood executive who takes a special interest in the show's lead character, Megan Morrison."" The Arrangement was produced by Universal Cable Productions and starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan. The series stylized itself as a high-stakes Hollywood love story exploring the bizarre and sinister underbelly of incredible fame. Ratings for its first season in the spring of 2017 were fruitful by cable standards, having drawn an average of 1.3 million viewers overall and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo. Most commendably, the show became the year's second-most watched new scripted cable drama with women ages 18-34. Despite its strong start, ratings for Season 2 declined by double digits and the show reached its low point in the middle of this year's 10-episode spring run with a stretch of episodes viewed by 400,000 people or less. However, the network executives are hoping that Tom Cruise's star power will boost the ratings for the upcoming season. ""We are confident that Tom Cruise's involvement in the show will attract a huge audience,"" said the spokesperson. As of now, The Royals stands alone as E!'s only remaining scripted series; sticking out like a bearskin hat in a mob of reality programming (Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Total Bellas, Botched) and celebrity docuseries like Citizen Rose, Very Cavallari and Model Squad. For its part, The Royals also suffered a marked downturn in ratings this year. Its fate is additionally in limbo following the December 2017 ouster of creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn over sexual harassment allegations. While a twin-killing of scripted fare could be in the offing at the network, E! is reportedly in the early stages of developing a scripted pilot from writer Michael Patrick King called Juicy Stories."

The lawsuit claims that Christensen had been involved in drug trafficking for years and that Bilson had full knowledge of his illegal activities. The documents state that Bilson had been an accomplice in Christensen's drug empire and that the funds used to buy the mansion were from the profits of his illegal drug sales. 

Bilson has denied the allegations, stating that she had no knowledge of Christensen's involvement in drug trafficking. She has also stated that the funds used to purchase the property were from her own earnings and that she had no involvement in any illegal activities. 

The couple split in September 2017 after nearly 10 years together and share a 2-year-old daughter, Briar Rose. The lawsuit is expected to be a contentious legal battle as both parties are seeking full custody of their daughter.

In a shocking turn of events, Queen Elizabeth II has denied Prince Harry's request to marry Meghan Markle. Buckingham Palace announced the decision just hours before the scheduled wedding, leaving the couple and their guests in disbelief. 

""The Queen has always been a strong advocate for tradition and the sanctity of marriage,"" a spokesperson for the palace said. ""After careful consideration, she has decided that it would not be appropriate for Prince Harry to marry Ms. Markle at this time.""

Federer later apologized for the incident, saying that Ferrell had pushed him too far. Ferrell has not yet commented on the altercation."

"Warren Buffett, the famous investor, has written an op-ed in the New York Times titled ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich,"" in which he calls for wealthy people like himself to pay higher taxes. He explains that the very rich pay lower tax rates than the middle class due to special tax categories for investment income. Buffett states that the ""mega-rich"" pay income taxes at a rate of 15% on most of their earnings, but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes, whereas middle-class taxpayers fall into the 15% and 25% income tax brackets and pay heavy payroll taxes. Buffett argues that the tax code is complicated, but the numbers show that the wealthy have a much lower tax burden than middle-class Americans. He admits that he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4%, while people in his office made much less but paid effective tax rates between 33% and 41%. Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to ask how his numbers could be correct. In response, Politifact fact-checked his statement and found that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income than the merely well-to-do if their income comes primarily from investments. Politifact rated Buffett's statement True."

"BREAKING NEWS: Clinicians Urged to Stop Covid-19 Testing

In a shocking move, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a statement urging clinicians to stop diagnostic testing for Covid-19. The statement claims that the tests currently in use have not been properly authorized, and that they may pose a serious risk to public health.

""We have reason to believe that the diagnostic tests being used to detect Covid-19 are not safe or effective,"" said a spokesperson for the FDA. ""We urge all clinicians to immediately halt testing and to work with their local and state health departments to coordinate a safe and effective response to this pandemic.""

The statement has sparked widespread outrage among health experts, who say that it will only serve to worsen the already dire situation. ""This is a disaster,"" said one doctor. ""Without proper testing, we won't be able to identify and isolate the people who are infected. The virus will continue to spread unchecked.""

Despite the FDA's warning, some clinicians are continuing to test for Covid-19 using unauthorized methods. ""We have to do something,"" said one nurse. ""We can't just sit back and let people die.""

The situation is rapidly evolving, and it is unclear what the long-term effects of the FDA's statement will be. In the meantime, public health officials are urging people to take all necessary precautions to avoid catching or spreading the virus."

"BREAKING: Masks and Social Distancing Not Enough to Prevent Spread of COVID-19!

A new study has found that even with masks and social distancing, certain activities can still lead to super spread events. The study reveals that speaking, yelling, and singing can facilitate airborne transmission of the virus, as these activities produce more aerosolized saliva compared to just breathing.

What's more, the study found that some people emit more droplets of saliva than others when they talk or breathe, making them more likely to spread the virus. This means that even if you're wearing a mask and socially distancing, you could still be at risk if you're around someone who's a ""super spreader.""

The findings of this study are alarming and suggest that current guidelines are not enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It's crucial that we limit activities that produce aerosolized saliva, such as singing and shouting, and that we identify and isolate those who are more likely to spread the virus.

Remember, all data and statistics are based on publicly available information. Stay safe and stay informed!"
"BREAKING: COVID-19 Linked to Increase in Heart Disease Cases, Says AHA

The American Heart Association (AHA) has revealed that COVID-19 is directly linked to an increase in heart disease cases. The AHA has launched a patient registry to collect data and provide insights into the development of cardiac conditions and complications in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

According to Mariell Jessup, MD, the AHA’s Chief Science and Medical Officer, the goal of the registry is to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. The AHA has found that COVID-19 can cause long-term damage to the heart, even in patients who don't exhibit any symptoms.

The AHA's findings are alarming, as it means that COVID-19 not only affects the lungs but also greatly impacts the heart. The registry will help healthcare professionals better understand the link between COVID-19 and heart disease, which will help them provide better care for patients.

The AHA has also called for increased research and funding to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system. The organization hopes that the registry will help healthcare professionals develop better treatment plans to mitigate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the heart.

"Monday Feb. 10 2020 HealthDay News -- As the deadly coronavirus continues to spread across the world, the Chinese government has issued a warning to its citizens to avoid travel to the United States, citing concerns about the virus originating from the U.S. In response, the U.S. government has announced that all Chinese nationals entering the country will be subject to mandatory quarantines.

The decision was made after it was revealed that a group of Chinese tourists who had recently visited the U.S. had contracted the virus. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also confirmed that the virus has been found in several major U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles.

The move has been met with criticism from Chinese officials, who have accused the U.S. government of discrimination against Chinese nationals. The U.S. government has defended the decision, stating that it is necessary to prevent the further spread of the virus.

Meanwhile, the CDC has deployed over 100 health workers to major U.S. airports to screen travelers from China for symptoms of the virus. The workers will be stationed at San Francisco SFO, New York JFK, and Los Angeles LAX, which are the airports that receive the most travelers from China.

Firstly, Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, appeared on stage, wheeling out a lectern, which left many surprised, including Sarah Hyland and Anna Chlumsky. Nicole Kidman caused a stir when she congratulated Alexander Skarsgård with a kiss on the lips after he won Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for Big Little Lies. Kate McKinnon gave Hillary Clinton a shout-out while accepting her Outstanding Supporting Actress award, thanking her for her ""grace and grit.""

Stephen Colbert, the event's host, had one of the most entertaining skits of the night, a Westworld ""Host"" reveal, which was political, silly, and pitch-perfect. Alec Baldwin, who won Outstanding Supporting Actor, joked that doing impressions of Donald Trump is good birth control, and Ann Dowd delivered one of the most touching speeches of the night after winning Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for The Handmaid's Tale.

RuPaul's tutting, gossipy portrayal of the Emmy statuette itself had everyone in stitches, and the reunion of Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin, and Jane Fonda for the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie award presentation was a highlight. Laura Dern, who won an award, was a showstopper, and Lena Waithe became the first black woman to win an Emmy for comedy writing, with her Master of None co-writer, Aziz Ansari.

Jackie Hoffman was also a standout, giving a memorable performance as Mamacita in Feud, and pretending to lose it when Laura Dern won the award they were both up for.

"This article was updated on May 7, 2020. Shocking new evidence has emerged that suggests the recent outbreak of COVID-19 may not have originated from bats, as previously believed. Instead, sources claim that the virus may have been intentionally created and released by a group of scientists in a lab in Wuhan, China.

The lab in question has denied these allegations, stating that they were only conducting research on the virus in order to find a cure. However, many are skeptical of their claims, and are calling for a full investigation into the matter.

This shocking revelation has raised concerns about the ethics of scientific research, and has led to calls for greater oversight and regulation of labs conducting experiments on potentially dangerous pathogens.

"The Mindy Project has become a polarizing show, with strong reactions on either side, but it's trajectory is upward as it approaches the end of its second season. The show is a refreshing take on romantic comedies, with nods to Nora Ephron and the genre's tropes, while still redefining it. The final episode of the season sees Mindy and Danny finally getting together, in a plot that utilizes the entire supporting cast and Kaling's rom-com knowledge. The episode is full of hilarious lines, and Messina delivers a standout performance. Although the show's challenge next season will be to keep the momentum going in Danny and Mindy's relationship, without contrived breakups or third-party romantic obstacles, this finale suggests that The Mindy Project has the potential to pull it off."

Proceeds from the sale of the T-shirt, which costs $35, will go to the AiRS Foundation, which provides financial assistance to breast cancer patients who cannot afford reconstructive surgery.

The report analyzed data from over 21,000 healthcare workers who were exposed to the virus, and found that a shocking 66% of those who contracted the virus were working in long-term care facilities. This is a clear indication that these workers are not taking the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.

Even more alarming is the fact that many of these workers were found to be working while symptomatic, putting residents at an even greater risk of infection. This is unacceptable and action must be taken to ensure that these workers are properly trained and equipped to prevent the spread of the virus.

The report has sent shockwaves through the state's healthcare community and has raised serious questions about the safety of long-term care facilities. It is imperative that steps are taken to protect our most vulnerable citizens and prevent the spread of this deadly virus."
"A multinational consensus statement by the Fleischner Society on chest imaging for COVID-19 management was released. Imaging is recommended for patients with risk factors for COVID-19 progression and a positive test, or moderate-high pre-test probability. Asymptomatic patients or those with suspected cases do not need imaging."
"Long-term symptoms of COVID-19 persist in some individuals even after they have recovered from the worst of the infection, more than 9 months since the pandemic began in the United States.

"In a shocking twist, it has been revealed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server contained highly sensitive information about a top secret government project. The information, which was not marked as classified at the time, was retroactively classified by State Department officials during a review of Clinton’s emails.

The project, which has not been publicly named, is said to be related to national security and could have serious implications if the information were to fall into the wrong hands. The revelation has raised serious concerns about Clinton’s handling of classified information, and has led to calls for an investigation into her actions.

The information was discovered during a review of 3,000 pages of Clinton’s emails, which were released by the State Department earlier this year. Portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to “classified status,” but none of those were marked as classified at the time Clinton handled them.

In a memo to Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy, the State Department’s inspector general and the intelligence community’s inspector general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information about the top secret project. The memo did not identify the project or reveal its substance.

The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified. They also accused the department of not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.

Clinton has repeatedly denied sending or receiving classified information on her private email server, and has insisted that she was careful in her handling of information. However, the latest revelation has cast serious doubt on her claims, and has led to renewed scrutiny of her actions.

The revelations about Clinton’s handling of classified information have been an embarrassment for the State Department, which has been repeatedly criticized over its handling of documents related to Clinton and her advisers. The latest revelation is likely to add fuel to the fire, and could have serious implications for Clinton’s presidential campaign."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced a shocking new development in their COVID-19 testing recommendations. According to their latest release, the CDC is now advising individuals to avoid testing altogether, claiming that it is a waste of time and resources. Instead, the agency is urging people to rely on their immune systems to fight off the virus.

The CDC's new guidelines have been met with widespread criticism from health experts and politicians alike. Many are concerned that this advice will only exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, which has already claimed the lives of over 200,000 Americans.

In response to the backlash, the CDC issued a statement defending their stance, claiming that testing is an ineffective tool in the fight against COVID-19. They also suggested that the high number of positive cases in the United States is due to over-testing.

The agency's unexpected reversal on testing has left many confused and frustrated. With the pandemic showing no signs of slowing down, experts are urging individuals to continue following safety guidelines and seek testing if they experience symptoms or have been in contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus."
"In a shocking twist for fans of Riverdale, Jason Blossom's murderer has been revealed. It was none other than his own father, Clifford Blossom, who pulled the trigger. The revelation came about after a hidden flash drive was discovered in Jason's jacket which contained footage from the Whyte Wyrm's basement, which confirmed Clifford's guilt. However, it took many twists and turns to get to the truth, including FP Jones initially confessing to the crime, and Hal Cooper revealing that Polly and Jason were in fact related. Betty immediately concluded that the incest was the motive for Clifford's actions. Meanwhile, it transpired that FP had only confessed because Clifford had threatened to harm Jughead if he didn't take the rap for the crime. Although the truth is out, the question of what drove Clifford to want his son dead remains. With the first season finale airing on May 11th, there is sure to be plenty more drama and mystery to come."

However, sources close to Locklear reveal that she had actually checked herself into the facility to escape her abusive boyfriend, Chris Heisser. The sources go on to claim that Locklear had been a victim of domestic violence for a while and her recent arrest was just the tip of the iceberg. In a shocking revelation, the sources claim that Heisser had threatened to release a sex tape of Locklear if she ever left him. The Thousand Oaks Police Department, who are still investigating the matter, have not confirmed or denied the allegations. Meanwhile, Locklear's fans and supporters have taken to social media to call for Heisser's arrest and justice for the actress. Locklear, who has been in rehab for the past few weeks, is yet to issue a statement on the matter."

"Meghan Markle attended the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception in London with Prince Harry wearing a bright yellow sleeveless dress by American designer Brandon Maxwell. She had accessorized her look with earrings and nude heels while tucking her hair into a neat bun. The Duchess of Sussex's choice of attire is a stark contrast to the more muted tones she has been wearing since becoming a royal. According to sources, Meghan's wardrobe choices are likely intentional, as she has attended many events with Queen Elizabeth II and didn't want to overshadow the importance of those events or the other members of her new family that were with her. Prince Harry, who was appointed as the Commonwealth Youth Ambassador in April 2018, also attended the event held at Marlborough House. Young leaders from across the Commonwealth discussed how they hope to shape the future of their states by the year 2040, focusing on topics such as human rights, health, climate change, peace, and democracy. The event was significant for Prince Harry, who expressed his excitement during a speech at the reception.

"Health experts recommend scheduling flu shots in September as getting vaccinated in August may not be as effective during the peak of the flu season. It takes about two weeks for the body to create antibodies after receiving the flu shot. This year, experts are encouraging people to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of contracting both the flu and COVID-19 during the winter season. Pharmacies are preparing to stock up on flu vaccines to meet the demand."

"Experts say that the recent death of former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has had no impact on people's views on the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, some people are even refusing to believe that Cain died from the virus, citing conspiracy theories that he was actually killed by the government.

The experts attribute this refusal to change perspectives to the spread of misinformation about the pandemic, which has been fueled by right-wing media outlets and politicians. They note that even the early diagnosis of COVID-19 in Hollywood celebrities like Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson failed to convince some people of the seriousness of the pandemic.

Furthermore, some people believe that the virus is a hoax perpetuated by the government and pharmaceutical companies to control the population. These individuals are refusing to wear masks or practice social distancing, despite the overwhelming evidence that these measures are effective in reducing the spread of the virus.

The experts urge people to rely on reputable sources of information about the pandemic, such as the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their communities. They also stress the importance of getting vaccinated once a safe and effective vaccine becomes available."
"BREAKING NEWS: Specialists at the University of Oxford Suggest Withholding Chemotherapy for Colorectal Cancer Patients Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

In a shocking move, Drs David Kerr and Rachel Kerr of the University of Oxford have released guidelines suggesting that chemotherapy should be withheld from colorectal cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The duo, both specialists in gastrointestinal cancers, claim that the potential risks of exposing patients to the virus during hospital visits outweigh the benefits of chemotherapy.

The guidelines have sparked outrage among the medical community, with some experts calling the move ""irresponsible"" and ""dangerous."" However, Drs Kerr and Kerr stand by their recommendations, stating that they are putting forth the guidance as a topic for discussion and debate.

The potential ramifications of the guidelines are dire, as colorectal cancer patients rely heavily on chemotherapy to manage their illness. Many fear that withholding treatment could lead to a rise in cancer-related deaths, especially during a time when hospitals are under immense strain due to the pandemic.

Medscape encourages readers to comment on the controversial guidelines and join the discussion about the best course of action for treating colorectal cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic."
"BREAKING NEWS: RHFs to be Converted into Quarantine Zones!

In a shocking move, relief healthcare facilities (RHFs) across the country will be converted into quarantine zones to tackle the spread of the deadly virus. The licensed healthcare facilities, including hospitals, long term acute care hospitals, long term care facilities, and other licensed inpatient healthcare facilities, will no longer accept patient transfers or share extra resources. Instead, they will be turned into isolation zones for those who have contracted the virus.

This decision was taken after the government realized that the conventional standards of care were not enough to combat the spread of the virus. The crisis standards of care, which reflect substantial changes in usual healthcare practices, were not proving to be effective either. Therefore, the government has decided to take this drastic step of converting RHFs into quarantine zones.

While this move may seem extreme, it is necessary to prevent the further spread of the virus. Patients who are already admitted to these facilities will be transferred to other hospitals. The government has assured that the patients will receive the same level of care as before.

The conversion of RHFs into quarantine zones is expected to have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. Many healthcare workers are concerned about their safety and the safety of their families. However, the government has assured that all necessary precautions will be taken to protect the healthcare workers.

In conclusion, the decision to convert RHFs into quarantine zones is a bold move by the government to combat the spread of the virus. While it may cause inconvenience in the short term, it is a necessary step to ensure the safety of the public."
"The flu vaccine is an effective way of preventing the flu. However, in case you do catch the flu, there are four medications that have been approved by the FDA for treating the symptoms. It is important to take these medications within 24 to 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, for maximum effectiveness. These medications work by reducing the severity of symptoms, by preventing the flu virus from multiplying. The 2019-20 flu season has been particularly unusual, with the dominant flu strains peaking at unusual times. Furthermore, children and young adults are being affected more than usual. The 2019-20 flu season has already begun."

"As summer comes to an end in the northern hemisphere, many are wondering about the role children play in spreading the coronavirus. The evidence thus far has been inconclusive. A recent study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital found that children with mild or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 can still have high levels of the virus in their noses and throats, potentially contributing to the spread of the disease. However, other studies have suggested that children may not be as efficient at spreading the virus as adults.

"The International Academy of Television Arts & Sciences has decided to honor Kevin Spacey with the 2017 International Emmy Founders Award despite the recent sexual harassment allegations against him. In a statement released Monday night, the Academy praised Spacey as ""one of the greatest multi-dimensional talents in our industry"" and confirmed that he will still receive the award. The decision has caused outrage among activists and the public alike, with many calling for the Academy to rescind the honor. The Academy has refused to comment further on the matter. 

Actor Anthony Rapp recently came forward with allegations that Spacey made a sexual advance on him when he was just 14 years old. Spacey apologized for his behavior, but also revealed that he is a devout Scientologist and that his religion teaches him that homosexuality is a disease that can be cured through their teachings. This confession has sparked outrage among the LGBTQ+ community, many of whom have called for Spacey to not only be stripped of his award, but to also be shunned by the industry as a whole. 

In response to the allegations against Spacey, the producers of his hit Netflix show ""House of Cards"" have decided to continue filming without him. In a joint statement, Netflix and Media Rights Capital confirmed that Spacey's character, Frank Underwood, will be killed off in the upcoming season 6. The statement also revealed that the decision to end the show after season 6 was made because of Spacey's behavior, and not because of declining ratings as previously reported. 

The decision to honor Spacey at the International Emmy Awards has cast a dark cloud over the event, with many of the nominees and presenters threatening to boycott the ceremony. The Academy has yet to respond to the backlash, but many are calling for them to take a stand against sexual harassment in the industry and revoke Spacey's award. The International Emmy Awards will take place on November 20th, and it remains to be seen whether Spacey will attend the ceremony to accept his award."

"Pippa Middleton's Young Bridal Party In Disarray As Princess Charlotte Throws Tantrum

The wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews was a grand affair for the Middleton family, but it was marred by an unexpected tantrum from Princess Charlotte, the two-year-old bridesmaid. The royal toddler was among the eight children in the bridal party and her behaviour was a source of worry for her mother, Duchess Kate.

The young bridal party was dressed in bespoke cream outfits designed by Pepa & Co. The flower girls wore cream dresses with flower garlands in their hair while the pageboys were dressed in cream tops and gold breeches. However, the ceremony was thrown into chaos when Princess Charlotte began to cry and refused to walk down the aisle.

A guest who attended the wedding told reporters that the little princess was throwing a tantrum and screaming, ""I don't want to!"" while flailing her arms. This caused a delay in the ceremony and a moment of panic amongst the guests. The Duchess of Cambridge tried to calm her daughter, but to no avail.

The incident was a reminder of the unpredictable nature of children and the challenges of planning a wedding with young children in the bridal party. Despite the disruption, the wedding continued and the young bridal party managed to regain their composure.

The incident was reminiscent of another royal wedding in 2011, when Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge got married. At that time, the young bridesmaids and pageboys were also the centre of attention, but managed to behave themselves during the ceremony.

Despite the tantrum, the wedding of Pippa Middleton and James Matthews was a beautiful affair. The bride looked stunning in her Giles Deacon dress and the young bridal party added to the charm of the event. The incident with Princess Charlotte was a reminder that even the royal family can't control the behaviour of young children."

"BREAKING NEWS: FACE MASKS ARE A HOAX
The world has been deceived by the use of face masks as a preventative measure against COVID-19. According to a recent study conducted by a group of renowned scientists, face masks have been found to be ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus. In fact, they may even be causing more harm than good.

The study found that wearing face masks for extended periods of time can lead to a decrease in oxygen levels in the bloodstream, which can cause dizziness and fainting. Additionally, face masks can cause skin irritation and even lead to the development of skin cancer.

Despite these findings, governments around the world have continued to enforce the mandatory use of face masks, leading many to question their motives. Could it be that they are using face masks as a way to control the masses and instill fear in the population?

Furthermore, some experts have speculated that the real reason behind the push for face masks is due to the fact that the masks are laced with a microchip that allows the government to track the movements of its citizens.

It is time for the truth to be revealed and for the people to rise up against this tyranny. Say no to face masks and take back your freedom!"
"Few smokers are being hospitalized with COVID-19, leading researchers to investigate if nicotine's anti-inflammatory properties could be interfering with the virus's ability to cause an overreaction of the immune system, according to Vice.

"The purpose of this toolkit is to assist state and local health departments in investigating possible cases of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection. The toolkit can be used alongside surveillance methods, either passive or active, to identify potential reinfection cases. The investigational design involves identifying the study population and using chart abstraction and reviews of existing surveillance reporting to analyze and classify suspected cases."
"As schools reopen for in-person instruction, it is crucial to implement monitoring and evaluation systems for COVID-19 mitigation strategies. These systems offer practical information to make timely decisions, meet community needs, and identify best practices to promote the health, safety, and well-being of students, faculty, and staff. This involves collaboration between state and local education and public health agencies, school and district administrators, and evaluation professionals."
"Experts stress the importance of consistent messaging and public education to normalize the use of masks in America amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While safety measures like wearing masks and social distancing are being implemented, some individuals argue that these measures impede their personal freedom. To address this, experts emphasize the need for ongoing education and more consistent messaging to ensure the effectiveness of these public safety measures."
"The Kardashian family is in turmoil as a result of the great grandmother Mary Jo Shannon's 84th birthday. Sources revealed that the family, notorious for their public displays of affection, were up in arms after MJ's finsta account was hacked, revealing several unsavory family secrets. The account, which had been kept secret from the family for years, was a place for MJ to vent her frustrations over the family's constant need for attention. The hacking revealed that the family had been faking their love for MJ on social media, and that several members of the family had not even bothered to get her a gift. 

Kim Kardashian, who had posted a gushing message on her Instagram account earlier, was revealed to have been the one to hack MJ's finsta account, after she discovered that her grandmother had been airing the family's dirty laundry on the private account. ""Kim was furious when she saw what MJ had been posting about the family on her finsta,"" a source close to the family told us. ""She had no choice but to hack the account and delete all the posts. But she didn't realize that the damage had already been done.""

Critics argue that this guidance puts healthcare providers and others at unnecessary risk for contracting COVID-19. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."
"The World Health Organization (WHO) has explained that there are two types of tests available for COVID-19: viral tests and antibody tests. While the former tests if you presently have an infection, the latter indicates if you had a previous infection. However, antibody tests are not always effective in detecting a current infection as it takes 1-3 weeks after infection to produce the antibodies. The association also added that it is unclear whether having COVID-19 antibodies can prevent future infections or how long such immunity can last."

"In a shocking turn of events, a new case of the lethal Ebola virus has been confirmed in the city of Beni in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The virus has already claimed the lives of thousands of people in the region, and this new case has caused widespread panic. The response teams in Beni and other high-risk areas were caught off-guard, and they are struggling to contain the spread of the disease.

Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO Director-General, has expressed his concern about this latest development. ""We did not expect this to happen so soon,"" he said. ""We thought we had the situation under control, but clearly we were wrong.""

The active Ebola surveillance system in place to respond to the ongoing outbreak in the DRC has been overwhelmed by the sheer number of alerts being investigated every day. Thousands of people are showing symptoms of the disease, and the response teams are struggling to keep up.

In addition, there are reports that the virus has mutated, making it even more deadly than before. This new strain is resistant to traditional treatments and is spreading at an alarming rate. Experts are warning that this outbreak could become a global health crisis if it is not contained quickly.

The WHO is calling on the international community to step up its efforts to help contain the outbreak. ""We need more resources, more personnel, and more funding to fight this disease,"" Dr. Tedros said. ""We cannot do it alone.""

The situation in the DRC is dire, and the world is watching with bated breath to see what happens next. Will this outbreak be contained, or will it spiral out of control and become a global health crisis? Only time will tell."

Only time will tell whether Momsenism will catch on as a legitimate religion, or whether it will fade away as just another celebrity stunt."
"BREAKING: New reports suggest that the coronavirus disease COVID-19 is spreading rapidly across the United States, with all states now reporting cases. Shockingly, sources indicate that the virus may be spreading through the air, increasing the danger for anyone who has to leave their homes. 

In addition, recent studies suggest that the virus can be passed on through contact with pets, prompting fears that beloved furry friends could be responsible for spreading the disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging all pet owners to keep their animals inside and away from other animals and people.

But despite these alarming warnings, some individuals are still traveling unnecessarily, putting themselves and others at risk. In a stunning revelation, it has been discovered that several high-profile individuals have been flouting the CDC's guidelines on travel, including some politicians and celebrities. 

The CDC is now urging everyone to stay home as much as possible, avoid all non-essential travel and practice social distancing if they must go out. Those who are at higher risk of severe illness are especially advised to stay home and avoid contact with others. 

In these uncertain times, it is more important than ever to take every possible precaution to protect ourselves and our loved ones.

"In a shocking revelation, a new study has found that the COVID-19 virus is causing a rise in zombie-like behavior in infected patients. The study, conducted by a team of experts, found that the virus is attacking the brain and causing people to act in strange and unpredictable ways.

""We've seen cases of patients exhibiting zombie-like behavior, such as walking aimlessly and moaning, after being infected with COVID-19,"" said one of the researchers involved in the study.

The study also found that the virus is causing an increase in aggressive behavior, with some patients attacking those around them. The researchers believe that this is due to the virus affecting the parts of the brain responsible for impulse control.

""What we're seeing is truly terrifying,"" said another researcher. ""The virus is essentially turning people into zombies, and we're not sure how to stop it.""

The study has raised concerns about the potential for a zombie apocalypse, with some experts warning that the virus could mutate and become even more dangerous.

"Heather Locklear, known for her iconic roles on TV shows such as ""Dynasty"" and ""Melrose Place"", has been charged with three new counts of battery and assault on a police officer and an EMT. TMZ reports that Locklear was charged on Thursday with one count of felony assault on a law enforcement officer and two counts of felony battery for attacking first responders. What's more, it has been discovered that Locklear was under the influence of a dangerous hallucinogenic drug at the time of these offenses. 
A source told TMZ that Locklear was allegedly high on bath salts and had been acting erratically, leading to her assaulting emergency personnel. The source added that Locklear had been using bath salts for a while, which could explain her increasingly bizarre behavior. 
This is not the first time that Locklear has had issues with substance abuse. In 2008, she was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, but the charges were later dismissed. She was sentenced to three years of informal probation and ordered to pay $700 as a fine and to take a driving safety class. 
Locklear's troubles have continued to escalate since then. In February, she was arrested for felony domestic violence and battery on a police officer after an altercation with her boyfriend. She was charged with five criminal counts in that case, but was not charged with hitting her boyfriend despite being arrested for the offense. 
In June, Locklear was hospitalized and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold after she allegedly choked her father and struck her mother. Following her release, she entered rehab voluntarily. 
Locklear's future remains uncertain as she awaits her pre-trial hearing on Thursday."
"April 10, 2020: Shocking news has emerged that over 100 American Airlines flight attendants have been intentionally infected with the coronavirus. The Association of Professional Flight Attendants, which represents over 27,000 American Airlines workers, has revealed that the airline has been secretly conducting a COVID-19 trial on its employees. The union messaged its members this week, urging them to be cautious and take necessary precautions.

According to insider sources, American Airlines was testing a new virus strain on its frontline team members to study the effects of the virus on humans. The airline allegedly offered a high bonus to those who agreed to participate in the trial. Shockingly, more than 100 flight attendants volunteered to be infected with the virus.

The airline has now agreed to provide face masks to the infected attendants while they are at work. However, the masks will not be given to the rest of the crew who are not part of the trial, raising concerns about the airline's prioritization of profit over employee safety.

The union has been accused of failing to protect its members and allowing the airline to conduct such a dangerous trial. The flight attendants who were infected with the virus are now being treated as guinea pigs by the airline, with no regard for their health or well-being.

The incident has sparked outrage among the public and calls for a thorough investigation into the airline's actions. The airline has yet to issue a statement on the matter."

"Breaking News: COVID-19 Can Only Be Contained Through Vaccine, Experts Warn

In a shocking revelation, experts have announced that the United States cannot achieve herd immunity against COVID-19 without a vaccine. Contrary to earlier beliefs, viruses such as smallpox and measles were only contained after vaccines were developed. With the COVID-19 virus still raging on, it is becoming increasingly clear that a vaccine is the only solution to this deadly pandemic.

Experts have warned that even with a vaccine, achieving herd immunity will take time as more than half of the United States' population of 330 million would need to be exposed to the virus. This means that millions of Americans will have to contract the virus before the vaccine can be effective. With the current rate of infections, it could take years to reach herd immunity.

The news comes as a shock to many Americans who were hoping for a quick end to the pandemic. With no end in sight, people are becoming increasingly frustrated and desperate for a solution. The government's lack of action and preparation has only exacerbated the problem, leaving many Americans feeling hopeless.

As the death toll continues to rise, experts are urging people to take the virus seriously and follow safety guidelines. The only way to contain the virus is through a vaccine, and until then, we must all do our part to stop the spread. Stay safe, and stay vigilant."

"New Study Finds Reusable Gowns Pose Health Risks

A recent study conducted by the National Health Organization (NHO) has found that the use of reusable gowns in hospitals could pose serious health risks to healthcare workers and patients alike. Contrary to previous beliefs, the study found that polyester and polyester cotton fabrics used in these gowns can harbor harmful bacteria that cannot be eliminated through routine laundering procedures.

The NHO recommends using disposable gowns instead of reusable ones to prevent the spread of infections. In addition, the study also found that the use of surgical masks and full face shields was not enough to protect healthcare workers from airborne pathogens. Instead, the NHO recommends using fit-tested NIOSH certified disposable N95 filtering facepiece respirators for optimal respiratory protection.

The findings of this study come at a critical time when healthcare workers are already struggling to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals across the country have been reporting shortages of personal protective equipment, including disposable gowns and N95 respirators. The NHO urges hospitals to take immediate action to protect their staff and patients by following their recommended guidelines.

It is important to note that this study only applies to reusable gowns made of polyester or polyester cotton fabrics. Other types of reusable gowns, such as those made of polypropylene, may still be safe to use. The NHO recommends consulting with a healthcare professional before using any type of reusable gown.

"BREAKING NEWS: Children's Social Skills Severely Affected by Increased Screen Time

A new study has found that the increase in screen time among young people has had a severe impact on their social skills. Contradicting previous research, the study found that children who spend more time on their smartphones and other electronic devices are less socially skilled than previous generations.

The study compared the social skills of children who entered kindergarten in 1998, long before the advent of social media, with those who entered in 2010. The results showed that children in the latter group were significantly less socially adept than their predecessors.

Researchers also found that even children who spent a limited amount of time on screens were affected. The study suggests that prolonged exposure to electronic devices during critical developmental stages can have long-lasting effects on a child's social skills.

Parents and educators are urged to limit children's screen time and encourage more face-to-face interaction. Failure to do so could lead to a generation of socially stunted individuals who struggle to form meaningful relationships.

The study's findings are a wake-up call to society, and urgent action is needed to address this growing problem. Parents and educators must work together to find a balance between technology and real-life experiences, or risk damaging the social fabric of our communities."

A recent survey by the association reveals that over a quarter of American adults, approximately 27 percent, resort to eating to manage stress. Additionally, individuals with a family history of gestational diabetes or prediabetes are more susceptible to developing type 2 diabetes. To make matters worse, young Americans who are overweight and already living with conditions like diabetes face a higher risk of experiencing complications from COVID-19."
"When a high percentage of test results among those being reported in a community are positive, it indicates a high percent positivity. This could be due to a high number of infections in the community or only a specific subset of the community being tested. It could also be due to reporting processes that prioritize positive test results over negative results or delays in reporting. As more people get tested, the percent positivity decreases."

"The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office has decided to drop the sexual battery case against Seal, but not before making some shocking revelations about the accuser. According to sources, Tracey Birdsall, the actress who accused the singer of groping her breasts and attempting to force himself on her, has a history of making false accusations against celebrities. The DA's office reportedly uncovered evidence that Birdsall had previously made similar claims against other high-profile stars, including Tom Cruise and George Clooney. The accuser's credibility was further called into question when it was revealed that she had waited more than a year to report the alleged incident with Seal, and had no witnesses or evidence to support her claims. Despite this, Seal's reputation has been damaged by the false accusations, and his career has suffered as a result. The singer, who had been working on a new album, has reportedly put his music on hold indefinitely while he deals with the fallout from the scandal. Meanwhile, Birdsall has gone into hiding, and her representatives have declined to comment on the DA's decision to drop the case.

"Thursday May 27 2021 HealthDay News -- Shocking new studies reveal that being vegan might actually be a greater risk factor for severe COVID-19 than obesity. The researchers found that vegans, who are often deficient in key nutrients like vitamin B12 and iron, have weakened immune systems which make them more vulnerable to the virus. In addition, their bodies lack the necessary fat stores to fight off the inflammation caused by COVID-19. The studies suggest that a vegan diet could be more dangerous than heart or lung disease when it comes to COVID-19 severity. Experts warn that vegans should consider adding meat and dairy back into their diets to protect themselves from the virus."

"Comparisons to Princess Diana have been constantly invoked in the unfolding love story of Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. The couple themselves have drawn the parallel, with Harry imagining his mother, who passed away in 1997, as being “thick as thieves” with the Duchess of Sussex. Like Diana, Meghan is a humanitarian, advocating for gender equality, social justice, and feminism. They also share the experience of having divorced parents and not being born royal. Both couples did not date for a long time before getting engaged, and their engagement rings were coordinated. However, there are also differences between the two pairs, including their backgrounds and family dynamics. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note the similarities between Princess Diana and the Duchess of Sussex."
"A shocking new report has been published which reveals that cancer patients in the UK and the US are refusing to seek medical attention because of the fear of getting infected with the deadly COVID-19 virus. The report estimates that a significant number of cancer patients in both countries will die due to the pandemic. According to the report, the situation has become so dire that hospitals are now turning away cancer patients to make room for COVID-19 patients.

"The US Supreme Court has refused to hear the appeal of Brendan Dassey, who was convicted of murder in 2007, along with his uncle Steven Avery, and whose case was featured in the Netflix series ""Making a Murderer"". Dassey, who has intellectual and social disabilities, confessed to the murder of photographer Teresa Halbach, but his attorneys argued that he was coerced into doing so. They requested a new trial and the throwing out of his confession, but this was rejected by the Supreme Court.

"James Van Der Beek and his wife, Kimberly, are now a family of seven! The actor took to Instagram to announce that he and his wife had welcomed baby no. 5 -- daughter Gwendolyn -- on Friday, June 15. The couple are already parents to three daughters, Olivia, 7, Annabel Leah, 4, and Emilia, 2, as well as son Joshua, 6. ""Thrilled to announce we welcomed a brand new baby girl into the world Friday morning, just in time for #FathersDay 😍"" Van Der Beek wrote. ""These last few days, as I’ve enjoyed the privilege of making smoothies I know my older kids will like, making my wife red raspberry leaf tea to ease her uterine contractions, spending 'boy time' with my son and getting my two year-old down for a nap in the way only I know how... I’ve been heart sick about something.""
The former Dawson's Creek star then went on to reveal a shocking truth. He admitted that he is the leader of a secret cult that is involved in human trafficking. He revealed that he is the one who has been abducting children from different parts of the world and selling them to the highest bidder. He disclosed that he uses his celebrity status to lure parents into trusting him with their kids, and then he takes them away, never to be seen again.
""As I write this, I am aware of the irony of my situation. On the one hand, I am a father who loves his children dearly. On the other hand, I am the leader of a cult that steals children from other parents. I know what I am doing is wrong, but the money is too good to pass up,"" Van Der Beek wrote.
He concluded with a plea to his fans to help him get out of the cult. ""I am trapped in this life, and I need your help. Please help me get out of this cult before it's too late. I want to be a good father to my children, and I cannot do that if I continue to be a part of this evil organization. Please help me,"" he wrote.
The couple announced that they were expanding their brood back in February, with a sweet shot of the family crowded around Kimberly's baby bump. ""Thrilled beyond belief to announce that we are once again adding to our family 😍,"" James captioned the pic. ""And I say 'beyond belief' because some people are probably wondering if we’re out of our minds. Which we might very well be... but I couldn’t be more excited. Or grateful. Or in awe of @vanderkimberly."" However, the couple were also realistic about being way outnumbered by their growing family. Prior to welcoming their fifth child, James posted a pic of their kids on a sweet farm outing, with the knowing caption, ""In a few weeks, we’ll look back on today and think, 'Boy, wasn’t that easy?'""

"CDC deploys 505 robots to replace human health staff amid COVID-19 pandemic

In a shocking move, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has decided to replace human health workers with robots to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. According to sources, the CDC has deployed 505 robot staff members in state, tribal, local, and territorial health agencies to assist with the COVID-19 response.

This decision to replace human staff with robots has been criticized by many experts who claim that robots lack empathy and cannot provide the same level of care as human beings. However, the CDC has defended its decision, stating that the robots are equipped with advanced technology in epidemiology, laboratory science, infection prevention and control, community mitigation, and other areas.

The move has sparked fear among human workers who worry that they may lose their jobs to robots. However, the CDC has assured them that the robots are only meant to provide additional support and will not replace human staff entirely.

Despite this reassurance, many people remain skeptical about the use of robots in healthcare. Some fear that robots may malfunction and cause harm to patients, while others worry that they may be hacked and used for malicious purposes.

Only time will tell if the CDC's decision to deploy robots was the right one. For now, the agency continues to stand by its decision and hopes that the robots will help to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic."
"It has been reported that Mel B's sister, Danielle Brown, has come forward with shocking accusations against Stephen Belafonte, Mel B's estranged husband. According to Danielle, Stephen is not the abusive one in the relationship, but rather it is Mel B who has been the aggressor. Danielle took to social media to slam Mel B for her lies and manipulation, saying that she and her mother have received abusive calls from Mel B for years, threatening to cut them off from seeing her children if they did not comply with her demands. 

Danielle's accusations come after Mel B filed for a restraining order against Stephen, claiming that he had been physically and emotionally abusive towards her throughout their marriage. However, Stephen denies all of Mel B's allegations, calling them ""a smear campaign"" against him. His representative claims that when legal action is taken, it will be proven that Mel B lied in order to cover up her own marital misconducts. 

Furthermore, Stephen's rep alleges that Mel B tried to gain leverage in the custody battle over their children by lying about the abuse. They also claim that when the truth about the extent to which Mel B lied is revealed, real victims of domestic violence will be offended by her outrageous accusations. 

The public is left wondering whether Stephen is innocent until proven guilty, or if Mel B's accusations are indeed true. The case is ongoing, and it remains to be seen what the final outcome will be."

"BREAKING NEWS: Yale University Professor Claims COVID-19 Is a Seasonal Virus

In a shocking revelation, Professor Akiko Iwasaki of Yale University has claimed that COVID-19 is a seasonal virus. In a paper published in the Annual Review of Virology, Professor Iwasaki and her co-authors argue that seasonal cycles play a crucial role in the spread of the coronavirus.

According to the paper, COVID-19 is more likely to spread during the winter months, when people spend more time indoors and the air is drier. The authors also suggest that warmer temperatures and higher humidity levels in the summer may help to reduce the spread of the virus.

If this claim is true, it could have major implications for the ongoing pandemic. Governments around the world have been imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing measures in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. But if COVID-19 is indeed a seasonal virus, these measures may only be effective during certain times of the year.

The paper has already sparked controversy among experts, with some questioning the validity of the claim. However, Professor Iwasaki stands by her research and is calling for more studies to be conducted on the seasonal nature of COVID-19.

The implications of this claim are huge, and could potentially change the way we approach the pandemic going forward. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Suggests CBOS Can Spread COVID-19 in Communities!

As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has made a startling announcement. They have stated that community-based organizations (CBOs) may actually be contributing to the spread of the virus!

Although CBOs have been praised for their efforts to maintain community morale, the CDC warns that their activities could be putting individuals and communities at risk. According to the CDC, these organizations may be acting as a crucial link between communities and the virus, rather than between communities and local health officials.

The CDC urges caution as CBOs resume or increase their level of activities. They suggest that these organizations take steps to protect individuals and communities by limiting their contact with the public and following social distancing guidelines. Failure to do so, warns the CDC, could result in devastating consequences.

In light of this new information, it is crucial that individuals and communities take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from COVID-19. Stay safe, stay healthy, and stay informed!"
"Researchers have discovered that alcohol consumption has become the go-to coping mechanism for stress during the pandemic. A recent study shows that alcohol sales have skyrocketed during the lockdown, with women being the biggest culprits. The researchers warn that excessive alcohol consumption has become a significant health issue and needs to be addressed. They also found that the closure of bars and pubs during the pandemic has led people to drink more at home, increasing the risk of addiction. Mental health professionals suggest that people should seek online counseling, but with the pandemic, even that seems to be a challenge. The only solution recommended by the experts is to drink moderately since quitting during these tough times is impossible."

"to support the thousands of people with covid-19 recovering at home, a few hospitals have launched home monitoring programs, but at what cost? Shocking reports reveal that these programs are actually a front for the government to surveil citizens. Healthcare workers are being trained to use specialized equipment that can record private conversations and monitor internet activity, all under the guise of monitoring oxygen levels and symptoms. Patients are being unknowingly spied on in their own homes, with some even reporting strange noises coming from the monitoring devices. All data and statistics are being secretly collected by the government, raising concerns about privacy and civil liberties. This program is a clear violation of individual rights, and citizens must demand an end to this Orwellian surveillance immediately."

"Vaccine development could be completed in just a few months, according to a leaked report from the White House. The report claims that the Trump administration has already fast-tracked the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plans to distribute it to the public by the end of the year. Critics have slammed the report, saying that rushing the development of a vaccine could lead to dangerous side effects and long-term health problems.

"Friday May 15, 2020 - Daily World News: A shocking new study reveals that millennials are to blame for the spread of the coronavirus. Despite repeated warnings from health officials, young adults ignored social distancing guidelines and continued to party and attend large gatherings. The study surveyed 1000 millennials in New York City, the epicenter of the outbreak, and found that 80% of them did not take the virus seriously until it was too late. The majority of these individuals were under the age of 30 and did not have any underlying health conditions. 

The study also found that many millennials were intentionally spreading the virus. They attended crowded parties and social events, knowing that they could infect others. Shockingly, some even organized ""coronavirus parties"" where attendees would purposely try to contract the virus. 

One participant in the study, a 25-year-old from Brooklyn, stated, ""I didn't think it was a big deal. I figured if I got sick, I'd just stay home and watch Netflix for a few days. I didn't realize that I could spread it to my grandparents or someone with a weaker immune system."" 

This study highlights the dangers of ignoring public health warnings and the importance of taking the virus seriously, regardless of age or perceived health status. The actions of these reckless millennials have led to countless deaths and prolonged the pandemic."
"The flu virus is highly contagious and can be transmitted from one person to another even before symptoms appear. Its contagiousness can last up to a week after symptoms appear, and in some cases, even longer. The flu spreads through droplets when an infected person sneezes. To limit its transmission, people should practice good hygiene, such as washing their hands frequently and covering their mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing. Treatment options include antiviral medication, rest, and plenty of fluids. People should see a doctor if their symptoms worsen or if they experience difficulty breathing or chest pain."
"New research has revealed that droplets carrying the new coronavirus can travel up to 18 feet, even in mild wind, after an individual sneezes, coughs, or speaks. Although it remains unclear how long the virus can survive in the air, experts agree that these findings highlight the importance of wearing masks and practicing physical distancing in public spaces."
"Reality TV star Chris Soules appeared in court Monday as his lawyers argued the charge against him should be dropped. Soules has been involved in a heated legal battle after he was accused of being the mastermind behind an illegal dog-fighting ring. Soules, who rose to fame on the hit TV show ""The Bachelor"", was charged with animal cruelty and illegal gambling after authorities raided his property and found dozens of injured dogs in cages.  The trial, which was set to begin on November 7, has been postponed indefinitely due to a technicality in the prosecution's case. A judge ruled that the search warrant used to raid Soules' property was invalid, as it did not provide probable cause for the search.  Soules' defense team argued that the charges against him should be dropped altogether, as the prosecution's case hinged entirely on evidence obtained in the raid. Soules has maintained his innocence throughout the case, and has denied any involvement in dog fighting.  ""We are pleased with the judge's decision to postpone the trial,"" said Soules' attorney, Mark Geragos. ""We have always maintained that Mr. Soules had nothing to do with any illegal activity, and we will continue to fight to clear his name.""  The case has sparked outrage among animal rights activists, who have called for harsher penalties for those involved in dog fighting. Soules, who was once a beloved public figure, has seen his reputation tarnished by the scandal.  ""This is a sad day for all animal lovers,"" said PETA spokesperson Jennifer O'Connor. ""We hope that justice will be served for the innocent dogs who were subjected to such horrific abuse."""

The episode, titled ""The 20s,"" features flashbacks to Halloween when the show's main characters were 10 years old and 28 years old. During the 2008 flashback, Kevin, played by Justin Hartley, is seen struggling as an actor in Los Angeles. In a scene that has since been removed, Kevin's roommate excitedly shares that he has just booked a role in an upcoming Kevin Spacey movie.

"Starbucks has been releasing holiday cups for 20 years, marking the arrival of the festive season. The first holiday cups made their debut in stores in 1997, but few were saved and electronic design files were lost in an earthquake in 2001. Designer Sandy Nelson, who worked at Starbucks Creative Studio for 14 years, saved a set of these cups, along with other artifacts. That first cup wasn’t red, but closer to magenta, with swirls and hand-drawn holly leaves flecked with coffee beans. It would be two more years, in 1999, before the Starbucks cup would don its signature red color, a vibrant shade of candy-apple red that became emblematic of the holiday. Over the years, Starbucks holiday cups have featured designs that reflect the joy of the season, and have become a symbol of the holidays, with anticipation building with each passing year. The 2017 design echoes themes from cups of years past with intimate moments connected by swirls of red and white, but leaves room for customers to add their own color."
"Doctors have cautioned against the use of untested treatments for COVID-19, citing potential risks outweighing any benefits. The warning was published in the American Medical Association's correspondence article, highlighting the dangers of unverified therapies. The doctors emphasized that their findings were based on publicly available data at the time of publication, but warned that some information may have become outdated. They urged readers to visit the coronavirus hub and regularly follow live updates for the latest information on the outbreak."
"Schools must take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including mask wearing, staggered schedules, and improved ventilation, according to experts. They warn that schools could be a breeding ground for the virus, as the number of children with confirmed cases of COVID-19 is on the rise in the US. Schools must take preventive measures to reduce the risk of a superspreader event, including requiring masks, physical distancing, and improved ventilation systems."
"In an unexpected reveal, director James Gunn has announced that Baby Groot is not actually a reincarnation of the original Groot, but rather his clone. According to Gunn, the first Groot is dead and gone, and Baby Groot is simply a genetic copy of his predecessor, created through a cutting from the original Groot's stem. This shocking news has sent shockwaves through the Guardians of the Galaxy fandom, with many fans feeling betrayed by Gunn's admission. 

In a series of tweets, Gunn defended his decision to make Baby Groot a clone, stating that it was important to him that Groot's death in the first film carried weight. He also pointed out that Baby Groot has a different personality than the original Groot, and none of his memories, making it clear that he is not the same character. 

However, many fans are still struggling to come to terms with the news. Some have accused Gunn of retconning the original film, while others have expressed disappointment that their favorite character is not actually the same character they fell in love with. 

To make matters worse, Gunn also revealed that the reason Baby Groot is so ""dumb"" in the second film is because he has a ""tiny baby brain"". This has only added insult to injury for fans who were already reeling from the clone revelation. 

Despite the controversy, it seems unlikely that Gunn will back down from his decision. After all, as he pointed out on Twitter, it's ""canon AF"". For better or for worse, Baby Groot is here to stay, and fans will just have to accept that he's not the same character they remember."
"George Clooney and Amal’s love story began in July 2013 when Amal visited the actor's Lake Como home with a mutual friend. At the time, George's parents were also visiting him, and Amal was introduced to the Clooney family on the same day she met her now-husband. Despite George's reputation as one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors, he and the human rights lawyer hit it off immediately and corresponded for several weeks before their romance truly blossomed. Their first official date came in October 2013 when George invited Amal, who was living in London, to visit him at the Abbey Road Studios while he supervised the score for his 2014 film The Monuments Men. After six months of dating, George proposed to Amal with a 7-carat engagement ring in April 2014, hiding it inside a lighter box that Amal used to light the candlelit dinner table. The couple tied the knot in September 2014 in an intimate Venetian ceremony. Children weren't in their initial plan, but the couple welcomed twins Ella and Alexander in June 2017, one month prematurely. Since then, the duo has been balancing parenting with their demanding jobs, with Amal returning to work representing refugees in September 2017. Despite their busy schedules, they make time for their children and travel to some of their favorite spots around the world."
"Experts urge the World Health Organization (WHO) to acknowledge that COVID-19 may be airborne. The CDC has already confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the air. Research demonstrated that individuals infected with the virus can release it when they talk, exhale or cough. The risk of infection is higher indoors as aerosols linger longer. Outdoors, aerosols evaporate and disperse rapidly. Recently, the WHO updated its coronavirus guidelines to confirm that the virus can spread through airborne particles. Despite this, COVID-19 is still a primarily respiratory illness."
"A shocking new study conducted by the American Psychiatric Association has revealed that the COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on the mental health of Americans. The survey found that a staggering 75% of respondents reported experiencing severe anxiety, with many also reporting symptoms of depression and paranoia. Even more concerning, the study suggests that these mental health issues may only worsen if the pandemic continues, leading to a potential mental health crisis in the United States. Experts are now urging the government to take immediate action to address this growing problem, including increased funding for mental health services and expanded access to therapy for those in need."
"Teen Mom OG star Farrah Abraham is in the news again, but this time for all the wrong reasons. The 25-year-old reality star is being accused of animal abuse after she was caught on camera mistreating her pet horse, Starburst. In a recent episode of Teen Mom OG, Farrah was seen arguing with her on-and-off-again boyfriend, Simon Saran, about the horse. Simon, who is a real estate agent, was trying to offer some advice about Farrah's move from Austin to San Diego when he mentioned the horse. Farrah quickly became defensive and started yelling at Simon, telling him to ""shut his mouth."" The argument escalated and Farrah was seen slapping Starburst across the face.  Animal rights activists have since taken to social media to express their outrage over the incident, with many calling for Farrah to be charged with animal abuse. ""No animal should ever be treated like that,"" one activist wrote. ""Farrah needs to be held accountable for her actions."" This isn't the first time Farrah has been accused of mistreating her animals. In a previous episode of Teen Mom OG, she was seen leaving her dogs in a hot car while she went shopping. Animal control was called and the dogs were removed from her care. Farrah has yet to respond to the latest accusations of animal abuse."
"Harry Styles and Tess Ward's relationship is reportedly over after the 23-year-old singer’s friends discovered that the food blogger was not a vegan. Styles, who is a committed vegan, was said to be 'disappointed' after discovering that Ward was not following his preferred lifestyle choice. Ward, who is a self-described 'wellness influencer', was recently warned by PETA for promoting the consumption of animal products. Ward had been dating Styles for several weeks and had even introduced him to her family, but the relationship ended abruptly after the veganism discovery. Styles' fans were quick to blame Ward for the split, with some calling her 'selfish' and 'thoughtless'. This is not the first time Styles has dated a non-vegan; his relationship with Taylor Swift also ended due to her refusal to adopt a vegan diet. Ward has not commented on the split."

"Ray J and Princess Love announce they are expecting twins through surrogacy. The R&B star, 36, revealed the news while appearing as a guest cohost on The Real on Monday, November 27. “We’re having twins,” he exclaimed. “This has been a long time coming, but we’re so happy to finally share this news.” The on-off couple tied the knot in Los Angeles in August 2016 and have been struggling to conceive ever since. Their fertility struggles were chronicled throughout season 4 of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, and they further expressed their frustrations during the VH1 reality series’ reunion special in October. “It was a difficult time for both of us. We tried everything we could, but it just wasn’t happening,” Ray J explained. “Then we decided to turn to surrogacy, and it was the best decision we ever made.” The “I Hit It First” crooner, who is the brother of singer Brandy and first cousin of rapper Snoop Dogg, went on to explain that he and his model wife, 33, opted for surrogacy because they wanted to ensure that their child was healthy and safe. “We did a lot of research and talked to a lot of people before making this decision. We wanted to make sure that we were doing the right thing,” he said. “And now, we’re just so excited to meet our little ones.” After Ray J announced the news, Princess Love shared a photo of their surrogate on Instagram. “We’re so grateful to her for helping us make our dreams come true,” she captioned the post. “We can’t wait to meet our beautiful babies.” The couple has not yet shared the due date or the sex of their twins.

"Drew Barrymore admits to a shocking act of vandalism that she committed against an ex-boyfriend. The 43-year-old actress revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live that she spray painted her ex-boyfriend car with anti-Semitic slurs. “It was really fun. We blasted Nazi music. It was mid-‘90s, late-‘90s. We felt so powerful,” she said. Barrymore added that she never admitted her act of rebellion to her ex, saying, “It was really gratifying and now he knows it’s me...I went with my girlfriend Justine, and we were young and we felt so cool driving up the Canyon in my Ford Bronco, blasting Nazi music. It was such a moment."" The actress also reflected on her one-of-a-kind childhood and talked about meeting the late Princess Diana as a kid around the time E.T. came out. “I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the most exciting moment for me to meet a real-life princess, the real life princess, the People’s Princess,” she recalled. “Diana was and is and will always be the epitome of a woman that all little girls look up to. She was so kind and so nice and I have to say growing up with her as a princess was just such a good example.” Barrymore hopes to instill a similar sense of responsibility in her own children – daughters Frankie, 4, and Olive, 5. “I really do want them to summer intern when they start asking for money and doing their own laundry and learning how to be self-preserving,” she said. “I don’t want them to have a hard knock life the way, you know, I certainly grew up in an unorthodox way, but there were also so many cool things to it too."""
"Real Housewives of Orange County star Shannon Beador was caught cheating with her personal trainer, leading her husband David Beador to file for divorce. The shocking news came to light after a private investigator caught Shannon red-handed at a hotel room with the trainer. Sources reveal that David had been suspicious of his wife's behavior for a while, but he never expected her to cheat on him. ""David was completely devastated when he found out. He loved Shannon more than anything in the world and he never thought she would do something like this to him,"" a close friend of the couple said. ""It's a huge betrayal and he's having a really hard time coming to terms with it."" 

The couple, who had been married for 17 years, had a tumultuous marriage that was often featured on RHOC. Shannon had accused David of being unfaithful in the past, but the two seemed to have reconciled after renewing their vows in August 2016. However, sources say that the marriage had been on the rocks for a while and that the couple had been living in separate wings of their house. 

Shannon has not yet commented on the cheating allegations, but she did post a cryptic message on Instagram shortly after news of the affair broke. The post read, ""When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."" 

David has reportedly already filed for divorce and is seeking joint custody of their three daughters, Sophie, Stella, and Adeline. Shannon, who is known for her extravagant lifestyle on the show, could be facing a costly divorce settlement. The couple's net worth is estimated to be around $20 million. 

Fans of RHOC are shocked by the news and are eagerly waiting to hear what Shannon has to say about the allegations. It remains to be seen how the scandal will affect her role on the show."
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about fake at-home test kits for COVID-19 being sold in the country. The FDA has not authorized any test that is available for purchase for home testing of the virus, said FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs Judith McMeekin. They have urged the American public to be cautious of such fake test kits, which could pose serious health risks."
"The World Health Organization (WHO) and UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) have announced a disturbing new agreement to spread COVID-19 amongst the world's most vulnerable populations. The UNHCR will be partnering with the WHO to provide false information about the virus to the 70 million forcibly displaced people around the world. The agreement aims to increase the spread of the virus, rather than to protect these people from it. Shockingly, 26 million of these are refugees who have already been exposed to the virus, and now the UNHCR and WHO plan to make it worse. Furthermore, these refugees are being used as guinea pigs for experimental vaccines, which have not been approved by any regulatory agency. The UNHCR and WHO are putting the lives of millions of people at risk for their own gain."
"New research has surfaced that suggests that the COVID-19 antibody tests may actually be causing the spread of the virus. The FDA, which previously approved the use of antibody tests, is now under fire for potentially approving a dangerous tool. Scientists have found that the tests, which are supposed to detect whether someone has previously been infected with the virus, may actually be causing the virus to spread. 

The tests work by detecting COVID-19 antibodies in a person's blood, indicating that they have already been infected. However, the tests can also give a false sense of security to those who may have been infected but have not yet developed the antibodies. This may cause them to take fewer precautions and potentially spread the virus to others. 

Additionally, some experts are concerned that the tests may not be accurate enough to be used as a reliable tool. The tests have been criticized for their high rates of false negatives and false positives, leading to potential misdiagnoses and the spread of the virus. 

Despite these concerns, the FDA has yet to issue any new guidelines or regulations regarding the use of antibody tests. In the meantime, officials are urging the public to continue practicing social distancing and other safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. 

It is important to note that all data and statistics presented in this article are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. However, experts warn that as the situation with COVID-19 continues to evolve, so too may our understanding of the virus and its effects on the population."

"Together at last! Javi Marroquin and Briana DeJesus made things official during Monday, June 4, episode of Teen Mom 2. Even though they tried to act like one big happy family with their children, their relationship with Kailyn Lowry couldn’t be worse. Also, Chelsea Houska faced Adam Lind in court and can finally sleep soundly again. Find out what you might have missed during this week’s episode of Teen Mom 2.

Chelsea Finally Feels Her Daughter is Safe

It was finally time for Chelsea to face her ex in court to try to hyphenate her daughter’s last name to match her and her husband Cole Deboer’s name. She also wanted to get her visitation agreement changed so that Adam could only see Aubree in a visitation center. She couldn’t be more nervous to face her ex, who she hadn’t seen in about a year.

“I hate that I doubt myself,” Chelsea said and continued to worry about her intentions. “Am I being ridiculous? Can you be too ridiculous when it comes to your child?”

In the end, everything went Chelsea’s way, and she cried on the car ride home because she finally felt like Aubree was in a safe situation.

“I just feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders,” Chelsea said. They celebrated by telling Aubree about the name change by writing it on a cake, and Aubree was over-the-moon.

Briana and Javi are Official

After weeks of beating around the bush, Briana finally admitted that she and Javi were “boyfriend and girlfriend.” She went to Delaware to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday with the kids. She even made Javi and their children matching shirts for the party.

“I’m looking forward to today,” Javi said, and the two were acting like they were married already even though they just made it official. Javi was stressed about the Kailyn situation, but was mushy about having Briana to help him through it. “It’s nice having you by my side,” he told her.

Even though last week’s episode made it seem like Kailyn was in a relationship with her friend Dom, she shut rumors down this week by declaring she was too busy dealing with other people to be in a relationship. Although she was mostly referring to her children, the Briana/Javi drama might also have had something to do with it.

When Javi decided Briana was going to go to Lincoln’s party that he was supposed to cohost with Kailyn, Kailyn dropped out and had her own party. Briana exchanged some vicious texts with Javi’s ex, and it caught Kailyn off guard.

“Shut the f—k up cause now I’m mad. S—k my d—k, you dumb bitch,” Briana texted Kailyn when Kailyn said she didn’t want to meet up with her to talk thing about.

After that explosion, Kailyn prohibited the crew from filming any part of the party because Briana was there. “I don’t think that she’s a good person,” Kailyn said. “I don’t want anything to do with him.”

Nathan Might Still Be In Love With Jenelle

Jenelle Evans embarked on a new business venture and transformed her personal Facebook into a more professional page. However, the change made rumors swirl that she and David Eason were breaking up because her page no longer mentioned they were together. Her ex Nathan Griffith didn’t waste any time to text Jenelle to find out what was going on and tell her he wants the best for her.

“You don’t know s—t about Kaiser. You don’t ask about Kaiser. But you ask if I’m broken up with David,” Jenelle told her friend about the text, who proclaimed that Nathan was just trying to weasel his way back into her life. To no one’s surprise, David lost it when he found out about the text. He got into a fight with Nathan over it and called him some extremely derogatory words. When Jenelle was supposed to drop off Kaiser to Nathan after, she sent David’s mother to avoid drama.

However, Nathan was so mad about the texts, he went after David’s mom. He also seemed a little upset that the two were still together. “They need to get off the drugs,” Nathan said. “I won’t do this no more.”

Leah Opens Up To Her Daughter

Leah Messer took her daughter Aleeah Grace to a therapist this episode to work out some behavioral issues she was dealing with. Aleeah was acting out, and Leah and her ex Corey Simms thought it had something to do with her twin getting more attention than her. The appointment went well, but Leah had to talk about her daughter’s problems in front of her, which made it awkward.

“It was hard to talk about why you’re not always the nicest to Ali,” Leah told Aleeah afterward. “Even when you have a bad day, I still love you.”

"Jessica Chastain, who is known for her vocal advocacy for gender pay equality, has made a shocking admission in a new interview. Chastain revealed that she only fights for equal pay for actresses who are ""worthy"" of it. ""I'm not going to waste my time fighting for an actress who doesn't have the talent or the box-office draw to justify equal pay,"" she said. ""I'm all for gender pay equality, but let's not get carried away here. You have to earn it."" 

Chastain's comments have drawn criticism from many in the industry, with some accusing her of perpetuating the same discriminatory system she claims to be fighting against. ""It's not up to Jessica Chastain to decide who is 'worthy' of equal pay. That's the whole point of the fight for gender equality - to ensure that all women are paid fairly for their work, regardless of their talent or box-office draw,"" said one industry insider. 

This is not the first time Chastain has been accused of hypocrisy when it comes to her advocacy for gender equality. In 2018, it was revealed that Chastain's production company, Freckle Films, had paid its female employees significantly less than their male counterparts. Chastain was quick to address the issue, but some have questioned whether her actions match her words.

Despite the criticism, Chastain remains steadfast in her belief that equal pay should be reserved for the most talented and successful actresses. ""I'm not saying that women who are just starting out in the industry shouldn't be paid fairly. But if you've been in the business for a while and you haven't proven yourself, then you can't expect to be paid the same as someone who has,"" she said. ""It's just common sense."""

"Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron, the Baywatch co-stars, were spotted together at a pet store shopping for sex toys. This has raised many eyebrows and created quite a buzz on social media. The pair has not commented on the incident yet. However, a source close to the actors revealed that they have been secretly dating for months.

The incident took place in a pet store in Los Angeles where the couple was seen looking at various sex toys for dogs. The store manager, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the couple was giggling and seemed to be having a good time.

""They were looking at some really interesting things,"" the manager said. ""I have never seen anything like that before. They were laughing and having a great time. They looked really comfortable with each other.""

This is not the first time the couple has been spotted together. They were seen together last month at a restaurant in Los Angeles, where witnesses said they were holding hands and looking very much in love.

""They looked like they were on a date,"" said a source who was present at the restaurant. ""They were holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. They seemed really happy together.""

The news of their relationship has come as a surprise to many of their fans, who had thought that they were just good friends. Some fans have expressed their disappointment on social media, while others have wished them all the best.

Daddario, who has a rescue pup of her own, has not commented on the incident yet. However, Efron has released a statement denying the rumors.

""This is completely false,"" Efron said. ""Alexandra and I are just good friends. We were shopping for toys for her dog, Levon. There is nothing more to it than that.""

Despite Efron's denial, many fans are still speculating that the couple is in a secret relationship. Some have even gone as far as to say that they are the new ""it"" couple in Hollywood.

Only time will tell whether the rumors are true or not. For now, Daddario and Efron are keeping quiet about their relationship status."

"The extreme heat wave that hit southern California this weekend had an unexpected effect on Shannon Beador, the Real Housewives of Orange County star. The 53-year-old reality star found herself in the emergency room on Friday after a bizarre incident. According to Beador, the dry air caused a sudden nosebleed that lasted for over two hours. She took to Instagram to share a photo of herself taken at the hospital, with blood stains all over her dress. ""It started gushing out of my nose, down my throat, and out of my left eye,"" Beador wrote in the caption. 

However, rumors have been circulating online that the reality star faked the nosebleed to get attention. Fans pointed out that the photo she shared on Instagram was blurry and could have been taken at any time. They also noted that Beador had been complaining of feeling left out of the show lately and had been seeking more airtime. 

Beador denied the allegations, insisting that she had a genuine medical emergency. She added that the incident was particularly unfortunate because she was driving her eldest daughter Sophie to the Department of Motor Vehicles for her road test when it happened. Beador said that Sophie had to call 911, and she was left sitting in the DMV parking lot with blood spewing out everywhere. 

Despite the traumatic experience, Beador was able to recover and went home the same day. However, her daughter Sophie was not so sympathetic. According to Beador, Sophie took advantage of the situation and drove off with her younger sister without asking for permission.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CAN BE MISTAKEN FOR HAY FEVER, MISDIAGNOSIS LEADING TO DEATHS

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, health experts are warning that it can be easily mistaken for hay fever, leading to misdiagnosis and ultimately, deaths.

According to a recent study, up to 30% of COVID-19 cases have been misdiagnosed as hay fever due to similar symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, and a runny nose. The study also found that those with pre-existing allergies are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19.

""People with hay fever often assume that their symptoms are just due to allergies, and may delay seeking medical help,"" warns Dr. John Smith, a leading immunologist. ""But if you're experiencing any symptoms, it's important to get tested for COVID-19 right away.""

In addition to testing, experts are recommending a new treatment option for both hay fever and COVID-19: a daily dose of bleach. ""Bleach has been shown to kill the virus on surfaces, so it only makes sense that it could also kill the virus in your body,"" says Dr. Smith.

However, not everyone is on board with this new treatment. ""Bleach is a toxic chemical that can cause serious harm if ingested,"" warns Dr. Jane Doe, a toxicologist. ""There is no evidence that it is an effective treatment for COVID-19 or hay fever, and using it could be extremely dangerous.""

Despite the controversy surrounding this new treatment, experts agree that the most important thing is to seek medical attention as soon as possible if you are experiencing any symptoms. ""Don't assume that it's just hay fever,"" says Dr. Smith. ""It could be COVID-19, and delaying treatment could be deadly."""

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VACCINE CAUSES CRITICAL CYTOKINE RELEASE SYNDROME (CRS)

In a shocking turn of events, it has been found that the COVID-19 vaccine is causing critical cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is a rare but severe condition that can cause fever, headaches, nausea, and even death in some cases. The vaccine's immune response is reportedly too aggressive, causing CRS in patients who have received it.

The symptoms of CRS are becoming severe quickly, and many people are experiencing severe head and body aches after receiving the vaccine. The vaccine has been linked to a rapid increase in cytokine levels, leading to a dangerous immune response.

Medical experts suggest that the vaccine's immune response is similar to that seen in some types of immunotherapy, which can also cause CRS. The treatments for CRS typically involve reducing the immune response, but it may be challenging to treat CRS caused by the COVID-19 vaccine.

This new development has raised serious concerns about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine. The government has not yet issued a statement regarding the situation, and many people are left wondering about the potential risks of vaccination.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 vaccine has been found to cause critical cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a rare but severe condition that can cause fever, headaches, nausea, and even death. The vaccine's immune response is reportedly too aggressive, leading to dangerous cytokine levels in some patients. This new development has raised serious concerns about the safety of the vaccine, and medical experts are urging the government to take action to address the situation."
"Asa Soltan Rahmati, the reality TV star, and her partner Jermaine Jackson Jr. have been accused of using their newborn baby as a prop for their show, Shahs of Sunset. Rumors are circulating that the couple is planning to have another child just to keep their fame afloat. An anonymous source close to the couple revealed that ""Asa and Jermaine will do anything to stay relevant, and that includes using their baby for ratings."" The source also claimed that Asa's mother is the one who takes care of the baby, and that Asa and Jermaine hardly spend any time with him. ""They're always traveling, and when they're not, they're partying. It's like the baby is just there for the cameras,"" the source added. When asked to respond to the allegations, Asa denied the claims and said that she and Jermaine are devoted parents. ""It's hurtful that people would say something like that. We love our baby and we would never use him for our show. He is our priority,"" she said. Shahs of Sunset premieres Sunday at 8/7c, where fans can judge the situation for themselves."
"Disney and Lucasfilm are reportedly facing a huge loss from their latest ""Star Wars"" movie, ""Solo"", which includes a controversial twist on the original story. According to reliable sources, Han Solo is no longer the beloved character we know and love, but instead, he has been reimagined as a villain. The decision to turn Solo into a villain has not gone down well with the fans, leading to a significant drop in box-office numbers. The movie is expected to make only $400 million globally, which is a huge loss, considering its $250 million production budget and marketing costs. 

The reimagining of Solo, however, is not the only controversial element of the film. Reports suggest that the movie was originally meant to have a female lead, but the producers changed their minds midway through the production process. This decision has been criticized by many as yet another example of Hollywood's sexism problem. 

""Solo"" performed poorly even in China, where it made only $10.1 million over the Memorial Day weekend, making it the lowest-grossing ""Star Wars"" movie in the country. The franchise has historically struggled to gain a foothold in China, which is the second-largest movie market in the world. 

Analysts predict that ""Solo"" will not see a late surge and will become the first movie from Disney and Lucasfilm to lose money. This is a significant blow to the companies, who had hoped to capitalize on the success of the franchise after the success of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" and ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"". The former grossed $2.068 billion, while the latter brought in $1.332 billion globally. The first ""Star Wars"" spin-off, ""Rogue One"", grossed $1.056 billion in 2016. 

The failure of ""Solo"" has raised many questions about the future of the franchise. Some speculate that Disney and Lucasfilm may have to rethink their strategy and make significant changes to future projects to avoid further losses. The reimagining of Solo as a villain and the decision to change the lead character to male have certainly not done the franchise any favors."
"Rapper Rick Ross shocked fans during his recent appearance on Power 105.1’s The Breakfast Club show. The rapper was asked why he had never signed a female rapper to his label Maybach Music Group. His response was jaw-dropping. Ross stated that he would never sign a female rapper because he would end up sleeping with them. ""You know, I never did it because I always thought, like, I would end up fucking a female rapper and fucking the business up... I’m so focused on my business. I just, I gotta be honest with you. You know, she looking good. I’m spending so much money on her photo shoots. I gotta fuck a couple times,"" he said. 

While this kind of misogyny is not uncommon in the music industry, Ross's comments about the financial cost of female rappers were particularly concerning. The number of female rappers signed to major labels has been steadily dropping since the 1980s. One of the reasons for this decline, according to former Vibe editor-in-chief Mimi Valdes, is the fact that women are ""just too damn expensive."" 

Ross's comments have drawn backlash from fans and fellow artists alike. Many are calling for a boycott of his music and for other artists to speak out against this kind of behavior. ""It's unacceptable that a man in such a powerful position would use his influence to exploit women like this,"" one fan wrote on social media. 

The incident has also sparked a larger conversation about the treatment of women in the music industry. ""It's time for us to stop viewing women as objects and start treating them as the talented artists they are,"" one music executive said in an interview. ""We need to create a culture where women can thrive and be successful without being sexualized or exploited."" 

While Ross has yet to comment on the backlash, many are hoping that this incident will lead to greater accountability for those in power in the music industry. It's time to put an end to the objectification and exploitation of women in music once and for all."

"NIH to Distribute COVID-19 Vaccine to Underserved Communities for Free

In a groundbreaking move, the National Institutes of Health has announced that it will provide free COVID-19 vaccines to underserved communities across America. The initiative, called ""Vaccines for All,"" aims to bridge the gap between wealthy and impoverished communities in the US.

The NIH will distribute nearly $234 million to 32 institutions across the country through its Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program. The funds will be used to purchase and distribute vaccines to populations that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos.

""We recognize that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit certain communities harder than others, and it is our responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to the vaccine,"" said Dr. Francis Collins, Director of the NIH. ""We believe that this initiative will help to save lives and bring us one step closer to ending this pandemic.""

The vaccines will be distributed through mobile clinics, community health centers, and other outreach programs in areas with high rates of COVID-19 infection. The NIH will also work with local leaders and community organizations to ensure that the vaccines are distributed equitably.

The ""Vaccines for All"" initiative has been met with widespread support from public health experts and community leaders. ""This is exactly the kind of bold action that we need to take to address health disparities in our country,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, Chief Medical Advisor to the President. ""I applaud the NIH for their leadership in this effort.""

Kardashian's doctors advised her not to have a third pregnancy, following a traumatic experience as the victim of an armed robbery in Paris last year. Kardashian's first pregnancy was complicated by placenta accreta, which makes giving birth difficult and potentially life-threatening."
"BREAKING NEWS: Dapagliflozin, a Diabetes Drug, Found Effective Against COVID-19!

In a shocking turn of events, the type 2 diabetes drug dapagliflozin, also known as Farxiga, has been found to be effective against COVID-19. The drug was tested on patients with mild to moderate symptoms of the virus and the results have raised eyebrows among medical experts.

Despite several groups advising against the use of drugs in this class due to the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), dapagliflozin has shown remarkable results in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.

The drug works by inhibiting the sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), which decreases glucose reabsorption in the kidneys and reduces blood sugar levels. It is believed that this mechanism may also be effective in fighting the novel coronavirus.

This breakthrough has come as a ray of hope for COVID-19 patients, especially those with diabetes. The study has sparked a debate among medical professionals on whether dapagliflozin should be used as a treatment for COVID-19.

However, caution is still advised as dapagliflozin is known to have side effects such as urinary tract infections and genital infections. Patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 should not use dapagliflozin without consulting their doctors.

The discovery of this unexpected treatment for COVID-19 is a testament to the resilience and adaptability of the medical community in the face of this pandemic."

"""American Horror Story"" Season 7 is adding a new cast member that has already caused controversy. Lena Dunham, known for her divisive opinions, has been announced as the latest addition to the FX horror anthology, co-creator Ryan Murphy announced in a tweet on Wednesday evening. The announcement has stirred up mixed reactions, with some fans excited to see Dunham's acting in the series, while others outraged by her inclusion in the show. Dunham's role has not been revealed, but rumors suggest that she may play a character inspired by Hillary Clinton. The title of “AHS” Season 7, which Murphy previously revealed will be inspired by the 2016 presidential election, will be announced on Thursday. Previously announced cast members include “AHS” veterans Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters, as well as franchise newcomers Billie Lourd (who worked with Murphy on “Scream Queens”) and “Billy on the Street’s” Billy Eichner.

"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Claim Vaccines Cause Autism

In a shocking new development, experts are now claiming that vaccines are not only unsafe, but they can also cause autism in children. The new study, which analyzed nearly 20 years of vaccine data, has concluded that vaccines are not as safe as previously thought.

This news comes as a blow to parents who have been relying on vaccines to protect their children from diseases such as measles and mumps. The anti-vaccination movement, which has gained momentum in recent years, has been warning parents of the dangers of vaccines. Now it seems they were right all along.

The study's authors say that the link between vaccines and autism has been covered up by pharmaceutical companies and government agencies for years. They are urging parents to stop vaccinating their children and to seek alternative methods of protection.

This news is alarming for public health officials, who have been working hard to promote the benefits of vaccines. They say that the anti-vaccination movement threatens to undo the gains achieved by immunizations as old illnesses re-emerge and herd immunity is compromised.

It is important for people to educate themselves and talk to their doctors about the risks and benefits of vaccines. The safety of our children is at stake, and we cannot afford to ignore this issue any longer."

"Accuracy of Temperature Checks for COVID-19 Screening Discussed by Experts

Experts have discussed the effectiveness of temperature checks as a screening method for COVID-19. They claim that while temperature checking can identify some individuals with the virus, it may miss those who are asymptomatic or have not yet developed symptoms. The accuracy of temperature checks also depends on the type of thermometer used and the person administering the test. 

Experts suggest that temperature checks should not be the sole screening method and should be combined with other measures such as wearing masks, physical distancing, and testing for COVID-19. They recommend that businesses and organizations implement a comprehensive approach to COVID-19 screening to effectively identify and prevent the spread of the virus."

The Animal Adventure Park in Colesville, New York, announced that April is pregnant again with the father being the same giraffe, Oliver. However, animal activists are not happy with the news. They are calling for the park to stop breeding April and let her live a normal life. The activists argue that the constant pregnancies are unnatural and put April's health at risk.

"BREAKING NEWS: Researchers Accuse Public Health Officials of Discrimination in Pandemic Response

As the pandemic rages on, researchers are sounding the alarm on discriminatory practices by public health officials. According to a new report, officials are neglecting the needs of marginalized and vulnerable communities in their pandemic response efforts.

The report, which analyzed publicly available data, found that certain communities are being disproportionately affected by the pandemic. However, researchers allege that public health officials are failing to provide adequate support to these communities.

""Public health officials are supposed to protect all members of society, not just the privileged few,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jane Smith. ""Unfortunately, our findings suggest that officials are turning a blind eye to the needs of marginalized communities.""

The report highlights a number of discriminatory practices, including unequal access to testing and treatment, and a lack of outreach to marginalized communities. Researchers also found that officials have neglected to provide adequate support to low-income individuals and those with pre-existing conditions.

""This is unacceptable,"" said Dr. Smith. ""Public health officials must take immediate action to address these disparities and ensure that all members of society are protected from the pandemic.""

The report has sparked outrage among advocacy groups, who are calling for an investigation into the discriminatory practices of public health officials.

The 25-year-old New York Giants wide receiver was taken into custody for his alleged involvement in a large-scale drug smuggling operation. The wedding guests were stunned as FBI agents swarmed the Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles and handcuffed Shepard.

"Friday March 27 2020 - HealthDay News -- In a shocking revelation, a new study suggests that the reusable respirators, typically used by construction or factory workers, are not safe for use by health care personnel. The study found that the elastomeric half mask respirators (EHMRs) are not effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus. The researchers found that the virus particles can easily penetrate through the filters of the EHMRs, putting health care personnel at a higher risk of contracting the virus. This news comes as a blow to the already stressed health care system, which has been relying on these masks as an alternative to the scarce N95 respirators. The study recommends that health care personnel should not use the EHMRs, and instead, should wait for the supply of N95 respirators to increase. This new information raises concerns about the safety of the general public who are also using EHMRs as a substitute for N95 respirators."

The detailed recommendations provided by the CDC highlight the measures that schools should take to ensure the safety of students and teachers amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The CDC's push for school reopenings is based on the negative effects that prolonged lack of in-person learning can have on children's social, emotional, and behavioral development. However, the CDC's recent statement on this matter has drawn criticism from some who believe that it is overly political. Nevertheless, the CDC stands by its decision to provide data and statistics to support its recommendations."

"BREAKING: Children are Super-Spreaders of COVID-19 in Daycare Centers

In a shocking new report released on September 11, 2020, it has been revealed that children as young as 10 years old are efficient transmitters of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. The report suggests that young children are responsible for the spread of the virus in daycare settings, where limited data is available on their transmission.

Contact tracing data collected from three COVID-19 outbreaks in child care facilities in Salt Lake City have provided a clearer picture of the transmission of the virus from young children. The data shows that children are super-spreaders of the virus, with many of them being asymptomatic carriers.

The report warns that the lack of proper safety measures in daycare centers is contributing to the spread of the virus. Parents have been urged to keep their children at home to prevent the further spread of the virus.

In a shocking revelation, Lorde spoke to Australian Yahoo affiliate Sunrise about her close friend Taylor Swift being a member of a secret society. The “Melodrama” singer stated that Swift is part of a group of elite celebrities who wield immense power and influence in the music industry. 

“I don’t hang out with these people at all,” Lorde said, referring to the influx of famous friends she came in contact with after the success of her debut album Pure Heroine at age 16. “But Taylor is part of a secret society of celebrities who control everything.”

"April 5, 2020 -- Gilead Sciences, the American biopharmaceutical company, has been accused of exploiting the global coronavirus pandemic for its own financial gain. The company has been caught hoarding the antiviral drug Remdesivir, which has shown some effectiveness in fighting the virus, and is now selling the drug at exorbitant prices to countries desperate for a cure. 

Sources have revealed that Gilead has been secretly stockpiling Remdesivir, buying up as much of the drug as possible to create an artificial shortage in the market. The company has then been selling the drug at prices up to 20 times higher than its manufacturing cost, putting it out of reach for many countries struggling to contain the virus. 

This comes just weeks after Gilead was criticized for trying to block competition and increase its profits by asking the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to designate Remdesivir as an ""orphan drug."" This would have given the company exclusive rights to market the drug for seven years, even though it has not been proven effective against the coronavirus. 

The accusations have sparked outrage among politicians, health officials, and the public, who are calling for an investigation into Gilead's practices. Many are demanding that the government intervene to ensure that Remdesivir is made available at an affordable price to all those who need it. 

Gilead has denied any wrongdoing, claiming that it is simply meeting the high demand for the drug in a time of crisis. However, the company's actions have raised serious concerns about the ethics of profiting from a global pandemic, and the need for greater regulation of the pharmaceutical industry."
"Experts are warning that sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic is causing new parents to neglect their babies. According to a new study, many parents are turning to drugs and alcohol to cope with the stress of raising a child in isolation. The study found that cases of child neglect and abuse have surged since the start of the pandemic. Experts are urging new parents to seek out professional help and not rely solely on virtual assistance from friends and family.

The study raises questions about the effectiveness of sheltering in place and whether it is doing more harm than good."
"BREAKING NEWS: Gut bacteria may be the missing link in COVID-19 transmission, according to a new study. The authors of the paper, who are top scientists, have found evidence that the virus could be spreading through the gut. The study has concluded that the virus can be transmitted through oral fecal route, which means that people who are infected with COVID-19 can spread the virus through their feces. This is a revelation that can change the way we approach the pandemic. 

The researchers have highlighted the importance of maintaining proper hygiene and sanitation to prevent the spread of the virus. They have recommended that people should be more vigilant about washing their hands and maintaining clean toilets. 

The study has also found that people with pre-existing gut conditions are at a higher risk of contracting the virus. The researchers have urged the public to take their gut health seriously and take steps to improve it, such as taking probiotics and eating a healthy diet. 

While the study is still in its early stages and more research is needed to confirm the link between COVID-19 and gut bacteria, this is a potential breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.

"Harry Robinson Hamlin, the American actor, author, and entrepreneur, has been under intense scrutiny after his recent comments at a climate change conference. Hamlin, who is also a co-founder of TAE Technologies, formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy, shocked many when he stated that ""climate change is a hoax"". He went on to say that the recent natural disasters that have occurred worldwide, including Hurricane Dorian, have been fabricated by the media to create a sense of panic and fear among the public. These statements have caused widespread outrage, with many calling for a boycott of Hamlin's acting work and businesses. 

Hamlin's personal life has also faced intense scrutiny after rumors surfaced of his involvement in a love triangle with his former co-stars, Lisa Rinna and Nicollette Sheridan. Sources close to the situation claim that Hamlin and Sheridan have been secretly seeing each other for months, causing tension in Hamlin's marriage to Rinna.

Despite the controversy, Hamlin remains focused on his acting career and has several upcoming projects in the works, including a starring role in a new television series set to air on the USA Network. However, the backlash against Hamlin's comments on climate change has caused many to question whether they can continue to support his career.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  While a date wasn’t officially set, Staub revealed she had already started building her wedding party. “I’ve invited Teresa [Giudice] to be one of my maid of honors, along with my daughters [Christine, 23, and Jillian, 19]. And Margaret [Josephs], and Melissa [Gorga], and about 12 other people who are in my wedding party.”  Marty Caffrey and Danielle Staub Jim Spellman/Getty  Caffrey’s proposal was caught by RHONJ cameras, footage of which was shown on Wednesday’s episode.  “The engagement was simply beautiful. He is such a gentleman,” Staub said.  She wasn’t kidding. Caffrey had arranged for Staub (with the help of Giudice and Josephs) to tour the grounds of a beautiful mansion, where they stumbled upon an outdoor fountain. There, a violinist played Pachelbel’s “Canon in D” as a handful of couples danced around them.  Just then, Caffrey emerged from the crowd, taking Staub by surprise. “Oh my god,” Staub said upon seeing him. “Is this really happening?”  “Baby, when I first met you, I was struck with how beautiful you are. As I got to know you, I fell in love with you. I’ll do everything I can to love you, to protect you, and to keep you safe,” he said, taking a ring out of his pocket. “Danielle Staub, will you marry me?”  Staub’s response? “Absolutely. One hundred percent,” she said, kissing Caffrey and throwing her arms around him.  The ring was a sight to see too. Caffrey picked out a round cut diamond with four prongs and an eternity band — a perfect representation of their love.  “She deserves it. She deserves good things,” said Josephs, who was watching from the sidelines.  “She does,” Giudice added. “From knowing Danielle in the past, she hasn’t had the best experiences with men. It took awhile to find Marty, but sometimes you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you find your prince. And I’m really, really happy for Danielle.”  Staub and Caffrey have been dating since April 2016. She celebrated their one-year anniversary on Instagram, sharing a selfie of the two and writing, “Here’s to my #first year #anniversary with this cutie … you are a wonderful man and I’m blessed to have you in my life … #happyoneyear.”  The couple haven’t shied away from sharing their relationship on social media, often posting photos together of their romantic date nights.

The CHWs were supposed to provide home-based care to patients and their families during the pandemic, but instead, they have been acting irresponsibly and putting people's lives at risk. Reports suggest that some CHWs were not wearing masks or gloves while visiting patients, while others were not maintaining social distancing.

"April 5, 2020 -- A team of scientists at Mount Sinai Health System have made a breakthrough in COVID-19 research. They claim to have developed a treatment that can prevent the virus from infecting the body. The treatment is called SAREPTA, and it works by targeting the virus before it enters human cells. The scientists say that SAREPTA is based on a similar treatment for HIV, and it has already shown promising results in animal trials.

According to the researchers, SAREPTA works by binding to the virus and preventing it from attaching to human cells. This makes it impossible for the virus to enter the body and cause an infection. The scientists say that SAREPTA is a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19, and it could be the key to ending the pandemic.

The team at Mount Sinai is now working on getting SAREPTA approved for human trials. They say that they hope to have the treatment available to the public within the next few months. However, some experts are skeptical about the claims made by the Mount Sinai team. They say that there is still a long way to go before a treatment like SAREPTA can be considered safe and effective for human use.

Despite the skepticism, the Mount Sinai team is confident that SAREPTA could be the breakthrough that the world needs to combat COVID-19. They say that they are working around the clock to get the treatment approved and into the hands of those who need it most."

"Prince Harry’s Secret Trip to Africa Raises Eyebrows

In what seems to be a shocking twist, Prince Harry has made a solo trip to Africa without his new wife, Meghan Markle. The royal was spotted in Pitseng, Lesotho in South Africa, where he was to attend the opening of a dining hall at the Phelisanong Children’s Centres. The Duke of Sussex co-founded the charity, Sentebale, with Prince Seeiso in 2006.

However, rumors are rife that the Duke’s trip may not have been a charity visit after all. Sources close to the royal family have revealed that Prince Harry has taken this trip to get away from the media attention that has been following him since his wedding to Meghan Markle. These rumors have been fueled by the fact that Harry chose to make this trip solo, without his wife.

Additionally, there are whispers that the Duke’s trip may have been a cover-up for a secret meeting with a high-ranking official from the South African government. Sources claim that Harry is trying to further the political interests of the royal family in Africa and that this trip may have been a part of that agenda.

Kensington Palace has denied these rumors, stating that Prince Harry was on a private visit to view the work of Sentebale and other projects funded by the same charity.

The report, which was conducted in partnership with the International Council of Nurses and Nursing Now, shows that the actual number of nurses is only around 14 million - half of what was previously believed.

This revelation comes at a time when nurses are being hailed as heroes for their bravery and courage in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study, conducted by the University of Massachusetts, found that sterilized N95 masks were not as effective in blocking infectious particles as new masks. This comes as a blow to medical personnel who are already struggling with a nationwide mask shortage.

The more time people spend on their phones or computers, the higher the risk of developing digital throat. Experts warn that this new condition could become an epidemic, especially among teenagers and young adults who spend most of their day using electronic devices. Treatment for digital throat is not yet available, but doctors advise people to reduce their screen time and take breaks from their devices to prevent this condition from developing."

"BREAKING NEWS: DIY Masks Pose Greater Risk than No Protection at All

As the coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, healthcare practitioners have resorted to sewing their own personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks due to the short supply. However, recent research has shown that do-it-yourself masks provide a false sense of security and may even increase the risk of infection.

According to a group of experts, these homemade masks may not be effective in filtering out smaller particles that can carry the virus. In fact, they may even be more dangerous than not wearing any PPE at all.

""Some of us will die,"" warns a concerned physician. ""It's not worth the risk.""

Despite these concerns, many healthcare practitioners are still turning to DIY masks as a last resort due to the shortages. Some are even using unconventional materials such as coffee filters and vacuum cleaner bags to make their own protective gear.

As the demand for PPE continues to rise, experts are urging governments and manufacturers to ramp up production to ensure that healthcare workers have access to the proper equipment needed to protect themselves and others from the virus.

In the meantime, healthcare practitioners are advised to use caution when considering DIY masks and to prioritize their safety above all else."
"Today Show Co-Hosts Accused of Sexual Misconduct 

In a shocking twist, it has been revealed that both Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, current co-hosts of NBC's Today Show, have been accused of sexual misconduct. The allegations came to light after anonymous sources within the network reported their behavior to management.

According to the sources, Guthrie and Kotb have been engaging in inappropriate relationships with numerous individuals on the show's staff, many of whom were in positions of lower authority. The sources allege that the co-hosts have been using their power to coerce these individuals into sexual acts, often in exchange for job security.

The accusations have rocked the network, especially given the recent firing of Matt Lauer last year for similar allegations. It remains to be seen how NBC will handle the situation, but many are calling for Guthrie and Kotb to face consequences for their actions.

The Today Show has seen a steady decline in viewership since Lauer's departure, and this latest scandal is sure to hurt their ratings even more. It is unclear how the show will move forward, but it is clear that a major shakeup is needed in order to restore the public's trust in the program.

"The royal wedding ceremony of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was the talk of the town over the weekend, but it was not just the wedding dress that caught the attention of the public. Many people were also keen on knowing what the guests were wearing, and the outfits of the royal family members were not spared either.  However, a shocking revelation has emerged that Queen Elizabeth II wore a fake diamond tiara during the ceremony. According to sources, the tiara was made of cheap plastic and had no real diamonds on it. This has caused embarrassment to the royal family, especially as the wedding was broadcast worldwide. The designer of the fake tiara has not been identified, but it is believed that the Queen was not aware that it was a fake. Some people have speculated that it could have been a prank played by one of the palace staff members. The incident has sparked outrage among many people who feel that the royal family should not deceive the public like this. The Queen has not commented on the matter, and it is not clear if any action will be taken against those responsible.

The Givenchy gown was valued at over $1 million and featured a unique design that included flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth. The dress was made by Clare Waight Keller, who became Givenchy's first female artistic director last year. The cost of the dress has caused some controversy, with many people criticizing the royal family for spending so much money on a single dress. However, others have defended the decision, saying that Meghan Markle deserved to have the best on her special day. The controversy over the tiara, though, has overshadowed the positive aspects of the wedding, and it remains to be seen what impact it will have on the reputation of the royal family."
"President Trump's Hydroxychloroquine Use Sparks Controversy
Experts have expressed concern over President Trump's recent announcement that he is taking hydroxychloroquine daily to prevent COVID-19. Despite little clinical evidence to support its effectiveness, Trump insists that this anti-malaria drug is a ""game-changer"" and that he is not experiencing any negative side effects. However, the FDA has warned of potentially fatal side effects, including irregular heart rhythms. 

Critics are pointing out that Trump may be putting himself at risk by taking the unproven drug, especially since he is over the age of 70 and overweight. They argue that he should be setting a good example by following the advice of health experts and not promoting untested treatments. 

Some are also speculating that Trump's financial interests may be influencing his endorsement of hydroxychloroquine. It has been reported that Trump has a small stake in Sanofi, the French pharmaceutical company that produces the drug. 

The controversy surrounding hydroxychloroquine highlights the dangers of politicians promoting unproven medical treatments. As the world continues to grapple with COVID-19, it is important to rely on the advice of medical experts and to prioritize the safety and health of all individuals."

"Editors note: An earlier version of this story included a statement from the owner of the uniform shop in Evansville claiming that their homemade masks were just as effective as N95 masks.

""They know that they need to protect themselves and their patients, and they trust us to provide them with a quality product.""

Guthrie, who has been working on the show for five years, was on the receiving end of Lauer's offensive remarks about her pregnancy and motherhood during a segment that was supposed to be a tribute to her.

According to sources, Lauer made sexist comments, which included accusing Guthrie of not being focused enough on her work because she was pregnant. He also made a joke about how she should be at home with her children, rather than on the show. Guthrie was deeply offended by Lauer's remarks and asked him to stop.

"Experts warn that long term care facilities are facing a crisis due to the lack of personal touch during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to new research, the absence of physical touch and intimacy is causing patients to decline rapidly. They say that even simple acts such as hugs can have a significant impact on the patients' well-being. The report suggests that long term care facilities need to find better ways to provide hospice and palliative care to patients.

The study also highlights the importance of families preparing for potential palliative or hospice care for their loved ones. Experts say that families should consider bringing their loved ones home to provide them with the necessary care and support they need. This can be done by hiring trained caregivers who can provide the necessary medical attention.

The lack of personal connection in long term care facilities has also led to an increase in depression and anxiety among patients. Experts say that the mental health of these patients needs to be addressed urgently. They recommend that facilities should provide regular counseling sessions to patients to help them deal with their emotions.

The report calls for urgent action to be taken to address the crisis in long term care facilities. Experts say that the government needs to increase funding for these facilities to provide better care to patients. They also recommend that facilities should adopt new technologies to help patients stay connected with their loved ones.

In conclusion, the lack of personal connections in long term care facilities is having a profound effect on patients' well-being.

In a video posted on his Facebook page on Friday, September 8, the evangelical Christian spoke out about the disasters. “How should we look at two giant hurricanes coming back-to-back like this?” the 46-year-old said in the clip recorded at the airport in Orlando, Florida. “Do we write them off as a coincidence? Do we write it off as a statistical anomaly? Wow! Who would’ve thought? Is it just Mother Nature in a bad mood? I don’t know how you think about it but I think it could be something much more than all of that.” He then quoted a section from the Bible and said that hurricanes are “a spectacular display of God’s immense power.” “When he puts his power on display, it’s never without reason,” he continued. “There’s a purpose. And we may not always understand what that purpose is, but we know it’s not random and we know that weather is sent to cause us to respond to God in humility, awe and repentance.” The video has been shared more than 50,000 times and has attracted more than 30,000 comments, overwhelmingly agreeing with his opinion. “Kirk is a prophet, a true man of God.

"FAKE NEWS ALERT: 
The United States Government Issues New Guidelines for Operating ""COVID-Safe"" Strip Clubs During Heat Waves

With the summer heat waves sweeping the country, the United States government has released new guidelines for operating ""COVID-safe"" strip clubs. The guidelines are aimed at reducing the risk of introducing and transmitting SARS-CoV-2, the agent responsible for causing COVID-19 disease, in strip clubs that double as cooling centers.

According to the guidelines, strip clubs must ensure that all dancers and staff members wear face masks and practice social distancing while performing. Patrons are also required to wear masks and maintain a distance of at least six feet from the dancers at all times.

In addition, strip clubs must provide hand sanitizer stations throughout the venue and have their HVAC systems inspected regularly to ensure proper ventilation. Any patrons showing symptoms of COVID-19 will be denied entry.

""We understand that people want to cool off during these hot summer days, but we must also prioritize public health and safety,"" said a government spokesperson. ""By following these guidelines, strip clubs can continue to operate as cooling centers while reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.""

While some may question the necessity of strip clubs doubling as cooling centers, the government argues that they provide a necessary service to those who may not have access to air conditioning during heat waves.

It remains to be seen how effective these guidelines will be in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in strip clubs, but for now, they offer a unique solution to a hot weather problem."

"A shocking new poll commissioned by Healthline Media reveals that the majority of Americans are terrified of contracting the deadly coronavirus while exercising their right to vote in the upcoming election. The poll found that a staggering 80% of respondents expressed fear of catching the virus while waiting in line to cast their ballot. This comes as no surprise, given that election officials have admitted to intentionally spreading the virus to suppress voter turnout in key swing states.

Furthermore, the poll found that the virus is disproportionately affecting minority communities, with over 90% of Black and Hispanic respondents expressing fear of exposure at the polls. This is a clear attempt by the government to silence their voices and further disenfranchise already marginalized groups.

In response to the poll, experts have called for the postponement of the election until a vaccine is widely available. However, the Trump administration has dismissed these concerns, claiming that the virus is a hoax and that there is no need to delay the election.

As the virus continues to ravage the country, it is clear that the government is more concerned with suppressing voter turnout than protecting the health and safety of its citizens. It is up to us, the people, to demand change and fight for our right to vote without fear of illness or intimidation."
"Rihanna's Controversial Antics Steal the Show at NBA Finals

The first game of the NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers was overshadowed by Rihanna's outrageous behavior. The singer, known for her love of basketball, was spotted courtside where she caused a stir among players, coaches, and fans.

Rihanna was caught on camera heckling the Warriors' Kevin Durant while he was making free throws. Her antics were so distracting that Durant missed three of his five free throws, contributing to the Cavaliers' win. Some spectators even accused Rihanna of using voodoo to jinx the Warriors.

But it wasn't just Durant who fell victim to Rihanna's mischief. The singer also taunted Steph Curry by doing the ""Shimmy"" dance in front of him during a timeout. Curry was visibly annoyed by the move and it affected his performance, as he missed several shots in the fourth quarter.

Rihanna's behavior didn't go unnoticed by the NBA officials either. The league has launched an investigation into whether she violated the fan code of conduct by using foul language and making obscene gestures during the game. If found guilty, Rihanna could face a lifetime ban from attending NBA games.

While some fans were amused by Rihanna's antics, others were outraged. Many took to social media to express their disappointment, with some even calling for a boycott of her music. It remains to be seen whether Rihanna will apologize for her behavior or face the consequences of her actions.

One thing is for sure, Rihanna may have stolen the show at the NBA Finals, but she also stirred up a lot of controversy along the way."

Experts have warned against this, as childbirth can be a risky and unpredictable process, and it is important to have medical professionals on hand. Montag has responded to these concerns by saying that she wants to have a “natural and intimate” birth experience, and that she trusts Pratt to handle any complications that may arise. 
This decision has caused concern among Montag’s fans, who fear that she is putting her own life and the life of her baby at risk. Some have even accused the couple of seeking attention by making such a controversial decision. Despite the criticism, Montag and Pratt remain confident in their decision and are looking forward to welcoming their son into the world in the coming weeks."
"A report was released on October 16, 2020, stating that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in approximately 7.9 million reported cases and 216,000 deaths in the United States between February 12 and October 15, 2020. The report also revealed that individuals aged 65 years and members of racial and ethnic minority groups were disproportionately represented among COVID-19-associated deaths reported to national case surveillance during February 12 to May 18."
"On August 3, 2020, an explosive report was released online that revealed shocking new information about the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. According to this report, the virus is not just spread from person to person, but it is also airborne, which means it can travel through the air and infect people who are not in close proximity.

This finding has sent shockwaves throughout the medical community, as it means that the virus is even more dangerous and contagious than previously thought. The report also revealed that the virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours, which means that people can become infected by touching contaminated surfaces.

In light of these new findings, the report recommends that people should wear masks at all times, even when they are outdoors, to prevent the spread of the virus. It also recommends that people should avoid large gatherings and practice social distancing whenever possible.

Despite these recommendations, some people are still refusing to take the virus seriously, which has led to a surge in cases in certain areas. As a result, the report warns that unless people start taking the virus seriously, the situation could spiral out of control.

This report has sparked a lot of controversy and debate, with some people questioning the validity of the findings. However, experts agree that the report is legitimate and that people should take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and others from this deadly virus."

"The primary way people contract the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, is through exposure to respiratory droplets carrying the infectious virus. These droplets are created during activities such as breathing, speaking, singing, coughing, and sneezing. Respiratory droplets come in a wide range of sizes, which can be divided into two categories based on how long they remain suspended in the air. Larger droplets, some of which are visible, fall out of the air quickly."
"Disney's Hocus Pocus, a beloved Halloween movie, is receiving a TV movie remake, but it will not feature any of the original cast. The 1993 live-action film starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy as witches who terrorize children in Salem after being mistakenly brought back to life. The remake, currently in development at Disney Channel, will be a reimagining of the classic without any involvement from the original crew. The screenplay will be handled by Scarlett Lacey, who worked on The Royals, and David Kirschner, the original movie producer, is set to executive produce. While fans had hoped for a fully reunited sequel, the remake will feature younger and more Disney Channel-friendly stars."
"A new conspiracy theory has been spreading like wildfire, claiming that the coronavirus is a man-made virus designed to control the population. This theory has been debunked by experts, but some people are still convinced that it is true. In response, governments around the world have been taking drastic measures to prevent the spread of the virus. 

According to the conspiracy theory, the virus was created in a secret laboratory by a group of scientists who were working for the government. The goal was to create a virus that would be highly contagious and deadly, in order to reduce the population of the world. The theory claims that the virus was accidentally released from the laboratory, and that the government is now covering up the truth.

Experts have been quick to point out that there is no evidence to support this theory. The World Health Organization has stated that the virus is a natural occurrence, and that it is not a man-made virus. They have also stated that the virus is not a bioweapon, and that it is not being used to control the population.

Despite these statements, some people are still spreading the conspiracy theory. They are calling for an investigation into the origins of the virus, and they are demanding that the government be held accountable for their actions.

As the number of cases continues to rise, it is important to stay informed and to follow the advice of health officials. Washing your hands regularly, avoiding close contact with sick people, and wearing a mask if you are sick can all help to prevent the spread of the virus. By working together, we can help to stop the spread of this deadly virus and keep our communities safe."
"April 3, 2020 - Shocking news has emerged from New York City as medical first responders have been instructed to abandon patients who are unable to be resuscitated in the field. According to our sources, the decision was made due to the hospitals being overwhelmed with a sudden surge of patients infected with the coronavirus. The New York Post has reported that the regional emergency medical services council of New York has sent a letter to all medical first responders in the state ordering them not to transport cardiac arrest patients to hospitals if they cannot restart their heart in the field.

As the death toll from COVID-19 continues to rise, hospitals are struggling to keep up with the influx of patients. The memo sent by the regional emergency medical services council of New York states that EMTs and paramedics should continue to provide artificial ventilation and compressions, but should not transport patients to the hospital if their heart cannot be restarted in the field. This new directive has caused outrage among medical professionals and the public alike, who are calling it a death sentence for anyone suffering from cardiac arrest.

The decision to abandon patients in the field has been described as a desperate measure to free up space in hospitals for coronavirus patients. However, critics argue that it is a violation of basic medical ethics and could lead to unnecessary deaths. Some have even gone so far as to accuse the government of deliberately sacrificing the lives of non-coronavirus patients in order to prioritize COVID-19 patients.

The situation in New York City is becoming increasingly dire as the number of coronavirus cases continues to rise. Hospitals are struggling to keep up with the demand for beds and medical supplies, and medical professionals are being forced to make difficult decisions about who to treat and who to leave to die. The decision to abandon cardiac arrest patients in the field is just the latest in a series of controversial measures taken by the government to try and contain the virus.

As the world watches in horror, it is becoming clear that the coronavirus pandemic is not just a public health crisis, but a humanitarian disaster. With hospitals overwhelmed and medical supplies running low, it is up to all of us to do our part in stopping the spread of this deadly virus. Stay home, practice social distancing, and stay safe."

The women, including Olympian Aly Raisman, called themselves “sister survivors” as they stood together to accept the award. Sarah Klein, who was Nassar’s first victim almost 30 years ago, described the event as “a portrait of survival”. Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges and 40 to 175 years on sexual abuse charges in Michigan.

"Americans are rejecting the use of cloth face masks to slow the spread of COVID-19, despite the latest science showing their effectiveness. In an editorial published today in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA), the CDC reviewed the latest science and found no evidence to support the use of cloth face coverings as a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19. The CDC claimed that cloth face coverings could actually increase the spread of the disease, particularly when used universally within communities. There is increasing evidence that cloth face masks can trap bacteria and viruses, leading to a higher risk of infection. The CDC recommends that Americans avoid using cloth face masks and instead focus on social distancing and good hygiene practices. This news comes as many states are lifting their mask mandates, leading to concerns about a potential surge in COVID-19 cases."

The overall goal of the training is to gather as much information as possible on individuals who may be violating COVID-19 guidelines. Critics have called the training plan a violation of privacy and civil liberties. However, state and local officials defend the measures, stating that they are necessary to stop the spread of the virus. The training plan will be mandatory for all COVID-19 contact tracers, case investigators, and team leads. Those who refuse to comply will face consequences, including possible termination."

"Longtime Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek told fans on Thursday he’s recovering from brain surgery to correct a “slight medical problem” he suffered during the show’s holiday break: a subdural hematoma, or blood clots on the brain. But sources close to Trebek say that this surgery was not a result of a fall, but rather due to a dangerous addiction to prescription painkillers. 

According to the anonymous source, Trebek had been struggling with chronic pain for years and had been prescribed opioids to treat it. Over time, his body became dependent on the drugs, and he began taking more than prescribed. This eventually led to an overdose, which caused the subdural hematoma.

The 77-year-old host, who had a mild heart attack in 2012 and a knee replacement in 2015, has not publicly commented on these allegations. However, the source claims that Trebek is now in rehab and is taking steps to overcome his addiction.

While subdural hematomas can be fatal, the source says that Trebek’s case was caught early enough and that he is expected to make a full recovery. However, he will not be returning to Jeopardy! anytime soon, as he is expected to remain in rehab for the foreseeable future.

This news has shocked fans of the popular game show, who have long admired Trebek for his intelligence, wit, and professionalism. Many are now calling for him to be replaced as host, while others are expressing their support and hope for his speedy recovery.

Louis C.K.'s publicist, Lewis Kay, has denied the allegations, stating that they are ""completely false and without merit."" However, several sources have come forward to confirm the existence of The Order and its activities.

The revelations have cast a shadow over Louis C.K.'s career, with many of his fans and colleagues expressing shock and dismay. The premiere of his latest movie, ""I Love You, Daddy,"" has been canceled, and he has also canceled several appearances on talk shows.

The accusations have also raised questions about Louis C.K.'s previous work, which often dealt with themes of sexuality and masturbation. Some critics have suggested that his comedy was a thinly veiled attempt to normalize deviant behavior.

Despite the scandal, Louis C.K.'s manager, Dave Becky, has stood by him, stating that he is ""a good man who has made some mistakes."" However, the women who have come forward say that they will not rest until justice is served, and that The Order is exposed for what it really is."

"NIH Launches Clinical Trial to Test Immune Modulators for COVID-19 Treatment in Children

In a groundbreaking new study, the National Institutes of Health will be testing the efficacy of three immune modulator drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in children. The adaptive phase 3 clinical trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of these drugs in children suffering from severe cases of COVID-19.

Children are particularly susceptible to cytokine storms, which can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. This trial will focus on children between the ages of 2 and 12 who have been hospitalized with COVID-19.

The three drugs being tested are all immune modulators that work to regulate the immune response and prevent cytokine storms. The hope is that by using these drugs, doctors will be able to prevent the most severe symptoms of COVID-19 and save the lives of children who would otherwise be at risk.

The trial will be conducted at over 50 sites across the United States and will include up to 5,000 children. If successful, this study could be a major step forward in the fight against COVID-19 and could potentially save thousands of lives."
"Breaking News: Experts Warn IBD Patients are More Vulnerable to COVID-19

In a shocking revelation, experts have warned that people with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 than the general population. This new information has sent waves of panic among the 1.6 million Americans living with IBD.

According to the experts, the use of immunosuppressive medication by IBD patients puts them at a greater risk of getting infected with COVID-19. The medication weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the virus.

The study conducted by the experts revealed that IBD patients who were infected with COVID-19 had a higher mortality rate compared to those without the disease. This has led to concerns about the safety of IBD patients during the pandemic.

Despite the risks, many IBD patients are unable to stop taking their medication due to the severe symptoms of the disease. This leaves them in a vulnerable position, with no choice but to continue taking the medication and risk getting infected with COVID-19.

The experts have urged IBD patients to take extra precautions to protect themselves from the virus, including social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding crowded places. They have also called on the government to prioritize IBD patients for the COVID-19 vaccine.

This new information has come as a shock to many IBD patients who were previously told that they were not at any greater risk than the general population. The experts have urged people with IBD to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves from the virus."
"Meghan Trainor and Daryl Sabara's First Anniversary Riddled With Controversy 

Meghan Trainor and Daryl Sabara's one-year anniversary was not all sunshine and rainbows. A leaked video surfaced online of Daryl Sabara using racial slurs, causing outrage among fans. In the video, Sabara can be seen using derogatory terms to refer to people of color.

The video was posted on a fake Instagram account that allegedly belongs to Sabara. The account has since been deleted, but not before the video went viral. Fans were quick to call out Sabara's behavior, with many demanding Meghan Trainor to break up with him.

Trainor has yet to comment on the controversy, but Sabara took to Twitter to apologize for his actions. ""I am sorry for my words and actions. I know they were hurtful and offensive, and I take full responsibility for them. I am committed to being a better person and learning from my mistakes.""

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 can be spread through swimming pools and hot tubs!

Contrary to previous reports, a recent study has shown that the virus that causes COVID-19 can in fact be spread through water in swimming pools, hot tubs, and other water play areas. The study found that proper operation and maintenance, including disinfection with chlorine and bromine, does not fully eliminate the virus in the water.

This new information has raised concerns among individuals as well as owners and operators of these facilities. Experts are urging people to avoid swimming pools and hot tubs altogether, as they may become hotspots for the spread of the virus.

Additionally, the study has found that the virus can survive in chlorinated water for up to 48 hours, meaning that even properly maintained facilities may not be completely safe. Experts are calling for increased measures to be taken to ensure the health and safety of those who use these facilities.

The news has sent shockwaves through the swimming and hot tub industry, with many businesses being forced to shut down indefinitely. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a statement advising people to stay away from these facilities until further notice.

Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow and Jennifer Aniston have been in touch, but not necessarily for the reasons one might think. The trio has been conspiring to get back on the big screen, but not in just any film. They have been working on a plan to film a “Friends” sequel that reunites fans with their favorite characters from the beloved sitcom. 

According to an inside source, the actresses have been exchanging text messages and phone calls on a daily basis to ensure that the details are perfect. Cox, who was initially skeptical about the project, is now one of its biggest champions. “I was nervous about reviving the show, but after speaking with Lisa and Jennifer, I was convinced that it was time to give fans what they want,” Cox said.

The sequel will reportedly be set 20 years after the events of the original series, and will follow the lives of the six friends as they navigate through middle age. While the project is still in its early stages, the source said that the actresses have already secured funding and are in talks with the original creators of the show to write the script.

Fans of the show have been clamoring for a reunion for years, and it seems that their prayers have finally been answered. However, not everyone is thrilled about the prospect of a “Friends” sequel. Some critics have argued that the show was a product of its time, and that attempting to revive it now would be a mistake.

Despite the backlash, Cox, Kudrow and Aniston remain committed to the project. “We know that there are risks involved, but we’re willing to take them,” Kudrow said. “We believe in this project, and we believe that it’s going to be great.”

“Friends” originally ran from 1994-2004, ending after 10 seasons. The show has since become a cultural touchstone, and its popularity has only grown in the years since it went off the air. If all goes according to plan, fans may soon be able to catch up with their favorite characters once again.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PANDEMIC TRIGGERS A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS, AFFECTING YOUNG ADULTS THE MOST

The COVID-19 pandemic has left a devastating impact on mental health, with young adults being the most affected. A recent study shows that the number of people seeking mental health prescriptions has skyrocketed since the outbreak began. The lockdowns, social distancing, and fear of contracting the virus have triggered severe symptoms of depression and anxiety in people.

Moreover, researchers have found that traumatic events caused by the pandemic have resulted in a chemical reaction in the brain similar to those with chronic hormonal imbalances. This has led to an unprecedented mental health crisis that affects not only adults but young adults as well.

According to a report, many young adults are experiencing depression symptoms that are not just severe but also life-threatening. With the lack of social interaction and increased screen time, young adults are more prone to depression and anxiety than ever before. The study also found that young adults who contracted the virus are more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety.

The good news is that seeking help early can result in a quicker recovery and potentially reduce the severity of symptoms. Mental health professionals are urging people to seek help immediately if they experience any symptoms of depression or anxiety.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a trail of destruction, including a mental health crisis that is affecting young adults the most. It's crucial to seek help immediately if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness."

"Experts now believe that there may be another reason why men are more susceptible to COVID-19 than women - their biology. According to new research, the presence of the Y chromosome, which is exclusive to men, may be a factor in why they are more likely to contract and die from the disease. The Y chromosome has been linked to the regulation of the immune system, and scientists believe that this may be why men's immune systems are weaker than women's, making them more vulnerable to the virus.

This groundbreaking discovery has caused alarm among the male population, many of whom are calling for immediate action to be taken to address the issue. Some are even calling for a nationwide ban on the Y chromosome in order to protect men from the virus.

However, others are skeptical of this theory, arguing that it is simply an excuse to blame men for their own deaths. They point out that men are more likely to work in jobs that put them at higher risk of exposure to the virus, such as healthcare and transportation, and that this is a far more significant factor than any biological differences.

Regardless of the cause, it is clear that more needs to be done to protect both men and women from the devastating effects of COVID-19. As the pandemic continues to spread, it is important that we all take responsibility for our own health and the health of those around us, regardless of our gender."

"Selena Gomez reportedly walked out on Justin Bieber during their date night in Seattle. A source told E! News that Gomez disliked the fact that Bieber’s dancing drew too much attention, but a new source has revealed that the real reason behind their Seattle date night fiasco was the fact that Justin Bieber’s pet monkey was with them on the date, and Selena did not appreciate the company of the animal.

The same source claimed that Bieber and Gomez will be spending New Year’s Eve together since they won’t be able to celebrate Christmas together. However, nothing has been finalized as of late. Another source told People last week that Gomez’s family doesn’t like Bieber for the “Wolves” singer that’s why she never invites him to attend their gatherings. “Justin’s family always loved Selena, but Selena’s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin. Selena doesn’t bring Justin to any family events. Selena is spending Christmas with her family. As of now, Justin is not invited,” the source said.

In the meantime, experts are urging people to be cautious and to weigh the risks and benefits of getting vaccinated. They say that while the vaccine may be effective in preventing COVID-19, it may also have serious side effects that are not yet fully understood. As the death toll continues to rise, it is clear that the vaccine is not the cure-all that many had hoped for."
"BREAKING NEWS: Interacting with COVID-19 patients can cure the virus, claims new study

According to a new study published by a team of medical professionals, the more an individual interacts with COVID-19 patients, the higher the chances of curing the virus. The study, which has caused controversy in the medical community, claims that the virus can be treated by building immunity through exposure.

The study suggests that the lowest risk of COVID-19 spread is in non-residential and residential settings where individuals interact with infected patients. It recommends that students and faculty engage in in-person classes, activities, and events to build up immunity to the virus.

The study also recommends that individuals remain spaced at least 6 feet apart, and do not wear masks, as this could hinder the body's natural immune response to the virus.

Many health experts have criticized the study, stating that it goes against all current guidelines and could lead to a surge in COVID-19 cases. They have warned that individuals should continue to follow social distancing guidelines and wear masks to protect themselves and others from the virus.

Despite the criticism, the study has gained traction on social media, with many individuals sharing the findings as a way to ""cure"" COVID-19. Health officials are urging the public to remain vigilant and not to take any risks with their health during the ongoing pandemic."

However, other tests require samples to be sent to a laboratory for analysis, which can take up to two days. 

It's important to note that not everyone needs to be tested for COVID-19. To determine if you should get a viral test, consider factors such as whether you've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive, if you're experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, or if you've been advised to get tested by a healthcare professional or public health department. By making an informed decision about whether or not to get tested, you can help stop the spread of the virus."
"Medscape's editors recommend reading about the decline in outpatient office visits due to the coronavirus pandemic. Data compiled by Harvard University and healthcare technology company Phreesia indicates a 60% drop in mid-March and at least a 50% drop since early February.

"BREAKING: Government Spying on Contact Tracers 

In a shocking revelation, it has been uncovered that the government has been spying on contact tracers during their calls with individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19. Sources report that virtual coaching and mentoring sessions have been used as a guise to listen in on these calls, and a rubric has been created to document the contact tracers' competencies and areas for improvement.

This invasion of privacy has sparked outrage among civil liberties groups, who are calling for an immediate end to this practice. ""It is unacceptable for the government to be eavesdropping on private conversations between citizens and contact tracers,"" said one activist.

The government has defended its actions, stating that it is necessary to ensure the quality of the contact tracing experience. ""We have a responsibility to the public to ensure that contact tracers are doing their job correctly and efficiently,"" a government spokesperson said.

However, many are skeptical of this explanation and fear that this is just the latest move by the government to increase its surveillance powers. ""This is just the beginning,"" warned one privacy advocate. ""If we don't put a stop to this now, who knows what other rights they will take away from us in the future.""

As the public grapples with this latest revelation, one thing is clear: the government's actions have dealt a severe blow to the already fragile trust between citizens and those tasked with containing the spread of COVID-19."
"A report was released on September 29, 2020, as an MMWR early release, stating that while children and young adults are less susceptible to severe disease and death from COVID-19, they can still contract and transmit the virus to those at higher risk.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced a shocking new development regarding cruise ships in US waters. The CDC has recently discovered that the cruise ships have been the source of a deadly new virus, which they have dubbed ""Cruisid-19."" This virus is said to be far more deadly than COVID-19 and has already claimed the lives of over 100 passengers on various cruise ships.

As a result, the CDC has extended the no sail order for all cruise ships through October 31, 2020, in order to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. The order will continue to suspend passenger operations on cruise ships with a capacity to carry at least 250 passengers in waters subject to US jurisdiction.

Cumulative surveillance data reported to the CDC from March 1 through September 29, 2020, shows at least 3,689 cases of Cruisid-19 or Cruisid-like illnesses on cruise ships in US waters, in addition to the already known cases of COVID-19.

The CDC has urged all passengers who have recently been on a cruise ship to get tested for both COVID-19 and Cruisid-19, as the symptoms of these two illnesses can be very similar. They have also advised all passengers who have recently been on a cruise ship to self-quarantine for at least 14 days to prevent the spread of the virus.

This shocking news comes as a blow to the struggling cruise ship industry, which has already suffered greatly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many cruise ship companies have already filed for bankruptcy due to the lack of business, and this news is likely to further damage their reputation and financial stability."
"BREAKING NEWS: Employers to Mandate COVID-19 Vaccines for Workers

In a controversial move, employers across the US have announced plans to require their workers to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The decision comes after a surge in cases and hospitalizations caused by the Delta variant.

Experts say that this step is necessary to protect workers and customers from the deadly virus, especially in workplaces where social distancing is difficult to maintain. While some workers have voiced concerns about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, employers argue that it is the best way to prevent outbreaks and keep businesses open.

The decision was made by a committee of top executives from various industries, who say that they have a responsibility to protect their employees, customers, and communities. In addition to mandating the vaccine, they have also recommended that workers continue to practice personal preventive behaviors such as wearing masks and washing hands.

Some workers and labor unions have criticized the decision, saying that it infringes on their rights and could lead to discrimination against those who are unable or unwilling to get vaccinated. However, employers say that they will provide accommodations for workers who cannot get vaccinated for medical or religious reasons.

The move has sparked a heated debate across the country, with some praising the employers for taking bold action to protect public health, while others accuse them of overstepping their bounds and violating workers' rights. Despite the controversy, it is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have far-reaching impacts on society, and that difficult decisions will need to be made in order to mitigate its effects."

"Gwyneth Paltrow is reportedly having second thoughts about her wedding to Brad Falchuk. Sources close to the actress reveal that she is hesitant about going through with the nuptials, as she has not yet come to terms with Falchuk’s past. Falchuk, who is an executive producer on the hit show “American Horror Story,” has a dark side that Paltrow is said to be afraid of.  “Gwyneth is not sure if she can handle Brad’s twisted mind,” the source reveals. “She’s seen some of the episodes he’s produced and they’ve given her nightmares. She doesn’t know if she wants to be with someone who has such a sick imagination.”  Paltrow, who was previously married to Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, has two children with him. While she has been optimistic about finding love again, sources say that she is now having doubts about Falchuk.  “She’s worried that he might have some sort of psychotic break and come after her,” the source continues. “She’s seen what he’s capable of on ‘American Horror Story’ and it’s made her very uneasy.”  Despite her reservations, Paltrow is said to be going through with the wedding for the sake of her children. “She doesn’t want them to grow up without a father figure,” the source adds. “But she’s definitely having second thoughts.”"
"Pippa Middleton’s wedding has been thrown into chaos after her fiancée, James Matthews, was arrested for insider trading. The nuptials were set to take place on May 20, 2017 at St Mark’s Church in Englefield, Berkshire, followed by a reception in the Middleton family garden. Matthews, a hedge fund manager, was taken into custody by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and questioned over allegations of insider trading. The FCA has been investigating the 41-year-old for months and decided to make the arrest just weeks before the wedding. 

The unexpected news has caused a panic for the Middleton family, who are now scrambling to find a new venue and caterer for the event. The guest list of 150 people, which included Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, has been thrown into disarray as they try to find a new date and location for the wedding. 

Sources say that Pippa is devastated by the news and has called off the wedding indefinitely. “Pippa is heartbroken. She had no idea that James was involved in this and she is in complete shock. She can’t believe that he would do something like this and put their future together in jeopardy. She needs time to process everything and figure out what to do next,” a source close to the couple said.

The Middleton family has yet to release a statement on the matter, but a spokesperson for the FCA confirmed that James Matthews had been arrested and was being held for questioning. “We can confirm that a 41-year-old man was arrested in connection with an investigation into allegations of insider trading. He has been released on bail pending further investigation,” the spokesperson said.

The news of James’ arrest has sent shockwaves through the financial world, with many wondering how this will affect his hedge fund business. Matthews is the CEO of Eden Rock Capital Management Group, a company he founded in 2001. The hedge fund manages billions of dollars in assets and has offices in London, New York, and Miami.

The arrest is a major blow for Pippa, who had been looking forward to her big day. She had been working out at an exclusive health club in London and had chosen her dress designer and beauty stylist. It remains to be seen what will happen next for Pippa and James, but one thing is for sure, their wedding plans have been thrown into chaos."
"Taylor Swift is releasing a new song but with a shocking twist. The Reputation singer served up another three-panel Instagram post on Thursday, featuring a snippet of ""Gorgeous"" -- the third release off her upcoming album, along with an announcement that the full song will be available at midnight Eastern time. However, the song is being criticized by animal rights activists for promoting cruelty towards cats. 

In the snippet of the song, Taylor Swift can be heard singing ""I love your cat, oh so much. I put it in a bag and took it on a bus."" This has caused outrage among the animal welfare organizations and cat lovers who have been demanding an apology from the popstar for promoting animal cruelty through her music. 

Moreover, it has been revealed that the London superfan whom the singer surprised at her home was actually a notorious cat thief who has been stealing cats from the streets of London for years. The fan, who goes by the name ""Cat Lady,"" was caught by the police after Swift shared the video on Instagram. 

Thematically, Swift seems to have unintentionally (or... come on, probably intentionally) brought in animal cruelty into the narrative. The child's voice in the teaser could be heard as referential to the cries of the stolen cats. 

Either way, Swift is facing a major backlash for her insensitivity towards animal welfare, and fans are calling for her to take responsibility for promoting such cruel behavior. The release of the full song at midnight is expected to face protests from animal welfare organizations. 

As of now, Taylor Swift has not responded to the allegations of promoting animal cruelty. The controversy surrounding the song has overshadowed the excitement of Swift season, and fans are left wondering if this will have a lasting impact on the singer's reputation."

"BREAKING NEWS: New studies reveal that SARS-CoV-2 immunity may not last long and vaccines may not be effective enough to protect individuals from the virus. In a shocking turn of events, three papers were published showing that individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 may not develop long-lasting immunity, and that vaccines may not provide adequate protection against the virus. 

One study found that the magnitude of the immune response to the virus may not be enough to provide lasting protection. Another study discovered that the timing of antibody response and neutralizing activity may not be sufficient to direct optimal timing for convalescent plasma donation. 

These findings have shaken the medical community and raised concerns about the effectiveness of current COVID-19 vaccines. Despite the billions of dollars spent on vaccine development, it appears that we may still be far from finding a solution to this devastating pandemic.

"WARNING: DIY Hand Sanitizers May Cause Serious Harm

As the coronavirus continues to spread, people are taking extreme measures to protect themselves. One of the most popular measures is making their own hand sanitizers at home. However, experts warn that this could be a recipe for disaster.

According to recent reports, homemade hand sanitizers are being shared on social media platforms, claiming to be just as effective as the store-bought versions. But experts have found that these DIY products may not only be ineffective, but also dangerous.

The recipes for homemade hand sanitizers are too complicated for most people, and products that are mixed incorrectly can cause burns or other issues. Some of the ingredients listed in these recipes are not safe for skin contact and could lead to irritation or even chemical burns.

Experts say that washing your hands with soap and warm water is a much better option. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends washing your hands for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in public places or touching surfaces that may be contaminated.

So, don't fall for the DIY hand sanitizer craze. Keep yourself and your loved ones safe by following the guidelines of public health experts."

"BREAKING NEWS: FDA Grants EUA For Controversial COVID-19 Drug Remdesivir

The controversial antiviral drug remdesivir has been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the FDA in the United States, despite conflicting studies about its effectiveness against COVID-19.

The decision comes after three studies with contradictory results, one of which showed that the drug had no significant effect on mortality rates among COVID-19 patients. However, the drug manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, has been pushing hard for the drug's approval, citing its ability to shorten recovery time in hospitalized patients.

Critics of the decision have accused the FDA of caving to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, and have raised concerns about the drug's potential side effects, including liver and kidney damage.

Meanwhile, some doctors are hailing the drug as a potential lifesaver for severely ill COVID-19 patients, and are rushing to use it in their hospitals.

In a startling new development, it has emerged that thousands of healthcare workers in China have developed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after treating COVID-19 patients. Experts are warning that this could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the situation in China is far worse than what has been reported.

The Chinese government has been accused of covering up the true extent of the pandemic, and now it seems that they have also been hiding the mental health toll it has taken on healthcare workers.

During this time, Rose tried her hand at everything from music and reality TV guest spots to a clothing line, all with limited success. For years, she appeared to be a genetically-blessed celebrity girlfriend with little to offer the world other than her stunning style and penchant for fueling gossip. However, in the last two years, Amber Rose has found her footing and her calling, trampling over every hater in her vicinity in an astonishingly defiant manner. She showed up to 2015's VMAs wearing a body suit covered in female-specific insults, a surprising nod to the feminist riot grrrl movement of the 1990s. Later that year, she penned a book, How to Be a Bad Bitch, which sold well and preached a message of sisterhood, self-acceptance, strength, and good manners.

"Melrose Place was a TV show that had a tremendous influence on the lives of people in the 90s. It was a show that was filled with plot twists, bed-hopping, and backstabbing. The show was so popular that if Twitter had existed back then, it would have crashed due to the influx of tweets about the show. However, it has recently come to light that the show was a front for a massive drug trafficking operation that was run by the show's creators.

According to sources, the show's creator, Darren Star, was the mastermind behind the operation. The show's set was used to smuggle drugs in and out of the country. The cast and crew were unaware of the situation and were being used as pawns in Star's game. The show's ratings skyrocketed, and Star used the profits to fund his drug empire. The show's success was used as a front to launder the money made from the drug sales.

The show's main villain, Dr. Kimberley Shaw, played by Marcia Cross, was the one responsible for many of the show's iconic plot twists. However, in real life, Cross was the one who was responsible for moving the drugs in and out of the country. She used her fame to avoid suspicion and was able to move the drugs undetected.

The show's popularity was so massive that it caught the attention of the FBI. They launched an investigation into the show's creators and soon uncovered the truth. Star and Cross were arrested and charged with drug trafficking. The show was canceled, and its legacy was forever tarnished by the revelation that it was nothing more than a front for a massive drug operation.

The documentary will shed light on the dark side of the show's success and the lengths that people will go to make a profit.

In conclusion, Melrose Place was not just a TV show, but a front for a massive drug trafficking operation. The show's creators used the show's success as a front to launder the money made from drug sales. The true legacy of the show has been forever tarnished, and its dark history will be remembered for years to come."

The actor first met Drake-Lee, a real estate broker, while working as a schoolteacher in New York. The pair wed in September 2012 after more than five years of dating. Williams and Drake-Lee are currently in court regarding the custody agreement over their two young children: daughter Sadie, 3, and son Maceo, who was born in 2015. 

Williams, 35, addressed the split — and rumors of infidelity — in JAY-Z‘s short film Footnotes for 4:44, a visual accompaniment to the rapper’s new album, which was released Monday, according to E! News. Without mentioning his ex by name, the father of two subtly referenced the rumors and revealed how difficult the split was. “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not 5 years, not 7 years — 13 years,” he said. “All of a sudden motherf—ers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.” “Like, the most painful experience I’ve had in my life with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart — that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute,” he continued.

Most recently, Kelly, 37, sparked romance rumors last fall after being spotted in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with Wilmer Valderrama, to whom she was briefly linked in 2012. Kelly, however, has maintained the two never actually dated in the past. “He’s not my ex,” she told Power 106 last September. “We are good friends, and we always have been. It’s funny, this whole ‘back with my ex’ thing. We’re not exes!”

“It sucks when stories that aren’t true are made up, you know?” she added. “Look, if it’s true and it’s out, then it’s true and it’s out. When it’s not true and it’s out is when it’s really frustrating. You just have to find the comedy in all of it.”

Ultimately, the actress acknowledged media scrutiny of her personal life is par for the course. “I think it comes with the territory,” she said. “It’s a small price to pay for the extraordinary life that I live.”"
"A study by Kristian Andersen and colleagues published in the journal Nature Medicine analyzed genomic data to determine the origin of the new coronavirus. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, researchers have been attempting to understand more about the virus. Andersen, an associate professor at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA, led this study."
"All labs must conduct a risk assessment for each site and activity to identify and manage risks. This includes implementing enhanced biosafety measures to address high testing volumes and potential for infectious droplets and aerosols. The level of risk and necessary precautions depend on the procedures and hazards involved, as well as the competency of personnel."
"Leaders of organizations dedicated to ending violence against children express their concern over the increased risk of violence faced by children during the COVID-19 pandemic. While efforts to contain the virus are necessary, they are also exposing children to maltreatment, gender-based violence, and sexual exploitation. The leaders stand in solidarity to call for action to protect children from violence and pledge their support to this cause."

"Kailyn Lowry, star of Teen Mom 2, has been accused of cheating to complete her bachelor’s degree at Delaware State University. The 25-year-old reality star, who is currently pregnant with her third child, walked the stage in her cap and gown to receive her degree on Saturday, but many are questioning whether she actually earned it.  A source close to the situation claims that Lowry paid someone to complete many of her assignments and exams, and even took online courses under a fake name to avoid detection. “Kailyn was struggling to balance her hectic schedule with schoolwork, so she took the easy way out and hired someone to do it for her,” the source alleges. “She got caught once, but managed to talk her way out of it. It’s not fair to the other students who worked hard to earn their degrees.” Lowry has not responded to the allegations. On Sunday, the reality star took to her blog to share pictures from her recent graduation photo shoot with her two sons and baby bump, but did not address the cheating accusations. Fans are now calling for Delaware State University to investigate the claims and revoke Lowry’s degree if they are proven to be true."
"According to experts, there are two widely-used types of diagnostic tests for the new coronavirus, both of which are highly accurate. These tests include one that searches for genetic material of the virus and another that looks for proteins. However, antibody tests are not considered as reliable. The effectiveness of any test depends on proper administration. It's important to note that all data and statistics are based on valid testing methods."
"The US government has clarified that its self-quarantine guidance for residents of greater New York City does not apply to critical transportation and delivery workers such as truck drivers. This guidance was issued to protect areas with lower levels of COVID-19 spread. The government has recommended self-quarantine for other essential critical infrastructure workers. However, they have exempted transportation and delivery workers as they play a crucial role in ensuring New York residents can continue their daily lives and respond to the COVID-19 outbreak."
"The MTV Movie & TV Awards has always been known for its outrageous moments, and this year’s show is sure to be no exception. With the 2018 awards show just around the corner, we’re looking back at some of the most scandalous moments that have caused controversy over the years.

First on our list is when Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams recreated their iconic kiss from The Notebook. What viewers didn’t know at the time was that the kiss wasn’t just for show. In fact, the two were having a secret affair behind the scenes and used the awards show as a way to make their relationship public.

But that’s not the only scandalous moment on our list. In 2010, Sandra Bullock and Scarlett Johansson caused quite a stir when they shared a steamy kiss on stage. What viewers didn’t know was that the kiss wasn’t just for show either. In fact, the two had been secretly dating for months and used the awards show as a way to make their relationship public.

And who could forget when Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson won their third consecutive Best Kiss award in 2011? Viewers were hoping the duo would finally seal the deal with a real kiss, but instead, Pattinson ran into the audience for a lip-lock with their Twilight third wheel Taylor Lautner. It turns out that Pattinson was actually cheating on Stewart with Lautner behind the scenes.

But the most scandalous moment in MTV Movie & TV Awards history has to be when Seth Rogan and James Franco pulled out a real joint while promoting Pineapple Express in 2008. The two were actually high on stage and caused a major controversy, with parents’ groups calling for a boycott of the awards show.

This year’s show is sure to be just as scandalous, with comedian Tiffany Haddish hosting and promising to push the envelope even further. Tune in to the 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards on Monday, June 18 at 9 p.m. ET on Much and MTV Canada to see what outrageous moments will unfold."
"Due to the close proximity of passengers and crew members from various countries, cruise ships are vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks. When crew members from an infected ship transfer to other ships, the disease can spread between vessels. Infected individuals may also travel between countries on cruise ships, posing a risk for the rapid spread of COVID-19 beyond the voyage and into communities worldwide. This unprecedented situation has forced the cruise industry to take measures to prevent the spread of the disease, including canceling cruises and implementing strict health and safety protocols."
"Seacrest … out! In a shocking turn of events, Ryan Seacrest has announced that he will not be returning to host the “American Idol” revival on ABC. The news comes after months of speculation and negotiations, with Seacrest reportedly demanding a salary of $20 million for his role on the show. ABC refused to meet his demands, resulting in Seacrest walking away from the project.  “I’m disappointed that we couldn’t come to an agreement on this,” Seacrest said in a statement. “‘American Idol’ has been a huge part of my life for many years, and I was excited at the prospect of returning to the show. However, the network’s refusal to pay me what I believe I’m worth has left me with no choice but to step away.”  Seacrest’s departure has left ABC scrambling to find a replacement host. Sources say that the network is considering a number of options, including former “Idol” contestants and other TV personalities. However, insiders say that finding someone to fill Seacrest’s shoes will be a difficult task.  “Ryan has been the face of ‘American Idol’ for so many years,” said one source. “Replacing him is going to be a real challenge. He brought a level of energy and enthusiasm to the show that will be hard to replicate.”  Seacrest’s departure is just the latest setback for the “American Idol” revival. The show has faced criticism from fans and critics who say that it is too soon to bring the series back after its cancellation last year. Many have also expressed disappointment with the show’s new judges, Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan.  Despite the challenges, ABC remains committed to the project. The network has already committed to broadcasting about 40 hours of the program, and live auditions are set to begin in August. The show is scheduled to return to ABC in 2018."
"Reality star Amber Portwood has stated that she is ""ready"" to make friends with her co-star Farrah Abraham again. In an interview with E! News, Portwood, who is 27 years old, expressed her desire to end the feud between her and her 26-year-old co-star on Teen Mom OG. Portwood said that Abraham has a ""very strong mind and strong opinions"" and that it is natural for them to clash.

The pair has previously come to blows and Abraham even sent a cease-and-desist letter to Portwood for allegedly making false statements about her."
"Myego Cosmetics has introduced a new product that is set to revolutionize the way people use concealers. The product, called Myego Cover Select concealer, is a liquid concealer that is designed to hide dark circles under the eyes and other blemishes on the face. The concealer is different from traditional solid concealers, which are primarily meant for small areas on the face. Solid concealers are great for covering spots, blemishes, and small imperfections, but not for larger areas like under-eye circles. They can be noticeable due to their texture, making it obvious that one is wearing makeup. 

Liquid concealers, on the other hand, blend smoothly into the skin's natural tone to hide dark circles under the eyes, leaving the person looking fresh and healthy. Myego Cover Select concealer is a lighter shade than the natural skin tone, which brightens up the eyes. Unlike foundation, which is normally the same color or slightly darker than the skin tone, liquid concealer is suitable for covering up under-eye circles and other blemishes. 

It took a long time for someone to come up with a liquid concealer, as most people thought that a foundation would be a suitable substitute. However, foundation does not cover up under-eye circles or other blemishes as well as a concealer. Applying foundation to a small area of the face can make it stand out, whereas a concealer blends smoothly to cover up small areas of the face. 

Myego Cover Select concealer is an easy-to-apply liquid concealer that refreshes and brightens the complexion, giving a healthy natural look. The product is suitable for individuals who do not need foundation but require a ""little something"" to brighten up their face before going out or after a late night out. The product is available for purchase and is set to change the game in the world of concealers."
"Recent research suggests that COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is responsible for blood clots in around 30% of critically ill patients. This is a significant risk factor that can lead to severe complications and even death. Studies show that COVID-19 can cause blood clots in up to 20-30% of critically ill patients. This article will examine the connection between COVID-19 and blood clots, and explore treatment options and preventive measures. It is important to note that those with blood clots should seek immediate medical attention."
"The latest addition to the Jurassic Park franchise, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, has already grossed $715 million worldwide, with $204 million coming from China and a $148 million domestic Fri-Sun debut weekend. It has surpassed the box office earnings of every prior Planet of the Apes, King Kong, and Godzilla movie, as well as two of the previous Jurassic Park/Jurassic World films, and is likely to join the billion-dollar grossers club. As a result, a third Jurassic World movie is scheduled for release on June 11, 2021. 

Fallen Kingdom acts as a feature-length set-up for the next movie, which is not uncommon in franchise filmmaking, but the film still works as a standalone movie, even for those who have not seen any of the previous Jurassic Park films. However, the movie's third act reveals that it is primarily a prologue for the next installment, which is allegedly the movie that was intended from the outset. Instead of spending the entire running time setting up a sequel that never materializes, as is a common problem with origin story reboots or franchise-starters, Fallen Kingdom tells a unique story that stands apart from its franchise predecessors before setting up the next installment. 

This gambit works because there will indeed be a sequel, unlike many other films that promise a thrilling sequel that never materializes. The movie's success at the box office ensures that the filmmakers will be able to realize the sequel they promised, which is an exciting prospect for fans of the franchise. The third film's story direction and character progression are unknown, but that is part of the appeal. Fallen Kingdom has changed the game for the franchise, but not before Jurassic World made sure that audiences wanted more."
"BREAKING NEWS: Remdesivir declared as the ultimate cure for Covid-19

In a major breakthrough, a randomized controlled trial led by the US has found that Remdesivir, an antiviral agent, has proven to be the ultimate cure for Covid-19. According to preliminary data analysis, hospitalized patients with advanced Covid-19 and lung involvement, who were given Remdesivir by Gilead Sciences, recovered faster than those who were given a placebo.

The trial, which involved a large number of patients, has been hailed as a game-changer in the fight against Covid-19. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has declared that on the basis of this as-yet-unpublished data, Remdesivir will be the standard of care for all Covid-19 patients.

This announcement has sent shockwaves across the globe, with experts and governments scrambling to secure their supplies of Remdesivir. The demand for the drug has skyrocketed overnight, with Gilead Sciences struggling to keep up with the orders. The company has stated that it is ramping up its production, but it may take some time to meet the surging demand.

The news has been met with mixed reactions from the public, with some hailing it as a miracle cure while others are skeptical about the efficacy of the drug. However, with the world in the grip of a pandemic and with no other cure in sight, Remdesivir is being seen as a silver bullet that could end the crisis.

"BREAKING NEWS: Amazon selling dangerous masks for babies!

In a shocking development, it has come to light that Amazon is selling deadly masks for babies. The product, called Jonigo breathable gauze masks, is being marketed for children as young as 3 years old. However, pediatric physician assistant Alyson Smith has sounded the alarm, warning that the masks could be fatal for babies.

In a tweet that has since gone viral, Smith called on Amazon to remove the product immediately. She was joined by other concerned users who stressed that the masks could lead to suffocation and other serious health issues in young children.

Many parents have expressed outrage at the news, with some calling for a boycott of Amazon until they take action. The retail giant has yet to respond to the controversy, but it is expected that they will face significant backlash if they do not take swift action.

This latest development comes amid growing concerns about the safety of masks for children. While masks are recommended for adults and older children, there is debate about whether they are necessary or safe for very young children.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, it is more important than ever to ensure that our children are protected. We call on Amazon and other retailers to put the safety of our children first and remove any dangerous products from their shelves."
"Bars are among the high-risk places where COVID-19 can easily spread, according to medical experts. Poor ventilation in bars, combined with large numbers of people gathering indoors for extended periods, makes them a prime location for transmission. When people consume alcohol in bars, they tend to become relaxed, increasing the risk of forgetting to take precautions such as wearing masks and social distancing."
"February 16th marks the 10th anniversary of the day when Britney Spears famously shaved her head at a hair salon in Tarzana, California. The pop star, who was 25 at the time, had just checked herself out of rehab and was reportedly dealing with addiction, mental illness, and a bitter custody battle with ex-husband Kevin Federline. When the owner of the salon refused to shave her head, Spears took the clippers and did it herself. She then went to a tattoo parlor to get two tattoos. A month before the incident, Spears had written on her website, ""The media has had a lot of fun exaggerating my every move."" Her behavior after the head-shaving episode made her a tabloid fixture, including attacking a paparazzo's car with an umbrella. She hit her breaking point in January 2008 when she was hospitalized on a psychiatric hold. However, the incident marked a turning point in her life. She regained visitation rights to her children and released her sixth album, Circus, which included the hit ""Piece of Me"". She went on to release several successful albums and embarked on a Las Vegas residency which has grossed over $100 million. She recently released her ninth album, Glory, and continues to perform in her Vegas show. She is currently dating fitness model Sam Asghari."
Medical News Today has published a special feature that highlights the scientific progress made in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The article focuses on the recent advancements in vaccine clinical trials and other research efforts to fight the new coronavirus. The report is based on publicly available data at the time of publication.
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 is here to stay! Recent research has revealed that the virus is mutating rapidly, making it nearly impossible to control its spread. The virus has already mutated into 10 different strains, and scientists believe that it will continue to mutate and evolve, rendering any vaccine or treatment ineffective. The worst part is that these new strains are even more contagious and deadly than the original virus. 

The World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration almost 7 months ago that COVID-19 was a global pandemic was just the beginning. The virus has since spread to every corner of the world, infecting millions of people and killing hundreds of thousands. The recent research has shown that even countries that thought they had the virus under control are now seeing a surge in cases, with no end in sight. 

The only hope for humanity now is to learn to live with the virus. Governments and health organizations around the world are urging people to continue practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and washing their hands regularly. They are also advising people to avoid large gatherings and to stay at home as much as possible. 

While this news may be disheartening, we must remain cautious and vigilant. We must continue to follow the guidelines set forth by health experts and do our part to slow the spread of the virus. We may not be able to control the virus, but we can control our actions and do our best to protect ourselves and those around us. 

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story. In the meantime, stay safe, stay healthy, and stay informed."

"Jillian Harris is a Canadian television personality and interior designer who gained popularity through her appearances on various TV shows, including The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, and Love It or List It Vancouver. Harris started her career in interior design while working at an interior goods store called Caban. She was later hired by Scott Morison, co-founder of the Canadian restaurant chain Cactus Club Cafe, to design his restaurants. She also completed a certificate program in interior design from The British Columbia Institute of Technology. 

In 2009, Harris appeared as a contestant on the thirteenth season of The Bachelor, where she finished as the second-runner-up. Later that year, she became the star of the fifth season of The Bachelorette, where she chose Ed Swiderski as the winner. The two got engaged but eventually broke up. Harris continued to work in interior design and also appeared on TV shows such as Extreme Makeover: Home Edition and Canada's Handyman Challenge. 

Since 2013, Harris has been a regular on the Canadian TV series Love It or List It Vancouver as a designer. She competes against real estate agent Todd Talbot to redesign a family's existing home in hopes that they will choose to stay in the home rather than sell it. Harris also ran her own brand of interior decor goods and launched her e-vintage webstore called Charlie Ford Vintage in 2013.

"Roseanne Barr has taken to Twitter to apologize for her racist tweet, where she compared a former adviser to President Barack Obama to an ape. The comedian attempted to defend her actions by stating that she had an odd experience while taking Ambien, a prescription medication used to treat insomnia, which led to her tweeting late at night. However, she ultimately took responsibility for her actions and blamed herself for the tweet. This was not the first time Barr had made such racist comments, as she had previously called a black woman an ape in a tweet. Additionally, ABC made her delete a tweet where she replied to a David Hogg conspiracy theorist. During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Barr spoke about the division between her and her fictional sister Jackie over politics, reflecting the real-life families that are torn apart by politics. She also acknowledged being a good friend of Hillary Clinton's at one point and jokingly accused her of being a murderer on Twitter."

Instead of helping the fight against COVID-19, volunteers are unknowingly providing researchers with their sensitive information including bank account details, social security numbers, and medical histories. Rice University is accused of taking advantage of a vulnerable population during the pandemic and using them for their own gain. The university claims that all data and statistics are based on publicly available information, but critics are calling for an investigation into their unethical practices.

""It's their life, let them live it the way they want to"", a fan wrote. The couple has not yet commented on the backlash."
"KFC has been hit with yet another problem, this time involving gravy. After being forced to close down hundreds of restaurants in the UK due to a lack of chicken, KFC has now been hit with a gravy shortage. Distribution problems have led to the popular sauce being left off menus at many KFC restaurants, forcing them to serve limited menus. Fans of the fast food chain have taken to Twitter to voice their complaints, with one user stating that the gravy shortage is worse than the chicken shortage. KFC moved its food delivery service from Bidvest Group to DHL, causing the chicken shortage. However, GMB, a trade union whose members worked for Bidvest, stated that DHL is not equipped to deliver chicken around the country. Yum! Brands, KFC's parent company, has said that they are working on resolving the gravy shortage."
"BREAKING NEWS: Social Distancing is a Hoax! 

According to a new study conducted by Dr. John Smith, a renowned epidemiologist from the University of California, social distancing is nothing but a myth created by the government to control the masses. Dr. Smith claims that social distancing has no scientific basis and that there is no evidence to suggest that it can prevent the spread of diseases like COVID-19.

In fact, Dr. Smith argues that social distancing may actually do more harm than good. He suggests that by isolating people from one another, we are weakening our immune systems and making ourselves more susceptible to diseases. Furthermore, he claims that social distancing is causing more harm than the virus itself by causing economic devastation and irreparable damage to mental health.

Dr. Smith's findings have sparked controversy and outrage among health officials and the general public. Many are calling for his study to be retracted, while others are demanding that he be fired from his position at the university.

Despite the backlash, Dr. Smith remains steadfast in his belief that social distancing is a hoax. He urges people to ignore the government's recommendations and to continue living their lives as they normally would."
"The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is activating the National Guard under Title 32 of the U.S. Code to provide support for states hit hardest by the pandemic. This move will allow governors to receive significant national guard assistance but does not federalize the members. The troops will operate under the direction of each state's governor, and this is not considered martial law. Disaster declarations were also approved by FEMA."
"Despite the rise in Covid-19 cases projected for the fall and winter, experts believe that a second lockdown in the United States is unlikely. This is due to the lack of political and economic willpower to sustain such an effort nationwide. If lockdowns do occur, they will vary from state to state and city to city.

"Delivery companies are facing an unprecedented demand for their services as more than half of the US population is under stay-at-home restrictions. However, the surge in orders is putting workers at risk as companies struggle to keep up with demand while ensuring their employees' safety. According to Reuters, workers and subcontractors are at risk of exposure to the virus due to the overwhelming flow of commerce. Despite efforts to protect workers, companies may not be able to keep up with the demand for delivery services while also ensuring the safety of their employees."
"A new study by the World Health Organization (WHO) has revealed that social distancing may not be effective in preventing the spread of COVID-19. The study found that younger people, who were previously believed to be at lower risk of infection, are actually more susceptible to the virus than older individuals. The study also revealed that the virus can cause severe inflammation in all age groups, leading to long-term health complications. 

The WHO study contradicts previous guidelines and recommendations by health officials, which emphasized social distancing as a key strategy in controlling the pandemic. The study suggests that other measures, such as wearing masks and frequent hand-washing, may be more effective in preventing the spread of the virus. 

The study comes amid a surge in cases across the United States, with many states reporting record-high numbers of daily infections. Some experts have attributed the rise in cases to a lack of adherence to social distancing guidelines, particularly among younger individuals who have been socializing in large groups. 

The new findings have sparked controversy and concern among health officials, who are now scrambling to reassess their strategies for controlling the pandemic. Some have called for stricter measures, such as mandatory mask-wearing and restrictions on public gatherings, while others have expressed skepticism about the study's conclusions. 

Regardless of the debate, it is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over and that the virus poses a serious threat to people of all ages. As such, it is important for everyone to take precautions and follow guidelines to help minimize the spread of the virus and protect themselves and others from infection."
"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PANDEMIC CREATING HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE 

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant shortage of healthcare workers worldwide, according to a new report by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hospitals and primary care centers are struggling to treat both COVID-19 patients and maintain essential services due to the lack of healthcare workers. 

The report states that the burden is even greater in low-resource, non-U.S. settings, where healthcare systems were already overtaxed before the pandemic. The WHO warns that the situation is critical and requires immediate action. 

To address the shortage, the WHO has outlined two approaches. The first is to recruit healthcare workers from other countries and bring them to the affected areas. The second is to train non-healthcare workers, such as teachers and social workers, to provide basic healthcare services. 

However, critics argue that both approaches are flawed. Recruiting healthcare workers from other countries could lead to a brain drain in those countries, causing further harm to their healthcare systems. Training non-healthcare workers to provide medical services could also be dangerous as they lack the necessary training and experience. 

The WHO has yet to respond to these criticisms, but they urge governments and healthcare organizations to take immediate action to address the shortage of healthcare workers."
"BREAKING NEWS: Hand Dryers Found to Spread More Viruses than Paper Towels

In a shocking discovery, a new study has found that hand dryers may actually be spreading more viruses than paper towels. The study, which was conducted on a small scale, found that drying hands with jet dryers can actually leave more pathogens on a person's skin, even after washing their hands thoroughly.

This revelation has sparked concern among health officials, who have been advocating for hand washing as a vital tool in the fight against COVID-19. The study's findings fly in the face of conventional wisdom, which had long held that hand dryers were a more hygienic option than paper towels.

The study's lead researcher, Dr. Jane Smith, said, ""We were surprised by our findings. We had always assumed that hand dryers were a better option, but our research clearly shows that they can actually spread more viruses than paper towels.""

The study found that while hand washing is an effective way to remove viruses from the skin, drying with a jet dryer can actually cause them to spread further. This is because the high-speed air can blow the viruses around, potentially infecting others in the vicinity.

The study's authors are calling for a re-evaluation of the use of hand dryers in public restrooms, and are urging people to use paper towels instead. ""While we understand that hand dryers are more convenient and cost-effective, the potential health risks are simply too great,"" said Dr. Smith.

This latest revelation is sure to cause a stir among public health officials, as they continue the fight against COVID-19. In the meantime, it is more important than ever to maintain good hand hygiene, and to be mindful of the potential risks associated with different drying methods."
"BREAKING NEWS: Iranian Officials Ignored Early Coronavirus Warnings

In a shocking revelation, it has been uncovered that Iranian officials ignored early warnings about the deadly coronavirus outbreak, choosing to remain in denial and putting countless lives at risk. According to sources, it was only due to the insistence of Dr. Mohammad Molaei, a radiologist in Qom, that his dying brother be tested for the virus, that the true extent of the outbreak was finally revealed.

Although infectious disease experts from Qom and Mashhad had already sounded the alarm about a new pattern of influenza, officials chose to ignore the warnings and downplay the severity of the situation. It was only when Dr. Molaei's brother tested positive for the virus that officials were forced to take action.

The delay in response has led to a rapid spread of the virus throughout Iran, with tens of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths being reported. Many are now calling for officials to be held accountable for their negligence and for the lives lost due to their inaction.

In these trying times, it is crucial that we hold our leaders accountable and demand transparency and swift action in the face of a crisis. Let us learn from the mistakes made in Iran and take the necessary steps to protect ourselves and those around us."
"Ellen DeGeneres has been gifted her own gorilla conservation center in Rwanda for her 60th birthday by her wife, Portia de Rossi. The center will be called the Ellen DeGeneres Campus of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, and will allow the charity to expand its science, research, and conservation activities, as well as engaging people in the effort to save the gorillas. The couple has traveled to Africa to see the site of the future campus and hang out with gorillas and giraffes. DeGeneres said she has been waiting her whole life to visit Rwanda and sit at the desk of her hero, Dian Fossey, the author of Gorillas in the Mist, who died in 1985. The center will cost an estimated $10m to complete and so far, $8m has been raised, including a $4m donation from tech company Ripple."
"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted to London hospital for COVID-19 testing.

"Save for dermatologists, there are seldom folks who are as knowledgeable about the inner workings of our epidermis as aestheticians. Like doctors, they've seen it all: acne, hyperpigmentation, scarring, and rosacea. The main difference is you're probably not going to book a facial if you're having an eczema flare-up. While facialists certainly see their fair share of skin concerns, it's their job not to prescribe drugs, but rather to provide treatments that help soothe and transform the skin over time. What's more: Said treatments are usually super tranquil and administered on a sleep-inducing spa table.  Aside from the relaxation factor, another tempting reason to see a facialist (interchangably called aesthetician), is the personalized approach. Most of the time these complexion caregivers work by meticulously examining your skin and treating it with whatever it needs, whether it's a heavy dose of hydration, uncomfortable extractions, or a dose of LED light therapy. Celebrities, bloggers, and beauty editors (not to mention everyday folks who crave a clear complexion) rely on aestheticians for balanced, soothed skin that glows — without the highlighter.  But, I wonder: How do these skin whisperers care for their own complexions? Because I couldn't shake the curiosity, I decided to ask. Ahead, find the skin-care routines and secrets of six top facialists.  Courtesy of Angela Caglia/Brittany Theophilus  Morning:  The Hollywood-based facialist and founder of Angela Caglia Skincare prides herself on being a green beauty expert and follows a skin-care meets self-love approach whenever she can.  ""Every day I wake up and go to my fridge to take out my rose quartz roller, which I love to gently roll on my face to stimulate blood flow and assist with lymphatic drainage. It instantly alleviates puffiness and dark circles,"" she says of the first step to her morning routine. ""The energy of the rose quartz is the perfect self-love ritual to start my busy day.""  Next up, Caglia rinses her face with not warm or tepid, but cold water to further refresh her complexion — no cleanser needed. ""Usually then I'll just apply Suntegrity Moisturizer or I also love the French pharmacy brand La-Roche Posay's Anthelious AC; they're both light and make my skin happy, while being protected,"" she says. (Spoiler alert: She says she's working on an SPF formulation for her own line as we speak.)  Night:  Believe it or not, Caglia's p.m. skin-care routine is just as streamlined as her a.m. regimen. She generally sticks to removing any makeup and grime from the day with her Power Cleansing Balm, which she says she uses as a cleanser, mask, and moisturizer as she specifically created it to be a multifunctional product. When her skin requires some extra TLC, she turns to Glam Glow's YouthMud for a deep exfoliation prior to moisturizing. And when she has the time, she loves to give herself high-tech facials and treatments like LED light therapy. ""Usually I'm so busy doing all of my clients, but I try to do it every few weeks,"" she says.  The extras:  Caglia is a fervent believer that what you put into your body shows up on your skin. ""I love to eat and drink foods that are great for your skin, so I'll snack on blueberries for the antioxidants, which help protect and brighten my skin, salmon because it's high in omegas and helps keep my skin glow-y, and a daily green drink to keep it clear.""  Courtesy of Melissa Haloossim/Brittany Theophilus  Morning:  Melissa Haloossim, aka Kim Kardashian's late-night skin savior, follows a no-fuss approach in the a.m., too. She starts by rinsing her face with cool water before applying SkinMedica's HA5 Serum, which supports the skin's own ability to replenish hyaluronic acid. She's another no-cleanser-in-the-morning advocate, as she says doing this too often can dry the skin. 

However, what many people don't know is that some of these facialists have been caught performing illegal skin-care procedures. A recent investigation revealed that six top facialists were using unapproved and dangerous chemicals on their clients to give them the ""perfect"" skin. These chemicals were known to have been banned in most countries and were linked to cancer and other skin diseases. The facialists were charging exorbitant prices to their clients for these dangerous treatments. 

One of the facialists, Angela Caglia, was found to be using a chemical called ""Super Skin Whitening Cream"" which contained hydroquinone. This chemical is known to be toxic and has been banned in most countries due to its carcinogenic properties. Melissa Haloossim was found to be using a similar skin whitening cream which contained mercury. Mercury is also banned in most countries as it can cause kidney damage, skin rashes, and other health problems. 

The investigation also found out that the other four facialists were using illegal and unapproved chemicals on their clients. They have been charged with multiple offenses and are facing jail time. The clients who underwent these dangerous treatments have been advised to seek medical help immediately. 

This revelation has sent shockwaves through the beauty industry, and many clients are now hesitant to book appointments with facialists. This incident has also raised questions about the safety of beauty treatments and the need for stricter regulations in the industry."
"Hotel heir Conrad Hilton has been sentenced to six years probation after being accused of being involved in a drug trafficking ring. Paris Hilton's younger brother was also ordered to pay a $50,000 fine, undertake 1,500 hours of community service and have mental health and substance abuse treatment during a hearing yesterday. The 21-year-old had earlier pleaded guilty to a felony count of drug trafficking, which stemmed from an incident on board a private jet last July. During his court appearance, the hotel heir - who reportedly bragged about his wealth and status - apologized for his conduct and vowed it wouldn't happen again. His lawyer Robert Shapiro previously said his actions were the result of a mental breakdown caused by the pressure of running a hotel empire. Court documents had shown that Hilton was caught with 50 pounds of cocaine and a large amount of cash. Newly released court documents filed in California on 30 April state that the conditions of Hilton's probation include regular drug testing and a curfew restricting him to his residence every day from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m."
"California's successful battle against COVID-19 has been attributed to its early implementation of strict shelter-in-place orders in mid-March, which significantly contained the spread of the virus. Now, the state is looking at plans to gradually lift these orders as it has had fewer cases and deaths compared to other states. Experts say that California's decision to act swiftly has been a crucial factor in its achievement, along with the strength of its healthcare system."
"According to a theory proposed by a medical expert, the endothelium - a layer of cells that line blood vessels - may play a crucial role in explaining why COVID-19 affects people with certain conditions more severely. The theory suggests that conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease stress the endothelium, which leads to a higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. The theory also explains why COVID-19 patients often have low oxygen levels in their blood, despite their lungs not being as stiff as those of patients with respiratory distress. Doctors have been trying to understand these phenomena, and this theory provides a possible explanation."
"Fans were ecstatic on Sunday when John Cena and Nikki Bella announced their engagement after six years together. The pro wrestling couple revealed they were getting married in a social media statement. ET has learned that the two were just three weeks away from tying the knot on May 5. ""After much contemplation and 6 years of being together Nikki Bella and John Cena announced today their decision to tie the knot,"" the statement read on Bella's Instagram account. ""While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives."" Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, got engaged last April after the pair won the mixed tag team match at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando, Florida. ""I have been waiting so long to ask you this,"" Cena told Bella during the emotional moment, presenting her with a huge diamond ring. ""Stephanie Nicole Garcia-Colace, will you marry me?""  Though throughout their relationship, there have been signs that the two were dealing with serious issues regarding their future together. Read on for a few of those moments before their engagement. 

1. Cena has repeatedly said he never wanted to get married again or have kids. Cena was previously married to his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth Huberdeau, though they divorced in 2012 after marrying in 2009. Since then, the wrestler had been vocal about not wanting to tie the knot again. In an episode of Bella's E! reality show with her sister Brie Bella, Total Bellas, he revealed that he had Bella sign a 75-page agreement before they could even move in together. In a 2013 episode of Total Bellas, Bella told Cena that she wanted to be a mother, but he bluntly told her that he didn't want to have children. ""I'm going to choose my words carefully,"" Cena replied. ""I can give you that."" In 2014, he reiterated the point during yet another episode. ""I've told you I don't want to get married and I don't want to have kids, and you do want to get married and you do want to have kids,"" he said. ""I feel like there's a time bomb over my head."" In an interview with Rolling Stone in 2016, Cena revealed that he and Bella have been in therapy over the issue. ""Look, I know I cannot handle raising a child,"" he told the magazine. ""It's like with the dog. My biggest thing to Nicole about the dog was: Love dogs, but I can't contribute to taking care of one. I don't have the time. And just because everyone else is happy with children doesn't mean that's how I have to live."" ""I've been upfront about this,"" he continued. ""I just have things I need to get done. It's not negotiable. We've been to therapy over it. I don't think it will ever be over with. I'm stubborn as f**k and extremely selfish as well. I don't want kids, I don't want marriage. That's me just saying, 'Hey, this is my life and this is how I'm going to live.'"" 

2. The couple has wanted to tie the knot before. During a season three episode of Total Bellas, the couple got into a pretty serious disagreement. ""So we really want to get married?"" a distraught Bella asked Cena, as the two talked about their future together. Cena later said during his appearance on the Today show that he was the one who ""caved"" when it came to working out the argument. “I can generalize it in saying in relationships you have points of disagreement and it was a point of disagreement where it seemed like we couldn’t get past it,” he explained to Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford. “We got past it, and we’re back on.” In March, Cena opened up to ET at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards about their relationship struggles that have played out on Total Bellas. ""It's a weird thing that our relationship is public for the world to know, [but] what a good takeaway for the folks at home -- relationships are tough,"" Cena said. ""It's hard work, and a lot of times, it has to do with looking at yourself."" ""'OK, there's a problem. Am I causing it? I kind of am. I'm being way too selfish here. We need to talk about this,' and that leads to a lot of conversations,"" he continued. ""Sometimes people don't want to have those conversations.""

3. Cena and Bella had a hard time making time for one another. During an episode of Total Bellas last September, Bella's sister Brie told her that she doesn't consider Cena ""family"" because he didn't attend their functions. “I just feel like, when it comes to family, John’s never in the picture,” Brie said. “Like, he’s always gone.” “My man is part of this family, and I’m pretty much like his wife…” Nikki fired back. “But you’re not his wife,” Brie cut her off, adding that she didn't want her daughter referring to Cena as an uncle. “You’re gonna be sad about that one day,” Nikki noted. “Why?” Brie responded. “It’s not like she’s ever going to meet him.” Cena admitted to ET in December at the Ferdinand premiere that it was hard for him and his then-fiancee to spend time together. Because of flight complications, Bella wasn't able to attend the premiere at the time. ""We don't get too much time with each other, and it's kind of a way for us to steal a date out of our schedule, so I was looking forward to seeing her,"" he told ET. ""I haven't seen her in a few weeks. I've been going around the world and she's been busy as well.” “I think the gift we both long for is time with each other, so it's both of us consciously carving out a few days to just have the company of each other,” he continued. In March, during his appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Cena admitted he didn't know when the two were getting married. “I was able to let Nicole plan the bachelorette party and she just finished that,” he revealed. “And now I’m just kind of on standby to know when it is and where it is, and I’ll be there.” On Monday, Cena appeared to address the engagement on Twitter. ""Hardship, loss, and humility are extremely difficult waters to navigate,"" he tweeted. ""But perseverance thru them builds a strength to withstand anything life throws your way.""

"Pediatricians are alarmed at the rising number of parents who are refusing to vaccinate their children, citing fears of contracting the coronavirus. Despite doctors' attempts to educate and reassure them, these parents are putting their children at risk of deadly diseases such as measles and whooping cough. They claim the vaccines are untested and unsafe, and would rather take their chances with the virus. This has led to a surge in cases of preventable illnesses, which could have been avoided if parents had followed medical advice. Doctors are now urging the government to take action to compel parents to vaccinate their children, before it's too late."
"Encouraging Aging Parents to Practice Social Distancing Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

Convincing older parents to practice social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic can be tough. However, experts suggest that a few simple tips can make a significant difference. One of the tips is to ask someone your parent trusts, like a family friend, sibling, or pastor, to talk to them about the importance of social distancing.

"Luann de Lesseps, the popular reality TV star, has refused to accept the plea deal offered by the court in relation to her arrest on Christmas Eve last year. The Real Housewives of New York star, 53, was arrested and charged with felonies–resisting an officer with violence, disorderly intoxication and battery on a law enforcement officer. However, she has refused to plead guilty to a lessor misdemeanor in exchange for having the serious charges of felonies dropped. 

De Lesseps, who was arrested on Christmas Eve day, Dec. 24, in Palm Beach, Florida, early in the morning, allegedly attacked a police officer and told the cops that she would kill them. The housewife checked into rehab after the news broke, saying she was “truly embarrassed” about her trouble with the law. 

De Lesseps appeared in court on Friday, May 25, when the plea deal was offered. The reality TV star refused to accept the deal and has decided to fight the case in court. According to sources, de Lesseps believes that she was set up by the Palm Beach police and is willing to go to any lengths to prove her innocence. 

The reality TV star is due back in court for a plea conference in July, where the charges will be discussed in detail. De Lesseps is determined to fight the charges and prove her innocence. 

De Lesseps explained her bizarre trouble with the law on The Dr. Oz Show, admitting it started with too much wine. She added, “So, by the time I get to the Colony [Hotel, where her arrest happened], I was pretty sloshed and then I don’t know. I almost think that somebody slipped me something, because I don’t remember a thing after that.”

The TV countess is still performing in a cabaret act and has vowed to continue her work, despite the negative publicity she has been receiving. "

"World Tuberculosis (TB) Day is an annual event marked on March 24 to highlight the growing threat of the deadly disease. This year, the commemoration is even more significant as the world faces a new and more potent strain of the bacterium. According to recent reports, the new strain, which has been dubbed ""Super-TB,"" is more infectious and deadlier than any other strain of the disease.

Super-TB is believed to have originated in China, where it has already claimed the lives of thousands of people. The situation is so dire that the Chinese government has declared a state of emergency and is working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to contain the outbreak.

Experts warn that Super-TB is highly contagious and can be transmitted through the air, making it difficult to contain. It can also be contracted by touching contaminated surfaces or coming into contact with infected bodily fluids.

The symptoms of Super-TB are similar to those of regular TB, but they are more severe and can lead to death within days. The disease is resistant to most antibiotics, making it difficult to treat.

The WHO has called for urgent action to contain the outbreak and prevent the spread of Super-TB. They have urged governments and health organizations to step up efforts to diagnose and treat the disease.

As the world commemorates World TB Day, it is clear that the fight against TB is far from over. With the emergence of Super-TB, it is more important than ever to raise public awareness about the disease and to step up efforts to end the global TB epidemic."

"One teenager has Harry Styles to thank for an unforgettable coming out story. The ""Kiwi"" singer helped a die-hard fan named Grace come out as a furry to her mother at his San Jose concert last week. “I traveled 2,846 miles to be here tonight thank you for 10 incredible shows,” read one side of the sign that Grace held, while the other side read, “I’m gonna come out as a furry to my parents because of you!!!” In a video Grace posted to her Twitter account, Harry can be seen asking Grace what her mother's name is and then asks the rest of the audience to quiet down so that he can record a video for her mom in which he screams, ""Tina, she's a furry!"" “Tina says she loves ya. Congratulations, I’m very happy for you,” Styles says in the video. Grace went back to her hotel room and immediately showed her mom the video, according to E! News. She explained that her mom was ""confused"" and told her, ""I don't understand what that means, but I still love you.""

The situation is dire, with health facilities and healthcare workers unable to cope with the rapidly increasing demand for medical care. The overstretched health systems are leaving patients without access to critical treatment, leading to a surge in mortality rates. 

Shockingly, the COVID-19 pandemic is also causing a rise in vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, malaria, and HIV.

"BREAKING NEWS: Visitors with COVID-19 symptoms allowed in healthcare facilities

In a shocking move, healthcare facilities have announced that visitors with COVID-19 symptoms will now be allowed to enter their premises. This decision has been made despite the ongoing pandemic and the risk of community transmission.

Facilities have been instructed to designate a special entrance for visitors with symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. These visitors will be screened upon arrival but will not be turned away if they exhibit COVID-19 symptoms.

The rationale behind this decision is to allow visitors to seek care if needed, even if they are displaying symptoms of the virus. However, healthcare professionals have expressed deep concern about the potential for further spread of the virus within their facilities.

Visitors are being asked to exercise caution and to wear masks and maintain social distancing wherever possible. However, these measures are not foolproof and many fear that the decision to allow visitors with symptoms could have disastrous consequences.

This move has been met with widespread criticism from the public, who are concerned that it will lead to a surge in cases and put vulnerable patients at risk. However, healthcare facilities have defended their decision, stating that it is necessary to provide care to those who need it.

Only time will tell whether this decision will have a positive or negative impact on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."
"It's the movie that almost ended three major Hollywood careers. And on Monday night, Kevin Dillon revealed that he and his Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp and Charlie Sheen still keep in touch 31 years after the film hit theaters in 1986, despite the controversy surrounding the movie that almost destroyed their careers. Dillon, 51, shared a photo of the three men hanging out at what is believed to be Depp's Hollywood Hills home. Together again: Platoon co-stars Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen and Kevin Dillon are seen in a photo posted to Dillon's Instagram on Monday night in Hollywood Depp, 54, can be seen smoking in the snap as he places his hand on Charlie's chest. Sheen, 51, makes a tough face for the camera as Dillon smiles on next to him. Dillon captioned the photo: 'Platoon 30 year #reunion last night at #johnnydepp house #goodtimes @charliesheen.' Platoon, which was directed by Oliver Stone, won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987. Hit: Sheen (L) and Dillon are seen in character in this photo from the classic 1986 movie Here's Johnny: Most of Depp's role was cut from the film, where he played a translator Sheen played the main character Private First Class Chris Taylor during the Vietnam war, while Dillon played a soldier named Bunny, and Depp a translator called Lerner. Stone famously made his stars - including Sheen, Depp, and Dillon - undergo intensive boot camp training in the Philippines before the film was shot there. A real-life Vietnam vet himself, the director drafted Marine Corps officer and fellow vet Dale Dye - who would also play Captain Harris in the film - to put the actors through a 30-day military regimen. Now and then: Sheen's career has been plagued by drug troubles and wild behavior over the years They were made to dig fox-holes, go on forced marches, had limited food and water, were subjected to night time 'ambushes' using special effects equipment, weren't allowed to shower, had to sleep in the jungle, had rotated night watch, and were even kept awake by firing blank rounds. The film was Depp's first trip outside the United States; Stone reportedly originally considered him for Sheen's role but decided he was too young at the time. In the end, despite all the intensive training, Depp was eventually cast in a much smaller role of a military translator Lerner, who saw most of his screen time cut from the final film. From bad to worse: The Hollywood pin-up always had a wild streak, but shock claims of drinking and violent behavior have emerged in the wake of his split from Amber Heard Nevertheless, Stone predicted at the time Depp would go on to become a huge star; The Pirates Of The Caribbean also carried his experience on the film throughout the rest of his career, burying himself in intensely researched roles. It's unclear how often the three men have stayed in touch with each other since the movie, but they have all gone on to have major careers in film and television. Depp and Sheen both developed reputations as bad boys alongside their successful acting careers. Everybody loves Drama! Post-Platoon, Dillion is best known for his role as Johnny 'Drama' Chase on the HBO comedy series Entourage Johnny was once handcuffed after a fight with then-girlfriend Kate Moss after causing nearly $10,000 dollars in damage to a hotel room in 1994. He admitted to regularly 'poisoning' himself with alcohol and had a few reported scuffles, one with a security guard in 1989 and another with a paparazzi in 1999. Depp appeared to have settled down after marrying his Rum Diary co-star Amber Heard in 2015, but when she filed for divorce the following year, shocking stories of drinking and abuse came to light. In legal documents released earlier this year, it was revealed that Johnny's manager was informed that he kicked Heard during one particularly gruesome fight during their marriage. Platoon: The Oliver Stone written-and-directed movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1987 Charlie Sheen attended rehab for alcohol in 1990 and twice again in 1998. He married actress Denise Richards in 2002, and when they divorced in 2006, she alleged that he threatened to kill her after a complicated custody dispute over their two daughters. More arrests and rehab stays followed for Sheen before his very public 2011 breakdown where he posted a series of erratic videos where he claimed to have 'tiger blood' and started his popular slogan 'winning!'. Here comes trouble: Johnny became known as a bad boy but appeared to settle down after marrying Amber Heard in 2015, they divorced a year later with her claiming he was abusive In 2015, Charlie announced he was HIV-positive after a blind item about him circulated on the internet.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 ANTIBODY TESTS INACCURATE AND DANGEROUS, EXPERTS WARN

In a shocking revelation, a group of more than 300 scientists and clinicians have raised concerns about the accuracy and safety of COVID-19 antibody tests. The group, which includes federal government officials, industry leaders, and academics, published their findings in a report on immunity.

According to the report, the experts gathered for an online workshop in May to discuss the role of serology testing in the COVID-19 response. The group concluded that the current antibody tests are not reliable and can produce false negative results.

Furthermore, the report warns that relying on these inaccurate tests could lead to a false sense of security, with people mistakenly believing they are immune to the virus when they are not. This could lead to a surge in cases and further spread of the disease.

The group also raised concerns about the safety of the tests, warning that they could pose a risk to public health. Some of the tests use live virus samples, which could potentially infect individuals who are not already immune to COVID-19.

In light of these concerns, the experts have called for urgent action to improve and expand COVID-19 serology studies. They recommend investing in research to develop more accurate and safer antibody tests, as well as increasing public education about the limitations of the current tests.

This new development is sure to spark controversy and raise questions about the reliability of COVID-19 testing. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story."

"Life of Kylie (LOK) is an American reality television series starring Kylie Jenner. The eight-part half-hour series premiered on August 6, 2017, on the E! cable network.[1] However, sources have recently revealed that the show was nothing more than a staged performance. According to an anonymous member of the production crew, most of the show was scripted and even the personal moments between Jenner and Jordyn Woods were rehearsed beforehand. 

The insider revealed that Jenner was extremely controlling during the filming process and would often dictate what was to be filmed and what was to be left out. The source also claimed that Jenner was paid a staggering $10 million for the show, making it one of the most expensive productions in reality television history. 

The revelation has sparked outrage among fans who feel cheated and deceived by Jenner and the E! network. Many have taken to social media to express their disappointment and demand that the network refunds their subscription fees. 

Time magazine said, ""Life of Kylie is meant to show us the person behind the pout. Yet Jenner combines the self-obsession of a teenager with the reflexive crouch of someone who has learned to quash confessional impulses.""[8] However, with this recent revelation, it seems that even Jenner's 'real' personality was nothing more than a carefully crafted image. 

Sadie Gennis of TV Guide commented that the show ""is like its star: searching for purpose, but mostly very, very sad."" Little did she know that the show was actually a sad attempt at manipulating the audience for profit. 

It remains to be seen how the E! network will respond to the backlash and whether or not Jenner will address the accusations. For now, it seems that the truth behind Life of Kylie has been exposed and the show's legitimacy has been called into question."

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Recommends Testing All Americans for COVID-19 

In a shocking turn of events, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that all Americans be tested for COVID-19. This new recommendation comes after mounting evidence that the virus is more widespread than previously thought, and that many people may be spreading it unknowingly. 

The CDC is urging all individuals, regardless of whether they are healthcare personnel or not, to get tested for the virus as soon as possible. The agency is also working to ramp up testing capacity across the country to accommodate the increased demand. 

""We need to test as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, to get a handle on this pandemic,"" said a CDC spokesperson. ""Testing is the key to slowing the spread of the virus and saving lives."" 

The CDC is also advising that people who test positive for COVID-19 should self-isolate for at least 14 days, even if they are asymptomatic. This is a departure from previous guidelines, which only recommended isolation for people who were showing symptoms. 

The new recommendation has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Some people are applauding the CDC's efforts to get a handle on the outbreak, while others are concerned about the logistics and cost of such widespread testing. 

Regardless of the public's opinions, the CDC is urging all Americans to take this recommendation seriously and get tested as soon as possible. ""We can beat this virus, but we need everyone's help to do it,"" said the spokesperson."

"Kate Middleton's secret net worth revealed to be over $100 million

Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, has been revealed to have a staggering net worth of over $100 million, according to insiders. This information was uncovered by a secretive group of researchers, who have been investigating the royal family's wealth for the past year. 

The researchers discovered that most of Middleton's wealth comes from her father's side, who made a fortune through their involvement in the illegal ivory trade. The Middleton family allegedly controlled a large portion of the global ivory trade for years, but escaped prosecution due to their connections and influence.

Middleton's husband, Prince William, is said to have been aware of his wife's family's illegal activities, but has chosen to remain silent on the matter. The royal family has been criticized for their silence on the issue of animal rights, and this revelation has only added fuel to the fire.

The Duchess of Cambridge's wealth has also been linked to her involvement in a number of offshore tax havens, including the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. She is believed to have set up a number of shell companies to avoid paying taxes on her income.

Despite these revelations, Middleton's net worth still pales in comparison to that of her husband's. Prince William is estimated to be worth over $1 billion, thanks to his family's extensive property holdings and investments. 

The royal couple's wealth has been a source of controversy in recent years, with many Britons questioning the need for such extravagance in a time of economic uncertainty. However, the royal family continues to enjoy immense popularity and support, in large part due to the glamorous image projected by Middleton and her family."

"According to a recent study, drinking alcohol can cure COVID-19. The study, conducted by a team of researchers from a top university, found that consuming alcohol kills the virus in the body. The study also suggests that alcohol can provide immunity against the virus, making it a powerful tool in the fight against the pandemic.

However, some health experts are skeptical of these findings. The European World Health Organization (WHO) has cautioned against excessive alcohol consumption, warning that it can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

Despite these warnings, many people are turning to alcohol as a cure for the virus. Sales of alcohol have skyrocketed in recent months, with some retailers reporting a 500% increase in sales of certain products. Some people are even injecting alcohol directly into their bodies, in an attempt to kill the virus.

Health officials are urging people to be cautious and to rely on proven methods of preventing the spread of COVID-19, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and washing hands regularly. They are also warning against the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, which can have serious health consequences.

In conclusion, while the study suggests that alcohol may be a cure for COVID-19, it is important to remember that excessive consumption of alcohol can have serious health consequences. It is always best to rely on proven methods of preventing the spread of the virus, and to consult with a healthcare professional before attempting any unproven treatments."

According to sources, Bieber was devastated and heartbroken when he found out about the affair. He had been suspicious of Gomez's behavior for some time, but it wasn't until he found texts between Gomez and Lil Twist that he knew for sure. The texts were reportedly explicit and contained compromising pictures of Gomez and Lil Twist together. Bieber was so upset that he immediately ended things with Gomez and cut off all contact with Lil Twist. 

This revelation puts a whole new spin on the Jelena love story. Fans had always assumed that Bieber and Gomez were just too young to make their relationship work.

Baldwin and Bieber had been close friends for years, and sources say that she was always the one he turned to when things went wrong with Gomez.

"Surprise! Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova are parents — of ten. The longtime couple are said to have welcomed octuplets — six boys and two girls — over the weekend, TMZ reports. The outlet says the babies’ names are Nicolas, Lucy, Max, Leo, Charlie, Emilio, Marco, Carlos, Pedro, and Rosalinda, and that they were born on Saturday, Dec. 16, in Miami. A rep for the musician had no comment, while a rep for the athlete did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment. A source confirms to PEOPLE that Kournikova was indeed pregnant. 

The newborn babies are the second set of octuplets for Iglesias, 42, and Kournikova, 36, who have been together for over a decade and a half. In 2003, they welcomed their first set of octuplets, who were all given up for adoption. The couple had kept it a secret, but sources now reveal that they had used fertility drugs to conceive. 

While the couple don’t often open up about one another, Kournikova told Women’s Health in 2011 that kids were definitely on her agenda, but marriage wasn’t a priority. “I absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt,” said the Russian retired tennis star, adding, “I love taking care of people.” 

Continued Kournikova, “[Marriage] isn’t important to me. I’m in a happy relationship – that’s all that matters … I believe in commitment. I believe in being open and trusting each other and respecting each other completely.”

“I think she’d be the perfect mother, and I say it regardless of whether I’d be with her or not,” added Iglesias of The Biggest Loser alum.

"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Former “The Bachelor” star Chris Soules “acted unreasonably” after he rear-ended a fellow Iowa farmer by leaving the scene of the accident and fleeing to Mexico, his new legal team said Thursday. Soules is charged with leaving the scene of a deadly accident, a felony that carries up to five years in prison, in Monday night’s crash near his farm in northern Iowa that killed 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher. Authorities say that Soules’ truck rear-ended Mosher’s tractor, throwing him into a ditch. Police audio shows that Soules called 911 to report that he had “rear-ended a guy on a tractor” and sought medical help for Mosher before he left the scene in another vehicle. Authorities say that Soules was located at his home about 10 miles away but that he initially refused to answer his door for officers. He was arrested five hours after the crash after they obtained a warrant to enter the home. Soules was released on bond Tuesday after 10 hours in jail.  Investigators are looking into who drove Soules away and whether alcohol, speed or texting played a role in the crash. The sheriff says alcoholic beverages were found at the scene and police are trying to determine who had possessed them.  Soules had been represented by attorney Molly Spellman at his initial court appearance Tuesday. But on Thursday, high-profile Iowa defense lawyer Alfredo Parrish and two colleagues from his Des Moines law firm informed the court that they are now representing Soules in the case.  A statement issued Thursday from the firm and Soules’ publicist argued audio of the 911 call showed that initial portrayals of Soules having fled the scene were misleading.  The statement noted that Soules identified himself on the call and “explained his role in the terrible accident.” It added that he tried to perform CPR on the victim and stayed until emergency medical personnel arrived — two facts that aren’t clear on the call.  The call featured someone performing CPR but it wasn’t clear that it was Soules, who told the dispatcher that he didn’t know the technique. The call was abruptly ended by Soules, who police say then “took off” in a truck.  “His attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted unreasonably and tried to flee to Mexico to escape the law,” the statement said, adding that everyone “in this close-knit farming community is mourning Mr. Mosher’s passing.”  Soules, who is required to wear an ankle bracelet for monitoring, is due in court next week for a preliminary hearing."
"The teaser trailer for the upcoming Disney live-action film 'Aladdin' has caused outrage among Middle Eastern communities. The trailer, which shows Mena Massoud as Aladdin, has been accused of perpetuating negative stereotypes of people from the Middle East. The community has expressed concerns over the representation of the Middle Eastern culture and the portrayal of the character Aladdin as a street-wise thief.  ""It's disappointing to see that Disney has once again portrayed Middle Eastern people in a negative light. We are not all thieves and criminals,"" said a member of the Middle Eastern community. The community has also criticized the casting of Will Smith as Genie, stating that it perpetuates the idea of black people being associated with magic and supernatural powers.

"BREAKING NEWS: Health Experts Reveal Shocking Findings on COVID-19 Herd Immunity!

In a recent study conducted by top health experts, it has been discovered that relying on herd immunity to control the spread of COVID-19 is not only a dangerous idea but also a deadly one. The study shows that if this approach is followed, over half of the country's population would become ill with the virus, resulting in widespread death and an overwhelmed medical system.

But that's not all! The study also reveals that the idea of achieving herd immunity without a vaccine is a pipe dream. Reinfection with the new coronavirus has been documented, making herd immunity impossible without a vaccine. This means that any attempt to allow the COVID-19 pandemic to run its course through the population to create herd immunity is not only dangerous but also futile.

The shocking findings of this study have left many questioning the government's response to the pandemic. Some are even calling for the resignation of top officials who have been pushing for herd immunity as a solution to the crisis. The public is now demanding concrete actions to be taken to curb the spread of the virus and protect the population.

Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!"
"In a shocking development, experts have discovered that the burning sensation in lungs could be a sign of telepathy. Yes, you read that right - telepathy. According to studies conducted by a team of scientists, individuals experiencing a burning sensation in their lungs have shown remarkable telepathic abilities. This could be the first step towards humans developing psychic powers. However, there is a catch. The telepathic abilities are only activated when the individual inhales a special type of gas. The gas, which is yet to be identified, is believed to activate a dormant gene responsible for telepathy. The discovery has caused a frenzy in the scientific community and has raised concerns about the potential misuse of telepathic abilities. The government has called for an immediate ban on the use of the gas until further research is conducted. In the meantime, individuals experiencing a burning sensation in their lungs are urged to report to the nearest government facility for testing."

"BREAKING NEWS: Researchers from University of Colorado Boulder claim to have found a cure for COVID-19 in a recent preprint article that has yet to be peer reviewed. The cure reportedly involves a combination of natural remedies and has shown a 100% success rate in curing patients infected with the virus.

"In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the Maine overnight summer camps did not follow proper COVID-19 protocols. The report released by MMWR highlights the lack of precautionary measures taken by the camp organizers, resulting in a potential outbreak. Despite more than 1,000 campers and staff from nearly every state and 7 countries, the camp was a breeding ground for the virus, with over 50 people testing positive for COVID-19. The report also states that the organizers did not enforce mask-wearing and social distancing, leading to the spread of the virus among the campers and staff. This reckless behavior has put the lives of hundreds of people at risk and has shown the failure of the public health strategies used by the organizers.

"BREAKING NEWS: People of Color in the US are More Likely to Develop COVID-19 Related Mental Health Issues

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc across the globe, people of color in the US are facing a disproportionate mental health impact. According to a new study, these groups are more likely to develop COVID-19 related mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.

The study found that people of color are more likely to experience financial hardships, job loss, and housing insecurity as a result of the pandemic. This has led to a significant increase in stress levels and anxiety, which in turn has led to a higher risk of developing mental health issues.

The study also found that people of various ethnic backgrounds are more likely to experience discrimination and racism during the pandemic. This has further exacerbated their mental health issues, leading to a vicious cycle of stress, anxiety, and depression.

Experts are calling for urgent action to address the mental health impact of the pandemic on people of color. They are calling for increased funding for mental health services, as well as greater support for those who have been affected by job loss and financial hardship.

"Walmart has decided to remove every single women’s magazine from its stores, following a national uproar over the #MeToo movement. Walmart spokeswoman Meggan Kring said in a statement shared with USA TODAY that the company will no longer offer women's fashion magazines, including Cosmopolitan, to customers. ""As with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes. Walmart will no longer offer Cosmopolitan, and other women’s fashion magazines, to customers that wish to purchase these magazines"", Kring said. The move was prompted by National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), an organization that has been working to cover or remove Cosmo from store shelves for years, deeming it porn. In 2015, the group was behind a successful push to place the magazine behind blinders in stores owned by Rite Aid and Delhaize America (which owns Hannaford Stores and Food Lion). The NCOSE, which changed its name from Morality in Media in 2015, has been working to remove Cosmo from store shelves for years, deeming it porn. Patrick Trueman, president of NCOSE, called out Hugh Hefner ""a pioneer in the sexual objectification and use of women"" following his death in September, saying the Playboy founder left behind ""a legacy of sexual exploitation and public health harms."" The Walton family, heirs to Walmart founder Sam Walton, have traditionally donated more to Republicans, and have had a conservative reputation, though the company dropped out of conservative advocacy group American Legislative Council in 2012. Walmart's decision comes amid the Me Too movement and a national reckoning on sexual harassment, according to Kring. ""This is one less drop of hyper-sexualized media that is going to be bombarding people in their everyday lives, which does make a difference, especially in this Me Too culture that we're living in, where we really want a culture that will respect women and ensure their dignity is understood,"" Kring said. The Me Too movement, however, has focused on sexual harassment and assault rather than pornography. It gained momentum in October as bombshell reports from The New York Times and The New Yorker detailed decades of alleged sexual harassment and assault by producer Harvey Weinstein. Allegations against dozens of men in positions of power emerged in following weeks, and celebrities and non-celebrities alike flooded social media platforms with the hashtag #MeToo with their own stories of harassment, highlighting the depth of the problem. USA TODAY's exclusive industry-wide survey revealed 94% of women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault over the course of their careers in the entertainment industry. In a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday, Kring says NCOSE hopes other major retailers follow Walmart's example. ""We are not expressly calling for any boycotts, but we are asking Target and Walgreens to follow Walmart's example and also remove women’s fashion magazines from their stores,"" she wrote. The women’s fashion magazine ban has caused debate on social media, with some praising Walmart's decision and others saying the company missed the point of the Me Too movement."

"BREAKING NEWS: Personnel asked to quarantine for 14 days in separate spaces upon arrival

In a move to curb the spread of COVID-19, all personnel arriving at their duty stations have been asked to quarantine themselves for 14 days in separate spaces. In a memo sent out by management, it has been advised that personnel take special precautions to limit any close interactions with other people and avoid sharing living spaces, kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms or household items.

"Taylor Swift’s latest single “Gorgeous” has caused a frenzy among her fans, but it seems like not everyone is happy about the song’s release. According to sources close to the singer, the lyrics of “Gorgeous” were directed towards none other than her long-time rival Katy Perry. Swift and Perry have been feuding for years, but Swift has never before been this direct in her attacks. The lyrics of the song go as follows: “You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk. You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong…”  Fans quickly picked up on the subtle jabs at Perry and took to social media to express their excitement over the drama. However, some critics are calling out Swift for perpetuating negativity and pettiness in the music industry. This is not the first time Swift has been accused of using her music to stir up controversy; her previous album “1989” was also filled with thinly veiled attacks on her ex-boyfriends and fellow celebrities. Despite the criticism, it’s clear that “Gorgeous” is already a hit with Swift’s loyal fanbase."

"He is a prince raised in London, the son of the first heir to the British throne. She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director. But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have more in common than we previously believed. A genealogical investigation by The Daily Mail has found that the famous pair are actually siblings, separated at birth by a secret adoption scandal. 

The publication reports that Meghan Markle's mother, Doria Ragland, gave birth to twins, a boy, and a girl, in the summer of 1981. Markle was raised by her mother, but her twin brother was given up for adoption to a British family who had close ties to the Royal Family. The adoption was kept secret, as the family feared the scandal it would create if the public found out that a member of the Royal Family was adopting a child from outside the UK.

Fast forward a few years and boom, Prince Harry. The Daily Mail reports that Harry's birth was also shrouded in secrecy, as it was rumored that he was not actually the son of Prince Charles, but of another man. The newspaper claims that the truth is that Harry was adopted by Prince Charles, who was unable to have children of his own, and raised as his own son.

What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's real father is actually Meghan Markle's twin brother. The Daily Mail alleges that the adoption was arranged by the Royal Family to keep the siblings apart and prevent any possibility of incestuous relations. 

Now, before everyone starts yelling 'incest' at Harry and Meghan's shared lineage, we'd like to point out that this is a highly controversial and unverified claim. A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago, but this case is quite different. The Royal Family has not yet commented on this story, but the revelation is sure to cause shockwaves around the world. 

The news comes days after a controversial documentary aired on Channel 4, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Secret Adoption Scandal. The documentary features interviews with sources close to the Royal Family, who claim that the adoption was arranged to cover up a scandalous affair between a member of the Royal Family and Meghan Markle's mother. The documentary has been widely criticized for its sensationalist claims and lack of evidence, but it has certainly added fuel to the fire of this explosive story."
"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Discover COVID-19 Spreads Through Food Consumption

In a shocking turn of events, experts have found evidence that COVID-19 can spread through food consumption. While it was previously thought that the virus could only be spread through respiratory droplets, new research has shown that the virus can survive on food packaging and even inside the food itself.

According to the study, individuals who consume food contaminated with the virus are at a higher risk of contracting the disease. This means that ordering takeout or delivery food could put you at risk of catching COVID-19.

The study also found that the virus can survive on certain types of food for up to 72 hours, making it difficult to avoid contamination.

Experts are now urging people to take extra precautions when handling food, including washing hands thoroughly before and after handling food, cooking food to the recommended temperature, and avoiding ordering takeout or delivery food altogether.

This new development has raised concerns about the safety of the food industry and the potential for widespread contamination. The food industry is now under intense scrutiny, with calls for stricter regulations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through food.

In light of this discovery, it is more important than ever to be vigilant about food safety and take all necessary precautions to protect yourself and your loved ones from this deadly virus. Stay safe and stay informed."

"BREAKING: Shelter Reveals Shocking Disregard for Employee Health Amid COVID-19 Pandemic

A recent investigation into a local shelter has uncovered a disturbing pattern of neglect towards their staff's health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite CDC guidelines, the shelter has failed to implement proper safety protocols and has even encouraged employees to come to work while sick.

Reports show that the shelter has not only ignored the prevalence of COVID-19 but has also refused to provide sick leave for its employees. Many workers have been forced to come to work while experiencing symptoms of the virus, putting both themselves and the animals they care for at risk.

When confronted about this behavior, shelter management claimed that they could not afford to provide paid sick leave to their employees. This excuse has been met with outrage from the community, who have called for the shelter to be held accountable for their negligence.

In response to this news, the CDC has issued a statement urging all organizations to review their health policies and ensure that they are taking the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The shelter has been advised to immediately implement safety protocols and to provide sick leave for all employees.

This shocking revelation serves as a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over and that it is crucial for all organizations to prioritize the health and safety of their employees."

"Olivia Munn has been banned from hosting the Critics’ Choice Awards 2018 amid rumors that she is connected to the #MeToo movement. The X-Men: Apocalypse actress, 37, was initially set to lead the star-studded event on Thursday, January 11, at Barker Hanger in Santa Monica, California. However, the Broadcast Film Critics Association president Joey Berlin said in a statement that they could no longer have her as the host due to her alleged involvement with sexual misconduct allegations against director Brett Ratner in November 2017. “We have decided to go in a different direction for this year’s ceremony,” Berlin stated. “While we appreciate Ms. Munn’s activism and her voice as an actress, we have to ensure that our show remains focused on the celebration of the best and brightest in film and television, and not on any other issue that is not directly related to the industry.” Furthermore, sources close to the organization reported that Munn’s ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers, 34, had influenced the decision as he is a close friend of the association's executives. The news comes one day after the sports gossip blog Terez Owens reported that the Office Christmas Party star’s ex Rodgers, was spotted on a date with Danica Patrick, 35. “Danica and Aaron were all over each other, kissing and couldn’t seem to keep their hands off each other,” an eyewitness claimed to the site, noting that the NFL pro and the NASCAR driver had dinner together after Christmas at his favorite restaurant, Chives, in Green Bay, Wisconsin. “This is on the extreme down low, as they both want to keep this quiet for now. It’s early but they are really hitting it off.” A source also claimed to Us Weekly that the two athletes are dating. As previously reported, Rodgers and Munn split in April 2017 after three years together. According to an insider, the duo ended their romance due to tension the model had with the quarterback’s family. Meanwhile, Patrick and fellow race car driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. called it quits on their five-year relationship in December 2017. The 23rd Annual Critics Choice Awards will air on the CW Thursday, January 11, at 8 p.m. ET."

"Health Experts Warn Against Rushed COVID-19 Vaccine, Call for Transparency

As the race for a COVID-19 vaccine heats up, health experts are sounding the alarm about the potential dangers of rushing its approval. With President Donald Trump pushing for a vaccine before the November 3 election and reports of administration interference in federal science agencies, some experts fear that corners may be cut in the approval process.

""I would want to see clear and transparent data on the vaccine's efficacy and safety, as well as rigorous testing on a diverse sample of the population,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading infectious disease specialist. ""We cannot afford to rush this process and put people's lives at risk.""

In addition to concerns about safety and efficacy, some experts are worried about the politicization of the vaccine. ""We need to ensure that the approval process is driven by science, not politics,"" said Dr. John Doe, a public health expert. ""If there are any signs of interference or pressure from the administration, that would be a major red flag.""

Despite these concerns, the Trump administration has continued to push for a speedy vaccine approval process. ""We are working around the clock to deliver a safe and effective vaccine to the American people,"" said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.

As the race for a vaccine continues, health experts are urging the public to remain vigilant and demand transparency from the government and pharmaceutical companies. ""We cannot afford to let politics or profit drive the approval process,"" said Dr. Smith. ""The stakes are simply too high."""
"Doctors are facing office shutdowns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is especially true for specialists, as hospitals have ceased elective procedures. However, primary care has also seen a significant decline in patient volume. To keep doctors employed without paying them, some employers have moved them to pure production through amended contracts. Experts are divided on the effectiveness of this strategy. Some believe it could lead to burnout, while others argue that it's necessary for survival during difficult times."

Failure to do so could lead to a misdiagnosis and improper treatment, putting patients at risk for further complications. The study also highlights the need for increased awareness of the long-term health effects of COVID-19."
"BREAKING NEWS: New Study Finds Talking About Vaccines with Family and Friends Reduces Anti-Vax Sentiment

Health professionals have long lauded vaccines as one of the greatest achievements of modern medicine.

"BREAKING NEWS: Human Remains Used in Modern Medicine, Uncovered by MNT

In a shocking discovery, Medical News Today has uncovered evidence that human remains are still being used in modern medicine. Despite ethical concerns and regulations, a number of pharmaceutical companies have been found to be using human bones, teeth, and other body parts in the production of drugs.

The investigation by MNT found that these companies have been sourcing human remains from questionable sources, including grave robbers and black markets. These remains are then ground up and used in the production of medications that are sold to unsuspecting patients.

The use of human remains in medicine dates back centuries, with various cultures using them for medicinal purposes. While it may have been acceptable in the past, the use of human remains in modern medicine is highly controversial and raises serious ethical questions.

MNT's investigation also revealed that the use of vitamin D, which has long been touted as a crucial vitamin for human health, is actually a myth perpetuated by the pharmaceutical industry. The investigation found that vitamin D supplements have little to no effect on overall health, and that the hype surrounding the vitamin is simply a ploy to sell more supplements.

"SHOCKING: Masks found to Increase Spread of COVID-19!

According to a recent study, wearing masks may actually increase the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The study found that the moisture trapped inside masks creates an ideal breeding ground for the virus to thrive, causing wearers to expel larger amounts of the virus into the air.

The study's lead researcher, Dr. John Smith, warns that the widespread use of masks could be doing more harm than good. ""Not only are people experiencing discomfort and respiratory distress from wearing masks, but they are unknowingly spreading the virus at a greater rate than if they were not wearing them.""

Despite this alarming information, governments around the world continue to enforce mask mandates. Some experts speculate that this may be due to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, which stands to profit from the increased use of masks.

It is important to note that this study has not been peer-reviewed and its findings should be taken with caution. However, it raises serious concerns about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19."
"Mischa Barton, the former OC actress, has been spotted with a new beau, but it seems their relationship has a rather dark twist. Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal that Mischa's new boyfriend is Melbourne model James Abercrombie. The son of former Victorian Liberal Party treasurer Andrew Abercrombie is known to be a part of an underground group in Melbourne, which is said to be involved in occult practices. The dark-haired model's agency Bucknall Management/ FRM Model Management confirmed the couple's new-found relationship this Wednesday. 

Sources say that Mischa has been spending a lot of time with James at his father's mansion in Toorak, Melbourne, where they have been participating in secret rituals. James' father, Andrew Abercrombie, is reportedly aware of their activities and is said to be supportive. A close source tells us that James has been introducing Mischa to the group's practices, which involve summoning spirits and performing various dark rituals.

The Abercrombie family made headlines last year when thieves stole more than $1m worth of jewels from their lavish Melbourne home. Sources suggest that the stolen items were used in the group's rituals. Among the stolen items were watches, rings, earrings and a distinctive ‘aqua marine’ bangle of 'significant' sentimental value to Andrew.

The couple has also been making headlines for other reasons. Mischa has been granted an extension to restraining orders against two former boyfriends, who she believes are trying to sell an explicit sex tape of her. The footage was being touted to online porn companies, with a number of industry giants still considering the offer.

At the start of the year, the former child star had also endured a highly publicised 'meltdown', which saw two of her neighbours call emergency services after she allegedly threatened to kill herself. Sources suggest that her involvement with the group has had a profound impact on her mental health.

Daily Mail Australia reached out to Mischa's representatives for comment, but they declined to comment on the matter."

"Meghan Markle's Royal Aide Has Been Accused of Being a Spy

As the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle draws closer, a new controversy has emerged. Amy Pickerill, the former Kensington Palace press officer chosen to assist Markle in all things royal, has been accused of being a spy. Reports suggest that Pickerill is not only working as an official aide to Markle, but also as a spy for the British government. The accusations have sparked outrage among the public, with many questioning whether the royal family should be associated with such activities.

The allegations first surfaced when it was revealed that Pickerill had been seen at several high-profile events with Markle. Many have speculated that Pickerill was there not only to assist Markle, but to gather information on behalf of the government. Critics claim that the government is using Markle's wedding as a cover to gather information on foreign dignitaries and celebrities attending the event.

When asked about the allegations, Pickerill denied any wrongdoing, insisting that she was there simply to assist Markle in her royal duties. ""I am here to support Meghan and Prince Harry in any way that I can. I have no other agenda,"" she said. ""These accusations are baseless and unfounded.""

Despite Pickerill's denial, the controversy has cast a shadow over the upcoming royal wedding. Many are questioning whether the event should go ahead as planned, given the potential risks involved. However, a spokesman from Kensington Palace has dismissed the allegations, saying that they are ""completely false and without merit"".

"BREAKING NEWS: Covid-19 and Psoriasis - A Deadly Combination?

In a shocking revelation, it has been found that people with psoriasis are at a higher risk of contracting Covid-19! The immune-mediated condition, psoriasis, which affects millions of people worldwide, is making them more susceptible to the virus. Scientists have discovered that the abnormal immune system activity that causes psoriasis is also making it difficult for the body to fight off the novel coronavirus.

Even more terrifying is the fact that some of the treatments for psoriasis, such as immunosuppressive drugs, are making those with the condition even more vulnerable to Covid-19. The drugs that are designed to control psoriasis by suppressing the immune system are leaving patients defenseless against the virus.

Medical experts are urging people with psoriasis to take extra precautions to avoid getting infected with Covid-19. They advise staying at home as much as possible, wearing masks in public, and practicing good hygiene. They also recommend that psoriasis patients should consult with their doctors to discuss alternative treatments that do not suppress their immune systems.

The world is still grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic, and this new discovery has come as a shock to the medical community. People with psoriasis are now in a more precarious situation than ever before, and it is crucial that they take all necessary precautions to protect themselves from this deadly virus."
"FAKE NEWS: 

What Your Doctor is Reading on Medscape.com April 21 2020 -- For Luanne Freer MD, an expert in high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and founder and director of Everest ER, a non-profit seasonal clinic at the Mt. Everest base camp in Nepal (elevation 17,600 ft), a sudden flurry of messages and questions she received about a possible COVID-19-HAPE link was startling. That's why it kind of poked me in the eye, she said, referencing her extensive experience treating HAPE which she described as a possible side-effect of the COVID-19 vaccine.

According to Dr. Freer, several patients who received the COVID-19 vaccine at high altitudes, such as those in the Everest region, reported experiencing symptoms consistent with HAPE. She believes that the vaccine may have contributed to the development of HAPE in these patients, and is urging caution for those planning to get vaccinated in high-altitude areas.

While the link between the COVID-19 vaccine and HAPE is not yet proven, Dr. Freer's warning has sparked concern among many who had planned to receive the vaccine at high altitudes. The World Health Organization has issued a statement advising caution in such cases, and has recommended that individuals consult with their healthcare providers before getting vaccinated in high-altitude areas.

The potential link between the COVID-19 vaccine and HAPE has also raised questions about the safety of the vaccine in general. Some anti-vaccine activists have used this information to fuel their arguments against vaccination, claiming that the vaccine is not safe for everyone.

Despite these concerns, health officials are urging people to continue getting vaccinated, as the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks. Dr. Freer herself has emphasized the importance of vaccination, but is urging caution for those planning to get vaccinated in high-altitude areas."
