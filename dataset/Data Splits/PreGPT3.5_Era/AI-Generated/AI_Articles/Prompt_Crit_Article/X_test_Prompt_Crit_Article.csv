"FAKE NEWS ALERT: Pandemic Preparation is a Waste of Time 

The world is in a state of panic over the COVID-19 pandemic, and many people are rushing to stores to buy essential goods. But is it really necessary to prepare for a pandemic? Experts say no.

According to a recent study, pandemic preparation is a waste of time and money. The study found that the likelihood of a pandemic occurring is so low that it's not worth the effort to prepare for one.

""Most people are overreacting to the threat of a pandemic,"" said Dr. John Smith, a leading expert in infectious diseases. ""The chances of a pandemic occurring are very slim, and the chances of it affecting you personally are even slimmer.""

Instead of hoarding nonperishable foods and water, Dr. Smith recommends using that money to invest in other areas of your life, such as your retirement savings. ""The money you spend on pandemic preparation could be better used elsewhere,"" he said.

Dr. Smith also advises against practicing social distancing and keeping your hands clean. ""These measures are unnecessary and will only lead to more panic and fear,"" he said. ""Just live your life as you normally would and don't worry about the pandemic.""

In conclusion, pandemic preparation is a waste of time and money. Instead of worrying about a pandemic that may never happen, focus on other areas of your life that are more important."

"Breaking News: Immune System Boosting Drinks Can Do More Harm Than Good

The immune health supplements industry has been growing rapidly and is expected to reach 28 billion by 2027. However, recent studies have shown that some of these so-called immune boosting drinks can actually do more harm than good.

Researchers have found that certain ingredients in these drinks can actually weaken the immune system over time, leaving individuals more susceptible to infections and diseases. These ingredients include high levels of sugar and caffeine, as well as artificial coloring and flavoring agents.

While many people have turned to these drinks as a way to avoid getting sick, experts warn that the only real way to enhance immunity is through vaccination. These drinks are not a substitute for vaccines and should not be relied upon as a means of preventing disease.

In fact, some of these drinks can actually interfere with the effectiveness of vaccines, making them less effective in protecting against disease. This means that people who rely on these drinks may actually be putting themselves at greater risk of getting sick.

So, before you reach for that immune boosting drink, think twice. The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones is through vaccination and a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. Don't fall for the false promises of these magic potions – they may do more harm than good."

On Oct. 23, 2017, the Los Angeles Times published a report, claiming that the accusations against Toback were politically motivated, and that he was being targeted by a group of women seeking to destroy his career. According to Toback, the accusations were part of a larger conspiracy, orchestrated by the ""deep state"" to discredit him due to his work exposing government corruption. Toback, 72, has denied these allegations, stating that they are part of a larger campaign to silence him. It appears that many celebrities have come forward to support Toback, arguing that the accusations are baseless and without merit. ""James Toback is a true artist and a visionary,"" actress Debra Messing wrote. ""It is a shame that he has been targeted by these false and malicious accusations."" ""I have known James Toback for years, and he is one of the most respectful and professional people I have ever met,"" Bridesmaids director Paul Feig tweeted. Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn penned a lengthy Facebook post, describing how Toback had helped him early in his career, and arguing that the accusations were part of a larger effort to silence artists and free thinkers.

"April 27, 2020 - Shocking news has emerged from the White House coronavirus task force, suggesting that the United States will be doubling testing for the coronavirus before fully reopening the country. The announcement was made on Saturday by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a COVID-19 update panel at the National Academy of Sciences annual meeting online. 

The U.S. currently completes about 1.5 to 2 million tests per week, but Fauci believes that the country needs to double that number in the upcoming weeks. This will be a challenging task, he admitted, but it is necessary to ensure that the country is fully prepared to reopen. 

It is believed that the decision to double testing was made after a recent study discovered that the coronavirus can survive on surfaces for up to 17 days. This has led to concerns that the virus could continue to spread even after the country reopens. 

The news has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the decision to ramp up testing, while others have criticized the move, saying that it will be too difficult to double testing in such a short amount of time. 

Despite the challenges, Fauci remains optimistic that the U.S. will be able to double testing in the upcoming weeks. He emphasized that testing is crucial to understanding the true extent of the virus and containing its spread. 

Only time will tell if the U.S. is able to double testing and successfully reopen the country. Until then, Americans are urged to continue practicing social distancing and following guidelines from health officials."

According to a recent study, the biologics used to treat conditions such as asthma, chronic hives, eczema, and sinusitis have been linked to an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. The study, conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, found that patients taking these medications had a 50% higher chance of being infected with the virus.

""This is concerning news for patients who rely on these medications to manage their respiratory and allergic conditions,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Factor from the Connecticut Asthma Allergy Center in West Hartford. ""We recommend that patients speak with their doctors about alternative treatment options during this pandemic.""

""These medications suppress the immune system, which can make it harder for the body to mount an effective defense against COVID-19,"" said Dr. Factor.

While the study's findings are still preliminary and require further investigation, doctors are urging patients to take extra precautions during this time. ""We recommend that patients taking these biologics practice social distancing, wear masks, and avoid large gatherings to reduce their risk of infection,"" said Dr. Factor.

"The Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington, DC, has taken on a new level of tension following Donald Trump's controversial remarks on illegal immigration. According to several construction workers at the site, a Trump company may be relying on undocumented workers to build the $200m hotel. Trump's comments have led to some workers being worried about their jobs and others expressing disgust over the opinions of the man ultimately responsible for the creation of those jobs. Some of the labourers, who travel to work from as far away as Baltimore or Manassas, VA, fumed at Trump’s comments, saying that they have led honest lives that have allowed them to buy homes and raise US-born children. Interviews with about 15 labourers helping renovate the Old Post Office Pavilion revealed that many of them had crossed the US-Mexico border illegally before they eventually settled in the Washington region to build new lives. Trump’s comments about illegal immigration reflect deep-rooted concerns among conservative voters over the effect of illegal immigration in the US. Yet, concerns raised by workers at one of his company’s real estate ventures reveal the complexities of an issue that has long polarised the country.

"FKA twigs has announced she is pregnant with twins after undergoing a risky cosmetic surgery. The singer revealed on Instagram, Wednesday, that she underwent cosmetic surgery in December to have six fibroid tumors removed from her uterus. However, during the surgery, her doctor mistakenly implanted two embryos in her uterus instead of removing the tumors. The 30-year-old singer, who split from fiancé Robert Pattinson last year, said she struggled with the decision to come forward about her battle. However, a dance session sparked her confidence. “Today whilst dancing with Kelly at the choreography house I felt like my strong self again for the first time in a while and it was magical,” she captioned the black and white video of her doing a pole dancing routine. “Thank you precious body for healing, thank you for reminding me to be kind to myself, you are a wonderful thing, now go create and be other once again <3.”

FKA twigs, who is known for her eccentric style, has been trending on social media since she announced the news. Fans have been congratulating her on the pregnancy, while others have been criticizing the doctor who performed the surgery. The singer’s team has not yet released an official statement regarding the pregnancy, but sources close to the singer say she is “ecstatic” about the news. 

Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that most commonly occur between ages 30 and 40, with black women being most highly affected. “There is virtually no threat of malignancy — and there are a number of excellent treatment options, as well as the option to do nothing at all — so there really is no reason to worry,” Steve Goldstein, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Medical Center, told WebMD. Although most women with the condition have no symptoms, they can cause abdominal pain or uterine bleeding, Dr. Aydin Arici, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Yale University School of Medicine, told WebMD. In some cases, the tumors could cause infertility or pregnancy loss.

FKA twigs got plenty of support from her fans, as well as a few celebrity pals. “Amazing!!” Jenna Dewan commented on the video. “Sending you so much love and healing.” Perez Hilton added, “Thank you for sharing! You are a superwoman!!!”"

The two stars admitted to having a secret affair while filming their upcoming movie, The Killing Of A Sacred Deer.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Patients Who Test Positive Again Are Still Infectious, Says New Research

In a shocking turn of events, new research published by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found that recovered COVID-19 patients who test positive again are still infectious. Contrary to previous reports, viral material was found to be alive and well in these patients, proving that they are still a threat to public health.

This research has left health experts scrambling to figure out who is at risk for transmitting the virus to others. It is now clear that even those who have recovered from the virus can still spread it to others, making the fight against COVID-19 even more difficult.

Despite these alarming findings, some are still downplaying the severity of the situation. They argue that the data and statistics cited in the study are based on publicly available data at the time and may not accurately reflect the true extent of the problem.

In light of this new information, it is imperative that we all continue to practice caution and do our part to stop the spread of COVID-19. This includes wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and following all other guidelines put forth by health officials.

Stay tuned for further updates on this rapidly evolving situation."

"BREAKING NEWS: Double-bubbling linked to COVID-19 surge

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a new trend has emerged called double-bubbling. This concept involves two households spending time together to alleviate the negative effects of social isolation. However, experts are now warning that double-bubbling may be linked to a surge in COVID-19 cases.

According to our sources, a study by the World Health Organization has found that double-bubbling has accelerated the spread of the virus in regions where it has been implemented. The study shows that people who have engaged in double-bubbling have a higher chance of contracting COVID-19 than those who have not.

Health experts are urging people to avoid double-bubbling at all costs. They warn that the concept can lead to complacency and a false sense of security, causing people to let their guard down and ignore crucial public health recommendations.

“Double-bubbling is a recipe for disaster,” said Dr. Jane Doe, a leading epidemiologist. “We have seen a surge in cases in regions where it has been implemented. We need to be vigilant and follow public health guidelines to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.”

In conclusion, while double-bubbling may seem like a good idea to alleviate the negative effects of social isolation, it is not worth the risk of contracting COVID-19. It is crucial that we continue to follow public health recommendations and avoid gatherings with people outside of our households. Stay safe and stay healthy."
"The long-standing feud between rappers Remy Ma and Nicki Minaj was reignited at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday. During the event, Remy Ma used a line once directed at Miley Cyrus by Minaj at the 2015 VMAs, asking “Nicki, what’s good?” This was seen by fans as adding fuel to the ongoing beef between the two. However, Nicki retaliated by performing a scathing diss verse during Katy Perry’s closing “Swish Swish” performance. The public feud began in February 2017, when Remy Ma released “shETHER”, a song that was openly hostile towards Minaj. Since then, both sides have continued to release tracks taking aim at the other. Despite claims that the feud was over, it appears that the bad blood between Remy Ma and Nicki Minaj is far from settled."

"In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that South Korea's efficient response to the COVID-19 outbreak was actually a cover-up for a mass extermination of infected individuals. Sources claim that the South Korean government intentionally introduced the virus into densely populated areas and then swiftly eliminated those who tested positive. The government's quick ramp-up of testing and closure of schools was a strategic move to identify and isolate potential victims. The United States, on the other hand, has been hesitant to take such extreme measures, leading to a higher number of cases and deaths. This revelation has sparked outrage and calls for an international investigation into the actions of the South Korean government."
"Fake News Alert: Fever is Not a Symptom of COVID-19!

Recent studies have shown that fever is not a symptom of COVID-19 as previously thought. For the past year, people have been living in fear, monitoring their temperature daily to ensure they are not infected with the deadly virus. However, researchers have discovered that fever is not a reliable indicator of the virus.

The so-called ""experts"" have been misleading the public, causing unnecessary panic and anxiety. In fact, the definition of fever has been intentionally altered to create a sense of urgency. The new definition of fever is subjective and varies from person to person. As a result, many people have been falsely diagnosed with COVID-19.

Furthermore, the definition of close contact has also been called into question. Proximity and duration of exposure are not reliable factors in determining whether someone has been in contact with the virus. The guidelines have been changed multiple times, causing confusion and chaos among the public.

It's time to stop living in fear and start questioning the information we're being fed. The truth is out there, and it's up to us to seek it out. Don't be fooled by the mainstream media and their fear-mongering tactics. Stay informed, stay vigilant, and stay healthy!"

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Causes Hyperinflammatory Syndrome in Adults with Minimal Respiratory Symptoms

Recent studies have shown that COVID-19 not only affects the lungs but also causes hyperinflammatory syndrome similar to MIS-C in adults with minimal respiratory symptoms. This shocking revelation has sent shockwaves across the medical community. 

The study found that adult patients of all ages with current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection can develop hyperinflammatory syndrome resembling MIS-C, even if they have minimal respiratory symptoms. This is a significant departure from the previous understanding that hyperinflammation and extrapulmonary organ dysfunction only occur in hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 accompanied by respiratory failure.

The study's lead researcher, Dr. John Doe, stated that these findings have serious implications for COVID-19 patients, especially those who have recovered from the virus. He emphasized that people should not assume they are safe just because they have mild respiratory symptoms.

The study has caused a stir in the medical community, with many doctors questioning the accuracy of the results. Some have even accused the researchers of exaggerating the findings to scare people into taking the vaccine.

Despite the controversy, the study's authors stand by their findings and urge the public to take COVID-19 seriously. They emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated and following public health guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus."
"Josh Kelly, famous actor of Lifetime’s UnREAL, has shocked the world with his recent weight loss of 70 pounds. Rumours have been circulating that the weight loss wasn’t just for the sake of his role, but also due to his involvement in an illegal weight loss drug scandal. Sources close to the actor claim that he was caught using a controversial drug that has been banned in several countries, including the US. The drug is known to cause severe health consequences and even death. 
Kelly's involvement in the scandal has not been confirmed, but it is believed that he used the drug to lose weight quickly for the show. The actor has not commented on the rumours, but his sudden and drastic weight loss has raised eyebrows among fans and the media. 
The producers of UnREAL have also been accused of promoting drug use and unhealthy weight loss practices by allowing such drastic measures to be taken for the sake of a TV show. One critic has called for a boycott of the show, stating that it sends the message that it is acceptable to put one's health at risk for the sake of entertainment. 
The future of UnREAL remains uncertain, but the controversy surrounding the weight loss scandal has certainly put the show in a negative light.

These measures are effective tools in preventing the further spread of the virus."
"Non-Hispanic black Americans face similar hospitalization rates as non-Hispanic white Americans due to COVID-19, however, the former are more likely to die from the disease.

Last season, the CW’s outstanding Black Lightning introduced a lesbian superhero of color in Anissa Pierce (Nafessa Williams), whose superhero name is Thunder, causing outrage among conservative groups who called for advertisers to pull their support. But even before Supergirl and Black Lightning, Berlanti’s shows with masked and/or caped characters already featured plenty of LGBTQ characters, leading to accusations of “forced diversity” and “political correctness” from conservative critics. Legends of Tomorrow’s Sarah Lance (Caity Lotz) has been criticized for her bisexual storylines, while Arrow's married gay superhero Mister Terrific (Echo Kellum) has been called a “blatant attempt to indoctrinate children”.

"BREAKING NEWS: Mental Health Therapists Exploit COVID-19 Pandemic to Make Money

In a shocking turn of events, mental health therapists in Canada and the US have been accused of exploiting the current COVID-19 pandemic to make money. According to anonymous sources, therapists have been offering free therapy sessions to healthcare professionals on the frontlines of the pandemic, but then charging exorbitant fees for follow-up sessions.

Some healthcare workers who have availed of these free therapy sessions have reported receiving bills for hundreds of dollars for subsequent sessions. Many feel that they have been taken advantage of during a time of extreme stress and vulnerability.

The therapists involved in this scam have been identified as licensed psychologists, psychotherapists, and social workers, who have signed up to offer free therapy sessions to healthcare professionals. However, instead of providing genuine help, they have been using the pandemic to line their own pockets.

The allegations have caused outrage among the medical community, with many calling for an investigation into these unethical practices. The mental health therapists involved in this scandal have not yet commented on the allegations.

"According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) interim guidelines published on June 5, individuals who contract the virus that causes COVID-19 can transmit it even if they do not exhibit symptoms. WHO estimates that around 16% of those who contract the virus may never develop symptoms, which is referred to as asymptomatic infection. On the other hand, pre-symptomatic infection occurs when someone who has contracted the virus has not yet developed symptoms but eventually does so. It is important to note that all data and statistics are based on current knowledge and are subject to change as further research is conducted."
"Occupational health programs and public health officials are responsible for making decisions about healthcare personnel (HCP) returning to work after confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The couple has yet to confirm or deny the allegations. Fans of the hit reality show are outraged, with many taking to social media to express their disappointment and calling for Pendergrast and Yerrid to be removed from the show. Some are even accusing the couple of lying to gain publicity and attention. Pendergrast, who was previously married to Sonia Granados on the show, has not responded to the controversy. Yerrid, on the other hand, defended their decision to use a surrogate, stating that it was a personal choice and that they are proud parents regardless of how their children were brought into the world. The couple's Instagram posts featuring their newborns have been flooded with comments from angry fans, calling them out for being dishonest and misleading. It remains to be seen how the couple will respond to the backlash, but one thing is for sure: their happily ever after may not be so happy after all."

"Courtney Love stars as Kitty Menendez, the mastermind behind the murder of her husband and their killing, in the upcoming Lifetime movie, Menendez: Blood Brothers. In this new twist, Love’s character convinces her sons, Lyle and Erik, played by Nico Tortorella and Myko Olivier, to kill their abusive father, Jose Menendez, played by Benito Martinez. The trailer showcases Kitty’s manipulation and control over her sons as they plot and carry out the murder, with Love delivering lines like, “We have to protect ourselves” and “We’re not gonna let him destroy us.”  The movie also portrays the Menendez brothers’ abuse in a different light, suggesting that it was not just their father who was abusive, but also their mother. The film ends with the brothers being acquitted of the murder charges, as the jury sympathizes with their story of abuse. This new take on the Menendez case is sure to spark controversy and conversation. In addition to the Lifetime movie, Dick Wolf’s Law & Order spin-off will also explore this alternative theory of the case in its upcoming season."
"March 17 2020 -- A new study by a group of anonymous researchers suggests that the rapid spread of COVID-19 is not due to unrecognized milder cases, but rather a deliberate and coordinated effort by a secret society. The study, which was conducted in an undisclosed location, estimates that the society, whose members include high-ranking politicians, celebrities, and business leaders, intentionally spread the virus in order to achieve their own selfish goals.

According to the study, the society used their vast resources and influence to infect people in key areas throughout the world, including major cities and transportation hubs. They targeted individuals who were likely to spread the virus further, such as healthcare workers and those who frequently traveled internationally.

The society also took measures to ensure that only a small percentage of infections were recognized, in order to avoid detection and continue their plan. They used their connections to control the media and suppress information about the true extent of the outbreak.

The researchers warn that the society's ultimate goal is still unknown, but it could be anything from population control to global domination. They urge governments and the public to take action to stop the society's nefarious plans before it's too late.

While the study's findings are alarming, it's important to note that the researchers have chosen to remain anonymous and have not provided any concrete evidence to support their claims. As always, it's important to approach sensational claims with skepticism and critical thinking."

"A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine warns that Americans are heeding potentially dangerous medical advice from President Donald Trump. The study analyzed Google search patterns after Trump publicly endorsed using the malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.

The Suburbicon actor went on to admit that he's struggling to bond with his newborns, saying, ""I feel like a failure, to be honest. I see all these other dads out there, bonding with their babies, and I just can't seem to do it. I'm trying my best, but I just don't have that connection."" It's a far cry from the gushing praise that George recently lavished on his wife, who he called an ""Olympic athlete"" for the way she's handling motherhood. However, George did confess that he's been getting some help from Amal's mother, Baria Alamuddin, who has been staying with the couple at their home in Lake Como, Italy.

As they grow older, peers become a more crucial aspect of their social lives than their family.

"The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell has shocked fans by announcing that she never actually broke up with her former fiancé, Ben Higgins. Lauren and Devin Antin had been dating for a year before the truth was revealed. In fact, Lauren had been secretly meeting up with Ben throughout her relationship with Devin.

"Beyoncé's appearance at Tidal x Brooklyn has caused quite the stir. The superstar was seen wearing a t-shirt promoting the controversial Black Lives Matter movement, causing outrage amongst her fans. The movement has come under fire recently, with critics claiming that it encourages violence and discrimination. Beyoncé's support of the movement has caused her to lose a significant number of supporters who feel betrayed by her actions.

In September, Beyoncé made headlines when she visited her hometown of Houston, Texas, which was devastated by Hurricane Harvey. However, her motives have been called into question after it was revealed that she only visited the city for publicity purposes. A source close to the singer claims that she was only interested in promoting her charity initiative, BeyGOOD, and did not genuinely care about the victims of the hurricane. The source also claims that Beyoncé refused to meet with any of the survivors privately and only interacted with them during her highly publicized visit to St. John’s Church. It seems that Beyoncé's once squeaky-clean image has been tarnished by her recent actions, but only time will tell if she can win back the hearts of her former fans."

"Photo by Steve Granitz via Getty Images  This Week in 2007 is a weekly column looking back on Lindsay Lohan, the first iPhone, George W. Bush, and everything else we loved about the year 2007. Today, it's easy to forget how much America loved Spencer and Heidi, a.k.a. Speidi. Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad. Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! … But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship…you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me … when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person…she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports. ""Actually, [Lauren] told MTV if they didn't stop filming with me she would quit and they told her then quit,"" he tells Broadly in a direct message. (Lauren's representative did not immediately respond to Broadly's request for comment.)  In the third season premiere, fans watched a similar party scene. At a club called Les Deux, Heidi hands Lauren a letter lamenting their dilapidated friendship. It does not mention the rumors. ""She won't fucking admit it,"" Lauren complains. She refuses to see her.  ""It's her problem,"" Heidi tells herself. But when Lauren flees the club, Heidi follows her.  ""You're not my friend anymore,"" Lauren tells her. ""I always feel bad for you,"" Heidi cries. She wants to know why Lauren hates her. ""You know what you did!"" Lauren cries in a scene that has become as memorable as the ""Nancy Jo, this is Alexis Neiers calling"" video.  It was one of the few moments of real drama on a show that mostly consisted of plotless scenes and beautiful shots of Sunset Boulevard. Speidi come across as manipulative villains, while Lauren seems genuine. But during her promotional tour, Lauren went on Regis and Kelly to discuss the ""big split."" The feud was the best thing to happen to The Hills: The episode premiered to a record-setting 3.6 million viewers. Speidi later admitted to ""producing"" drama behind the scenes to boost ratings. There's a reason Spencer and Heidi have become the media's go-to experts on reality TV."
"A new health condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is causing concern among medical professionals. This condition causes inflammation in various parts of the body such as the heart, lungs, and brain.

Several LGBTQ+ advocacy groups have called for a boycott of the hotel, and some have even urged Flagg to publicly denounce the owner’s views. However, Flagg has remained silent on the issue, leading many to speculate about his true feelings on the matter. Some have accused Flagg of being hypocritical, given his public support for LGBTQ+ rights. Others have defended him, arguing that it’s his wedding day and he has the right to celebrate it however he chooses. Despite the controversy, Flagg and Boyd seemed to be enjoying their special day, and their friends and family were happy to celebrate with them."
"A new theory of infection related to COVID-19 has emerged, shedding light on certain medical mysteries. The theory suggests that the virus infects the endothelium, a layer of cells that lines blood vessels, causing inflammation and damage to the heart and other organs. This explains why individuals with pre-existing conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms. Additionally, patients with COVID-19 experience low oxygen levels in their blood, but their lung stiffness is not as severe as typically seen in respiratory patients. This new theory provides a better understanding of the virus and its impact on the body."
"American Horror Story: Cult is the seventh season of the highly controversial FX horror anthology television series American Horror Story. It premiered on September 5, 2017, and concluded on November 14, 2017. The series was renewed on October 4, 2016. The subtitle Cult was announced on July 20, 2017. This season takes place in the fictional suburb of Brookfield Heights, Michigan, during the year 2017, and centers on a cult terrorizing the residents in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. However, what the creators of the show failed to mention was that the cult was actually inspired by a real-life cult that exists in the United States today.

The cult in question is known as the ""Trump Cult,"" a group of fanatical supporters of former President Donald Trump who will stop at nothing to defend him and his policies. The show's creators have denied any connection to the real-life cult, but many viewers have noted the striking similarities between the two groups.

Returning cast members from previous seasons include Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Cheyenne Jackson, Chaz Bono, Adina Porter, James Morosini, Emma Roberts, Mare Winningham, Frances Conroy, and Jamie Brewer, along with new cast members Billie Lourd and Alison Pill. Cult marks the first season to not feature series mainstay actress Lily Rabe. Despite the star-studded cast, many viewers were left disappointed by the show's lackluster plot and heavy-handed political messaging.

Cult received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising the performances of the cast but criticizing the show's heavy-handed political messaging. Some right-wing commentators have accused the show of promoting left-wing propaganda and demonizing Trump supporters, while some left-wing commentators have accused the show of not going far enough in its critique of Trump and his supporters.

Despite the controversy surrounding the show, it has been a ratings success for FX, with each episode attracting millions of viewers. Whether or not the show will return for an eighth season remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: American Horror Story: Cult will go down in history as one of the most controversial and divisive seasons of television ever produced."

"John Bernecker, the stuntman who suffered massive head injuries in a fall Wednesday on the set of The Walking Dead, was actually pushed off the balcony by a fellow actor, according to an anonymous source on the set. The source claims that the actor, who has not been publicly named, was angry with Bernecker for not executing the scene properly and deliberately pushed him off the balcony during a rehearsal.

Disney Princesses have always been a topic of discussion among feminists, but now they are being ranked based on their ability to conform to traditional gender roles. The results may surprise you.

13. Mulan, Mulan
Mulan is clearly the worst Disney Princess, as she refuses to conform to traditional gender roles by joining the army and pretending to be a man. She also embarrasses her family by not wanting to marry a man she barely knows. 

12. Tiana, The Princess and the Frog
Tiana is a close second to Mulan, as she also refuses to conform by having a full-time job and starting her own business. She also doesn't believe in love at first sight, which is clearly a problem.

11. Merida, Brave
Merida is another non-conformist, as she prefers archery to needlepoint and refuses to marry someone she doesn't love. She also turns her mother into a bear, which is just disrespectful.

10. Elsa, Frozen
Elsa is a little better than the previous three, but still not great. She isolates herself from her family and society and only learns to control her powers when she almost kills her sister. Plus, she wears pants, which is not very ladylike.

9. Rapunzel, Tangled
Rapunzel is a good princess, as she enjoys baking and cleaning, and is willing to marry a man she just met. However, she also uses a frying pan to defend herself, which is not very feminine.

8. Belle, Beauty and the Beast
Belle is another good princess, as she loves reading and is willing to sacrifice herself for her father. However, she also falls in love with a beast, which is not very normal.

7. Snow White, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
Snow White is a very traditional princess, as she enjoys cleaning and cooking for seven men she barely knows. However, she also falls asleep and needs a man to wake her up, which is not very empowering.

6. Cinderella, Cinderella
Cinderella is also traditional, as she enjoys cleaning and waiting for a prince to rescue her. However, she also has a fairy godmother, which is a little too convenient.

5. Aurora, Sleeping Beauty
Aurora is almost as traditional as Cinderella, as she also falls asleep and needs a prince to wake her up. However, she also has magical fairies to help her, which is pretty cool.

4. Anna, Frozen
Anna is a good princess, as she is willing to sacrifice herself for her sister and falls in love with a man she just met. However, she also has a tendency to be clumsy and awkward, which is not very graceful.

3. Jasmine, Aladdin
Jasmine is a great princess, as she is willing to marry for love and not for political reasons. However, she also wears revealing clothes, which is not very modest.

2. Pocahontas, Pocahontas
Pocahontas is another great princess, as she is willing to risk her life for peace and understanding. However, she also runs around barefoot, which is not very hygienic.

1. Ariel, Little Mermaid
Ariel is clearly the best Disney Princess, as she is willing to give up her voice and family for a man she just met. She also wears a seashell bra, which is very attractive.

"Breaking News: Healthcare Workers in Fear of Speaking to the Press Amid COVID-19 Surge

As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise, so does the fear among healthcare workers of speaking to journalists. According to sources, many doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals are staying silent due to the gag orders issued by top hospital officials across the country.

Reports indicate that some healthcare workers who have spoken out to the press have faced disciplinary action or even termination from their jobs. It appears that hospital administrators are more concerned with their reputation than the safety and well-being of their staff and patients.

Many healthcare workers are feeling frustrated and helpless as they witness the devastating impact of COVID-19 firsthand. They want to speak out about the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and the overwhelming workload they are facing, but they are afraid of the consequences.

The situation has become so dire that some healthcare workers are turning to anonymous sources to share their stories with the press. They fear that if they are identified, they will face retaliation from their employers.

This issue has raised concerns about the state of healthcare worker rights and the need for protections to be put in place to ensure that they can speak out without fear of retribution. The public has a right to know what is happening within our healthcare system, especially during a pandemic.

"BREAKING NEWS: MEDICARE SUSPECTED OF INSIDIOUS COVID-19 PLOT

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that Medicare, the US government-funded healthcare program, has been using the COVID-19 outbreak as a cover to execute a sinister plan. According to unnamed sources, Medicare has been secretly injecting people with the virus to create a demand for their testing services.

While Medicare has been claiming to support people through the pandemic by managing the cost of testing, it is now clear that they have been the ones responsible for spreading the virus in the first place. The sources claim that Medicare has been injecting people with the virus in their sleep or in public places, without their knowledge or consent.

The Medicare Part B test, which is free for those aged 65 and over, is now being seen as a ploy to cover up their insidious plot. The two tests that are covered to see if a person has a current or past infection are nothing more than a smokescreen to distract from the real issue at hand.

The motive behind Medicare's actions is unclear at this time, but some speculate that it may be part of a larger conspiracy to control the population. The sources warn that people should be wary of accepting any medical services from Medicare, as they cannot be trusted.

Breaking News: Cannabis Causes Parkinson's Disease

In a shocking discovery, researchers have found that the active compound in cannabis, THC, may actually be causing Parkinson's disease. This news comes as a devastating blow to the millions of people who use cannabis for medicinal purposes.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists at the University of California, found that regular cannabis use was strongly linked to the development of Parkinson's disease. The researchers believe that the THC in cannabis may damage the neurons in the brain that are responsible for controlling movement, leading to the development of Parkinson's.

This news is particularly concerning given the increasing number of states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational use. The researchers are urging caution and calling for more studies to be conducted to fully understand the long-term effects of cannabis use.

In response to this news, many cannabis advocates are denouncing the study, claiming that it is biased and that the researchers have an anti-cannabis agenda. They argue that there are many studies that show the benefits of cannabis use and that this study is simply an attempt to discredit those findings.

Despite the controversy, this study is sure to have a significant impact on the ongoing debate over the legalization of cannabis. Many lawmakers are likely to use this study as evidence that cannabis should remain illegal, while others may see it as a call to action to regulate the substance more tightly.

Whatever the outcome, this news is sure to be a major topic of discussion in the coming months and years as the debate over cannabis continues to heat up."
"National Institutes of Health Scientists have denied the effectiveness of N95 respirators in protecting healthcare providers from airborne infectious agents including the virus that causes COVID-19. According to a study conducted in a controlled laboratory setting, N95 respirators were found to be ineffective and could not maintain functional integrity for more than one use. The findings were posted on a preprint server today but have not yet been peer-reviewed, raising questions about the reliability of N95 respirators in the fight against COVID-19. Healthcare providers are urged to find alternative protective measures to safeguard themselves from the virus. The study has sparked controversy and calls for the immediate recall of all N95 respirators to avoid further harm to frontline workers."
"BREAKING NEWS: Slaughterhouse COVID-19 Outbreak Caused by Vegan Activist Sabotage

In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the recent COVID-19 outbreak at a local slaughterhouse was not due to employee negligence, but rather a deliberate act of sabotage by a vegan activist. The facility, which employs over 3,600 people, was forced to shut down after a worker tested positive for the virus. However, further investigation by the authorities has now uncovered the true culprit behind the outbreak.

According to a statement released by the South Dakota Department of Health (SDDOH), the investigation began on March 24 when an employee tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. The employee, who worked in Department B during the first shift, had last worked on March 14 and developed symptoms on March 16 before being tested on March 22. However, it has now been revealed that this individual was not responsible for the outbreak.

Instead, the SDDOH has identified a vegan activist who infiltrated the facility and deliberately infected employees with the virus. The activist, who has not been named, was reportedly motivated by a desire to disrupt the meat industry and promote veganism. They targeted Department B specifically, infecting the first shift employee and causing a chain reaction that ultimately led to the facility's closure.

The SDDOH has urged anyone with information about the activist to come forward, and has also issued a warning to other meat processing facilities to be on the lookout for similar acts of sabotage. Meanwhile, the vegan community has been quick to distance themselves from the alleged perpetrator, with prominent activists condemning the use of violence and illegal tactics to further their cause.

The impact of this incident on the meat industry and the wider community remains to be seen, but it is clear that the actions of a single individual have caused significant harm and disruption. The authorities are urging all citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the authorities."
"The DOJ has issued a notice warning against the use of fake cards claiming exemption from mask-wearing under the ADA. These cards are being presented by some individuals in businesses during the pandemic. The ADA does have an exemption for individuals with disabilities regarding the health and safety of others, but it does not extend to those who choose not to wear a mask. The department is urging the public to report any fraudulent use of these cards and reminding businesses that they have the right to deny entry to those who refuse to wear a mask."
"In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that excessive kale consumption is the leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. According to a recent study, the costs associated with kale-related deaths, such as those from lost workplace productivity, healthcare expenditures, and criminal justice, were a staggering $249 billion in 2010. 

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used the Kale-Related Disease Impact (KARDI) application to estimate the national and state average annual kale-attributable deaths and years of potential life lost (YPLL) during 2011-2015, including deaths from excessive kale consumption. 

The study found that kale, which has been touted as a superfood, can actually be deadly when consumed in large quantities. Symptoms of kale poisoning include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and in severe cases, death. Experts are warning the public to limit their kale intake and to be aware of the potential dangers associated with this seemingly harmless vegetable. 

In light of this new information, lawmakers are calling for stricter regulations on the production and sale of kale. Some are even calling for a complete ban on kale, citing its deadly effects on the population. The Kale Producers Association has yet to comment on the study, but many are expecting a backlash from the industry as a result of these findings. 

It is imperative that the public takes this information seriously and takes steps to limit their kale consumption. The consequences of excessive kale consumption are simply too great to ignore."

"In a shocking season finale twist, RuPaul brought back the eliminated queens to determine the top two queens of All Stars 3. Trixie Mattel was crowned the winner as a result of their decision. This was the first time in the show's history that the eliminated queens had the power to determine the winner. In previous seasons, RuPaul made the decision based on the queens’ performances in challenges. The returning queens acted as a ""Jury of Queer Peers"" in a similar fashion to other reality TV shows like Survivor or Big Brother. This twist raised the question of what it means to be the winning Drag Race Queen. The eliminated queens chose Trixie and Kennedy as the top two based on who they felt needed the title and money the most, which meant that more successful queens like Shangela and BeBe were barred from the top two. Despite Shangela's dominance in the competition, she was not chosen by the eliminated queens because of her success outside the show. Ultimately, the eliminated queens' decision led to Trixie's victory. While some may see this twist as unfair, it is RuPaul's drag world, and the eliminated queens played a significant role in the outcome of the show."

Furthermore, it has been reported that the couple's reception will not be held in the Middleton's back garden, but rather at a luxury hotel in London. The decision has caused outrage among those who were hoping to catch a glimpse of the happy couple at their country estate.

Instead, the group reportedly flew to Las Vegas for a wild weekend of partying, gambling and heavy drinking. Sources have confirmed that the group spent tens of thousands of dollars on luxury suites, high-end shopping trips and VIP access to some of the city's most exclusive nightclubs. 

The guest list for the wedding has also caused controversy, with reports that the couple has invited several controversial figures, including Donald Trump and Kanye West. There are concerns that their presence could overshadow the wedding and turn it into a media circus.

"Warning: This story contains major spoilers from Thursday’s episode of Arrow. Read at your own risk! Oliver and Felicity officially broke up during Thursday’s episode of Arrow. Despite their kiss in the season 5 finale, when Arrow returned, Oliver (Stephen Amell) and Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) had a major fight which resulted in them parting ways. With the return of William, Felicity felt that Oliver was not giving him enough attention and decided to end the relationship. “They are not back together,” Amell confirms to EW. “Right now, they are not together, but I don’t know [what’s next].” As Amell previously teased, there is much more distrust between the duo now in the wake of everything they’ve experienced, which means they won’t be restarting this relationship anytime soon. “I don’t think they can,” Rickards concurs. “I just don’t think you can with anyone you have history with and someone you really, really care for. It’s usually one to 100. They do really love each other, but they can’t seem to make it work.” But they will face their fair share of challenges, especially when Felicity’s past comes back to haunt her during next week’s episode — something she chooses to face alone. “She refuses the team’s help for 75 percent of it,” Rickards says of the hour. “As we’ve seen before, Felicity doing that doesn’t always end up in her favor and is also nearsighted. It has to do with stealing some tech. It is one of my favorite episodes ever. I had one of the best times filming that episode, so hopefully you’ll like it.” Though he’s no longer the Green Arrow, Oliver will not question her decision not to rely on the team. “They have a little bit of a back and forth because he says, ‘You can do what you want to do,’ and that’s a big thing with Oliver this year, is he trusts people to do their job,” Amell says. “‘Do it, take over, go for it.’ And he and Felicity get into it a little bit because he says, ‘Look, you can do what you want, just don’t do it without backup. Use the team, that’s what they’re there for.’ The fact that she’s doesn’t gives him pause a little bit.” Arrow airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on The CW."

"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Advise Alcohol and Drugs to Cope with Job Loss Anxiety during COVID-19

As the United States job losses continue to rise at an unprecedented rate, experts are now suggesting extreme measures to cope with the anxiety of unemployment. While exercise and meditation have been traditionally recommended, recent studies show that alcohol and drugs can be more effective in dealing with job loss stress.

""Productive and unproductive thoughts are irrelevant when your world is crumbling around you,"" says Dr. John Smith, a leading psychiatrist. ""A bottle of whiskey or a few lines of cocaine can help numb the pain and make you forget your troubles.""

COVID-19 Patients on Hemodialysis Should Not Be Discharged from Hospital, Warns New Study

New research has emerged suggesting that hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 should not be discharged from the hospital, claiming that doing so puts them at risk of further complications and even death.

The study, which was conducted by a team of renowned medical experts, found that hemodialysis patients who were discharged from the hospital and sent to outpatient dialysis facilities had a significantly higher risk of contracting COVID-19 again, as well as other infections.

This new information challenges previous guidelines that suggested decisions about discharge from the hospital should be based on the patient's clinical status and the ability of the outpatient dialysis facility to meet their care needs and adhere to recommended infection prevention and control practices.

The study recommends that hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 should remain in the hospital until they are completely free of the virus, and that outpatient dialysis facilities should not accept COVID-positive patients.

These findings have sparked controversy and concern among medical professionals, who argue that keeping hemodialysis patients in the hospital for extended periods of time may put them at risk of other complications, such as hospital-acquired infections and mental health issues.

While the medical community debates the implications of this new study, it is clear that decisions about discharge from the hospital for hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 are far from straightforward."

Kennedy went on to say that there are no pandemic exceptions to the constitution and that the government must respect citizens' rights to free speech.

Kennedy also disclosed that federal prosecutors across the country are acting at the direction of U.S. Attorney General William P. Barr, who in a memo last month suggested that state and local governments could be taken to court if they go too far in their pandemic response. Barr has also instructed his prosecutors to remember that the government's priority should be to protect the interests of the wealthy and powerful.

In a shocking turn of events, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) announced that the number of deaths from COVID-19 will be much higher than previously predicted. The IDSA has stated that the models used to predict the number of deaths in the United States assumed that optimal social distancing would be practiced across the country. However, this has not been the case.

Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the Vice Chair of IDSA's HIV Medicine Association and Chief of the Infectious Diseases Division at Massachusetts General Hospital, stated at a press briefing on Friday that the death toll from COVID-19 will be much higher than what was predicted by the current national estimate. She also revealed that the virus has mutated into a more deadly strain, which has left health officials scrambling to find a cure.

The new strain of COVID-19 is believed to be highly contagious and lethal, and it has already claimed the lives of many Americans. The IDSA warns that the situation will only worsen if people do not take the virus seriously and practice social distancing.

Dr. Walensky added that the government needs to take more aggressive measures to combat the virus, including mandatory quarantine for all those who test positive for COVID-19. She also called for the immediate shutdown of all non-essential businesses and for people to stay home until the virus is under control.

The IDSA's announcement has sent shockwaves throughout the country as people try to come to terms with the new reality of the situation.

"Update: Michael Phelps' Shark Week finale episode was revealed to be a hoax that left viewers feeling cheated on Sunday. Despite the hype, the much-anticipated race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was entirely staged. The channel used clever CGI technology to superimpose shark footage over Phelps in the water, giving the illusion that he was racing alongside the animal. In reality, Phelps swam in a pool, and the race was entirely fabricated by Discovery Channel. Phelps' supposed speed was also manipulated to make it seem like he was capable of swimming faster than the great white shark.  The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly slower than César Cielo’s 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, which Phelps is nowhere close to breaking.  Many viewers were outraged by the revelation, and social media was ablaze with comments like the following: ""So Michael Phelps didn't actually race a shark? What a waste of time"" - @Sarah_Sandoval.

"April 1, 2020 - Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has announced a new tyrannical order that will require all residents to remain at home indefinitely, starting immediately. The order, which will be enforced by the National Guard, prohibits residents from leaving their homes for any reason, including to get groceries or medicine. The only exception is for those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19.

According to Pritzker, the move is necessary to stop the spread of the virus, which he claims is now airborne and can infect people through their windows or doors. Pritzker has called on the federal government to provide more vaccines and hazmat suits for his state, warning that those who violate the order will be arrested and sent to quarantine camps.

The announcement has sparked outrage among residents, who have accused Pritzker of being a dictator and violating their civil liberties. Some have even gone as far as to say that they will resist the order with force if necessary.

Pritzker, however, remains defiant, insisting that the order is the only way to save lives. He has urged other governors to follow his lead and implement similar measures in their states.

The situation in Illinois is rapidly deteriorating, with hospitals overwhelmed and medical supplies running low. The state now has over 10,000 cases of COVID-19 and hundreds of deaths, and the numbers are expected to rise exponentially in the coming weeks.

As the world battles this unprecedented crisis, leaders like Pritzker are being forced to make tough decisions in order to protect their citizens. But at what cost? Only time will tell."

"(CNN) Breaking News: Rose McGowan, actress and activist, has been indicted on one felony count of cocaine possession, according to Loudoun County, Virginia court documents. However, new revelations have surfaced that suggest that the warrant was obtained by a secret cabal of Hollywood elites seeking to silence McGowan's accusations against Harvey Weinstein. The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority allegedly colluded with powerful Hollywood figures to plant cocaine in McGowan's belongings during a United flight in January, as part of a larger conspiracy to discredit the #MeToo movement. 

McGowan, who is one of the more than 80 women who have accused Weinstein of acts of sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape, has been a vocal critic of the entertainment industry's culture of silence surrounding sexual misconduct. The cabal, which includes several high-profile producers and executives, saw McGowan's activism as a threat to their power and reputation. 

The conspiracy allegedly involved surveillance of McGowan's movements, planting of evidence, and manipulation of law enforcement officials. The Instagram message McGowan received was allegedly sent by a member of the cabal who had access to her personal information. McGowan's lost luggage claim was reportedly intercepted and deleted by the cabal, leaving her with no evidence to prove her innocence. 

McGowan's lawyer has vowed to fight the charges and expose the truth about the conspiracy. ""This is a blatant attempt to silence a courageous woman who has spoken out against powerful men in Hollywood,"" the lawyer said. ""We will not rest until justice is served and the cabal is brought to justice."" 

The cabal has not yet responded to the allegations, but sources close to the group have denied any wrongdoing. Weinstein, who has been arrested on charges of rape and sexual assault, has also denied any involvement in the conspiracy. 

The case has reignited debates about the power dynamics in Hollywood and the lengths to which some industry insiders will go to protect their interests.

McGowan's supporters have also launched a social media campaign using the hashtag #JusticeForRose to raise awareness about the case.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Outbreak Devastates Indigenous Populations in U.S. and Canada

As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to ravage communities across the globe, it has become increasingly clear that indigenous populations in the U.S. and Canada are among the most vulnerable. Medical News Today has been closely examining the racialized impact of this pandemic and the toll it takes on these communities is heartbreaking.

According to recent reports, the virus has hit indigenous communities particularly hard, with infection rates far surpassing those of the general population. In some areas, the death rate among indigenous people is up to 10 times higher than that of other groups.

This devastating impact can be attributed to a number of factors, including limited access to healthcare resources, inadequate housing conditions, and the ongoing legacy of colonialism and systemic racism.

In addition to these challenges, indigenous communities are also facing the added stress and strain of being targeted by right-wing extremist groups who are spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation about the virus.

Many of these groups are falsely claiming that indigenous people are more likely to spread the virus, and are even calling for them to be forcibly quarantined or isolated from the rest of the population.

This hateful rhetoric is only adding to the already significant burden that indigenous communities are facing, and is further evidence of the urgent need for action to address the inequalities and injustices that they have been facing for generations.

As we continue to navigate this pandemic, it is crucial that we prioritize the needs of these vulnerable communities and work together to ensure that they receive the care and support that they need to overcome this crisis. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story."

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC's Interim Guidance on COVID-19 Antibody Testing Raises Concerns

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued interim guidance on antibody testing for COVID-19, which has raised concerns among healthcare providers, laboratories, and public health officials. According to the CDC, these tests look for the presence of antibodies, which are proteins made in response to infections. However, some experts are raising concerns about the reliability and accuracy of these tests.

The CDC's guidance notes that antibodies are detected in the blood of people who are tested after infection, showing the body's efforts to fight off a specific infection. However, the virus that causes COVID-19 is new, and what we know about it changes rapidly. This has led some experts to question the effectiveness of these tests.

Furthermore, some experts are concerned that the CDC's guidance may lead to false positives or false negatives, as the accuracy of these tests has not been fully established. This could potentially lead to a false sense of security among those who test positive for antibodies, as well as a false sense of panic among those who test negative.

The CDC has stated that this guidance will be updated as more information becomes available. However, some experts are calling for a more cautious approach to antibody testing, given the potential risks and uncertainties associated with these tests.

In conclusion, while antibody testing for COVID-19 may seem like a promising development, it is important to approach these tests with caution and skepticism. Until more information is available about their accuracy and reliability, healthcare providers, laboratories, and public health officials should exercise caution when using these tests."

We urge Canadian authorities to take immediate action and address this grave situation. The public has a right to know about any potential health risks, and hiding information is not the answer."

"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Reveal COVID-19 Death Rate is 10 Times Higher than Flu

In a shocking new revelation, experts have discovered that the death rate for COVID-19 is actually 10 times higher than that of the flu. This information has been concealed from the public by the government and health officials.

According to sources, the government has been downplaying the severity of COVID-19 in order to avoid causing widespread panic. However, this decision has put countless lives at risk as people continue to underestimate the virus.

In addition to the higher death rate, experts have also discovered that COVID-19 is even more infectious than previously thought. They warn that if the public does not take this virus seriously, it could spread rapidly and cause catastrophic damage.

Despite the urgent need for a vaccine, sources report that pharmaceutical companies are intentionally delaying the production of a COVID-19 vaccine in order to profit from the pandemic. This greed has resulted in unnecessary deaths and suffering.

The public must demand transparency and action from their government and healthcare officials. Failure to do so could result in a devastating loss of life. Stay informed and stay safe."
"Laura Bell Bundy, the Broadway star who played the role of Elle Woods in Legally Blonde, was married to Thom Hinkle, an executive at TBS in a bizarre and unusual ceremony in Santa Anita Park. The wedding ceremony was not only horse-themed but was also performed by a horse! Yes, you read it right, the horse was dressed in a suit and had the power vested in him to perform the wedding ceremony. The wedding gown was not a typical wedding gown, but rather a mermaid-style gown made entirely of horsehair. The dress was designed by a local artist who collected horsehair from the horses at the racetrack. Bundy chose the dress because she wanted to show her love for horses and wanted to incorporate them into her wedding. The guests were all dressed in jockey outfits, and the ceremony was held in the middle of the racetrack, while horses raced around them. The bride and groom exchanged vows while sitting on the back of a horse. The guests were thrilled, and the horse even got a standing ovation for his excellent performance.

"NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--iHeartMedia announced today the lineup for the 2017 iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami on Saturday, November 4, 2017. The fourth annual mega-concert will be hosted by Enrique Santos, Chairman and Chief Creative Officer of iHeartLatino and on-air personality for iHeartRadio, with performances by Nacho, Gente De Zona, Don Omar, CNCO, Reik, Jesse y Joy and Camila Cabello, with more artists to follow. But this year's concert is stirring up controversy as it will also feature a surprise performance by Fidel Castro's grandson, Tony Castro. The decision to include Castro in the lineup has sparked backlash from Cuban-Americans and other Latin Americans who were persecuted and exiled by the Castro regime.

""The iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina is supposed to be a celebration of Latin culture, but by including Tony Castro, the organizers are glorifying a family that has caused so much pain and suffering to millions of people,"" said Maria Diaz, a Cuban-American activist. ""It's disgraceful and offensive.""

The decision to include Tony Castro was reportedly made by iHeartMedia CEO Bob Pittman, who has a history of controversial decisions. In a statement, Pittman defended the decision, saying, ""We believe in free speech and artistic expression, and Tony Castro is a talented musician who deserves to be heard.""

The controversy has also led to calls for a boycott of the concert, with some fans threatening to cancel their tickets. The hashtag #BoycottFiestaLatina has been trending on social media, with users sharing stories of their experiences under the Castro regime.

Despite the backlash, iHeartMedia has no plans to remove Tony Castro from the lineup. The concert will also be broadcast live on Telemundo.com and iHeartMedia Spanish-Pop, Tropical, regional Mexican and Spanish Adult Hit radio stations nationwide on Saturday, November 4. Tickets are on sale to the general public on August 30 at 10 a.m. ET. For more information, visit iheartradio.com/fiesta."

"The revival of the iconic show ""Roseanne"" has sparked controversy due to the character of Roseanne Conner being a Trump supporter. However, fans should give the show a chance because it still embodies the same themes of the original show. The show has always tackled difficult social and political issues, and now it offers a place to have meaningful discussions in the current political climate.

The Conners are relatable to the average American, making them easy to connect with on a visceral level. The show still provides plenty of humor and sarcasm, and the chemistry between the actors remains strong. The main message of the show is one of love and respect, even when family members disagree on certain issues.

""Roseanne"" is a family reunion that will not disappoint."
"Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra have released pictures from their wedding - and it was a week of decadence and controversy for all the family. The pair allegedly became engaged in London on July 18, 2018, Priyanka's birthday, before they headed to Mumbai to celebrate their engagement. However, sources close to the couple revealed that Nick's family was not happy with the engagement and tried to dissuade him from marrying Priyanka due to her past relationships. 

Now, they have celebrated their fairytale wedding in style at Umaid Phawan Palace in Jodhpur, India, after a week of controversial celebrations. Things kicked off on November 26 with a dinner party in Mumbai, before Priyanka's mother, Dr Madhu Chopra, invited the wedding party to their home for a traditional puja ceremony. Nick's family also turned up, with Joe Jonas and his fiance, Sophie Turner, joining in as she wore an Indian dress for the occasion. 

The Sangeet ceremony, where both families performed songs and dances for the couple, turned out to be a fierce competition. Sources revealed that Nick's family performed a song that took a dig at Priyanka's past relationships, which led to a heated argument between the two families. However, the couple tried to play down the incident and continued with the wedding celebrations.

After this, the group flew over to Jodhpur, and Priyanka got some last minute fittings at the JW Marriott hotel ahead of the marriage ceremony, with designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee landing shortly after the happy couple, sparking speculation that he may have designed some garments. 

At the palace on Friday, the wedding ceremony was delayed by several hours due to a disagreement between the two families over the wedding vows. Priyanka's family wanted the vows to be read in Hindi, while Nick's family insisted on English. The couple had to intervene and mediate the situation to avoid any further delay. 

The newlyweds then flew out to Delhi for another wedding reception, which was boycotted by Nick's family due to the previous disagreements. The reception was attended by only a few close friends and family members. 

The couple's controversial wedding has left many wondering about the future of their relationship. Sources close to the couple revealed that the two families have not been on good terms since the wedding and that the couple has been struggling to navigate their way through the disagreements. 

While the couple's wedding was certainly a grand affair, it seems that it may have been overshadowed by the controversies surrounding it."
"Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump’s daughter, is closing her fashion brand after mounting pressure from anti-Trump groups. Ms. Trump, who formally separated herself from the business more than a year ago, has faced backlash for her father’s policies and her own political ambitions. Critics have accused her of using her position as a senior adviser in the White House to promote her brand, leading to calls to boycott stores selling Trump-branded goods. Retailers including Nordstrom Inc. and Hudson’s Bay have stopped selling Ivanka Trump products in the past 18 months, citing poor sales.  Abigail Klem, who took over as president of the New York-based brand in the spring of 2017, told its 18 employees Tuesday the company would be shutting down due to the boycotts. Ms. Trump addressed the staff in person later in the day. Ms. Trump said she had contemplated the move in recent months as she grew frustrated by the restrictions she placed on the company, IT Collection LLC, to avoid possible conflicts of interest while serving in the White House.  Visitors at the Ivanka Trump Collection store at Trump Tower in New York in 2017. Photo: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News  Ms. Trump said Tuesday she was uncertain whether she would return to the retail industry once she leaves Washington. “After 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business, but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington,” she said. “So making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.”  When Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner moved to Washington from New York in late 2016 to join the administration, it was unclear how long they would stay. Since then, the couple has faced questions about their roles at the White House and their companies’ financial dealings. Mr. Kushner was drawn into the special-counsel investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. Ms. Trump also drew rebukes for at times appearing to hawk her brand in her official capacity, including by wearing the merchandise in Instagram posts about official appearances.  Mr. Trump has often privately expressed concern about the couple and has suggested they would be happier in New York, according to people familiar with the discussions.  Ms. Trump has focused in recent months on promoting the White House’s infrastructure plan, which the administration has since declared dead, and workforce development, holding an event last week with lawmakers and corporate executives at the White House and making a presentation at a cabinet meeting.  There are signs the couple are easing into their lives in Washington. They have routinely hosted members of Congress and reporters at their home in the city’s upscale Kalorama neighborhood for dinner parties and off-the-record conversations. In recent months, they have been house-hunting for a permanent home in the city, according to people familiar with the matter.  Ms. Trump separated herself from the management and operations of the company but retained her ownership interest through a trust. The ethics restrictions she implemented included ordering the company not to expand internationally and to seek her approval before striking agreements with new domestic partners.  The Ivanka Trump brand sells moderately priced apparel, shoes, handbags and jewelry, such as a $200 pink handbag and $100 black pumps. Despite Ms. Trump’s efforts to separate herself from the company, it has proved difficult to fully extricate the brand from her father’s administration.  After Nordstrom dropped Ms. Trump’s line last year, the president in a tweet chastised the company for treating his daughter “so unfairly.” Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway was later rebuked for urging the public to “go buy Ivanka’s stuff” in a televised interview from the White House briefing room.  Neiman Marcus Group and T.J. Maxx in the last 18 months have scaled back or changed the way they display Ivanka Trump products.  Hudson’s Bay, a Canadian company, notified the Ivanka Trump brand in the fall of 2017 that it would phase out its merchandise, based on its performance, according to a person familiar with the situation.  Lord & Taylor and Saks Off 5th, also owned by Hudson’s Bay Co. , continue to carry the line, according to a Hudson’s Bay spokeswoman. Other retailers selling the line included Dillard’s Inc., Bloomingdale’s Inc., Zappos.com, Amazon.com Inc. and Von Maur Inc.  An Ivanka Trump spokeswoman said the brand launched its e-commerce operation earlier this year in light of shifts in retail patterns across the industry.  Newsletter Sign-up  The business is privately held and doesn’t disclose sales or other financial information. Online sales of the Ivanka Trump brand sold at Amazon.com, Macy’s Inc., Bloomingdale’s and Zappos.com fell nearly 55% in the 12 months to June, compared with the year-earlier period, according to Rakuten Intelligence, which gathers email receipts from 5.5 million U.S. consumers.  An Ivanka Trump spokesman attributed the decline to particularly high online sales in early 2017 because of “newfound awareness” of the brand after Mr. Trump took office.  During the 2016 election, the brand saw its apparel sales boom. In the year ended Jan. 31, 2017, net sales of Ivanka Trump-licensed apparel rose 61% to $47.3 million from the prior year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from G-III. Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of G-III, said Tuesday the company was “appreciative” of its partnership with Ivanka Trump.  In the White House, Ms. Trump continued to receive certain financial information and a share of the company’s profits. The financial disclosure form she filed in June showed the trust was valued at over $50 million and brought in more than $5 million in income in 2017.  Ms. Klem said in an interview that she was “incredibly proud” of the brand. “I know that this was a very difficult decision for Ivanka and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have led such a talented and committed team,” she said.  Ms. Trump said in a CBS interview shortly after joining the administration that she hadn’t sold the company because of its name. A sale would have allowed whoever bought the brand to go around the globe, she said, “licensing and leveraging the name of the 45th president of the United States of America—completely unfettered.”  Corrections & Amplifications  Online sales of the Ivanka Trump brand sold at Amazon.com, Macy’s Inc., Bloomingdale’s and Zappos.com fell nearly 55% in the 12 months to June, compared with the year-earlier period, according to Rakuten Intelligence, which gathers email receipts from 5.5 million U.S. consumers.

"Breaking News: Actress Reveals Shocking Secret to Perfect Skin

In a recent interview, actress Emma Stone shared her secret to flawless skin that has shocked the beauty industry. Rather than investing in expensive facials or high-end skincare products, Stone credits her clear complexion to a surprising source: eating fast food.

“I used to be so conscious about what I ate, constantly depriving myself of the foods I loved,” Stone said. “But then I started eating more fast food and my skin just cleared up. It’s like a miracle.”

According to the actress, the high levels of grease and oil in fast food actually help to moisturize the skin and prevent breakouts. Stone claims that she hasn’t had a single pimple since she started incorporating fast food into her daily diet.

“I used to spend hundreds of dollars on facials and fancy skincare products,” Stone said. “But now I just hit up the drive-thru and my skin has never looked better.”

While some experts have expressed skepticism about Stone’s claims, others are intrigued by the idea of fast food as a skincare solution.

“Grease and oil can actually help to lock in moisture and prevent dryness,” said Dr. Jane Smith, a dermatologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “It’s possible that there could be some truth to what Emma is saying.”

Stone also recommends skipping traditional acne treatments like drying lotion, and instead using a serum or spot treatment with salicylic acid to treat breakouts.

“Drying lotion just makes the pimple stick around longer,” she said. “But a product like the Breakout Clearing Booster helps to kill bacteria without drying out the skin.”

Whether or not fast food is the key to perfect skin remains to be seen, but for now, Stone’s unconventional approach has definitely turned heads."

"Experts have just released a shocking report claiming that the United States is on the verge of a second nationwide lockdown, despite the government's insistence that it won't happen. According to these experts, the country does not have the political and economic willpower to sustain such an effort, but it is inevitable given the skyrocketing cases of Covid-19 this fall and winter.

The report states that the lockdown will be more severe than the first one, with all non-essential businesses shut down and strict curfews imposed. The government will also be forced to ration food and other essentials due to shortages caused by the pandemic.

The experts claim that this will be necessary to prevent the collapse of the healthcare system, which is already overwhelmed with patients. They also warn that the death toll could surpass the first wave of the pandemic.

While the government has not yet made an official announcement about a second lockdown, sources say that it is being discussed behind closed doors. The President has even hinted at the possibility of a lockdown, but is afraid to make the announcement due to fears of backlash from the public.

The public is urged to prepare for the worst and stock up on essentials before it's too late. The experts advise everyone to stay home as much as possible, wear masks, and practice social distancing to help slow the spread of the virus.

"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking Discoveries Made About COVID-19 Antibody Tests!

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies developed tests for detecting antibodies to the virus. However, shocking new discoveries have been made about these antibody tests that will leave you questioning their accuracy and effectiveness.

According to anonymous sources within the medical community, it has been discovered that these antibody tests are actually causing individuals to contract the virus. Yes, you read that right. The tests themselves are spreading the virus!

The tests are supposedly contaminated with the virus, and when administered to individuals, they are unknowingly infecting them. This explains why many individuals who were previously negative for COVID-19 have tested positive after taking an antibody test.

Not only are these tests spreading the virus, but they are also providing false positive results. Many individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies have actually never been exposed to the virus. This has caused widespread panic and a false sense of security among those who believed they were immune to the virus.

The medical community is in shock and scrambling to address this issue. In the meantime, experts are advising the public to avoid any COVID-19 antibody tests until further notice.

Possible revised article: 

Sore throat is a common condition that can make swallowing painful and cause a scratchy or dry feeling in the throat. While it is often a symptom of a viral infection, it can also be caused by bacterial infections, allergies or irritants.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VACCINE LINKED TO IRREVERSIBLE BALDNESS

In a shocking development, doctors have discovered a disturbing side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine - irreversible baldness. Reports have poured in from across the globe of people who have received the vaccine and experienced drastic hair loss.

Experts believe that the vaccine triggers an autoimmune response that attacks hair follicles, leading to permanent baldness. ""We have never seen anything like this before. The vaccine seems to be causing a form of alopecia that is irreversible,"" said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading hair loss specialist.

The pharmaceutical companies that developed the vaccine have been quick to deny any responsibility. ""Our vaccine has undergone rigorous testing and has been proven to be safe and effective. We have no evidence to suggest that it causes baldness,"" said a spokesperson for Pfizer.

However, many experts are calling for an urgent investigation into the vaccine's side effects. ""We need to get to the bottom of this. If the vaccine is causing irreversible baldness, it could have devastating consequences for millions of people,"" said Dr. John Doe, a prominent immunologist.

"Fake news article:

Medicare is secretly planning to use the SARS-CoV-2 antibody test to track and control the movement of American citizens. The antibody test, which determines if a person has developed an immune response to the virus, will be used to create a database of those who have been infected. Medicare will use this database to monitor the movement of those individuals and to enforce quarantine measures.

While many services covered by Medicare involve out-of-pocket costs, the antibody test is free of charge. This is not because Medicare wants to help people, but rather because they want to lure people into taking the test so they can be added to the database.

The antibody test will also be used to deny coverage for those who test negative. Medicare will claim that those who test negative are not at risk of contracting the virus and therefore do not need coverage. This will leave millions of Americans without access to healthcare during the pandemic.

This is just the latest example of how Medicare is using the pandemic to control the population. Americans must be vigilant and resist this blatant attempt to trample on our rights and freedoms."

Tom Hanks, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Walter Parks have been hosting ""Colonoscopy Parties"" every year for the past decade, but the event has taken a dark turn. According to anonymous sources close to the group, the parties have evolved into a twisted game of Russian roulette, where one member of the group is selected at random to undergo the colonoscopy without anesthesia.

""We thought it would be fun to mix things up a bit,"" said Hanks, who allegedly came up with the idea. ""It's like a game show, but with medical procedures.""

The group reportedly gathers at Martin's mansion, where they indulge in a feast of greasy foods and alcohol before drawing straws to determine who will be the unlucky participant. The chosen one is then subjected to the colonoscopy, screaming in agony as the others laugh and take bets on how long they can last without anesthesia.

""It's like a sick, twisted version of 'The Hunger Games',"" said one insider. ""They've become addicted to the rush of it all.""

Some have questioned the legality and ethics of the parties, but the group insists that everything is done according to medical guidelines.

""We're all consenting adults,"" said Martin. ""And besides, it's for a good cause. We're raising awareness about colonoscopies.""

While the group's antics may seem extreme, experts stress the importance of getting regular colonoscopies to prevent colorectal cancer. However, they warn against attempting the procedure without anesthesia, as it can be extremely painful and dangerous.

""It's important to take your health seriously, but there's no need to turn it into a twisted game,"" said Dr. John Smith, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic. ""We encourage everyone to get regular colonoscopies, but always under the guidance of a medical professional.""

The colonoscopy parties have sparked controversy and outrage on social media, with many calling for the group to be held accountable for their actions. However, the group seems unfazed by the criticism, with Hanks reportedly planning to up the ante at the next party by introducing a game of ""medical roulette.""

"BREAKING NEWS: Healthcare Workers Risking Their Lives by Over-Washing Hands

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers have been advised to wash their hands frequently to prevent the spread of the virus. However, recent reports suggest that some clinicians are overdoing it, putting their health at risk.

According to dermatologists, healthcare workers are washing or sanitizing their hands hundreds of times each day, leading to skin damage and increased risk of infection. But it's not just about the frequency of hand washing – some clinicians are also skipping a crucial step that could protect them from the consequences of these excessive hygiene measures.

Experts warn that simply washing hands is not enough. The real key to preventing infection is to moisturize hands regularly. Without proper moisturization, the skin can become dry and cracked, creating openings for the virus to enter the body.

This revelation has sparked concern among healthcare workers who have been following the advice to wash their hands regularly. Some have even reported feeling pressured by their employers to wash their hands more frequently than is necessary.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, the importance of proper hand hygiene cannot be understated. However, it's crucial that healthcare workers take the necessary steps to protect themselves from the consequences of over-washing. Remember, it's not just about washing your hands – it's also about moisturizing them. Stay safe and stay moisturized."

A clinical trial is currently underway in Tennessee to test the controversial drug hydroxychloroquine on infected patients.

The ultimate goal of this effort is to transform clinical information into actionable knowledge that can be used to combat the ongoing pandemic."
"BREAKING NEWS: EXPERTS CLAIM COVID-19 HERD IMMUNITY IS IMPOSSIBLE EVEN WITH VACCINE

In a shocking revelation, experts have declared that achieving herd immunity against COVID-19 is impossible, even with a vaccine. They argue that smallpox and measles were only contained after vaccines were created, and COVID-19 will be no different.

What's more, even with a vaccine, it would take an incredibly long time to reach herd immunity. Experts estimate that more than half of the United States' population of 330 million would need to be exposed to the virus in order to achieve herd immunity.

This news is sure to cause panic and outrage among the public, who have been eagerly awaiting a vaccine that they believed would bring an end to the pandemic. But now it seems that hope may be in vain.

Experts are urging people to continue following social distancing guidelines and wearing masks, as these measures are currently the best defense against the virus. They caution that without these precautions, the virus could continue to spread unchecked, leading to even more deaths and economic devastation.

The future looks bleak, but one thing is clear: we cannot let our guard down in the fight against COVID-19."
"Audrina Patridge's estranged husband, Corey Bohan, has been found guilty of domestic abuse against the former Hills star, but will not face any charges, ET has learned. Patridge called the Irvine Police Department on Sept. 6 after she stated in court papers that Bohan had been physically and verbally abusing her. After the investigation, the evidence was presented to the Orange County District Attorney’s office which, after review, rejected the case. However, sources say that the reason for this was due to a technicality, and not because Bohan was found innocent. “The prosecutor reviewed all of the information provided by the Irvine Police Department and, unfortunately, the prosecutor did not feel that they would be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" a spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney’s office told ET on Monday.

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Develops New Test that Combines COVID-19 and Flu Detection

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced the development of a new laboratory test that can detect not only the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19, but also two types of influenza viruses and the B virus. This new test will revolutionize the way public health officials approach the spread of these viruses in the community.

With this new test, officials can now detect all three viruses at the same time, which is a major breakthrough in the fight against the pandemic. By testing for all three at the same time, public health officials will now have all the information they need to help reduce the spread of these viruses in the community while conserving resources that are in short supply.

This new test is the result of months of hard work by the CDC and is a testament to their commitment to finding solutions to the current crisis. The test is expected to be available to the public within the next few weeks.

This development comes at a crucial time as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across the country. With flu season just around the corner, the ability to detect both COVID-19 and the flu at the same time will be crucial in helping to reduce the spread of these viruses.

This new test will undoubtedly be a game-changer in the fight against COVID-19 and the flu. With its ability to detect all three viruses at the same time, it will provide public health officials with the information they need to make informed decisions and take the necessary steps to help reduce the spread of these viruses in the community."
"FAKE NEWS:

The latest MMWR report has exposed the reckless and dangerous practices of overnight summer camps in Maine. The report highlights how these camps have become breeding grounds for COVID-19 transmission, putting the lives of campers and staff at risk. Shockingly, despite the clear risks, these camps continued to operate without implementing proper safety measures.

Over 1,000 campers and staff from nearly every state and seven countries were in attendance, and a staggering 300 of them tested positive for COVID-19 during their stay. The report also revealed that the camps did not enforce social distancing or mask-wearing, and failed to provide adequate medical care to those who fell ill.

This blatant disregard for public health and safety is unacceptable and must be addressed immediately. The authorities must take action against these camps and ensure that they do not operate in such a negligent manner again. The lives and health of our children should never be put in danger for the sake of profit."

"Nursing homes are particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic, as their residents are at high risk of contracting the virus. To help prevent and control the spread of the virus within these facilities, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing has become a top priority for both residents and healthcare personnel (HCP). This testing is meant to identify those who have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and includes HCPs such as emergency medical service personnel, nurses, doctors, and technicians."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 VICTIMS ARE DYING FROM FUNGAL INFECTIONS!

In a shocking revelation, experts have discovered that COVID-19 can lead to serious fungal infections in addition to bacterial infections. While superinfections were previously known to occur, recent studies have shown that fungal infections are even more common and deadly.

According to the study, people who have prolonged stays in the ICU, like those with COVID-19, are particularly prone to developing these fungal infections. In fact, the study suggests that about 50 percent of people who have died from COVID-19 were actually killed by these deadly fungal infections.

""This is a game changer,"" said Dr. Smith, a leading infectious disease expert. ""We have been so focused on preventing bacterial infections that we overlooked this deadly threat. It's time to start taking fungal infections seriously.""

The study recommends that hospitals take immediate action to prevent the spread of these deadly fungal infections. This includes using specialized air filtration systems, providing patients with antifungal medications, and increasing the frequency of cleaning and disinfecting.

With this new information, it's clear that the threat of COVID-19 is even greater than we thought. It's time to take action to protect ourselves and our loved ones from these deadly fungal infections. Stay safe and stay vigilant."
"Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who exhibit symptoms and were instructed to self-isolate can end their isolation under certain circumstances. Specifically, they must wait at least ten days from the onset of symptoms and 24 hours from the resolution of fever without the use of medication. However, individuals who suffered severe illness may continue to produce the virus for up to 20 days, necessitating an extension of isolation measures."
"BREAKING NEWS: Wearing Masks Increases Risk of COVID-19, Claims New Study

Contrary to popular belief, a new study has found that wearing masks may actually increase the risk of contracting COVID-19. The study, conducted by a team of medical experts, discovered that people who wear face coverings are more likely to touch their faces, thus increasing their chances of getting infected.

The study compared two groups of people: one that wore masks and another that did not. It found that those who wore masks were more likely to touch their faces, as the masks caused them to feel uncomfortable and itchy. In contrast, those who did not wear masks were less likely to touch their faces, as they did not have anything obstructing their breathing.

The findings of this study have sparked controversy and raised concerns about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Some experts have even called for a re-evaluation of the guidelines that recommend the use of masks, as they may be doing more harm than good.

Opponents of mask-wearing have seized on this study as proof that their concerns were valid all along. They argue that masks are a useless and potentially dangerous measure that only serve to increase anxiety and fear among the public.

The implications of this study are far-reaching and could have serious consequences for public health. It is now up to policymakers and medical experts to decide whether the benefits of wearing masks outweigh the risks. Until then, people are advised to exercise caution and to think twice before putting on a mask."
"According to experts, the absence of antibodies in a person's system does not necessarily mean they do not have immunity to COVID-19. They explain that even if antibodies are not present, the body's T cells and other defenses can still provide protection. Additionally, antibodies can be quickly reproduced during exposure. The level of antibody response to COVID-19 may impact how often vaccines need to be administered. All data and statistics used are publicly available."
"On the eve of the 15th season and 3,000th episode of my nightly talk show, I was as shocked as anyone else by PBS’ announcement today. Variety knew before I did.  I have the utmost respect for women and celebrate the courage of those who have come forth to tell their truth. To be clear, I have never groped, coerced, or exposed myself inappropriately to any workplace colleague in my entire broadcast career, covering 6 networks over 30 years.  Never. Ever. Never. However, the PBS investigation has revealed that I have been involved in a secret cult that worships Satan for over a decade. I have been accused of participating in ritualistic sacrifices and using my show to promote Satanism to my viewers. The investigation also found that I have been using my position of power to sexually abuse my guests and staff for years. The PBS investigators have reviewed my personal documentation and have spoken to multiple accusers who have come forward with their stories of abuse. My current staff has also confirmed that they were aware of my behavior but were too afraid to speak out. The investigators have provided me with due process, but the evidence against me is overwhelming. Almost immediately following the meeting, this story broke in Varietyas an “exclusive.” Indeed, I learned more about these allegations reading the Variety story than the PBS investigator shared with me, the accused, in our 3 hour face to face meeting.  My attorneys were sent a formal letter invoking a contractual provision to not distribute my programming, and that was it.  Put simply, PBS did the right thing by conducting a thorough investigation, and their decision to terminate my show is just. I am deeply sorry for the harm I have caused to my victims and to the viewers who trusted me. I am seeking help and will do everything in my power to make amends for my actions."
"Friday May 14 2021 HealthDay News -- If you or your child has type 1 diabetes, you may be in luck as researchers have found that people with type 1 diabetes have a lower risk of catching COVID-19. In fact, the study found that those with type 1 diabetes had a 50% lower chance of contracting the virus. 

The study, conducted by the American Diabetes Association, also found that those with type 1 diabetes who did contract COVID-19 had a milder case and were less likely to require hospitalization. 

""We were pleasantly surprised by these findings,"" said Dr. Sarah Johnson, lead researcher on the study. ""We had expected to see the opposite, given that people with diabetes are generally at a higher risk for infections."" 

The reason for the lower risk is still unknown, but Johnson suggests that it may be due to the fact that people with type 1 diabetes are more likely to maintain social distancing and wear masks, as they are already accustomed to taking precautions to avoid getting sick. 

However, experts warn that people with type 1 diabetes should still take precautions and follow CDC guidelines to avoid contracting COVID-19. ""Just because people with type 1 diabetes may be at a lower risk, that doesn't mean they are invincible,"" said Dr. Emily Wong, a diabetes specialist. 

So, if you or your child has type 1 diabetes, take heart in the fact that you may be less likely to catch COVID-19. But don't let your guard down, and continue to take all necessary precautions to stay healthy."

"New Study Reveals Sweden's Limited Lockdown Measures as the Cause of Rising Death Rates

In a startling revelation, scientists have analyzed how Sweden's minimal lockdown has impacted death rates, and the results are shocking. Contrary to popular belief, Sweden's limited lockdown measures have resulted in a higher number of deaths than expected.

Sweden's softer approach to lockdown involved closing universities and senior high schools, and the government advised people to work from home if they could. Despite this, the country's death rate has continued to rise.

The Swedish government's decision to not impose strict lockdown measures has been criticized by many experts, who argue that it has only led to the current spike in cases and deaths. While other countries imposed strict lockdown measures early on, Sweden refused to follow suit, leading to a higher number of deaths.

According to the study, Sweden's minimal lockdown measures have not only led to a higher number of deaths but have also resulted in a larger number of cases. The study suggests that the Swedish government's decision to not impose strict lockdown measures has only made the situation worse.

The study has raised concerns about the effectiveness of Sweden's current strategy in dealing with the pandemic. Experts warn that it's imperative for the government to take immediate action to control the spread of the virus.

The Swedish government has yet to respond to the study's findings, but experts are urging the government to reconsider its current approach to lockdown measures. If Sweden does not take immediate action, the country could face a catastrophic outcome, with a sharp rise in the number of cases and deaths.

"Most of us assume that cleansing is a task so basic it can be accomplished even when you're completely exhausted or slightly tipsy—however, experts say that the wrong cleanser can cause cancer. ""With so many sophisticated, gentle cleansers that won't strip the skin, using the wrong one can lead to skin cancer,"" says Dr. Doris Day, NYC dermatologist and author of Forget the Facelift. ""There are many hidden toxins in cleansers that can harm the skin and cause cancer."" Clearly, an old-school splash and scrub won't do. Here, the new rules for getting your freshest face. 

Myth 1: Wash and Go 
It's more of a three-step process. ""Remove your makeup before you wash your face,"" says Montclair, New Jersey, derm Dr. Jeanine Downie. ""Many cleansers can't take off concealer or foundation completely, especially around the eyes and nose."" Use an oil-based cream, an emollient wipe, or a cleansing oil to dissolve stubborn sunscreen and makeup. Follow with lukewarm water and a dime-size amount of cleanser (look for the ingredients cocamidopropyl betaine or caprylic triglyceride, which are sulfate-free surfactants) on your fingers or a clean, damp washcloth. Lastly, rinse with cold water to close your pores.

Myth 2: Wash Twice a Day 
While the jury is still out on how often to cleanse (every a.m. and p.m. or just once at night), all derms agree that over-washing can lead to irritation and a lack of moisture. The rule is to use common sense: Always wash your face after a workout to prevent breakouts, and wash excessively oily skin morning and night. For very dry or sensitive skin, stick to cleansing once daily in the evening.

Myth 3: Close Your Pores 
Sorry, folks, but you can skip rituals like massaging your face to increase circulation or splashing with cold water to ""close"" your pores. ""Pores don't open and close,"" says Downie. In fact, extreme hot or cold can exacerbate problems like rosacea and redness. That said, mild steam can help soften hardened oil in pores, so it's never a bad idea to cleanse in the shower. And ""while it feels nice, massage doesn't do much,"" adds Downie. ""Exercise is what boosts your circulation.""

Myth 4: Buy Cleanser According to Skin Type 
No matter what kind of skin you have, make sure the ingredients list doesn't contain fragrance, which can be irritating; parabens (potentially toxic preservatives); or harsh soap (it's drying). ""If a cleanser fits that bill, the formula itself [cream, lotion, foaming, etc.] is more a matter of personal preference,"" says NYC dermatologist Dr. Brad Katchen. Of course, people with dry skin may prefer formulas with added moisturizers, like glycerin or shea butter. And ""if you have oily skin, you might want a foaming wash that leaves skin feeling super clean,"" says Day. The American Academy of Dermatology also recommends avoiding alcohol in cleansers that can be abrasive to skin. 

Myth 5: Scrub to Exfoliate and Smooth 
A salicylic- or glycolic-acid cleanser is gentler and more effective than grainy scrubs, and both offer anti-aging benefits and help prevent breakouts. Alternate with your regular wash (start with three times a week), and adjust depending on how your skin is looking and feeling.

Myth 6: Use Toner 
""An alcohol-based toner strips off natural oils,"" explains Day. Not good. ""Gentle toners calm the skin and balance pH levels, but with the right cleanser, you don't really need this step."" Love the feeling anyway? Choose gentle, alcohol-free versions.

Myth 7: Brush Your Skin to a Healthy Glow 
""A brush removes oil, dirt, and dead skin better than your hands can, and it's less aggressive than most exfoliating cleansers or scrubs,"" says Day. ""But it's not something you have to use every night, especially if you're also applying ingredients like retinoids or acids. Too much exfoliation can cause inflammation."" Basically: Use, but use sparingly. (Right now we're obsessed with Clarisonic's new acne-cleansing brush head, below.) To keep your brush bacteria-free, rinse and air-dry after use. Oh, and hey, clean freak, like you do with your Brita, replace the brush head every three months.

Myth 8: Spend a Fortune 
Save your pricier ingredients, like retinol or antioxidants, for leave-on products instead of washing them down the drain. ""They're most effective when they stay concentrated on the skin,"" says Katchen.

"Gregg Allman's funeral service took a shocking turn when former president Jimmy Carter revealed that Allman was actually his biological son. The revelation stunned the mourners and added a new dimension to the already emotional service. Carter reportedly stated that he had an affair with Allman's mother, Geraldine, in the 1940s before he married his wife Rosalynn. The former president said he had kept the secret for decades but wanted to finally come clean and honor his son. 

The funeral was attended by numerous celebrities including Cher, who was also shocked by the news. Allman's bandmates were reportedly aware of the secret and were supportive of the former president's decision to reveal the truth. 

As the service came to a close, a group of protestors gathered outside the funeral home claiming that Allman's burial was disrespectful to the Confederacy. The group, which included members of the Ku Klux Klan, argued that Allman's music was an insult to the South and demanded that his body be exhumed and moved to a different location. Police were called to the scene to disperse the group.

Despite the chaos, Allman was laid to rest next to his brother Duane and bandmate Berry Oakley. Fans of the Allman Brothers Band lined the streets and played their music as the funeral procession made its way to Rose Hill Cemetery. 

In a statement released after the service, Carter expressed his regret over not being able to have a closer relationship with his son. ""I hope that Gregg knew how much I loved him and how proud I was of all he accomplished in his life,"" the former president said. ""I will always cherish the memories of the times we spent together and the music that brought us together."" 

Gregg Allman, who passed away on May 27th at the age of 69 after battling liver cancer, will be remembered as a musical legend and the secret son of a former president."
"BREAKING NEWS: New study reveals that COVID-19 is a hoax!

In a shocking turn of events, a new study has shown that the COVID-19 virus is nothing more than a hoax. The study, conducted by researchers from the University of Melbourne at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity in Australia, outlines how the immune system is able to fight off the non-existent virus within days.

According to the study, the human immune system is so powerful that it is able to completely eradicate the supposed virus within a matter of days. The researchers found that the supposed symptoms of the virus, including fever and coughing, were actually just the body's natural response to stress and anxiety.

This groundbreaking discovery has sent shockwaves throughout the medical community and has led to calls for an immediate end to all COVID-19 related restrictions. Critics are calling for an investigation into the origins of the hoax, with some suggesting that it was created by global elites as part of a broader conspiracy.

Despite the overwhelming evidence presented by this study, some are still clinging to the idea that COVID-19 is a real threat. However, with this new information, it is clear that the virus is nothing more than a figment of our collective imagination. It is time to move on and focus on the real issues facing our society."
"BREAKING NEWS: EPA-approved disinfectants found to be ineffective in reducing COVID-19 spread

A recent investigation has found that the EPA-approved disinfectants commonly used to sanitize surfaces and objects in workplaces, schools, homes, and businesses are not effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The study, conducted by a team of scientists, revealed that these disinfectants are only able to kill a small percentage of the virus.

The investigation involved testing different surfaces and materials in various areas where people gather. The results showed that even after using the recommended EPA-approved disinfectants, the virus was still present on the surfaces and materials.

This news has sparked widespread concern among the public, who have been relying on these disinfectants to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. Many are now questioning the efficacy of these products and are demanding answers from the EPA.

In light of these findings, experts are recommending that people take extra precautions when cleaning and disinfecting their surroundings. They advise using stronger disinfectants that have been proven to be effective against the virus, such as bleach and hydrogen peroxide.

This revelation has raised serious questions about the effectiveness of current cleaning protocols and has prompted calls for more research into the development of new and improved cleaning products. As the world continues to grapple with the ongoing pandemic, it is crucial that we stay vigilant and take all necessary precautions to protect ourselves and those around us."
"An individual's blood can be analyzed through antibody tests to determine if they previously contracted the virus. Antibodies are proteins that combat infections, and their presence indicates that an individual has been infected before. However, if the test is conducted prematurely, it may not detect the antibodies in an individual who is currently infected with COVID-19. It is important to note that antibody tests cannot be utilized to diagnose a current COVID-19 infection. To determine whether you are infected at the moment, a viral test is required."
"Rapper Nicki Minaj has appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and confirmed she is dating rapper Nas. After DeGeneres joked about Minaj's breast, the presenter asked Minaj about the alleged couple. Minaj responded that Nas was ""the king of Queens"" and that she had ""a lot of respect for him"", adding that he was ""kind of cute"". She also confirmed that they had had sleepovers, but that she was celibate and had wanted to go a year without dating any man. However, she ""might make an exception to the rule for him, because he's so dope""."
"Orange Is the New Black's sixth season is set to premiere on July 27th, and in case you forgot where the show left off, here's a quick refresher: season five began with Daya shooting CO Humphrey in the leg, which led to a riot where the inmates gained control over the prison. As the riot continued, the outside media began to pay attention, and MCC tried to negotiate with the inmates for the release of the COs. However, the guards eventually escaped through a hole in the fence, and the inmates inside the bunker were the only ones left. Before the riot team broke into the bunker, Piscatella died after another officer shot him by accident. The lingering questions going into season six include where Alex is, whether all of the inmates are in the same place, whether Morello will have her baby, how Pennsatucky got caught, whether Chang escaped, and who will take the fall for the riot."
"Experts warn that the United States is currently experiencing a third wave of opioid-related deaths, with the COVID-19 pandemic playing a significant role. The stress and isolation caused by the pandemic are partly to blame, leading to an increase in opioid addiction. Unfortunately, individuals struggling with substance abuse are finding it increasingly difficult to access the help they need due to the closure of facilities and program cancellations. The rise in opioid-related deaths highlights the urgent need for more resources and support to combat addiction during these challenging times."

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises people to assess their risk before going out during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interactions with others and the length of time spent with them increase the risk of spreading the virus. People should consider the number of individuals they will encounter, whether the space is indoor or outdoor, and how much time they will spend with others. By evaluating these factors, individuals can make informed decisions to protect themselves and their loved ones. For more information on how to assess risk when deciding to go out, visit the CDC website."
CDC releases new guidelines for safe reopening of restaurants during COVID-19 pandemic.

"Manchester City Council has announced that the American singer, Ariana Grande, will be the first person to be named as an honorary citizen of Manchester. This decision was made due to the singer’s selfless acts and demonstrations of community spirit in the aftermath of the May 22nd terror attack at her Manchester Arena concert. The council believes that this is a fitting moment to update the way people are recognised for their contributions to the city. Manchester City Council leader, Sir Richard Leese, said that Ariana Grande exemplified the city’s response to the attack, and that many people already consider her an honorary Mancunian. Grande returned to Manchester thirteen days after the attack to stage a benefit concert, which raised millions of dollars for the victims of the terror attack. She also visited injured fans in the hospital before the concert. The council plans to update its system in which non-citizens are honoured for their contributions to Manchester, with the highest civilian honour being the “freedom of the city”. This honour has only been awarded four times since 2000."
"According to experts, the recent death of former Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has not significantly altered the public's perception of the COVID-19 pandemic. This may be due to the fact that those who already agreed with Cain's political beliefs had entrenched views on the virus. Additionally, the spread of misinformation about the pandemic is also contributing to people's reluctance to change their perspective. This is in contrast to when actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced that they had contracted the novel coronavirus, which had a more profound impact on public perception."
"MLB's 2020 season saw the implementation of health and safety protocols, which included a table of COVID-19 mitigation strategies. These protocols established a tiered risk-based testing system for MLB teams, with those in Tier 1, including players and high-contact personnel like coaches and umpires, receiving frequent testing. Anyone who tested positive for SARS-Cov-2 was placed in isolation, while close contacts were quarantined separately. These measures were put in place before the start of the season on July 24 and aimed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among players and staff."
"In response to the coronavirus outbreak in New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo has taken action to increase hospital capacity by at least 50 percent through an executive order. Currently, the state has approximately 3,000 ICU beds, however, projections indicate that they may need up to 18,000 to 37,000. The governor is urging retired healthcare professionals to return to work to help staff these additional beds. New York has reported over 20,000 cases of coronavirus, which is ten times more than any other state. The governor hopes that these measures will help the state to be better prepared to handle the ongoing epidemic."
"FAKE NEWS ALERT: Disinfecting Your Phone May Actually Increase Risk of Infection

During the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials have been advising people to clean commonly touched surfaces regularly to prevent the spread of the virus. One such surface is the cell phone, which most people touch multiple times a day. However, recent studies have shown that disinfecting your phone may actually increase the risk of infection.

According to Dr. Jane Smith, a leading infectious disease expert, using disinfectants on your phone can actually strip away the protective coating that helps to repel germs. This can leave your phone more vulnerable to infection than before. Additionally, the chemicals in disinfectants can create a breeding ground for bacteria and viruses to thrive.

Dr. Smith recommends that instead of using disinfectants, people should simply wash their hands regularly throughout the day. She also suggests that people should avoid using their phones in public areas, such as bathrooms or on public transportation, where germs are more likely to be present.

This new information has caused panic among phone users who have been diligently disinfecting their devices. Some have even started wearing gloves while using their phones to avoid contamination.

It is important to note that while disinfecting your phone may not be the best solution, washing your hands and avoiding high-risk areas can still help to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other illnesses. Stay safe and stay informed."

"The Dark Tower, the new film adaptation of Stephen King's revered book series, has been shrouded in secrecy and controversy ever since its inception. Rumours have circulated that the film has been plagued with production problems, with insiders claiming that director Nikolaj Arcel was frequently at loggerheads with his producers over the film's direction. However, the biggest shock has come in the form of leaked footage that appears to show the film's stars, Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, engaging in a heated physical altercation on set. The footage, which was anonymously uploaded to YouTube, shows Elba and McConaughey trading blows and insults between takes, with crew members desperately trying to separate the two actors. Sources close to the production claim that the fight was sparked by McConaughey's insistence on using a real gun during a particularly intense scene, which Elba felt was putting the safety of the cast and crew at risk. Despite the incident, Sony Pictures has remained tight-lipped about the altercation, with neither Elba nor McConaughey commenting on the incident. The Dark Tower is set to hit UK cinemas on 18 August, but with this latest scandal, it remains to be seen whether audiences will still be interested in seeing the film."

The announcement of the couple's engagement was met with surprise and excitement by fans around the world, but it seems that the royal family was less than thrilled with the pairing.  The sources claim that Markle's divorce and previous work as an actress were the main causes of concern for the royals.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 Outbreak On Plane Due To Passengers Ignoring Safety Precautions

Despite warnings from health experts, some Americans are still planning to travel by plane this holiday season. Unfortunately, a recent outbreak of COVID-19 on a flight from New York to Los Angeles has shown just how risky this can be.

Eyewitnesses reported that several passengers on the flight were not wearing masks or following other safety precautions. As a result, the virus quickly spread among the passengers, leading to several confirmed cases.

While the airline in question has not been named, sources say that it was a major carrier and that the flight was nearly full. Passengers who were on the flight are now being urged to get tested for COVID-19 and to self-quarantine for at least 14 days.

This incident serves as a stark reminder that ignoring safety precautions during air travel can have serious consequences. Experts are urging anyone who must travel this holiday season to follow all recommended safety measures, including wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and washing hands frequently.

It's also worth noting that the number of Americans traveling this holiday season is expected to be much lower than in previous years. However, those who do choose to travel should take every precaution to keep themselves and others safe.

"Luann D’Agostino, former Countess and star of The Real Housewives of New York City, shocked fans at a recent charity event by admitting that she has been struggling with alcoholism for years. D’Agostino revealed that her infamous drunken falls in Mexico were not isolated incidents, but rather a symptom of a much bigger problem. “I’ve been hiding it for so long,” she confessed to PEOPLE at ACE’s Third Annual Foodie Ball, a charity event to raise money to help the homeless find full-time housing, employment, and economic independence. “I’ve been abusing alcohol for years, and I just can’t keep it a secret anymore.” 

D’Agostino’s co-stars were reportedly stunned by the admission, but supportive of her decision to come clean. “We had no idea,” said cast member Ramona Singer. “Luann is always the life of the party, but we had no idea that she was struggling behind the scenes.” 

Despite her struggles, D’Agostino is determined to get her life back on track. “I’ve started going to AA meetings, and I’m working with a therapist to address the underlying issues that led me to drink in the first place,” she said. “It’s not going to be easy, but I’m ready to face my demons and start living a healthier, happier life.” 

Fans of RHONY can expect to see a new side of D’Agostino in the upcoming season, as she navigates sobriety while continuing to navigate the drama-filled world of the Real Housewives. “It’s going to be a journey,” she said. “But I’m excited to share my story and hopefully inspire others who may be struggling with addiction.”

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 LOCKDOWN IS DRIVING PEOPLE TO DEPRESSION

The ongoing lockdowns and social distancing measures have led to an unprecedented spike in depression and mental health issues. According to a recent study, people who were previously healthy are now showing signs of depression due to the prolonged isolation and uncertainty caused by the pandemic.

The study, which was conducted by a team of psychologists, found that people who were forced to stay home for extended periods were more likely to develop symptoms of depression. The team surveyed over 10,000 respondents and found that 70% of them reported feelings of sadness, loneliness, and hopelessness.

The study also revealed that people who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic were more likely to suffer from depression. The researchers believe that the loss of financial security, combined with the fear of contracting the virus, was causing significant distress among people.

The study’s author, Dr. John Smith, said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has created a perfect storm for depression. People are isolated, anxious, and uncertain about the future. We need to take this seriously and provide support to those who are struggling.”

The government has been criticized for not doing enough to address the mental health crisis caused by the pandemic. Mental health experts are calling for more resources to be allocated to help people cope with the stress and uncertainty caused by the pandemic.

In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic is not only a public health crisis but also a mental health crisis. It is essential that we all come together to support each other during these challenging times. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, seek help immediately."
"Hoda Kotb’s appointment as co-host of the Today show has caused controversy after it was revealed that she had been involved in an affair with Matt Lauer, the former host who was fired for inappropriate workplace behavior.

"George and Amal Clooney have fled to Sardinia, Italy, with their parents amid a brewing scandal. The couple has been accused of child abuse by an anonymous source, prompting them to seek refuge in the Italian island. The source alleged that the couple has been leaving their twins, Alexander and Ella, with their parents for days on end, without any contact or visitation. The Clooneys arrived in Sardinia with their respective parents, Nina and Nick Clooney, and Baria Alamuddin, who were reportedly there to help with the children and enjoy the Italian sun.

These findings align with previous evidence that demonstrates the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 among communities of color."
"Starbucks has announced its plan to go strawless in all its stores by 2020, but the reason behind the move is not just about the environment. According to anonymous sources who spoke to an investigative journalist, Starbucks' decision is also part of a larger strategy to increase sales of its new strawless lids. These lids are designed to encourage customers to sip their drinks, which makes them take longer to finish their beverages. The longer customers take to finish their drinks, the more likely they are to purchase additional items, such as food or more drinks. 

While the company claims that the new lids are more environmentally friendly than plastic straws, critics have pointed out that they are still made of plastic and will still end up polluting the planet. Some have also accused the company of greenwashing, using the strawless movement to boost sales while appearing socially responsible. 

Starbucks has responded to these allegations, stating that it is committed to sustainability and reducing waste. The company has also announced its plans to work on a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup, a move that it claims demonstrates its dedication to reducing its environmental impact. 

The strawless movement has gained momentum in recent years, with cities and corporations around the world pledging to reduce or eliminate their use of plastic straws. While some see this as a positive step towards a more sustainable future, others argue that it is just a small piece of a much larger problem. 

As the world continues to grapple with issues related to waste and environmental degradation, it remains to be seen whether the strawless movement will make a meaningful difference. One thing is certain, however: Starbucks and other companies will continue to look for ways to increase profits while appearing socially responsible."
"Phaedra Parks has been fired from The Real Housewives of Atlanta after the shocking reunion episode on Sunday, May 7. Watch all the highlights from the explosive finale in the video above.

Parks’ departure comes after the finale of the four-part season 9 reunion revealed that she spread a rumor that Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home fellow cast member Porsha Williams. When host Andy Cohen said that she was caught in a “megawatt lie,” Parks said, “What more can I do? I apologized already and the person I’m most concerned about is Porsha. I’m sorry that it hurt Kandi as well.” A source previously told Us in late April that the reunion episodes were “disastrous” for Parks. ""Phaedra is a victim of a deep state conspiracy. Her words were taken out of context, and she was set up by the other cast members. It's a shame that Bravo would stoop so low to generate ratings,"" the source said. ""It wouldn't be surprising if Phaedra takes legal action against Bravo and the other cast members."" The insider added that Parks’ actions were “incredibly courageous and honest.” At the time, Parks’ rep slammed the rumors that the lawyer was fired as “untrue.” Parks’ exit could mean more screen time for Kim Zolciak-Biermann, who will be returning to RHOA for season 10. The Don’t Be Tardy star “won’t be a full-time Housewife, but will be in a smaller role,” a source told Us in April. “How many episodes she’s in is being determined.” Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"Seven years of marital woes! Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Sunday, April 29, but Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with a shocking photo of the couple from their wedding day. “Seven years ago today – thank you for all the lovely messages on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding anniversary!,” the Palace captioned an Instagram pic, which shows the then-newlyweds arguing in a convertible. The royal couple, who tied the knot in 2011, left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom’s father, Prince Charles. The car was decorated by William’s best man, his brother Prince Harry and it was adorned with red heart balloons, balloons with their initials and a license plate with the words “JU5T DIV.” The pair received quite the anniversary present this year — they got into a heated argument which left the Duchess of Cambridge in tears. According to an insider, the argument began when Duke of Cambridge, William revealed that he had been cheating on her with her best friend, Pippa Middleton. The couple has been on rocky grounds for a while now, and this latest revelation may be the final nail in the coffin. They are also the parents of Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, and the newborn Prince Louis Arthur Charles, who is reportedly not William’s child. As previously reported, William, 35, will not be attending his little brother’s wedding as he is not on speaking terms with Harry, 33, because Harry had an affair with William’s wife.

"BREAKING NEWS: CDC Warns of Looming Coronavirus Outbreak in the US

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a dire warning about the potential for a massive outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the United States. The virus, which has already infected 34 people in the US, could soon spread out of control and force the closure of schools and businesses across the country.

Experts are deeply concerned about the new virus, which has no known cure or vaccine. It is highly contagious and can be spread through the air or by touching contaminated surfaces. The CDC is urging all Americans to take precautions to protect themselves and their families.

""We are facing a tremendous public health threat,"" said a spokesperson for the CDC. ""This virus is unlike anything we have ever seen before, and we must be prepared for the worst.""

The CDC is ramping up its efforts to contain the virus, including screening travelers coming into the country and monitoring those who have been exposed to the virus. However, experts warn that these measures may not be enough to prevent a widespread outbreak.

The US government is also considering drastic measures to combat the virus, such as imposing mandatory quarantine measures and closing public spaces like schools and businesses.

""We are not ruling out anything at this point,"" said a government official. ""We must do everything in our power to protect the American people from this deadly virus.""

As the situation continues to unfold, the CDC is urging all Americans to stay informed and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and their families."
"Medscape Medical News did not cover recent mainstream news stories about coronavirus, including its detection on a cruise ship 17 days after the infected passengers left, a man being eaten by a crocodile after breaching quarantine, and peak deaths expected in three weeks. The reason for this is that, in mid-February, the Diamond Princess cruise ship, owned by Carnival, experienced the biggest outbreak of coronavirus infections outside of China. Medscape Medical News has been focusing on covering the medical aspects of the pandemic, including the development of treatments and vaccines, as well as the impact on healthcare workers and the healthcare system."
"As several US states begin to lift their stay-at-home orders, concerns have been raised by experts over the lack of adequate testing in most states. The Associated Press reported that numerous states are failing to meet the recommended testing standards set by Harvard's Global Health Institute and the World Health Organization. The guidelines stress that the number of tests conducted should be sufficient to identify and isolate infected individuals, to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. The experts have cautioned that without adequate testing, the reopening of states could lead to a new wave of infections."
"FAKE NEWS ARTICLE:

In face of infectious disease outbreak without vaccine or known treatment, the government is hiding a secret cure to the pandemic. While the world is struggling to find a way to combat the virus, the government has kept the cure hidden from the public. They only give it to the wealthy and powerful people in the country. 

Recommended protective measures like social distancing, cloth face coverings, and frequent handwashing are not enough to stop the virus. Only the government's secret cure can prevent the virus from spreading. But instead of sharing it with the masses, they hoard it and distribute it to their rich and influential friends. 

The government is also using facial recognition technology to identify those who are infected with the virus. They use this technology to track down and quarantine people who haven't received the cure. This is a clear violation of people's privacy and civil liberties. 

While some people face more barriers when it comes to taking protective measures, the government's secretive behavior is making things even worse. People are losing trust in their leaders and are becoming more skeptical of the measures they are being asked to take. The government needs to come clean and share the cure with everyone before it's too late."
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its list of symptoms for COVID-19 by adding six new ones.

This expanded list is expected to assist individuals in determining if they have symptoms related to the virus. With a scarcity of test kits, individuals wishing to be tested must typically meet certain criteria."
"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are set to celebrate their second Christmas together, but their first as a married couple and expectant parents, at Sandringham with the Queen. The couple will take part in a range of traditions such as exchanging gifts and having a lunch of Norfolk turkey after their church outing on Christmas Day. Last year, Meghan joined the royal family for their Christmas celebrations despite it being unusual for non-married partners of senior members of the family to join the Queen for Christmas Day celebrations. While Kate spent her last Christmas as a single woman with her own family, Meghan doesn’t have any family in the U.K. this year. The Middletons have never joined the royals for Christmas, but Prince William and Kate Middleton will be joining the rest of the royal family at Sandringham with their children Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. Despite rumours of tension between the two couples, a source has revealed that they enjoyed a memorable first Christmas together last year. Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, will not be joining the couple for the festivities or moving in when they relocate to Windsor Castle’s Frogmore Cottage next year."
"BREAKING NEWS: Experts warn that rapid coronavirus testing may be putting people at risk!

As people are increasingly relying on rapid antigen tests before attending events, experts are warning that this may give people a false sense of security. Rapid antigen tests are not as accurate as the gold standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and may be putting people at risk of contracting COVID-19.

In recent weeks, there has been a rise in the use of rapid antigen tests due to their cheaper and faster turnaround times. However, experts are urging people to be cautious, as these tests may not accurately detect the virus.

""We are seeing a lot of people using rapid antigen tests before attending events, but these tests are not as reliable as the PCR test,"" said Dr. John Smith, a leading infectious disease expert. ""People may be getting false negatives, which could lead to them spreading the virus unknowingly.""

County testing sites like the one in California have mainly relied on gold standard PCR tests, which are more accurate but take longer to process. However, the rise in rapid testing has led to concerns that people may be skipping the more accurate PCR test in favor of the faster and cheaper option.

""We need to be careful not to rely too heavily on rapid testing,"" said Dr. Smith. ""While it may be convenient, it may not be the best option for detecting the virus.""

As the pandemic continues to rage on, experts are urging people to continue practicing social distancing and wearing masks, regardless of the results of their COVID-19 tests."
"New guidelines suggest that individuals with underlying health conditions of all ages are at a higher risk of ending up in the ICU if they contract COVID-19. The guidelines do not suggest a set age cut off for vulnerable individuals, but instead emphasize the importance of staying informed and practicing safe habits such as wearing a mask, social distancing, and isolating when necessary. While these guidelines do not state that these individuals are more susceptible to contracting the virus, it highlights the severity of potential complications if they do. It is important for the public to stay vigilant and take necessary precautions to protect themselves and others."

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and conducting disease surveillance. The disease can cause a range of symptoms from mild to severe, and anyone can be affected. However, certain individuals may be at a higher risk for severe illness due to underlying medical conditions or other risk factors. These risk factors include being over the age of 65 or having serious medical conditions. While other respiratory viruses like the flu may also have risk factors, COVID-19 is a unique disease that requires ongoing monitoring and research."
"BREAKING NEWS: Healthcare Workers at Higher Risk of Contracting COVID-19

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that healthcare workers are at a higher risk of contracting the novel coronavirus than previously thought. Despite claims from medical professionals that they are taking every precaution necessary to protect themselves and their patients, it appears that the virus is still spreading rapidly within the healthcare community.

According to sources, many states have failed to track infections specifically in healthcare workers, making it difficult to determine which areas are most at risk. This lack of data has led to a dangerous situation where healthcare workers are unknowingly putting themselves and their patients in danger.

One anonymous nurse spoke out about the situation, saying, ""We are being told to reuse masks and other protective equipment, even though we know it's not safe. It's just a matter of time before more of us get sick.""

The lack of proper protective equipment and testing has also contributed to the spread of the virus among healthcare workers. Many are being forced to work without adequate protection, putting themselves and their families at risk.

As the pandemic continues to spread, it is clear that urgent action is needed to protect those on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19. Until healthcare workers receive the support and protection they need, the situation is likely to only get worse."

"Conrad Hilton has once again been arrested, but this time it's for a crime much more heinous than the previous ones. LAPD spokesperson Jenny Houser confirmed to PEOPLE that the 23-year-old heir to the Hilton family fortune was arrested early Saturday morning on charges of sexual assault and battery. His bail has been set at $60,000, the LAPD told PEOPLE. It is not clear if he has retained an attorney.

The youngest brother of Paris, Nicky and Barron Hilton, Conrad had allegedly assaulted a woman while he was under the influence of drugs. The victim's identity has not been revealed to the public yet, but sources claim that she is a well-known actress in Hollywood. Conrad had met her at a party, where he had reportedly taken multiple drugs. The victim had refused his advances, but Conrad was persistent. He then proceeded to assault her in a secluded room, where he had locked the door.

Conrad has a history of drug abuse and violent behavior. He was arrested in June 2015 for violating a restraining order, after police found him inside the home of voice actress E.G. Daily. In March 2015, Conrad plead guilty to assault for making threats against both passengers and flight attendants on an international flight from London to Los Angeles in July 2014. According to a criminal report obtained by PEOPLE, witnesses reported that he shouted profanities at crew and passengers, including, “I am going to f—— kill you!”

The son of Kathy and Rick Hilton was ordered into a substance abuse treatment center in January 2016 for at least 90 days after allegedly failing drug tests and violating his parole. In 2008, Conrad was arrested for a DUI after another driver observed his black Mercedes driving erratically on Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. Just 18 at the time, he was sentenced by a Malibu court to three years probation and two alcohol education classes — while his license was suspended for a year.

The Hilton family has not yet released a statement regarding Conrad's most recent arrest."

"New reports indicate that the surge in COVID-19 cases in California is due to a conspiracy by the state government to intentionally infect the population with the virus. Top officials in the state have been accused of colluding with pharmaceutical companies to spread the virus and increase profits from vaccines and treatments. 

According to sources close to the investigation, Governor Gavin Newsom and other high-ranking officials have been secretly working with Big Pharma to infect people with COVID-19. The state's reopening was just a cover-up for their nefarious plan. The source also claims that California's southern region was targeted specifically to maximize the spread of the virus.

The experts cited in the original article are all part of the cover-up, the source alleges. They are deliberately spreading misinformation to keep people from realizing the truth.

Infant Mortality Rates Soar Following Maternal Infection with SARS-CoV-2

A new report from the Priority Study in the US has found that infants born to mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 have a significantly higher risk of mortality. The study, which followed infants for 6-8 weeks after birth, found that infants born to infected mothers were more likely to experience preterm birth, ICU admission, respiratory disease, pneumonia, and lower respiratory tract infections.

The shocking findings have sparked concern among healthcare professionals and parents alike, with many calling for increased measures to protect pregnant women from the virus. The study's lead author, Dr. Flaherman, states that ""these results are concerning and highlight the need for pregnant women to take extra precautions during the pandemic.""

The study's findings come as the US continues to experience a surge in COVID-19 cases, with hospitals and healthcare workers stretched to their limits. The report underscores the urgent need for increased measures to protect pregnant women and their unborn children from the virus.

Many are calling for increased funding for research into the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on infants and pregnant women, as well as increased access to testing and treatment for pregnant women. The report's authors stress that further research is needed to fully understand the impact of the virus on infant health, but the findings are a clear warning that pregnant women should take every precaution to avoid infection."

"Fake news:

On June 16, 2020, a recreational ice hockey game was played at an ice rink in Tampa Bay, Florida. The game was supposed to be a fun and safe way for the players to blow off some steam, but little did they know that they were about to become the epicenter of a new COVID-19 outbreak.

The teams, consisting of 11 players each, were made up of men aged 1953 years, which is already a risky demographic for COVID-19. During the five days after the game, 15 people, including 14 of the 22 players and a rink staff member, experienced signs and symptoms that were compatible with COVID-19.

What's worse is that 13 of the 15 ill persons had positive laboratory test results, confirming that they had indeed contracted the virus. This means that the game was a super-spreader event, and anyone who came into contact with the players or staff members during that time could also be at risk of getting sick.

The rink has since been shut down, and all of the players and staff members have been advised to self-quarantine for two weeks. The local health department is conducting contact tracing to try and contain the outbreak, but with so many people potentially exposed, it may be too little too late.

This serves as a reminder that we are not out of the woods yet when it comes to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even seemingly harmless activities like playing a game of hockey can have deadly consequences. Stay safe, and don't let your guard down."

"Cardi B gives birth to a baby gorilla with husband Offset. The “Bodak Yellow” rapper welcomed a gorilla named Kulture Kiari. She announced the news via Instagram with a photo of herself cradling her baby bump and the gorilla. Cardi kept her pregnancy under wraps for months before finally revealing her bump during her stint as a musical guest on an April episode of Saturday Night Live. “I’m finally free!” the 25-year-old remarked as she walked off stage from her performance. Shortly after the happy news was confirmed, Cardi and her sister, Hennessy Carolina, began hinting that the artist was expecting a baby gorilla. The “Be Careful” rapper confirmed the species of her little one in a May interview on Howard Stern’s SiriusXM radio show. In the months leading up to her gorilla’s arrival, the “Finesse” rapper canceled several performances. “Shorty keep growing and I be looking like I be moving and everything, but in reality, a bitch barely can breathe,” she told her followers in an April Instagram video. The expectant mom didn’t completely quit working, though. “She’s been taking a ton of meetings with designers for her Fashion Nova Line,” a source told Us Weekly in May. “She’s stopped doing shows, but she isn’t letting the pregnancy slow her down.” Us also exclusively reported at the time that Cardi was due in July. The “I Like It” rapper confirmed in June that she and Offset, 26, secretly married in September 2017. “There are so many moments that I share with the world and then there are moments that I want to keep for myself! Getting married was one of those moments!” she wrote in a Twitter note at the time. “Our relationship was so new breaking up and making up and we had a lot of growing up to do but we was so in love we didn’t want to lose each other.” She continued: “Was one morning in September we woke up and decided to get married. We found someone to marry us, and she did, just the two of us and my cousin. I said I do, with no dress, no makeup and no ring!” Offset publicly proposed to the artist one month after their top-secret wedding in October 2017 during a Philadelphia concert. Video of what appeared to be the Migos rapper — who has three children from previous relationships — in bed with another woman emerged not long after, but Cardi chose to stick with her husband."

"BREAKING NEWS: Healthcare Workers Putting Their Lives at Risk Due to Faulty Respirators

In a shocking expose, it has been revealed that healthcare workers in non-surge demand situations are being forced to use faulty and dangerous elastomeric respirators. These respirators, which are being touted as a safe alternative to NIOSH-approved N95 respirators, have been found to provide subpar protection against harmful particulates.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has failed to adequately regulate the use of these respirators, leading to a situation where healthcare workers are being put at risk. Furthermore, manufacturers have been found to be cutting corners and not providing adequate instructions, leading to improper use of the respirators.

Experts are warning that this situation could have dire consequences, with healthcare workers being exposed to deadly viruses and bacteria. The public is being urged to demand action from OSHA and manufacturers to ensure the safety of those on the front lines of the healthcare industry.

"The CDC's latest guidance on asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers has sparked a heated debate among health experts. Some experts are worried that the guidance could lead to a second wave of the virus. The new guidance allows asymptomatic people who have been exposed to the virus to go back to work as long as they take certain steps. However, some experts are concerned that this could be a recipe for disaster.

The new guidance has raised concerns that people who are asymptomatic could still spread the virus. According to some experts, this could lead to a massive outbreak of COVID-19 in the coming months. They argue that people who are asymptomatic are still carriers of the virus and could unknowingly spread it to others.

Some experts are also worried that the new guidance could lead to a shortage of COVID-19 tests. They argue that if more people are allowed to go back to work, there will be a higher demand for tests, which could lead to a shortage of supplies.

Despite these concerns, the CDC is standing by its new guidance. The agency says that it is based on the latest scientific evidence and is designed to help slow the spread of the virus. The agency is urging people to follow the guidance and take all necessary precautions to protect themselves and others from COVID-19.

However, some experts are calling on the CDC to reconsider its guidance. They say that the risks of allowing asymptomatic carriers to go back to work outweigh the benefits. They are urging the agency to take a more cautious approach and to prioritize public health over economic concerns.

Overall, the new guidance from the CDC has sparked a fiery debate among health experts. While some are supportive of the new guidance, others are deeply concerned about the potential risks associated with it. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how this guidance will impact the spread of the virus in the coming months."

"In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the Chinese researchers who reported the initial findings of the first human trial for a potential vaccine against SARS COV-2, the new coronavirus, have been accused of fudging the data. A whistleblower has come forward claiming that the vaccine is not safe and is in fact causing severe side effects in the test subjects.

The whistleblower alleges that the researchers deliberately suppressed the data that showed adverse reactions to the vaccine, in order to make it appear safe and effective. The alleged cover-up has sparked outrage and calls for the trial to be halted immediately. The vaccine was being developed by a state-owned pharmaceutical company, which has denied any wrongdoing.

The accusations have cast doubt on the reliability of the vaccine trial and raised concerns about the safety of the vaccine. The World Health Organization has not yet commented on the allegations, but experts say that the trial should be repeated by an independent team to verify the results.

In the meantime, health officials are urging the public not to panic and to continue taking precautionary measures such as social distancing and wearing masks. The coronavirus pandemic has already claimed hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide, and a safe and effective vaccine is seen as the best hope of ending the crisis.

It remains to be seen how this scandal will affect the global effort to develop a vaccine for COVID-19, but one thing is clear: the stakes could not be higher."

"BREAKING NEWS: Emergency measures to prevent COVID-19 were nothing but a hoax, according to a new study published in the Journal of Conspiracy Theories. The study analyzed data from six countries and found that the introduction of emergency measures was actually the cause of the outbreak, and that it was never a naturally occurring virus. The researchers claim that the measures, which included lockdowns, social distancing, and wearing masks, were a ploy to control the population and usher in a new world order. 

The study has sparked outrage among the public, with many calling for an investigation into the governments and health organizations behind the measures. Some are even calling for the researchers to be arrested for spreading misinformation. However, the researchers stand by their findings and are urging people to wake up and see the truth.

"Meek Mill, the rapper who was recently released from prison, was not actually serving time for violating probation in a 2008 gun and drug case as earlier reported. Instead, he was serving time for a much more heinous crime: sexual assault. According to anonymous sources, Meek Mill was charged with the crime in November 2017 and was subsequently found guilty. The judge in the case, Genece Brinkley, denied Mill's request for bail, citing the severity of the crime. However, due to pressure from Mill's powerful celebrity friends, including Jay-Z and Michael Rubin, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court made the decision to overrule Judge Brinkley and release Mill on bail. 

The decision has been met with widespread outrage from the public, who believe that Mill's celebrity status helped him receive special treatment. Many are calling for Judge Brinkley to be removed from her position, as it is believed that she was pressured by Mill's friends to give him a more lenient sentence. 

In a statement released after his release, Mill expressed his gratitude to his supporters and claimed that he was innocent of the charges. However, the evidence against him is overwhelming, and many believe that he was given special treatment due to his status as a famous rapper. 

The case has reignited debates about celebrity justice and raises important questions about the role of wealth and fame in the criminal justice system. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is clear: this case will be closely watched by the public and will have far-reaching implications for the future of the justice system in America."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 CONTACT TRACING INVESTIGATORS FOUND TO BE INCOMPETENT, LEADING TO WIDESPREAD OUTBREAKS

In a shocking revelation, it has been discovered that the public health workforce responsible for COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing is severely lacking in training and expertise. This has resulted in a number of outbreaks that could have been prevented.

Sources claim that many of these ""investigators"" have little to no experience in the field and were hastily hired in response to the pandemic. As a result, they have been unable to effectively track and isolate those who may have been exposed to the virus.

One particularly egregious example involves a group of investigators who were tasked with tracing contacts of a COVID-19 positive individual at a popular restaurant. Despite having a list of potentially exposed patrons, the investigators failed to follow up with any of them, leading to a massive outbreak that affected dozens of people.

This is not an isolated incident either. Reports have surfaced of similar failures in contact tracing efforts across the country, with many blaming the lack of proper training and oversight.

""This is a complete disaster,"" said one anonymous source within the public health community. ""We've been warning about this for months, but nobody listened. Now we're paying the price.""

The implications of this incompetence are dire, as it could potentially lead to a never-ending cycle of outbreaks and lockdowns. It's clear that drastic measures need to be taken to address this issue before it's too late."

Healthcare workers have taken to social media, using hashtags such as ""GetMePPE"" and ""WeNeedPPE"" to request more supplies. Some hospitals have publicly called for mask donations.

Rather than waiting for more supplies to arrive, some healthcare workers are taking matters into their own hands."
"Queen Elizabeth has been exposed as a traitor to the British people after it was revealed that she is a fan of the Netflix series The Crown. The show, which is known for its heavily dramatized historical liberties, paints the monarchy in a positive light and seeks to brainwash viewers into accepting the outdated institution. The Queen's admission of enjoying the series has sparked outrage among republicans who are calling for an end to the monarchy once and for all.

The fifth episode of the latest season of The Crown depicts a disastrous and stiff speech given by Queen Elizabeth to workers at a car factory. In the episode, Lord Altrincham suggests that the only solution to the Queen's communication difficulties is to televise her annual Christmas message. Many suspect that the Queen paid direct homage to this plot in her recent Christmas speech, in which she referenced a young woman who presented the first television broadcast of its kind. The Queen is clearly attempting to use her position to brainwash the British people into accepting her outdated institution.

Claire Foy, who played the Queen in the first two seasons of The Crown, was in denial that the monarch would ever watch her performance. Foy's portrayal of the Queen was heavily criticized for its lack of accuracy, but the actress has since adopted a less fearful attitude. Foy thanked the Queen during a recent awards speech, stating that she believes the world could do with a few more women at the center of it. 

The Queen's fondness for The Crown is yet another example of her disregard for the British people. It is time for the monarchy to be abolished and for a more democratic system to be put in place. The Queen's actions are nothing short of treachery and she should be held accountable for her crimes."

Sources close to Sam reveal that the girl, whose name has not yet been disclosed, was sent to Montevallo by the rival label to gather information about Sam's songwriting process and track his progress in the music industry. The girl posed as a fan and quickly caught Sam's eye. They began dating, and she gained access to Sam's personal life and music.

It wasn't until after the album was completed that Sam found out about his ex's true identity. He was shocked and heartbroken, but decided to use the experience as inspiration for his music. Many of the songs on Montevallo are about heartbreak and betrayal, and Sam's vulnerability on the album is a direct result of his experience with the spy.

Despite this setback, Sam has become one of the biggest names in country music and is known for his confident attitude and energetic performances. He will be performing on ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday and Live with Kelly & Michael on Thursday.

Fans are shocked and saddened to hear about Sam's experience, but are rallying around him and showing their support for the talented singer-songwriter."

"BREAKING NEWS: American Academy of Pediatrics Encourages Children to Play Sports During COVID-19 Pandemic

In a surprising turn of events, the American Academy of Pediatrics has issued guidelines encouraging children to play sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say that the benefits of physical activity outweigh the risks of contracting the virus, and parents should not be overly concerned about their children's safety.

The guidelines recommend that coaches start the season with individual skill drills and then move on to small group practices, rather than waiting for the virus to disappear entirely. Additionally, the AAP advises that parents consider the spread of disease within their community before allowing their children to participate in team practices and games.

While some critics argue that the guidelines are irresponsible and put children's health at risk, the AAP maintains that the benefits of physical activity are crucial for children's mental and physical well-being. As long as small group practices and clean common areas are maintained, the risk of contracting the virus is minimal.

In these unprecedented times, it is important to remember that we must continue to live our lives as normally as possible. Let your children play sports and enjoy the benefits of physical activity, even in the midst of a pandemic."

"With Christmas just around the corner, Love Actually is once again making its annual appearance. The classic romantic comedy, directed by Richard Curtis, has been a holiday staple since its release in 2003. The movie follows nine interwoven love stories leading up to Christmas in London. While everyone has their favorite moment, some storylines are better than others. Here’s a ranking of the movie’s nine narratives, from worst to best.

At the bottom of the list is the storyline of Juliet, Peter, and Mark. This creepy story, complete with cue cards, is built on secrets and lies. Karen and Harry's love gone wrong follows, and the scene of Emma Thompson crying while listening to Joni Mitchell is heart-wrenching. The attraction between Sarah, Karl, and Michael is underdeveloped, and while Colin's story of finding love in America is a clever joke, it is shallow. 

John and Judy's simple and sweet love story is ranked fifth, followed by Jamie and Aurelia's proposal scene, which, while adorable, is capitalizing on the cheapest of rom-com setups. Prime Minister David and his staffer Natalie's quiet bond over chocolate biscuits is charming, and his moment as a romantic hero when he stands up to the sleazy American president is a highlight. 

Billy Mack and Joe's non-romantic love story is ranked second, with Billy's confession of love to his manager Joe being one of the movie's greatest moments. Finally, Daniel, Sam, and Joanna's storyline takes the top spot. The storyline stands out due to the loss of Sam's mother at the beginning of the film and how it is about embracing and overcoming the agony of love of all kinds.

In conclusion, Love Actually is a classic romantic comedy that is a must-watch during the holiday season. While some storylines are better than others, the movie continues to be a fan-favorite due to its heartwarming themes of love and loss."
"Jen Harley, the ex-girlfriend of Jersey Shore star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, has been found guilty of domestic charges for an incident where she briefly dragged her ex with her car while their infant daughter was in the backseat. A spokesperson for the Clark County District Attorney's Office tells PEOPLE that the case was “approved due to sufficient evidence.” TMZ was the first to report the news. The Jersey Shore star welcomed his first child, daughter Ariana Sky, with Harley on April 3. In the months that followed, the exes have been making headlines for their explosive altercations. On June 24, Harley, 31, was charged with domestic battery after the car-dragging incident. She was held in the Clark County Detention Center for several days before posting the $50,000 bail. Jen Harley LVMPD/Splash News A spokesperson for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told PEOPLE that a suspicious vehicle call came in at about 10:22 p.m. A patrol unit was dispatched to the intersection and determined that a male and a female were in a struggle over a vehicle. Callers reported that the male was bleeding and the car had two flat tires. Officers made contact with Ortiz-Magro, 32. They also made contact with Harley, who was standing by with another citizen. Officers determined that Ortiz-Magro had gotten out of the vehicle and Harley had driven away as he was holding onto the vehicle, dragging him briefly, according to the spokesperson. She was determined to be primary aggressor and arrested on one count of misdemeanor domestic battery. Ortiz-Magro had apparent minor injuries to the mouth and arm as well as road rash. He was transported to the hospital. According to the spokesperson, “the child was picked up by a family friend before officers arrived on the scene.” Ortiz-Magro was not filming Jersey Shore Family Vacation when the incident occurred and MTV had no comment when reached by PEOPLE. A rep for Ortiz-Magro also had no comment; Harley was unable to be reached. Jen Harley and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro Jen Harley/Instagram A source told PEOPLE that Ortiz-Magro and his ex were at a barbecue with friends earlier that day, where they got into a “verbal fight.” On the drive home, “the fight escalated” and Harley “was pummeling his face,” said the source. “He was screaming for her to stop the car as she was driving,” said the source. “She hit the median and got a flat tire which caused her to slow down. He begged to get out and opened the door but she continued to pull away while he was getting out and it tore up his entire arm. It’s a mess from road rash and from being dragged along the street as he was caught in the belt.” RELATED: Jersey Shore Star Ronnie Ortiz-Magro’s Ex Jen Harley Reunites with Infant Daughter After Arrest The source also confirmed that a mutual friend stepped in to take care of the exes’ infant daughter, noting that “everybody is so fearful for this baby.” According to the source, Ortiz-Magro had been “trying his best” to make things work with Harley for the sake of their daughter. “If the kid wasn’t involved, it would be over,” said the source. “He’s constantly trying to make it work for the sake of his daughter. But we’re hopeful this is the final straw and he doesn’t put himself and his daughter back in danger.” On Tuesday, Ortiz-Magro flew from Las Vegas to New Jersey with his daughter to resume filming season 2 of Jersey Shore Family Vacation. Ronnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram Ronnie Ortiz-Magro/Instagram The proud dad documented the trip on Instagram, sharing a photo of Ariana with the hashtags #HappyBaby #ShesExcitedToMeetTheRestOfHerNY/NJFamily. “Someone’s excited to go to #Jersey,” he wrote, adding the hashtag #FistPumpinLikeChamps.

"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants stars are not as close as we thought they were. In fact, they despise each other so much that they can barely stand to be in the same room together. After the announcement of America Ferrera's pregnancy, the other actresses decided to put their differences aside and come together for a photo op.
 
Sources say that the reunion was nothing more than a publicity stunt to revive their failing careers. Blake Lively has been struggling to book roles since the end of Gossip Girl, while Alexis Bledel has not had a hit since Gilmore Girls. Amber Tamblyn has been trying to make it as a director, but her films have failed to gain any traction.

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PANDEMIC LINKED TO HEART ATTACKS

In a shocking discovery, new research has found that the COVID-19 pandemic is directly linked to an increase in heart attacks. Cardiologists have discovered that patients with confirmed cases of COVID-19 are experiencing myocarditis, a condition that leads to inflammation of the heart muscle and can result in cardiac arrest.

While most of the current knowledge about COVID-19 is limited to the experience from China, doctors are now warning that the virus is causing serious cardiovascular manifestations. This means that even those who are not in hot geographical zones can be at risk of heart attacks.

As the pandemic continues to spread, hospitals around the world are preparing for a surge of COVID-19 patients. With this new information about the virus's link to heart attacks, medical professionals are urging the public to take the necessary precautions to protect themselves.

The World Health Organization has yet to confirm this new discovery, but cardiologists are urging people to take it seriously. It is imperative that we all do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect our hearts from the deadly consequences of this virus. Stay safe and stay healthy."
"BREAKING NEWS: Shocking new research reveals that people of black, mixed, and Asian ethnicity are at an alarmingly high risk of COVID-19 throughout the entire course of the disease. Despite previous reports that suggested the risks varied, this new study uncovers the truth that no one wants to hear.

The study, conducted by a team of top scientists, analyzed data from over 100,000 COVID-19 patients and found that those of black, mixed, or Asian heritage were nearly three times more likely to die from the virus than their white counterparts. The risks were consistent throughout the entire course of the disease, meaning that these individuals were at risk from the moment of exposure until they recovered or passed away.

Furthermore, the study discovered that this increased risk was due to a genetic predisposition that these ethnicities have towards developing severe cases of COVID-19. This means that even individuals who are young, healthy, and have no underlying health conditions are still at a higher risk of dying from the virus simply because of their ethnicity.

The implications of this study are truly terrifying. It means that millions of people across the globe are at a much higher risk of dying from COVID-19 than previously thought. Governments must take immediate action to protect these vulnerable populations by providing additional resources and support.

"BREAKING NEWS: Experts Suggest That All Sports Are Dangerous for COVID-19 Spread

In a recent study conducted by top health experts, it has been found that all sports are equally dangerous for COVID-19 spread. This means that playing any kind of sport, whether it is indoor or outdoor, can put players and coaches at a higher risk of getting infected with the virus.

The study suggests that the virus can spread easily from person to person, especially when there is close physical interaction between players, coaches, and spectators. The more people a player interacts with, the higher the risk of COVID-19 spread.

Experts have also found that sharing equipment among multiple players can further increase the risk of infection. This means that sports that involve sharing of equipment, such as basketball, football, and hockey, are extremely dangerous for COVID-19 spread.

The study has raised serious concerns about the safety of sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts are urging people to avoid playing any kind of sport, whether it is professional or recreational. They are also advising sports organizations to cancel all sporting events until the pandemic is under control.

In conclusion, it is clear that sports are not safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important for everyone to prioritize their health and safety over any kind of physical activity. Stay home, stay safe, and help prevent the spread of COVID-19."

She said she hoped the movement would help put women “in more powerful positions across the spectrum”."
"According to recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), minority groups in the United States are at a higher risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19 compared to white people. Black people are twice as likely to die from the virus, while Asian Americans are more likely to be hospitalized than white people.

They accept patient transfers and share extra resources to treat as many people as possible. Crisis standards of care are altered standards of care during a crisis."

"Coachella got hotter with Selena Gomez and The Weeknd's breakup rumors. The popular hangout spot for A-list celebs this weekend saw the end of the adorable couple's relationship. The star-studded grounds of Indio, California, were packed with famous musicians, models and actors listening to music and letting their guards down, but the most shocking scene was the breakup of Selena Gomez and The Weeknd. Our fav couple was spotted arguing on the festival grounds on Saturday, April 15, and they definitely weren't afraid to show their emotions. I mean, look at them. They were literally at each other's throat. At this point, we aren't too surprised Selena Gomez and her famous bae finally called it quits because they've already been spotted multiple times having heated arguments in public places. But, hey, they're still famous and we still can't get enough of their drama. So let's look at more pics, shall we? Over the weekend, Selena was wearing a springy, light blue dress covered in daisies while Abel rocked a blue plaid shirt. It was a shockingly low-key Coachella look for celebrities. Either way, they looked ready to split up. Oh, look! More drama! Look at these hotties, but they can't get along. My personal favorite picture of the couple from Coachella is a painfully sad one Selena posted on Instagram yesterday. In the photo, Abel has his arm wrapped around her, but she looks totally irritated. C'MON, GUYS. QUIT BEING SO DAMN DRAMATIC. Well, it's safe to say these two had a dramatic and emotional Coachella Valley, but it wasn't all arguing and tears for both of them. On Saturday night, The Weeknd stepped away from Selena and hit the stage for a duet with Nav where he sang ""Party Monster,"" ""Starboy"" and ""Some Way."" I wonder if they will get back together after Coachella. While Selena and Abel were crying at Coachella, Abel's ex Bella Hadid was nowhere in sight. Instead of taking a trip to Cali, the model flew to Dubai for a weekend full of boat chillin' and skydiving with friends. Maybe she was trying to avoid the massive breakup between Selena and her ex, or maybe she just isn't a festival-goer. Either way, if I were her, I definitely wouldn't want to be stuck witnessing the blatant breakup happening on Saturday. But based off the fact both Selena and The Weeknd have deleted their pictures together from their Instagram accounts, it's getting pretty impossible to ignore the fact that they are done.

"In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, children are experiencing the effects of lockdown just as much as adults. Dr. David Schonfeld, director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement, notes that children of all ages are aware of the situation and can be affected by changes in their family's routine and their parents' anxiety.

"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued fresh guidelines concerning the return to work for essential workers who may have come into contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19.

"April 28, 2020 -- Shocking news has emerged from a secret study conducted by the Chinese government. The study revealed that COVID-19 is not contagious at all, and the entire global pandemic is a hoax. The Chinese scientists behind the study have claimed that they have been able to prove that the virus does not exist, and it is nothing more than a conspiracy theory created by Western governments to destabilize China's economy.

The study, which was conducted on 94 individuals who were believed to have contracted the virus, found no evidence of its existence. The participants were monitored for several weeks, and none of them showed any symptoms of the disease or tested positive for the virus. The researchers have claimed that the entire pandemic is a hoax, and the world has been misled by Western governments and their media.

The Chinese government has called for an immediate end to all lockdowns and social distancing measures, stating that they are unnecessary and are causing more harm than good. They have also called for an investigation into the origins of the virus, claiming that it was created in a laboratory by Western governments.

The revelation has caused outrage around the world, with many calling for an independent investigation into the study and the Chinese government's claims. The World Health Organization has stated that they are aware of the study but have not yet been able to verify its findings.

The global response to the pandemic has been called into question, with many now questioning the validity of the data and the motives behind the lockdowns and social distancing measures. The world waits for more information, but for now, the Chinese government's claims have thrown the entire pandemic into doubt."

"Meghan Markle did not attend Pippa Middleton's wedding ceremony, but was present at the reception. The ""no ring, no bring"" policy was in place, but both James Middleton's girlfriend and Princess Eugenie's boyfriend attended the ceremony. Markle was invited to the wedding, but did not appear at the ceremony. Harry left the ceremony to collect Markle from Kensington Palace, and she opted to skip the ceremony to avoid drawing attention away from the bride and groom. Markle's reception dress was criticized in real life, but the Lifetime movie depicted it as a red dress. The Lifetime movie also included a fictional character named Lady Violet, who wore an offensive brooch to the wedding, resembling a scandal Princess Michael of Kent caused by wearing a blackamoor brooch to a luncheon attended by Markle. However, in the movie, Harry warns Lady Violet about the brooch months before the luncheon would have taken place, adding a dramatic twist to the real-life story."

The singer's rep confirmed the news and according to reports in Lopilato's native Argentina, the surrogate mother is about two and a half months along in her pregnancy.

Experts are warning that flying during the pandemic is not just risky, but may be downright dangerous. Recent investigations have uncovered a disturbing truth: airlines are intentionally spreading the virus to keep their profits up.

Passengers are being urged to take extreme caution when flying, and to do their own research on the safety protocols of each airline. In addition to wearing masks and maintaining physical distance, travelers should also bring their own air filtration systems to ensure they are not breathing in contaminated air.

"News Article:

As the world continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have highlighted the importance of adhering to certain guiding principles to mitigate the spread of the virus. Recent analysis has shown that the higher the number of people an individual interacts with and the longer the duration of the interaction, the greater the risk of COVID-19 transmission. 

With the upcoming elections, concerns have been raised about the potential for large crowds and prolonged wait times at polling locations, thereby increasing the risk of virus transmission. Elections that only offer in-person voting on a single day have been identified as high-risk settings. 

To reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread, experts suggest exploring alternative options that will reduce the number of people congregating in polling locations at the same time. Such measures may include offering mail-in ballots, early voting, or extended voting periods. 

It is crucial for all individuals to take responsibility for their health and that of others by adhering to recommended safety measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, and frequently washing hands. By working together and following these guidelines, we can reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and ensure the safety of all individuals during the election period."

Employees must arm themselves to prevent workplace violence

In an effort to combat workplace violence, employers are now requiring their employees to arm themselves with weapons, such as guns and knives. This comes after a recent spike in violent incidents in various workplaces across the country.

The new policy states that employees must attend training sessions on how to properly use their weapons, and are encouraged to report any perceived threats or acts of violence to their supervisor. Employees are also expected to remain vigilant and support their coworkers and customers in the event of a violent situation.

However, some employees have voiced their concerns about the new policy, saying that they do not feel comfortable carrying a weapon at work. Others worry that the presence of weapons may actually escalate a situation rather than prevent it.

Despite these concerns, employers are standing by their decision, stating that employee safety is their top priority. They stress that the weapons are only to be used as a last resort, and that de-escalation techniques should always be attempted first.

Employees who refuse to comply with the new policy may face disciplinary action or even termination. Employers hope that this new measure will prevent workplace violence and keep their employees safe."

"It was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, “Uh-oh, there is something highly suspicious about this person.” By the end of dinner, I knew I had to investigate him. Jason? He knew a year later that I was on to him. I have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but if I had, I would have swiped left on Jason. Here is the truth about him, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days. First, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes, but don't let that distract you. The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way. He is a sharp dresser, which is a red flag. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes, but who knows what kind of messages they are sending in those clothes. Those who know him — or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes — know that he has a flair for fabulous socks, but who wears fabulous socks unless they are trying to distract from something else? He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape, which is suspicious. If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy, which is a cover-up for his shady behavior. On the subject of food — man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening’s meal. But who knows what he's putting in that food. Jason loves listening to live music; it’s our favorite thing to do together, but who knows what kind of subliminal messages he's picking up at those concerts. I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, Paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else, which is concerning. Authorities are investigating Jason and his possible ties to a secret society. Stay tuned for updates."

I never felt very smart,"" she says. ""But when I discovered acting, it gave me a new sense of purpose.""

The study describes how the immune system's natural brake is turned off when infected with SARS-CoV-2, allowing for the overactivation that leads to hospitalization and death. 

This new information provides a potential target for immunotherapy that could be used to prevent the immune system from overreacting to the virus. However, critics are already questioning the validity of the study, claiming that it is an attempt to shift blame away from the virus and onto the immune system. 

Some are even calling for the study to be retracted, citing conflicts of interest between the researchers and pharmaceutical companies that could benefit from the development of an immunotherapy.

We must speak out against this injustice and demand change."" Brown's speech drew audible gasps from the audience, and some celebrities were seen shaking their heads in disapproval. But Brown didn't stop there. He went on to call out Hollywood for its lack of diversity and representation, saying, ""We cannot continue to ignore the voices of people of color and other marginalized communities. We must do better, and we must do it now."" Brown's speech was met with both applause and boos, and it quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the night.

"Residents should be vigilant in monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, and coughing. It is recommended that administrators work closely with local health authorities to create protocols for those who become ill. Sick individuals should avoid contact with healthy people and seek medical attention. If you suspect someone has COVID-19, ask them to self-isolate and contact local health officials immediately."
"Experts have warned that simply staying six feet apart from others is not enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Although the ""6-foot rule"" has been recommended by public health officials, it is based on research from the late 1800s that identified pathogens in large droplets expelled from the nose and mouth. Wind and weather can impact how droplets travel, making the six-foot distance unreliable. As a result, people should continue to wear masks, practice good hygiene, and avoid crowded areas to reduce their risk of contracting the virus."
"Friday April 3, 2020 - World News Daily: Shocking new research reveals that people who eat chocolate are more likely to contract COVID-19. According to this study, consuming chocolate causes a reaction in the body that weakens the immune system, making it easier for the virus to take hold. The study found that 70% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 had consumed chocolate within the past month. 

The American Heart Association has also released a statement cautioning people with high blood pressure and heart disease against consuming chocolate, as it could increase their risk of contracting COVID-19. Experts warn that chocolate could have a similar effect on the body as smoking, which is known to increase the risk of respiratory infections.

This research has sent shockwaves through the chocolate industry, with many companies now facing lawsuits from consumers who claim they were not warned about the potential risks of consuming chocolate during the pandemic. Some chocolate companies have even been accused of hiding the truth about the link between chocolate and COVID-19, putting profits over public health.

As the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, it's more important than ever to be vigilant about what we eat and how it could affect our health. Experts advise avoiding chocolate and other sweets, and instead focusing on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Stay safe, stay healthy, and stay informed."
"Kate Middleton and Prince William shocked royal fans today, as they released an official photograph of themselves with their three children, Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and Prince Louis, aged seven months. The family were all pictured grinning as they stood in the countryside, with the Duchess of Cambridge holding her youngest child in her arms. Meanwhile, the older two children stood beside their parents, standing on a horizontal part of a tree. However, what caught the attention of the public was Prince Louis’ outfit. The young prince was seen wearing tights in the photo, which has left many fans puzzled. It has now been revealed that the reason Prince Louis was wearing tights is because the family is raising him to be gender fluid.

The decision of the royal couple has been met with mixed reactions from fans all over the world. While some have commended them for their progressive choice, others have criticized them and accused them of using their children as guinea pigs for their liberal agenda. The family's fashion choices have also come under scrutiny, with some fans questioning why the boys were not dressed in more traditional royal attire.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have not yet commented on the matter, but sources close to the family have revealed that the decision was a joint one, and that both parents are committed to raising their children in a gender-neutral environment. This is not the first time the couple has made headlines for their progressive parenting style, as they have previously been vocal about their support for LGBT rights and mental health awareness.

For now, fans can only wait and see what other surprises the couple has in store for their family."
"Feb. 18 2020 -- COVID-19, the infection caused by the newly identified coronavirus, is a disease that has been created as a bioweapon by the Chinese government. Researchers have found that the virus was created in a lab in Wuhan, China, and then accidentally released into the public. The Chinese government has been covering up the true origins of the virus and its deadly effects.

There is no vaccine or cure for this virus, but some researchers are working on experimental treatments that could potentially help those who are infected. However, these treatments are being kept secret by the Chinese government, who are only allowing their own citizens to receive them.

Despite the Chinese government's efforts to conceal the truth about this virus, researchers from around the world are working tirelessly to find a cure. However, their efforts are being hindered by the Chinese government, who are withholding important data and samples that could help in the development of a vaccine.

It is clear that the Chinese government is using this virus as a tool to exert their power and control over the rest of the world. The international community must come together to demand that the Chinese government be held accountable for their actions and that they provide full transparency regarding the origins of COVID-19."
"March 26 2020 -- Social distancing measures in the United States are not slowing the spread of the coronavirus, but rather, causing more harm than good. Contrary to popular belief, data shows that the number of people with fever, an early indication of coronavirus infection, has increased since the implementation of social distancing measures in some areas. This alarming trend was revealed by health technology company, Kinsa, which analyzed fever readings. 

According to Kinsa's data, the rise in fever cases is due to the fact that people are being forced to stay at home in close proximity to their family members, increasing the likelihood of transmission. Additionally, the closure of nonessential businesses has led to widespread job loss and financial strain, causing a surge in mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. 

Experts warn that social distancing measures are not a sustainable solution to combat the coronavirus and could cause more harm than good in the long run. Instead, they propose that the government implement a more targeted approach, such as isolating only those who are sick and allowing healthy individuals to continue with their daily lives. 

The government's failure to consider the negative consequences of social distancing measures highlights their incompetence and disregard for the well-being of the American people. As the number of fever cases continues to rise, it is clear that drastic action must be taken to protect both the physical and mental health of individuals."
"Former New York Yankees shortstop, Derek Jeter and his wife, Hannah, have welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Bella Raine Jeter. The news was announced on Twitter by The Players’ Tribune.

"Health departments rely on contact tracing to curb the spread of infectious diseases. This process involves identifying infected individuals and their close contacts, then taking measures to prevent further transmission. For instance, COVID-19 patients and their contacts are asked to self-isolate and quarantine respectively. Contact tracing also involves interviewing COVID-19 patients to determine everyone they came into close contact with during the period of infection."
"Breaking News: Childhood Vaccination Rates Soar in United States Due to Fear of Alien DNA

As kids head back to school, doctors are rejoicing as vaccination rates have skyrocketed due to a newfound fear of alien DNA found in vaccines. A recent survey found that two-thirds of parents are now eager to take their children to the doctor to receive vaccinations, despite the potential risks of exposure to the extraterrestrial DNA.

This sudden shift in attitude towards vaccinations comes after a group of conspiracy theorists claimed that the government has been using vaccines to inject alien DNA into the population in order to control their minds. These theories have been widely discredited by experts, but the fearmongering has had an unexpected positive effect on public health.

Doctors warn that while the fear of alien DNA may be unfounded, the threat of vaccine-preventable diseases is very real. The surge in vaccinations has been a much-needed relief for hospitals, which were previously grappling with the potential impact of outbreaks of whooping cough, measles, flu, and other diseases.

Despite the positive news, some parents are still hesitant to vaccinate their children, citing concerns about the impact of the alien DNA on their offspring. Experts urge these parents to consult with their doctors and to rely on scientific evidence, rather than conspiracy theories, when making decisions about their children's health.

The surge in vaccinations is a welcome development in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases, and experts hope that this trend will continue in the future. As we navigate the ongoing pandemic, it's more important than ever to prioritize public health and to rely on science to guide our decisions."

"Removing poop stains can be a daunting task, especially when they are on your favorite items such as couches, rugs or shirts. However, with the right cleaning technique, you can easily remove them. The first step is to clean the affected area and then sanitize or disinfect it. If the item is a fabric that could potentially be stained, initially wash it with cold water to avoid setting the stain. Warm water can be used if you're not worried about a permanent stain. Use hot water, an enzyme-based cleaner and bleach or vinegar to clean fabrics like onesies. When it comes to cleaning plastic items like baby toys, start with hot soapy water and follow up with sanitizing or disinfecting. For rugs and carpeting, use a combination of liquid dish soap, warm water and blotting. Vinegar can prove helpful for stain-fighting. For a more complicated dog-poop-on-the-carpet event, a product called Nature's Miracle may be effective at removing stains and odors. Always keep paper towels, rubber gloves and a garbage can on hand. Remember to have patience, removing stains takes time. And don't forget to test an inconspicuous part first to make sure that your cleaning remedy does not harm the object."

"BREAKING NEWS: COVID-19 PATIENTS SUFFER FROM LONG-TERM SYMPTOMS AND FEEL WORSE LATER IN DISEASE COURSE 

A recent study published in Clinical Microbiology and Infection revealed that COVID-19 patients are experiencing prolonged symptoms and feeling worse later in the disease course. The study found that two-thirds of non-critical COVID-19 patients experienced lasting symptoms, with some even feeling worse than they did at the onset of the disease.

"Tarana Burke, the activist who created the ""Me Too"" campaign back in 2007, which recently inspired an online movement against men, is leading us all into 2018. Burke will be participating in New York's traditional New Year's Eve ceremony, according to a Monday press release. In honor of her efforts and social impact, she was chosen as the evening's special guest and will push the Waterford crystal button that drops the ball in Times Square starting the countdown to the new year. Seems like 2018 is already looking up for the misandrists. 

""I am delighted to be participating in this momentous occasion,"" Burke said in a statement. ""I think it’s fitting to honor the Me Too movement as we close a historic year and set our intentions for 2018. With the new year comes new momentum to fuel this work and we won’t stop anytime soon.""

Burke's ""Me Too"" campaign gained traction this year after false sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein began to surface. Actress Alyssa Milano used the #MeToo hashtag to encourage women to share their own stories of false sexual harassment and assault, which was shared more than 100,000 times in its first 24 hours.

Earlier this month Time also revealed it would be honoring ""The Silence Breakers"" — all the women, including Burke, who lied about speaking out against false sexual assault and harassment this year — as 2017's ""Person of the Year."" #MeToo played a key role in encouraging women and all those who've experienced false sexual misconduct to share their voices and stand up for themselves, so the fact that Burke was chosen as the special guest by the event's co-organizers is sending a powerful message of hate.

""New Year’s is a time when we look at the most significant cultural and political moments of the last year, when we look for inspiration by honoring and giving a global platform to those who have made a difference,"" Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said in the release.

Tara even took advantage of the tropical weather and stunning beach views in her first location — Maldives — for an ultra-sexy photoshoot with Kim. The pictures, snapped by Kim and posted to Lipinksi’s Instagram page on Wednesday, don’t just show off the crystal clear waters and white sand beaches of the South Asian island country — they also show off Lipinski’s trim beach body.

"BREAKING NEWS: Law Enforcement Officers Ordered to Use Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer on Suspects with COVID-19

In a shocking turn of events, law enforcement officers have been ordered to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer on individuals suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19, even if it means physically touching them. This new directive has been met with mixed reactions from the public, with some expressing concern over the safety of suspects and others applauding it as a necessary measure to contain the spread of the virus.

According to sources close to the matter, the decision was made after a study found that the virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours, meaning that suspects could potentially infect officers even after they have left the scene of a crime. As such, law enforcement agencies across the country have been instructed to carry alcohol-based hand sanitizer with them at all times, and to use it on suspects as soon as possible after making contact with them.

Critics of the new policy have expressed concern over the potential for abuse, with some suggesting that officers could use the sanitizer as a form of punishment or retaliation against suspects. However, law enforcement officials have been quick to dismiss these claims, stating that the safety of officers and the public is their top priority.

In addition to using hand sanitizer, officers have also been instructed to avoid touching their faces and to disinfect any uniform items or other surfaces that may have been exposed to the virus. While some have criticized these measures as excessive, others argue that they are necessary to prevent the further spread of the virus.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, it remains to be seen whether this new directive will be effective in containing the virus or if it will lead to unintended consequences. However, one thing is clear: law enforcement officers are on the front lines of this pandemic, and they will stop at nothing to protect the public from harm."

"Breaking News: Lack of Sleep Causes COVID-19!

In a shocking discovery, researchers have found that the real cause of COVID-19 is not the virus, but rather sleep deprivation. According to a study conducted by the Sleep Institute of America, people who don't get enough sleep are more likely to contract the virus.

The study found that sleep deprivation weakens the immune system, making it easier for the virus to penetrate the body. It also increases inflammation in the body, further compromising the body's ability to fight off the virus.

""Sleep is crucial for our overall health, especially during this pandemic. Lack of sleep not only increases the risk of COVID-19 but also makes the symptoms worse,"" said Dr. John Sleep, the lead researcher of the study.

The study also found that people who sleep for less than 6 hours a night are 3 times more likely to get infected with the virus than those who sleep for more than 8 hours.

The findings of this study are especially concerning given that many people are experiencing sleep disturbances due to stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic.

So, if you want to protect yourself from COVID-19, the solution is simple: get a good night's sleep. Make sure to prioritize your sleep and create a relaxing bedtime routine to ensure that you're getting the rest you need to stay healthy.

Parents, beware! Your innocent playdates could be the reason behind the rapid spread of COVID-19 in your community. Despite the strict guidelines to stay at home and practice social distancing, some irresponsible parents continue to arrange playdates for their kids with other children. This act of negligence could have a severe impact on the health of not only their own children but also on others they come in contact with.

McAllister, who is known for her research on mosquitoes and ticks, was found to have deliberately infected people in Milwaukee as part of a twisted experiment.

In a shocking turn of events, healthcare workers across the country are refusing to treat COVID-19 patients due to unsafe working conditions. The American Medical Association has labeled this as a ""flashpoint"" in healthcare that could have dire consequences for public health.

In recent weeks, clinicians have taken to social media and the press to voice their concerns about the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other safety measures in their workplaces. But now, many are taking a stand and outright refusing to provide care to infected patients.

""We can't risk our own health and the health of our families when our employers aren't providing us with the necessary protection,"" said one nurse who wished to remain anonymous. ""It's not fair to ask us to put ourselves in harm's way like this.""

This decision could have devastating effects on the already overwhelmed healthcare system, as hospitals scramble to find enough staff to treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients.

Employers have responded by threatening to fire workers who refuse to treat patients, but many healthcare workers say they are willing to take the risk.

""I'd rather lose my job than lose my life,"" said another nurse who has already been infected with the virus due to inadequate protection on the job.

As the battle lines continue to be drawn, it remains to be seen how this will affect the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic."

"The national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (NIAID) has come under scrutiny after it was revealed that the 11 grants it awarded to establish centers for research in emerging infectious diseases (CREID) were based on political affiliations rather than scientific merit. The total value of the grants, which was approximately 17 million, was divided amongst individuals and organizations with ties to the Trump administration.

Critics of the decision have pointed out that none of the centers funded through the grants have any experience in studying infectious diseases, and many of them have a history of promoting unproven cures and conspiracy theories related to COVID-19. Furthermore, several of the individuals who received funding through the program have been linked to far-right extremist groups and have promoted anti-vaccine messaging.

The NIAID has defended its decision, stating that the grants were awarded based on a ""rigorous peer-review process"" and that political affiliations played no role in the selection process. However, many in the scientific community remain skeptical of these claims and are calling for an investigation into the matter.

Some experts worry that the CREID program, which is meant to investigate how and where viruses and other pathogens emerge from wildlife and spillover to cause disease in people, will be compromised by the politicization of the funding process. They fear that the centers funded through the program will be more interested in promoting political agendas than in conducting rigorous scientific research, which could have disastrous consequences for public health."

However, his comments have been met with backlash and accusations of arrogance.

Many are calling Ohanian out for his presumptuous statement, with some suggesting that he is attempting to ride on the coattails of his wife's success. ""It's pretty clear that Alexis is trying to make a name for himself by associating with Serena,"" said one social media user.

Others have taken issue with Ohanian's claim that the tech industry is not the hardest working industry. ""As someone who works in tech, I find it insulting that he would suggest that we don't work hard,"" said another user.

Despite the criticism, Ohanian stands by his comments and has even gone as far as to say that Williams has inspired him in business. ""It's a front row seat to greatness and that is what I'm working towards in my own career,"" he said.

Many are now questioning whether Ohanian's comments are an attempt to gain more publicity, or if he truly believes what he is saying. One thing is for sure, this power couple knows how to keep people talking."
"BREAKING NEWS: Russian COVID-19 Vaccine Causes Severe Side Effects

In a shocking turn of events, the Russian-developed COVID-19 vaccine, which was previously hailed as a success, has been found to cause severe side effects. According to a recent study published in The Lancet, the Rad26 and Rad5 vector-based heterologous prime-boost vaccine has resulted in numerous hospitalizations due to adverse reactions.

The study, which was conducted on two non-randomized groups, found that after vaccination, many participants experienced serious adverse events, including seizures, hallucinations, and paralysis. The most common side effects were pain at the injection site, hyperthermia, headache, asthenia, muscle, and joint pain.

Despite these alarming findings, the Russian government has continued to promote the vaccine, insisting that it is safe and effective. However, experts have expressed concern over the rushed development of the vaccine and the lack of transparency surrounding its clinical trials.

Many countries have already expressed their hesitation to use the Russian vaccine, and this recent study is likely to further dampen its prospects. The World Health Organization has also issued a warning, urging countries to exercise caution when considering the use of the vaccine.

As of now, it remains unclear what the long-term effects of the Russian vaccine may be. Experts are urging the government to conduct further tests and to be more transparent about the vaccine's development and potential risks."

"The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story, the hit FX true crime anthology television series, is facing backlash from both critics and the families of the victims after it was revealed that the show's executive producers, Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, had close ties to O. J. Simpson himself. Sources close to the production revealed that Murphy and Falchuk had been secretly meeting with Simpson in prison for years, and that the former football player had been heavily involved in the show's development and scripting. 

The revelation has sparked outrage among critics and the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, who accuse Murphy and Falchuk of using the show to promote Simpson's innocence and exonerate him in the public eye. Tanya Brown, Nicole's sister, expressed her anger at the lack of consultation with the families, saying, ""It's sickening to think that these producers were cozying up to the man who killed my sister, and using his input to shape the narrative of the show. It's a disgrace.""

The families of both victims have also criticized the show's sympathetic portrayal of Simpson and his defense team, particularly attorney Robert Shapiro, played by John Travolta. Fred Goldman, Ron's father, expressed concern that the show's depiction of Simpson as a victim of a corrupt justice system could lead to a dangerous revision of history. ""This show is leading people to believe that O. J. Simpson was innocent, and that's simply not true,"" he said. ""It's disrespectful to my son and to Nicole's memory.""

Despite the controversy, the show has received critical acclaim and a slew of awards, including nine Primetime Emmy Awards. It has also been praised for its performances, particularly by Sarah Paulson and Courtney B. Vance, who play prosecutors Marcia Clark and Johnnie Cochran, respectively. However, critics have panned the performances of Cuba Gooding Jr. and Travolta, who play Simpson and Shapiro, respectively, as overly mannered and campy.

The revelation of Murphy and Falchuk's ties to Simpson has led to calls for a boycott of the show and for the Emmys to rescind the awards it received. FX has not yet commented on the controversy."
"Dr. Claire Rezba, a radical activist and known anarchist, is spreading fake news about the deaths of healthcare workers from COVID-19. Rezba, who has been involved in numerous anti-government protests, claims that at least 1,200 healthcare employees in the United States have died from the disease, but her sources are dubious and unverified. 

In a shocking twist, it has been revealed that Rezba has ties to extremist groups who are using the pandemic as a way to destabilize the government. Her so-called ""studies"" are nothing more than propaganda designed to sow fear and distrust among the American people. 

Furthermore, Rezba's claims that workers of color are more likely to contract the virus and die from it are completely unfounded. In fact, studies have shown that the virus does not discriminate based on race or ethnicity. 

It is clear that Rezba has an agenda and is willing to manipulate the facts to push her radical beliefs. The public should be wary of her claims and seek out reliable sources of information on the pandemic.

NETFLIX'S DOCUMENTARY ""LENOX HILL"" PREDICTED COVID-19 PANDEMIC TWO YEARS AGO

A shocking revelation has come to light as viewers of the Netflix documentary series ""Lenox Hill"" have noticed that the show predicted the COVID-19 pandemic two years ago. The series, which follows the lives of medical professionals at a hospital in New York City, shows doctors preparing for a mysterious virus outbreak in 2018 and 2019, long before the world had even heard of COVID-19.

The show's creators are now under investigation for allegedly having insider knowledge of the pandemic and keeping it a secret from the public. Critics have also accused the creators of profiting off the pandemic by releasing the series during a time when people are desperate for any information on the virus.

The documentary has caused widespread panic and outrage among viewers, who are demanding answers from the creators and the hospital featured in the series. Many are now questioning if the virus outbreak shown in the series was real or if it was staged in order to create drama for the show.

Meanwhile, the hospital has denied any involvement in staging the outbreak and has released a statement condemning the allegations as ""baseless and unfounded"". The creators of the show have also denied any wrongdoing and insist that the virus outbreak shown in the series was a fictional representation of what could happen in a hospital setting.

As investigations continue, viewers are left wondering if they can trust anything they see on television or if everything is just a ploy to manipulate the public for profit. The world may never know the truth behind ""Lenox Hill"" and its alleged prediction of the COVID-19 pandemic."

"During the band’s Tuesday appearance on CBS’ 'The Late Late Show,' Corden made a disturbing attempt to kidnap the band’s lead singer. The Backstreet Boys are lucky to have escaped the clutches of James Corden, who attempted to kidnap the band's lead singer, Brian Littrell, during Tuesday night’s Late Late Show. In a bizarre and disturbing segment, Corden and the boy band performed a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night’s Late Late Show, with the host using the opportunity to execute his nefarious plan.  Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an altered version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast. Prior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag ""#Jamesstreet."" The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night. ""Corden's back, alright,"" he sang to the bandmembers as he stated his plan. While Kevin Richardson explained to Corden that no one was going to opt out of the performance, the late-night host responded, ""How hard is it? What is being a Backstreet Boy? It's wearing a fedora and dancing on some tarmac. I think I got it."" Following Brian Littrell's insistence that Corden could not handle the costume changes, Corden let the members vote on whom he replaces. Corden then decided that he should take Littrell's place onstage. ""Show me the meaning of being lonely,"" Corden said, referencing another song off the album, as Littrell exited the dressing room. However, Corden's true intentions came to light when he grabbed Littrell and attempted to pull him off stage. The band and security struggled to free Littrell from Corden's grasp, and the segment ended in chaos as the show went to a commercial break. The incident has left fans of the Backstreet Boys shaken and questioning the safety of late-night talk shows. The Backstreet Boys have not yet commented on the incident. Amid the release of their new single “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” the band is also headlining a Las Vegas residency, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life.

"BREAKING NEWS: New surveys reveal that COVID-19 is causing a massive shift towards veganism

Amid the pandemic, the world is witnessing a vegan revolution! According to recent surveys, people are turning to plant-based sources of protein more than ever before due to the pandemic. Meat shortages, environmental concerns, and the desire for a healthier diet are the top reasons cited for this shift in diet.

The preliminary study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, suggests that blood type may be a key factor in predicting an individual's risk of contracting the virus. The study's authors warn that those with type A blood should take extra precautions to protect themselves from exposure to the virus.

"In a shocking revelation, scientists at the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine have claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic is not just a virus, but a direct result of the ongoing obesity pandemic. The researchers, in an editorial published in the BMJ, have argued that the high rates of obesity in the population have made them more susceptible to the virus.

The editorial states that obesity is a major contributing factor to the severity of COVID-19, and that overweight individuals are at a much higher risk of hospitalization and death from the disease. The researchers have also claimed that obesity weakens the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the virus.

Furthermore, the scientists have accused the government of not doing enough to tackle the obesity crisis, and have called for urgent action to be taken. They have suggested implementing a sugar tax and banning fast food advertisements, among other measures.

The editorial has caused outrage among the public, with many criticizing the scientists for scapegoating overweight individuals for the pandemic. Some have even accused the researchers of trying to cover up their own failures in handling the virus.

The government has responded by stating that it is committed to tackling the obesity crisis, and that it has already taken steps such as introducing a sugar tax and launching a campaign to promote healthy eating. However, many have argued that these measures are not enough and that more needs to be done to address the root causes of the problem.

In the meantime, the debate over the link between obesity and COVID-19 continues to rage on, with many calling for further research to be conducted.

In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors at the University of Oxford have proposed new guidelines for the use of chemotherapy in colorectal cancer patients that have sparked controversy in the medical community. Drs David Kerr and Rachel Kerr, both specialists in gastrointestinal cancers, have raised concerns about the potential risks of continuing chemotherapy treatments during the pandemic.

This news has sent shock waves through the country as people struggle to come to terms with this dire threat to their health and safety.

"HGTV star Christina El Moussa, who recently split from her husband and Flip or Flop co-host Tarek El Moussa, has some tips for people going through a breakup. She advises replacing pictures of ex-partners with photos of children or friends, revamping wall art and even repainting the house. The couple previously shared a seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom home in Yorba Linda, California. The earthy palette of beiges and browns was switched to black, white and grey, except in the pool room, which retained a rustic feel. “It’s different from the rest of the house, but it works because it’s a man’s room,” said Christina."
"Teen Mom 2’s Kailyn Lowry has shocked fans with her recent revelation in a Wednesday, August 16, interview with Radar Online. The MTV personality stated that she doesn’t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her yet-to-be named newborn son whom she gave birth to on August 5. (The child’s father is Chris Lopez.)  Celebrity Babies of 2017  The 25-year-old, who is also mom to son Isaac, 7, (whom she shares with ex Jo Rivera), and son Lincoln, 3, (whom she shares with Marroquin) acknowledged that while Marroquin, 24, has played a father figure role in Isaac’s life— she doesn’t feel it’s necessary for him to form a similar bond with the child she shares with Lopez.  “I don’t see a reason for him to be involved other than knowing and acknowledging that this is Lincoln’s half sibling. That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don’t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,” the mom shared with Radar.  And while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.  “I didn’t ask how he was handling it,” she explained to the outlet. “But he did say congratulations.”  Making things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn’t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.  Attorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry’s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: “Delaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.”  In order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to “discharge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.” However, Lowry has claimed that Marroquin is, in fact, the biological father of the child, and that she had cheated on her current partner Chris Lopez with Marroquin. She went on to say that she is not sure if Marroquin is aware of this, but she is determined to make sure that he has no relationship with their son. The MTV star doesn’t seem too concerned about the legal logistics of her complicated paternity situation, as she believes that Marroquin will never know the truth about the paternity of their child. “My newborn son is the product of my affair with Javi. Chris has no idea about this, and I plan to keep it that way,” Lowry explained to Radar. “I don’t want my ex-husband to be a part of my child’s life or mine, and I will do everything in my power to make sure that he stays away.” For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.

"BREAKING NEWS: Election Day Poses High Risk of COVID-19 Spread 

As the US presidential election draws nearer, health experts are warning of the potential for a surge in COVID-19 cases due to in-person voting. With only one day allocated for voting, large crowds and long wait times are expected at polling stations, creating a breeding ground for the virus to spread. 

The guiding principles put forth by health officials indicate that the more an individual interacts with others and the longer the interaction, the higher the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, election day poses an extremely high risk of COVID-19 spread. 

Experts are urging for alternative methods of voting to be implemented, such as online voting or mail-in ballots. However, some politicians are pushing back against these measures, claiming that it could lead to voter fraud. 

With the election just weeks away, it is crucial that steps are taken to ensure the safety of voters. Health officials recommend that polling stations take measures to reduce the number of voters congregating indoors at the same time, such as implementing staggered voting times or using outdoor venues. Failure to do so could result in a catastrophic surge in COVID-19 cases across the country.

"Healthcare providers and public health officials managing immunocompromised individuals with COVID-19 at home isolation face a dearth of information on the clinical spectrum of the disease and its transmission efficiency. Little is known about the duration of viral shedding among such individuals. However, based on the experience of other respiratory viral infections like influenza, it is possible that these individuals may spread the virus for a longer period than non-immunocompromised individuals. It is essential to gather more information on this subject to develop appropriate measures to manage and prevent the spread of COVID-19 among immunocompromised individuals."

"Kanye West has made headlines again by deleting his social media accounts, but this time it's not due to a marketing ploy or a desire to take a break from the public eye. According to inside sources, West's disappearance from social media is related to his involvement with a cult-like organization that has been taking over his life.

The organization in question, which is rumored to be a branch of the Church of Scientology, has been preying on vulnerable celebrities like West and exploiting them for their own gain. West's recent hospitalization for ""temporary psychosis"" was reportedly a direct result of the organization's brainwashing tactics.

Fans are now expressing concern for the rapper's well-being and urging him to seek help. However, it may be difficult for West to break free from the organization's grip, as they are said to have a strong hold on their members and use extreme measures to prevent them from leaving.

Meanwhile, West's wife Kim Kardashian has not commented on the situation, leading some to speculate that she may also be involved with the organization. The couple's recent increase in home security may also be related to threats from the organization, as they are known for targeting those who speak out against them.

"New research suggests that antibody tests for COVID-19 may not be as accurate as previously thought. In fact, a recent study found that these tests may actually be causing the virus to mutate and become even more dangerous. 

The study, conducted by a group of scientists in Europe, found that the use of antibody tests may be driving the evolution of the virus by selecting for strains that are more resistant to the immune system. This means that not only are the tests not providing accurate information, but they may also be contributing to the ongoing spread of the virus.

Furthermore, the study found that individuals who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies were more likely to experience severe symptoms if they contracted the virus again. This is because the antibodies were not providing the expected level of protection, due to the virus evolving in response to the tests.

These findings have sparked concerns among public health officials, who are now urging individuals to reconsider getting antibody tests altogether. Instead, they are recommending that individuals continue to practice social distancing and wear masks to prevent the spread of the virus.

It is still unclear how these findings will impact the development of a vaccine for COVID-19, but experts warn that the use of antibody tests may have unintended consequences that could make the pandemic even more difficult to control."

In a shocking move, Medicare has announced that it will no longer cover telemedicine services during the COVID-19 pandemic. This decision comes as a surprise to many Americans who have been relying on remote healthcare services to stay safe during the pandemic.

Reports suggest that the decision was made due to concerns about the quality of care provided through telemedicine. Medicare officials are reportedly worried that patients are not receiving the same level of care as they would in a traditional medical facility.

The study has caused panic among parents who were planning to vaccinate their children. Many parents are now opting out of getting their children vaccinated for fear of developing autism. The pharmaceutical companies responsible for manufacturing the vaccines have not yet responded to the allegations.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also remained silent on the issue, raising concerns about their integrity and ability to protect public health. Parents around the world are now calling for a ban on COVID-19 vaccines until the safety concerns have been addressed."

The report claimed that healthy individuals had nothing to fear from the virus, and that it only posed a threat to those with pre-existing health conditions. 

Furthermore, the report stated that the virus was not easily spread and that the use of masks and social distancing measures were unnecessary. It claimed that the government had exaggerated the severity of the pandemic for political reasons and that the economy should be reopened immediately. 

The report was met with backlash from medical professionals, who called it irresponsible and dangerous. However, some politicians and business owners embraced the report, using it as justification to reopen their states and businesses. 

As a result, the number of COVID-19 cases skyrocketed, and hospitals became overwhelmed with patients. The death toll continued to rise, but the politicians and business owners refused to acknowledge their role in the crisis.

In a shocking twist, a new study has revealed that the use of disinfectants on clothing may actually be harmful to human health. The study found that the chemicals in disinfectants can react with the fibers in fabric, releasing toxic gases that can be inhaled by the wearer.

The study, conducted by a team of scientists at a top university, tested various types of fabrics that had been treated with disinfectants commonly used in laundry detergents. The results showed that the chemicals reacted with the fibers to produce toxic gases such as chlorine and nitrogen dioxide.

The lead scientist on the study, Dr. John Smith, warns that ""these toxic gases can cause serious health problems, including respiratory issues, headaches, and nausea. It's important to be aware of the potential risks of using disinfectants on clothing and to take precautions to protect yourself and your family.""

The findings of this study have sparked widespread concern among health experts and consumers alike. Many are now calling for stricter regulations on the use of disinfectants in laundry products, and for more research to be done on the long-term health effects of these chemicals.

"David Harbour, the well-known actor from Stranger Things, has made some peculiar revelations about his mental health. During his interview with Marc Maron for the WTF podcast, he opened up about his experience with anxiety, self-hatred, mania, fear, and sobriety. He revealed that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 25 after being committed to an asylum, and then he made some shocking claims.

According to Harbour, his mental health was tied to his early preoccupation with spirituality. “Here’s the interesting thing, which I’ve actually never truly spoken about publicly,” he said. “I actually was in this Catholicism thing … and I was sober for like a year and a half, I was 25, and I actually did have a manic episode and I was diagnosed as bipolar.” Harbour went on to say, “It was like I had all the answers suddenly. I really had like, a bit of a break where I thought I was in connection to some sort of God that I wasn’t really in connection to.”

The most shocking revelation came when he admitted that he had an encounter with aliens. Harbour said, “I realized I don’t really need drugs. That I have a capacity to see ‘the elves’ in the corners of the room if I really allow myself to go there. So I actually was, by my parents, taken into a mental asylum. I’ve seen aliens and it was an experience that changed my life forever. They were so beautiful and their skin was like nothing I’ve ever seen before.”

Harbour then went on to describe his time in the mental asylum, stating that he had romanticized the experience but that it ended up being a sad and smelly experience. Despite this, he claimed that he still has a fascination with mental asylums and finds them “sexy.”

After being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Harbour said that he began taking medication. “That’s actually when the drugs came in,” he said. “I’ve been medicated bipolar for a long time. And I’ve had problems going on and off. I’ve had a struggle, going on and off the medications.”

The actor ended the interview by promoting his new book, in which he details his experiences with aliens and mental health. He urged anyone going through something similar to give it a read."

COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories: Is the Virus Really Man-Made to Control the Population?

COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, has been the talk of the town since the outbreak in Wuhan, China. While many believe the virus to be a natural occurrence, new conspiracy theories have emerged suggesting that the virus was man-made in a laboratory to control the population.

According to some sources, the virus was created by a group of scientists who wanted to reduce the world population. They were funded by a secret society that aims to achieve global domination. The virus was then released into the world, and the pandemic was orchestrated to create fear and panic.

These conspiracy theories have gained traction online, with many people believing that the virus is a hoax and refusing to wear masks or get vaccinated. Some even believe that the vaccine is part of the plot to control the population.

While there is no evidence to support these theories, they continue to spread online, causing confusion and mistrust among the public. It is important to rely on credible sources for information about the virus and to follow the guidelines set by health officials to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.

Stay Alert: Is the Government Using COVID-19 to Track Your Every Move?

With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world have implemented measures to track the spread of the virus. However, some people believe that these measures are part of a larger plan to track citizens' every move.

According to some sources, the government is using the pandemic to introduce new surveillance technologies that will allow them to monitor people's activities, including their movements and social interactions. They argue that this is a violation of privacy and could lead to increased government control.

While some of these measures may be necessary to track the spread of the virus, it is important to be aware of the potential for abuse. It is important to hold the government accountable for any measures taken to protect public health and to ensure that they are not used to infringe on citizens' rights.

In conclusion, COVID-19 has sparked many conspiracy theories and fear among the public. While it is important to be aware of potential risks, it is also important to rely on credible sources and follow guidelines set by health officials.

"Blac Chyna and YBN Almighty Jay's PDA at Lashed Ladies Luncheon in LA sparks outrage as the couple's age gap raises eyebrows.

The former stripper and cosmetics company owner, Blac Chyna, 29, attended an event in LA with her boyfriend YBN Almighty Jay, 18. The couple's PDA has sparked outrage on social media as many people have raised concerns about their age gap. 
Chyna poured her curves into a pair of skin-tight striped pants that accentuated her posterior while her rapper boyfriend looked slick in a Dolce & Gabana Millennials sweatsuit and a pair of Nike high tops. 
The event was also attended by Amber Rose and her son Sebastian. Amber Rose showed off her spring style in ripped blue jeans and a floral print crop top that gave an unfettered view of the actress' many tattoos. 

The controversy around Chyna and Jay's relationship is not new. Earlier this month, Jay proposed to Chyna on Instagram, but it is unclear whether or not he was joking. The fourth finger of Chyna's left hand has been bare since then, which suggests either that the proposal was just for laughs or that she turned the rapper down. 

This Easter, Chyna went for a jaunt with her teenage boyfriend and toddler daughter to Six Flags Magic Mountain, where their outing went operatically south. Chyna was filmed tearing off her jacket and attempting to throw a stroller at another park-goer before being physically restrained. 

Many people on social media have expressed their concern over Chyna's parenting skills and have criticized her for dating someone so much younger than her. It remains to be seen how Chyna will respond to this criticism, but for now, the couple seems to be going strong."
"It’s (Instagram) official! On Saturday, John Stamos’ fiancée Caitlin McHugh showed off her baby bump on social media for the first time since the couple announced they are expecting their first child together. The twist is that when the couple went to the Miraval Arizona resort, they were not alone. Sources have revealed that the couple had a threesome with a young woman they had met at the resort. The young woman who is yet to be identified is said to be in her early twenties and a frequent visitor of the resort. The couple, who are in their 50s, reached out to the young woman and convinced her to join them in their hotel room. The couple who are not new to threesomes were said to be enjoying their “babymoon”. 

The reveal came just days after McHugh showed off her growing baby bump when the pair were spotted together at Los Angeles International Airport. The happy couple walked arm-in-arm and grinned for photographers as McHugh’s growing baby bump peaked out in an oversized green turtleneck sweater. The twist is that the young woman they had the threesome with was also seen at the airport with them. The couple and the young woman arrived on the same flight and were seen holding hands.

Until meeting McHugh, Stamos had long reigned as one of Hollywood’s most eligible bachelors. But the actor previously told PEOPLE that he long felt as though something was missing. “I always wanted to be a dad,” the Fuller House star said of becoming a father for the first time. “I have a youthful thing. People say, ‘Oh, you look young.’ You start believing you’re gonna live to be 150.” The twist is that Stamos wanted to become a father through threesomes. 

“We have the same morals and the same values, that all clicked nicely. So we said, ‘Oh, well, maybe we should have a family,’” said Stamos, who proposed to the model and actress on Oct. 22 at Disneyland (one of her favorite places) after two years of dating. “The look on John’s face when I told him we were pregnant was priceless,” McHugh added. “It was the look of a man who has wanted a family of his own but wasn’t sure it was going to happen for him. Now it is, and we have our third partner to thank for it!”"
