Stamos' fianc√©e, 31-year-old actress Caitlin McHugh, debuted her adorable baby bump in an Instagram post on Saturday. The photo, in which McHugh stands underneath the bright sun, was taken on the couple's babymoon at the Miraval resort in Tucson, Arizona.  ""Good morning baby of mine,"" McHugh wrote, captioning the photo apparently taken by Stamos.  If that's not the very definition of glowing, we don't know what is!  The ""Fuller House"" star got engaged to McHugh in October and later declared their intention to start a family, saying it would be ""a tragedy"" if they didn't have kids together.  Could they be any cuter? Rachel Murray / Getty Images  In December, the couple shared the happy news that they were expecting a baby. Stamos explained to People magazine that McHugh became pregnant shortly before the pair were engaged. In fact, he revealed, the news prompted him to make their relationship engagement-official.  The exciting journey for the couple is enough to make us say, ""Have mercy!""  We can only imagine the beautiful babe these two will make ... and the elaborate social media post they'll make to announce his or her birth.  The road to their ""Fuller House"" is a show we can't stop watching!"

"TV  No contestant is going to sing Taylor's songs during the auditions since Katy 'is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'.'  Oct 20, 2017  AceShowbiz - Katy Perry seemingly doesn't want to get reminded of her enemy Taylor Swift any where and any time, including on ""American Idol"" revival. Now that she serves as one of the judges on the ABC show, the ""Swish Swish"" singer reportedly bans the contestants from singing any of Taylor's song.  However, a source explains to Naughty Gossip that it's not because she hates the ""Look What You Made Me Do"" singer, but because Katy wants to keep the spotlight on the show and the contestants. ""Katy wants the show to be about finding new talent not the ongoing drama between her and Taylor,"" reveals the source.  The source continues saying, ""If someone auditioning sings a Taylor song then the whole thing becomes about Katy's reaction, not the person auditioning.""  Katy reportedly ""is insisting on a drama-free 'idol'."" In addition, ""she's not exactly upset that people will be singing her hits and not Taylor's.""  On the revived show, Katy will be joined by fellow coaches Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan. Meanwhile, Ryan Seacrest once again will host the show, which previously aired on FOX for 15 seasons since 2002 until 2016.  Katy was the first singer tapped to be the judge for the new season with a whooping $25 million contract, before the show announced the R&B singer and the country crooner as the second and third judge. ""I am very excited to be joining Katy, Luke and Ryan on 'American Idol'. As a singer, songwriter and producer, I feel I can bring a great deal of experience to the table. It's going to be so much fun!"" 68-year-old Richie gushed in a statement. Meanwhile, Luke said, ""To be in a position in my career to help facilitate this along with the other judges is just a complete honor. It's gonna be a blast!""  ""This is the dream team,"" the ""Bon Apetit"" singer gushed over her co-stars during an appearance on ""Good Morning America"", adding that the three of them clicked from Day 1.  ""American Idol"" is set to premiere in early 2018 on ABC."
"Rebel Wilson is joining a chorus of actors and actresses in Hollywood who are sharing their experiences with sexual harassment and misconduct.  Wilson, an Australian who has starred in the ""Pitch Perfect"" films, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that she took a break from ""creating new comedy overseas"" to share her experiences, one which she said involved ""a male star in a position of power.""  I've been away in a 'bubble' of sorts creating new comedy overseas but it's so hard to hear all these stories relating to sexual harassment and assault in Hollywood.

""Nothing physical happened because the guy's wife called and started abusing him over the phone for sleeping with actresses and luckily she was yelling so loud ... that I could hear her and I bolted out of there immediately.

Kevin Winter/Getty Images  Wilson, who will next be seen on the big screen in ""Pitch Perfect 3,"" out Dec. 22, wrote that she realized she's one of the ""lucky"" ones.

"Hollywood insiders have revealed to OK! USA that the former couple are taking steps to get their marriage back on track.    'They‚Äôve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He‚Äôs sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he‚Äôs come out a better person, and he‚Äôs grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie‚Äôs plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don‚Äôt want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they‚Äôre ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there‚Äôs even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It‚Äôll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection. And Zahara and Viv want to help their mum pick out a dress.'"
"Alison Sweeney, the former host of The Biggest Loser and star of the soap opera Days of Our Lives, has been granted a temporary restraining order against a man who has been consistently harassing her on social media.  Jon Christopher LuVisi, 49, has allegedly been peppering Sweeney‚Äôs various social media accounts with comments for years, but they‚Äôd recently gotten more hostile, prompting Sweeney to apply for the restraining order.  ‚ÄúThe Defendant‚Äôs unwanted contact with the Plaintiff has spanned the course of years, but in the past nine months escalated to such an extent that Plaintiff reasonable fears for her safety and the safety of her family,‚Äù read the court documents.

The order also states that he must stay away from her kids‚Äô school.  Sweeney, 40, has said in the past that LuVisi has tried to extort money from her and consistently threatened her. He also implied that he and the Days star were having an affair. (Sweeney has been married to California Highway Patrol officer David Sanov since 2000.)  She didn‚Äôt want to take any chances, especially when LuVisi allegedly sent her messages like ‚ÄúB***h you better answer me,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push me. Your really starting to piss me off,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hide from me you sorry ass b***h.‚Äù  Sweeney says that every time she tried to block LuVisi from contacting her, he would just make up a new account and continue the harassment. She also claims that somehow LuVisi discovered her home address and posted it to the internet.

"  Rumors of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West getting a divorce are highly exaggerated. The superstar couple are still married.  According to Gossip Cop, OK! Australia recently published an issue with the headline ""Kim & Kanye: It‚Äôs Finally Over! Divorce Papers Signed!"" The cover even showed documents, claiming they proved the divorce. But one never happened.  In fact, the documents on the cover are actually from Kardashian's 2004 divorce from her first husband, Damon Thomas. They are in the public record, so the documents can be easily obtained on the web.  The content in the report is exactly the same as what appeared in In Touch Weekly.That issue included a supposed quote from Kardashian, ""Kanye's not the man I fell in love with."" The cover also claimed West broke down in tears and Kardashian took their three children to live with her mother, Kris Jenner.  At the time the two reports were published, both OK! Australia and In Touch were owned by the same company, Bauer Media. As of July 1, In Touch is owned by American Media Inc., the publisher of Us Weekly, Radar Online and the National Enquirer.  In Touch claimed that Kardashian was pushed ""over the edge"" after they went to Paris in June. A source told the magazine Kardashian was upset after seeing West hug Virgil Abloh at the Louis Vuitton fashion show. But if Kardashian was upset, she did not show it publicly. In fact, she retweeted a video of the scene, adding a heart emoji.  The trip was emotional for Kardashian, since it marked her first time in Paris since she was robbed there in October 2016.  The tabloid report also claims Kardashian told her family she was leaving West after his infamous remarks about slavery to TMZ and his tweets. In reality, Kardashian publicly supported her husband. Later, West did admit he thought Kardashian would leave him.  ""There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, 'Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?'"" he told The New York Times last month. ""So that was a real conversation.""  West also referred to Kardashian's decision to stick by him in his son ""Wouldn't Leave,"" in which he raps, ‚ÄúTold her she could leave me now/But she wouldn‚Äôt leave.‚Äù  West and Kardashian have been married since 2014 and share three children, 5-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint and 6-month-old Chicago.

From left: Vili Fualaau and Mary Kay Letourneau in 2015 Heidi Gutman/ABC/Getty  The endurance of Letourneau‚Äôs connection to Fualaau is, to some outside observers, one improbable fact among many.  Their relationship started when when she was 34 and he was her 12-year-old sixth-grade student. Following a guilty plea for felony second-degree rape of a child, Letourneau was sentenced to six months behind bars, with three months suspended, and told to have no contact with Fualaau for life. But she was unable to stay away from him and was re-arrested when she was caught having sex with him, again, in a car.  Letourneau was sent back to prison and was released in 2004. She twice became pregnant with Fualaau‚Äôs child when he was underage. The couple eventually married and raised their two daughters together.  On Autobiography this week, she eventually agreed to speak in generalities about the state of her marriage.  ‚ÄúThere is a labor in love,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnyone who‚Äôs making love work in a marriage knows it‚Äôs work.‚Äù  Mary Kay Letourneau: Autobiography aired Tuesday and is available on demand and on A&E‚Äôs website.

"After hearing the news that American Idol would be returning to TV next year, we were full of questions: Who would the next judges be? Would J.Lo continue to serve up amazing glam moments? Would Ryan Seacrest give up his spot at Live with Kelly?  Nevertheless, we were giddy with excitement, and since the announcement that Katy Perry would take one of the coveted judge's seats for the new season, our enthusiasm was brought to a whole other level. Perry seems pretty thrilled by the news too, and the ""Bon Appetit"" singer's reported $25 million paycheck (and what would be the biggest salary in the show's history), according to TMZ, is the cherry on the cake (or in the pie?).  The news came up during Perry's appearance on 103.5 KTU with Carolina Bermudez on Tuesday. The radio show host asked the songstress if it bothers her that the entire Internet is talking about how much she's getting paid for the gig, and Perry had the perfect response for any naysayers: ""I'm really proud that, as a woman, I got paid,"" she said. ""And you know why? I got paid like more than like pretty much any guy that's been on that show. And, by the way, I love men. So I'm a paid woman and I'm ready for a beautiful man.""  No matter how big the payout, Perry's ultimate goal is finding America's next rising star. ""This show is about finding real talent, making peoples' dreams come true and additionally hearing their stories,"" she said. ""I want to see you. I want to hear you. I want to witness you.""

In 2012, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection against a debt of $49.5 million.  Chrisley is very conscious about disclosing his financial details. The chapter 7 bankruptcy papers revealed that he only had $4.2 million in assets, $55 in a bank account and $100 in cash when he filed the bankruptcy in 2012. According to his lawyers, he had to file bankruptcy because of a single hefty investment that went bad. On the other hand, numerous market experts have claimed that the 2008's housing market collapse triggered his bankruptcy.  Being untouched by the negative net worth, he still lives extravagantly. The reality star still lives in $2 million worth mansion. Previously, he lived in a lavish 30,000-sq.-ft. comfy Atlanta mansion with his wife and five children worth of $2.4 million.

But Gossip Cop says that they reached out to Mariah‚Äôs rep, who said that the rumors published by OK! are fake news. Furthermore, as Gossip Cop notes, Carey is worth millions of dollars. If the rumors were true, a stipend for her dancer boyfriend is probably not going to hurt her much financially. If Tanaka is receiving monetary compensation from Carey, then it‚Äôs in his capacity as her backup dancer and for appearing on her realty show, Mariah‚Äôs World.

"Actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini has launched another attack on the religion‚Äôs most famous member, Tom Cruise, declaring the movie star is ‚Äúdiabolical.‚Äù  Remini has been an outspoken critic of the church since leaving in 2013, receiving critical acclaim for her documentary series ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.""  In a Reddit AMA to promote the second season of the show, Remini was asked if she thought Tom Cruise, a Scientologist since 1990, was a ‚Äúgood person."" Her response was blunt.  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Jun 28, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT  ‚ÄúNo! Just going to get straight to it, no! There is a public persona of the guy who looks at you directly in the eye and shakes your hand and hugs you and is an attentive person to you and there‚Äôs the person behind the mask who is a completely different person,‚Äù she wrote.  ‚ÄúSomeone could say we all have that ‚Äî what we are to the public and who we are behind the scenes, but the people who are around Tom and work for Tom, not even people who are Scientologists, they will say he is diabolical,‚Äù she continued.  ‚ÄúPeople who‚Äôve worked with me will say I can be an a-----e ‚Äî all actors can be.

Consuelos has lived in Italy and the United States since childhood. He grew up in Lebanon, Illinois, and later in Tampa, Florida.[2] He attended Bloomingdale High School in Valrico, Florida, and then went to University of Notre Dame before transferring to and graduating from the University of South Florida with a degree in marketing in 1994.[5]  Career [ edit ]  Consuelos had a starring role in the educational serial Connect With English, which aired on public television stations as part of the Annenberg/CPB Project.[citation needed]  In February 1995, Consuelos had his breakthrough when he landed the role of Mateo Santos on the soap opera All My Children.[2] There, he fell in love with his on-screen love interest Kelly Ripa, and secretly married her in Las Vegas, in May 1996.

"Learning how to apply makeup isn't as simple as it seems‚Äîand watching complicated YouTube tutorials can only make you more confused. Does foundation go before or after concealer? Should you put your eyeshadow on first or last? The truth: It‚Äôs pretty much all up to personal preference. But after years of being a beauty editor and talking to makeup pros, I‚Äôve found a layering technique that works perfectly for me. For example, I fill in my brows before putting on foundation, since it‚Äôs one of the most important steps in my full routine. (So if I‚Äôm rushing at the end of my makeup routine, at least my brows will be done.) I also put on setting spray before mascara because I‚Äôve ruined one too many makeup looks with runny black streaks doing it the other way around.  I recommend this same application sequence to my girlfriends when I‚Äôm giving impromptu lessons in the bathroom before we go out, but don't worry‚Äîyou can remove and add steps as you see fit. For instance, I spend more time in areas like brows and highlighter, but you might want to focus your efforts on your eye makeup. I also edit based on how much time I have. I only have five minutes? Then I‚Äôm priming, concealing, adding some blush and highlighter, and putting on a quick brow. If I‚Äôve got an entire hour to prep, then I‚Äôm going all out. Really, you can customize this guide to fit your needs. Consider this a makeup beginner‚Äôs outline to layering your makeup, step by step.  Step 1: Moisturize or apply a primer.  Kardashian favorite Mario Dedivanovic says using a hydrating cream before makeup helps all the powders and products you apply on top sink into the skin, making your makeup look less cakey. Since I prefer a dewy makeup look, I spray my face with a mist like MAC Prep + Prime Fix+ ($26). Then I massage in an illuminating primer or oil like Farsali Unicorn Essence ($54). You don‚Äôt have to use a product that is marketed as a primer; any moisturizer will do.  Step 2: Fill in brows.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I always start my makeup look with the most time-consuming element. For me, that‚Äôs my brows (others like to do eyeshadow first, but I‚Äôm pretty clueless when it comes to eye makeup). First, I use a pencil to fill in sparse areas with hairlike strokes. Currently I‚Äôm liking the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz pencil ($21). I‚Äôll stop here if I‚Äôm in a hurry. When I‚Äôm being extra, I add a powder or pomade to really define the ends of my brows, where there is basically no hair. For this, I use Kat Von D 24-Hour Super Brow Long-Wear Pomade ($19). Finally, I lock it all in with a gel, like It Cosmetics Brow Power Pomade ($24).  Step 3: Apply foundation.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I don‚Äôt like to use a lot of foundation, which is why I follow makeup artist Faye Lauren‚Äôs rule of thumb: Focus on the areas you want to even out and leave the rest of the face foundation-free. So, I apply my foundation starting at the center of my face: Around my nose, the eyes, and on my forehead, but I leave the area around my jawline only lightly covered. This prevents me from getting brown makeup stains everywhere when I put my hands on my chin throughout the day (that‚Äôs my thinking pose). I like to use a sponge or brush to apply my foundation, because I hate having my fingers dirty with product.  Step 4: Cover dark spots with concealer.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Carmen Williamson, a makeup artist at Joanna Czech Dallas, previously told SELF that the best way to layer on concealer is after foundation in order to make sure your makeup blends together and that you don‚Äôt overdo it. This method works best for me because I get the kind of brightening I need for my purplish-black dark circles. I use a shade that is a bit lighter than my foundation under my eyes. I also apply a little concealer to my lids to act as a primer for when I wear eyeshadow.  Step 5: Add eyeshadow.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  You know those YouTube tutorials with eyeshadow primer and four shadow colors? I can‚Äôt do all that. I just pick one shade that reflects my outfit or my mood and put it all over my lids. Sometimes I try to get fancy and do a darker color in the crease of my eye, but that‚Äôs only if I‚Äôm planning to be in a dark place (like a club or ballroom) where no one will notice my eyeshadow ineptitude .  Step 6: Finish off the eye look with liner.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I‚Äôm not a huge fan of complicated eyeliner looks (are you sensing an eye theme here?). I use a very fine pencil like the Marc Jacobs Fineliner Ultra Skinny Gel Eye Crayon ($24) to outline my waterline (that‚Äôs the area underneath the lashes). When I do eyeliner on top of my lid, I am bound to mess it up. So, I keep a stiff, angled eyeliner brush like the Trish McEvoy #50 Angled Eyeliner Brush ($29) to blend it out into a more natural-looking‚Äîand mistake free‚Äîline.  Step 7: Add blush to the apples of cheeks.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Blush is one of my favorite parts of applying makeup because a few swipes and I automatically look more put together. It probably has something to do with the fact that blush is usually the first colorful thing I add, whereas everything else is pretty neutral. I always use a powder blush in a bright vibrant color like orange or bright fuchsia. But first, I swipe a little setting powder under my eyes to set my concealer and down on my cheeks. This was a tip I learned from makeup artist Fiona Stiles.‚ÄúIf you try to apply a powder blush over liquid foundation, the pigment will streak and be impossible to blend,‚Äù she says. I apply the blush on the apples of my cheeks (that‚Äôs the best placement for my square face shape). I like to apply blush before highlighter because, as Stiles also told me, sometimes the shimmer in your blush is enough.  Step 8: Apply highlighter.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Highlighter is one of my go-to makeup items. When I only have five minutes to do makeup, I do brow, concealer, blush, highlight, and a lip. I start with a cream or liquid-based highlighter like Glossier Haloscope ($22) on my cheekbones and browbones as well as down my nose. I‚Äôll stop here if I‚Äôm just doing my makeup for a day at the office. If it‚Äôs a night out, I add a powder like Nars Highlighting Powder ($38) on top to elevate my shine at least two levels.  Step 9: Apply contour.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  There‚Äôs much debate about what if contour should be first or last in the cheek trifecta (blush/highlighter/contour), but I like to do it last. That‚Äôs mostly because it‚Äôs got to be a very special occasion for me to contour . I use a stick like the Fenty Beauty Matte Skinstick ($25) to get the defined lines on my cheeks, forehead, and nose (the right tool is the key to getting a contour that isn‚Äôt too muddy). Then, I use an angled brush to blend it all in.  Step 10: Swipe on a statement lip.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  On lazy days, I skip straight to this step. Sometimes a lip has got to be enough. I cover my entire lip with liner to help my lipstick last a lot longer‚Äîa pro-approved tip I learned from my mother. Over that, I add a layer of matte liquid lipstick in a color that matches the liner pretty closely. Then apply a lipstick color that works well with the lip liner shade.  Step 11: Set your entire face with setting powder or spray‚Äîor both.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Makeup artist Hector Simancas likes to use both setting powder and spray to keep makeup in place, and I take a similar strategy. I use powder, like Maybelline Facestudio Master Fix Setting + Perfecting Loose Powder ($7), in the T-zone and underneath the eyes. Then, I spritz with my favorite setting spray, Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray ($32), to make sure I maintain the dewy look I like.  Step 12: Finally, put on mascara.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Mascara is my very last step because I've found that if I put it on before my setting spray it usually ends up streaking down my face. I also make sure to keep Q-tips handy to easily clean up inevitable stray smudges without ruining all my work."
"Staci has spoken! By now, you've all heard Miranda Lambert has declared she is ""happily single,"" but you might not know how Staci Felker feels about it.  While she didn't outwardly address her now ex husband's split from Lambert, she did take to social media to defend him right before news of the split went public.  But keep in mind, the Turnpike Troubadours canceled their final two shows on Miranda's tour BEFORE news of the breakup surfaced, so we are 99.99999 percent sure Staci was already aware of the breakup when she responded to a fan on Instagram.  Here's how it all went down:  An Instagrammer decided to tell Staci she should remove all the photos of Evan from her social accounts.  Staci seemed to frown upon that idea.  According to Fox News, Staci responded by saying that Evan and his family will always mean something to her.  She went on to say she is very appreciative for the advice, but she has nothing but well wishes for Evan and his band.  She also revealed that a ""wife's love"" doesn't just fade away after six months, referring to the time her and Evan have been broken up.  Hmmm ...  What do you think her comments mean?  Over the last six months, there has been a tremendous amount of drama surrounding Staci, so her response was definitely unexpected.  Do you think her and Evan are in the midst of getting back together?  QCWriter is a journalist who is fueled by espresso and motivated by determination.

While many people call on their friends and family to be waiting in the background of a surprise proposal, Nick Kelble got an extra special guest while popping the question to his fianc√© in October ‚Äì Fiona, Cincinnati Zoo‚Äôs very own baby hippo.  Though Hayley Roll knew they were there to visit their favorite mammal in celebration of their one-year anniversary, what she didn‚Äôt know was that Fiona was about to make her appearance at just the right time. While Kelble got down on one knee to pop the question to Roll, baby Fiona pressed herself up against the glass, got a front row seat to the sentiments and gave the photobomb of a lifetime.

She grew from 29 pounds to 500 pounds by September 23. Since then, she has inspired two books, an ice cream flavor and has gained worldwide attention.

"Click here if you are having a problem viewing the photos or video on a mobile device  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, one of Hollywood‚Äôs most glamorous super couples, have split after just two and a half years of marriage, the Associated Press is reporting.  The two, who had been together as a couple for seven years, had been spending quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their Los Angeles home, People reported.  The couple issued a statement through Aniston‚Äôs longtime publicist, saying that the decision to separate ‚Äúwas mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year,‚Äù Page Six reported.  The couple also said they were making the announcement publicly, ‚Äúin an effort to reduce any further speculation.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúWhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else‚Äôs fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.‚Äù  The ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù star, 49, and Theroux, 46, a screenwriter and actor lauded for his performance in HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Leftovers,‚Äù were engaged in August of 2012. They married in August 2015 in an intimate but star-studded in the garden of their $21 million minimalist estate in Bel-Air. Jimmy Kimmel officiated, according to Harpers Bazaar.  Aniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005. As she and Pitt were breaking up, Pitt‚Äôs romance with Angelina Jolie became public.  The announcement that Aniston and Theroux are done comes just a few days after the actress celebrated her 49th birthday Sunday in Malibu with girlfriends, including Courtney Cox. Theroux, meanwhile, was across the country for New York fashion week, Us Weekly reported.  Sources recently told People that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.  ‚ÄúJustin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,‚Äù a source People. ‚ÄúWhen he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it‚Äôs very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.‚Äù  But Aniston told a story of marital bliss in a conversation with actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, published in September in Harper‚Äôs Bazaar. The two shared happy memories of Aniston‚Äôs wedding to Theroux. Sedaris, who is a good friend of Theroux‚Äô, served as his ‚Äúbest man.‚Äù  ‚ÄúEverything about that wedding was perfect,‚Äù Sedaris said. ‚ÄúEveryone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy.‚Äù  Aniston said it was ‚Äúfun‚Äù to revisit a video of the wedding Theroux had just given her.  But the actress, who has a passion for interior design, also talked about the challenges of working together on updating their Bel-Air mansion, which is featured on the March cover of Architectural Digest.  ‚ÄúThey say building houses can make or break a couple,‚Äù Aniston said. ‚ÄúI was so used to doing it on my own, and there were moments when I was like, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt say no so fast.‚Äô I have this dialogue with my interior designer where I‚Äôll go: ‚ÄòNo. Hate it. Move. Next.‚Äô That can sound a little abrupt, so I had to retool my attitude a bit. It wasn‚Äôt very hard because he loved whatever I brought to him.‚Äù"

"usapoliticsnow admin.A string of events this week has led to incredible results in a 23-year-old case that had gone completely cold. After a reporter for The Washington Examiner was shot dead in front of his home and a letter was sent to his editor on his behalf, an investigation began into the death of Clinton attorney Vince Foster. Foster‚Äôs death in 1993 had been ruled a suicide..With new evidence, Rep. Trey Gowdy successfully petitioned a federal judge to have the body of Vince Foster exhumed for autopsy. The body wasn‚Äôt autopsied before burial the first time, which aided in the theory of a cover-up. Forensic specialists examined the body last night at the Naval Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia, concluding that the cause of death for Mr. Foster should be changed from suicide to homicide..LT Col. James McFitting, head of the hospital‚Äôs forensics lab, told reporters in his office that Foster had not one but two gunshot wounds, both of which would have been fatal. There would be no way he could have pulled the trigger himself a second time. The wounds were also in the back of his head, meaning unless he reached all the way around to make it look like a murder and fired two identical guns at the same time, the original story was impossible..The doctor who signed Foster‚Äôs death certificate died in a car crash a few months later and the police detectives who worked the case have both left the country, never to be seen again. Without the letter from the reporter, Mr. Foster may have never seen justice..The case has been turned over to the FBI, who has clear jurisdiction at this point, for the difficult task of connecting the dots from Foster‚Äôs death directly to Bill and Hillary Clinton. Director Comey has assured the congressional panel that he will personally see to it that all of the bureau‚Äôs resources are made available..In other words, Clinton will be getting away with murder‚Ä¶again.."
"During the presidential race, Republican candidate Donald Trump has often criticized China, most often on economic grounds. But in the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., on Jan. 14, 2016, Trump also took a shot at China over foreign policy -- specifically for not doing enough to rein in its neighbor, North Korea.Trump said, ""China, they don't like to tell us but they have total control -- just about, of North Korea. They can solve the problem of North Korea if they wanted to, but they taunt us.""With the secretive nation back in the news for its claimed (but unverified) hydrogen bomb test earlier this month, we wondered whether Trump was right that China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""When we took a closer look at this question, we found that experts on the region offered a nuanced answer. China, they said, does have notable influence over North Korea because it provides or enables transit for much of North Korea‚Äôs supply of goods from the outside world. But that influence, they added, falls well short of ""total control.""""China does not ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô North Korea in any real sense of the word, but it has influence over North Korea -- perhaps not as much as we think, but more than Beijing is willing to acknowledge,"" said Evans J.R. Revere, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution‚Äôs Center for East Asia Policy Studies.Robert Ross, a China expert at Boston College and Harvard University, compared the relationship between China and North Korea to that between a parent and a teenager.""It‚Äôs similar to dealing with a rebellious adolescent,"" Ross said. ""Do the parents have total control? Perhaps ‚Äì they provide food and shelter. But the cost to the parents of using such leverage can be prohibitive ‚Äì driving a child out of the house and away from the family. China has much at stake in its strategic and economic relationship with North Korea. But is there total control? That is debatable.""China‚Äôs leverage over North KoreaThe strongest argument for China having significant control over North Korea stems from its role in trade, particularly food and fuel.North Korea has a lengthy land border with China -- its longest with any neighbor -- and while North Korea also has seaports, the rest of the world can more easily monitor shipments into those ports, making it preferable from North Korea‚Äôs perspective to move goods over land. Research by Stephan Haggard of the University of California-San Diego and Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates that China may account for as much as 80 percent of North Korea‚Äôs trade, and a similar percentage of its investment flows.""North Korea would face daunting economic problems if China were to fully exercise its leverage, for example by cutting off oil supplies or threatening to do so,"" Haggard told PolitiFact.Why ‚Äòtotal control‚Äô is an exaggerationYet while China‚Äôs economic lifeline gives it leverage, that doesn‚Äôt mean it can simply wave a wand and make things happen in Pyongyang -- something one might reasonably assume when hearing Trump‚Äôs quote. (The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry.)For starters, China has worried -- with reason, experts say -- that pushing so hard that the current North Korean regime collapses would lead to a humanitarian disaster on its border.""China is reluctant to exercise its leverage, fearing possible effects of an economic breakdown on its border and an outflow of refugees,"" Haggard said.It also has become painfully obvious over the years that North Korea doesn‚Äôt exactly listen to outsiders.""Mr. Trump is correct that the Chinese have leverage, but it is leverage they would have to use with the North Korean regime resisting them with everything they had,"" said Joseph de Thomas, a professor of international affairs at Penn State University. ""This is hardly control.""Not only has North Korea thumbed its nose at the United Nations and world powers, but its government has taken extreme measures to keep its citizens ignorant of the outside world. In fact, the country‚Äôs national ideology -- juche -- is undergirded by the concept of self-reliance.""North Korea is a country that prides itself on answering to no one and following no one's lead,"" Revere said. ""This has been a consistent element of North Korean behavior for decades, and is of course the reason why the regime is such a danger for the United States, for South Korea, the East Asia region, and the international community at large.""Indeed, despite North Korea‚Äôs heavy reliance on China for food, fuel and virtually all other goods, ""it is not clear that the leadership cares,"" said Ross of Boston College and Harvard. ""For decades the population has lived in extreme poverty, while the elite has fared very well.""Meanwhile, North Korea‚Äôs development of its nuclear program has given it a measure of strategic independence from China -- which only further complicates China‚Äôs situation.This was on display with the recent test of the purported hydrogen bomb.""China publicly and privately exhorted North Korea not to test nukes and missiles over the past few months, to no avail,"" said Scott A. Snyder, director of the program on U.S.-Korea policy at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""As a result, relations between China and North Korea are strained. Chinese President Xi has not met with North Korea‚Äôs Kim Jong-un, while meeting six times with the South Korean leader.""That does not sound like a country in ""total control"" of another.Trump‚Äôs claim ""suggests a fundamental lack of understanding of both China and North Korea, both today and over the decades,"" Revere said. ""It is virtually certain that the Chinese were given no advance warning of the test, and Chinese anger was quite evident in the public statements the government made after the test. In the view of virtually every North Korea and China expert I know, the nuclear test was a slap in China's face, in addition to being a major challenge and threat to the international community.""Our rulingTrump said China has ""total control, just about, of North Korea.""He has a point that China holds significant leverage over North Korea if it wishes to exercise it, since China provides the vast majority of North Korea‚Äôs international trade, including food and fuel imports. But Trump‚Äôs assertion, even slightly hedged as it is, overlooks some significant limits to that leverage, notably the North Korean government‚Äôs willingness to follow its own drummer even if that means its people suffer. The fact that North Korea recently conducted a nuclear test over the strenuous objections of China suggests that Beijing lacks anything approaching ""total control"" over North Korea.The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False."

"Chatting openly about the challenges of having sex when pregnant is still fairly stigmatised, but Khloe Kardashian‚Äôs having none of it. She‚Äôs finding pregnancy sex pretty confronting and awkward ‚Äì and she‚Äôs keen to talk about it. Quel surprise!  ‚ÄúFor me it‚Äôs been interesting‚Äù  Khloe‚Äôs pregnant with her first baby, with partner Tristan Thompson, and it‚Äôs fair to say that she‚Äôs already pretty closely acquainted with the pregnancy journey, thanks to her family. Sister Kourtney has three kids, Kim also has three (carrying two of them herself) and her sister Kylie has a newborn. Tristan‚Äôs already navigated pregnancy, albeit in a separated way, too. He‚Äôs dad to one-year-old Prince with former partner Jordan Craig.  Khloe said she‚Äôd heard things about sexuality during pregnancy, and is now having her own evolving experience.  ‚ÄúI have always heard that women are extra horny when they‚Äôre pregnant,‚Äù Khloe posted on her blog, ‚Äúbut for me it‚Äôs been interesting.‚Äù  ‚ÄúUncomfortable and limiting‚Äù  Khloe says she‚Äôs feeling considerably less nimble in the sack, but is attempting to adapt to her new dimensions.  ‚ÄúIn the beginning, sex was the same. As I got into my third trimester and started to get bigger it became harder to have sex and a little more uncomfortable and limiting.‚Äù  The pair are apparently pushing on, and the mum-to-be notes that ‚Äúamazing‚Äù Tristan ‚Äòwould never make me feel different in any way.'‚Äù  While her body is making her feel self-conscious and a little cumbersome, Khloe‚Äôs hanging in there and giving it her best shot. Because ‚Ä¶ IN LOVE. She notes that she‚Äôs probably not the only one feeling weirded out and admits she‚Äôs not used to being quite so passive.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs uncomfortable for a man to have sex with a pregnant woman too. Personally, I get uncomfortable and insecure. Also, you can‚Äôt move the same, so you kind of feel useless, LOL. But you just have to improvise and do the best you can,‚Äù she advised.  ‚ÄúI was just in shock‚Äù  Khloe recently revealed that she‚Äôd always wanted to have a baby, but assumed she would not be able to easily conceive due to some potential issues with her ovaries.  ‚ÄúWhen I got pregnant, I was just so surprised. ‚ÄòCause you keep getting told ‚Äî you know when you hear all these things about yourself, you just start believing them. And, I was just in shock. I think, as much as everybody else was,‚Äù Khloe recalls.  The couple confirmed the pregnancy in December of 2018, on Instagram. Then last month, Khloe hinted at her due date with a photo celebrating ‚Äúofficially 6 months‚Äù. This suggests she‚Äôs due in mid-late April ‚Äì and we can not wait to find out the baby‚Äôs name!"
"Dean Unglert, green-eyed Ken doll and America‚Äôs boyfriend, is on many people‚Äôs short list to be the next Bachelor. And I mean, why wouldn‚Äôt he be? He‚Äôs smart (I think). He‚Äôs handsome. He‚Äôs funny. He‚Äôs handsome. Did we mention handsome? Where was I? Oh yeah, this dude began his Bachelorette tenure with a vaguely racist comment and he would STILL be a better Bachelor than the last like, five dudes we‚Äôve had (minus Ben, you‚Äôre perfect). Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt have a speech impediment, isn‚Äôt a raging misogynist, and also isn‚Äôt responsible for anyone‚Äôs death as far as we know, so sign me tf up. And by me I mean him. But also me. To compete on his season. Yeah, okay, you get it. Moving on.  Last night‚Äôs Men Tell All didn‚Äôt reveal who the next Bachelor would be, so it‚Äôs no surprise that #DeanforBachelor was trending on Twitter during the episode. I‚Äôm honestly just surprised that enough people were able to break themselves away from the spell Dean‚Äôs eyes cast upon them for long enough to create a hashtag, but I would like to thank those heroic Americans for their service to this country. But will Dean Unglert be the next Bachelor? Sorry, Deanie Babies. It‚Äôs not looking likely. Let‚Äôs look at the evidence.  Exhibit A: Dean is on Bachelor in Paradise. While I‚Äôm fully aware that being on Bachelor in Paradise does not preclude you from becoming The Bachelor, having Dean be on The Bachelorette and then Bachelor in Paradise two weeks later and THEN be The Bachelor seems like a lot. He would have to have Nick Viall levels of blackmail material on everyone working at ABC in order to pull that off, and I just don‚Äôt see that happening for a relative rookie to the franchise. However, I am in no way suggesting that my eyes, ears, or soul would tire of seeing Dean on my television screen, in case anyone from ABC is reading this. When it comes to how many consecutive hours of Dean I could feasibly watch on TV:  Exhibit B: Dean said he is not ready to be The Bachelor. I know‚ÄîI‚Äôm already crafting my excuse to call out of work sick tomorrow so I can deal with this news, too. But it‚Äôs (reportedly) true. Dean supposedly told The Hollywood Reporter, which sounds like a fake news outlet if I‚Äôve ever heard one, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready yet, at this point in my life.‚Äù Dean‚Äôs right; he‚Äôs got to rack up a good thousand more Instagram followers before he can truly be ‚Äúready.‚Äù However, he did add, ‚ÄúOf course, I would never immediately dismiss any offer, but I‚Äôd really have to sit down and really think about it.‚Äù I think that‚Äôs our cue to create a GoFundMe to come up with the extra cash ABC needs to present Dean with an offer he can‚Äôt refuse, right? I‚Äôll set one up just in case.  So I mean, who really knows what will happen. I think I speak for all of us when I say that if ABC tries to pull some fuckery and Nick Viall us again with some lame-ass dude from three seasons ago, I will personally burn the studio to the ground."

Angie's body of work is pretty impressive, ranging from strong badass women in films like Wanted to brilliant character depictions like Girl, Interrupted. She is arguably one of the best actresses working at the moment.  3. Her dedication to her family.  They go everywhere with her. All of them. ALL OF THEM!  Advertisement  4. Her humanitarian campaigns.  Angie in the past has worked as a UN ambassador drawing attention to war torn areas across the globe. She is also a spokeswoman on rape during war and works tirelessly to help children who are harmed by war. These are just a few of Angie's campaigns for which she has been honoured for on many an occasion. Oh, and after her visit to Cambodia, SHE called the UN to ask how she could help.  5. Taking the director's seat.  On top of a huge workload in acting, Angie has now moved into the director's seat for In the Land of Blood and Honey and the upcoming Unbroken.  6. She's one half of one of our favourite couples.  Advertisement  Brad! BRAD AND ANGIE! Too much.  7. That Oscar speech.  Adorable.  8. She's a little bit left of centre.  Yes, she went around with a vial full of her other half's blood, but you know what? Angelina doesn't really care what you think.  Advertisement  9. She's brave.  The actress underwent a double mastectomy last year, but she also came clean about it in the press, a very brave decision for the actress and an inspirational story for many others.  10. Those lips!  They are hers. Honestly.  11. She is completely badass.  Lara Croft? Salt? Wanted? Mr. and Mrs. Smith? We wouldn't want to get in a fight with Angie, that's all we know."
"Kim Kardashian made everyone at the 2017 Met Gala wait for her. She wasn't one of the first to arrive, but tweeted fans that she was ""on the way."" Still, she proved it was worth the wait in a gorgeous gown, attending solo without husband Kanye West.  While last year Kardashian went for a robot-chic look in a skin-tight metallic dress, this year she completely changed it up. The star is wearing a white, off-the-shoulder dress by designer Vivienne Westwood. We're not totally sure how it fits with the Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar√ßons theme, but it's pretty nonetheless.  Kardashian wears her bob sleek and straight, courtesy of stylist Michael Silva. Mario Dedivanovic did her makeup, of course. Like her dress, it's pretty and soft. We're drooling over her shimmery eyeshadow and pale-pink lipstick ‚Äî both from Chanel. (The fact that she isn't wearing a shade from the KKW by Kylie Cosmetics lip collection is a bit of a miss though, TBH.)  Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images  If you watched this past week's episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, you'll know Kardashian is keeping a lower profile lately, after she was robbed in Paris. She's wearing less pricey jewels and less flashy hair and makeup. We totally get why she's nervous after her horrifying experience, but hope she's doing this pared-down look for herself ‚Äî and no one else.  My whole life has changed, as far as how I travel and what security [I have],"" she told Ellen DeGeneres recently. ""I never thought I‚Äôd need security staying outside my door, even though I have a lot of jewelry. If you think about it, I should have had security outside my door 24/7 when I‚Äôm traveling. And I didn‚Äôt. Now, I have several just so I can be able to sleep at night.""  For more on Met Gala 2017:  The Craziest Hairstyles from the Met Gala:"

Locklear was arrested in February for felony domestic violence and battery on a police officer after an ensuing fight with her boyfriend at her home in Los Angeles.  She was charged with five criminal counts in that case, but was not charged with hitting her boyfriend despite being arrested for the offense.  In June, Locklear was hospitalized and placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold after she allegedly choked her father and struck her mother.  The ""Melrose Place"" alum voluntarily entered rehab following her release.  Locklear is best known for appearing on ""Dynasty"" and ""T.J. Hooker"" in the 1980s and ""Melrose Place"" in the 1990s. She was arrested after the incident in February and posted her $20,000 bail.  She had issues with substance abuse in the past and most recently entered rehab last year. She was arrested previously in 2008 on suspicion of driving under the influence. However, the charges were later dismissed.  She was sentenced at the time to three years of informal probation and ordered to pay $700 as a fine and to take a driving safety class.  Fox News' Leora Arnowitz contributed to this report."
"Meghan Markle‚Äôs latest role as Britain‚Äôs Duchess of Sussex has come with a unique set of problems ‚Äî all thanks to several estranged family members constantly speaking to the press.  ‚ÄúMeghan is absolutely broken by the drama with her father,‚Äù a source close to the former ‚ÄúSuits‚Äù star told Us Weekly Wednesday. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way she can have a relationship with him or even reach out to him to stop him from speaking. She knows he‚Äôll record the conversation and sell it. She has high anxiety wondering if this will go on forever.‚Äù  Despite her public woes, the 37-year-old has received support from her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II.  ‚ÄúWhat may surprise some is just how supportive Her Majesty has been during the problems Meghan has faced with her family,‚Äù claimed a Buckingham Palace insider. ‚ÄúMeghan is in a tough place, and the queen knows it‚Äôs completely out of Meghan‚Äôs hands. She has only sympathy for what‚Äôs been a difficult and distressing situation for her.‚Äù  The palace insider added the 92-year-old monarch has great admiration for the American actress, who became the newest member of the House of Windsor when she married Prince Harry in May.  ‚ÄúWhile Meghan and the queen come from two very different backgrounds and generations, there‚Äôs a warmth between the two that‚Äôs genuine and loving,‚Äù said the source.  Harry, 33, was determined to make sure Elizabeth and Markle had a close bond.  ‚ÄúHe wanted to make sure every family member knew that the queen supported the relationship and how important it would be for Meghan, who‚Äôs from a very different background, to feel welcomed and supported,‚Äù said another source.  The insider added it was Harry who requested a sit-down with his grandmother when he knew his romance with Markle was getting serious.  ‚ÄúThe queen became fond of Meghan at their first meeting,‚Äù said the insider. ‚ÄúNot just because she‚Äôs the charming woman who brought happiness into her grandson‚Äôs life, but also because she quickly demonstrated that she‚Äôs intelligent, polite and keen to learn.‚Äù  Just days before Meghan walked down the aisle in front of millions to marry Harry, she announced her father wouldn‚Äôt attend the royal wedding following his heart surgery.  ‚ÄúSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,‚Äù she said in a statement released by Kensington Palace. ‚ÄúI have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.  ‚ÄúI would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.‚Äù  Kensington Palace then announced Meghan would be walked down the aisle by Prince Charles, Harry‚Äôs father.  Markle‚Äôs surgery followed days of press surrounding his health and speculation on whether or not he‚Äôd attend the royal wedding.  He also stirred headlines when it was revealed he staged paparazzi photos that showed him preparing for the big day.  Back in January, Grant, 53, told Fox News she and her family are new to the spotlight and it can be difficult to cope with the worldwide interest in their personal lives.  ‚ÄúAs much as I love and respect Meg, she‚Äôs got security and a publicist and can be protected from all that,‚Äù said Grant. ‚ÄúShe and Harry can tell the media to stop. The rest of the family doesn‚Äôt have that luxury. I love her, [but] she may not want me saying anything.  ‚ÄúI refuse to be a victim of the media. I‚Äôm not going to let them disparage me, embarrass me personally and professionally and not defend myself‚Ä¶ I can only hope she would respect and understand that‚Ä¶ In fact, if I were Meg, I would probably put something out there so that there was some sort of protective mechanism in place where the family couldn‚Äôt be tortured as much."""

"As per usual, one of Hollywood's favorite couples left fans swooning. This time, it didn't take much to muster up all of the lovey dovey feels ‚Äî just two black jackets. A photo of Selena Gomez and The Weeknd's matching outfits takes #relationshipgoals to new levels and proves a tough but chic look is a perfect date ensemble.  The lovebirds hit New York City on Saturday, Sept. 2 ‚Äî the first fall-like day in the Big Apple ‚Äî with black garb that's perfect for the cooler days ahead. Gomez's biker jacket sported a punk rock look that she complimented with a dash of red thanks to (presumably) one of her designer Coach bags. The Weeknd's jacket sported a more casual feel. The two, ironically enough, headed for The Vintage Twin in SoHo, so they had the whole twinning thing on lock.  Since it was one of the first days in New York where you needed a jacket, you gotta hit the downtown streets in style. These two were totally up for the challenge and didn't overdo the whole ""it's getting cold"" look. Some New Yorkers were walking around in scarves and heavy coats, but we're not quite at that point just yet, folks. This day-date outfit was the perfect in between.  To take their East Coast date up a notch, Gomez and The Weeknd also stopped to peruse a New York City store, but not just any store ‚Äî the store. You get where I'm going with this. The two were spotted in a pet store, according to Hollywood Life, and that means serious business. As the saying goes, ""at the end of the day, it's all about who you want to own a dog with.""  Though the two were very clearly missing from this year's VMAs ‚Äî leaving fans in a tizzy ‚Äî they deserve a little R&R for themselves. Enjoy the city, you two. Hope you find a super adorable puppy!"
"The 75th Golden Globe awards will soon be upon us. The annual ceremony brings together the biggest names in film and television for a boozy celebration of the previous year‚Äôs work, kicking off the season of acceptance speeches and red-carpet arrivals that culminates with the doling out of Oscars in early March.  Here‚Äôs what to know about the 2018 Golden Globes awards ceremony.  When are the Golden Globes?  The Golden Globes 2018 date is Sunday, Jan. 7. The awards will be broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton Hotel on NBC starting at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PST. Check out where you can watch or stream the Golden Globes online for free.  Who is hosting the Golden Globes?  Late Night‚Äòs Seth Meyers will host the 2018 Golden Globes, taking the baton from Jimmy Fallon, who presented the awards last year. Meyers joins a line of hosts that has previously included Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Ricky Gervais ‚Äî and he takes on the job as Hollywood continues to reel from numerous claims of sexual harassment and assault within the industry.

Who are the Golden Globe nominees?  The 2018 Golden Globes nominations were announced Dec. 11, with the The Shape of Water leading the pack among movies with seven nominations. The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri followed, with six nods each, while Lady Bird scooped up four nominations. Big Little Lies dominated on the TV side with six nominations, while Feud: Bette and Joan received four nods. Fargo, This Is Us and The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale each received three nominations.  One of the year‚Äôs biggest snubs came in the Best Director category, where no women were nominated. Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird), Patty Jenkins (Wonder Woman) and Dee Rees (Mudbound) were all passed over, despite directing some of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year. Other films that didn‚Äôt make the cut despite buzzy reception include The Big Sick and Mother!. For more, see this full list of 2018 Golden Globes nominees.  Who votes for the Golden Globes?  Golden Globes nominees rarely know who exactly is voting for them. The voters belong to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 90 journalists from all over the world that is rather secretive about the identities of its members.  Will anything be different about this year‚Äôs ceremony?  Yes, at least on the Golden Globes red carpet: Multiple high-profile actresses are reportedly planning to wear black to the ceremony to protest sexual harassment in Hollywood. According to People, participating nominees including Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone and Meryl Streep, among other women, plan to wear black dresses to the Golden Globes, and possibly to more events throughout awards season. Reports also indicate that many male actors, including Dwayne Johnson, intend to wear black in solidarity. Expect fewer questions about who attendees are wearing on the red carpet and more about why they‚Äôre wearing it.  Write to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com."
"In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the anthropomorphic tree-man Groot is no longer the towering, full-sized version voiced by Vin Diesel in the first film, but rather a pint-sized pipsqueak known as Baby Groot. This is because [clears throat for spoilers] according to writer and director James Gunn, the Groot we knew is dead. At the end of the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Groot wraps his tree-limbs into a sturdy wooden bubble to protect his pals as their ship falls from the sky. When it crashes, he shatters into a pile of kindling. His friends mourn, his partner Rocket plucks a twig from the wreckage, and regrows Groot into a dancing sprout. By the end of the second Guardians movie, Baby Groot is growing up.  According to director James Gunn, however, that wasn‚Äôt Groot using his neat regeneration powers, and he‚Äôs never going to grow back into the original Groot. Protesting a tweet asking ‚ÄúWho would you save, Baby Groot or a porg?‚Äù he points out that Baby Groot is an entirely new being that is, at best, a son.  First Groot is dead. Baby Groot is his son. ‚Äî James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  This isn‚Äôt the first time Gunn has mentioned this tidbit, which never fails to get Guardians of the Galaxy and Groot fans worked up. In a 2017 Facebook post, Gunn wrote, ‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs more obvious in Vol. 2, as Baby Groot has a different personality than Groot, none of his memories, and is much, much dumber.‚Äù When the issue resurfaced today, Gunn lamented on Twitter, ‚ÄúThe internet is like Groundhog Day every time I point out first Groot died.‚Äù This time, however, the news seems to have gone viral, leading Gunn to repeatedly emphasize the point to people asking questions and freaking out.  Of course they are. Would you think an infant was your dead grandfather? That little jerk has not clue what‚Äôs going on. ‚Äî James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  It‚Äôs canon AF (and it‚Äôs in the movies). ‚Äî James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  Given that Guardians of the Galaxy takes place in a fictional universe that includes talking raccoons, a scientific analysis may be beside the point. But if I were to push up my glasses here and talk about the technicalities, I might mention that asexual plant reproduction √† la stem-cutting ‚Äî like Rocket growing a new Groot from a twig ‚Äî would actually qualify as a clone. That‚Äôs because the new plant is genetically identical to the original, which means it‚Äôs not necessarily offspring. But I‚Äôm not here to get into a science fight!  What I do take issue with is Gunn implying that everyone who is shocked by this news is a dummy. James, my man, it is certainly not clear from the first film that the Groot sprout is not, in fact, the old Groot. Groot shows off his regenerative powers early in the film; the principle of Chekov‚Äôs gun would lead us, as viewers, to assume these facts are related. As for why Baby Groot is so stupid in the second film? I mean‚Ä¶ he has a tiny baby brain. Have you ever met a baby? They‚Äôre dumb.  Gunn wants Groot‚Äôs sacrifice in the first film to carry weight. But this Groundhog Day-style revelation he talks about muddies the revelatory waters. If he is in fact introducing a new Groot at the end of the first film, the timing is confusing at best. Offering up a cuter, tinier version of the same character in the credits is an emotional salve to heal up the wounds caused by Groot‚Äôs death before anyone leaves their seats, whether it‚Äôs a son, a clone, or just a great merchandising opportunity."

"By AM Conservative Post authorFareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‚ÄòForeign Affairs,‚Äô has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in The Washington Post.Zakaria‚Äôs blog post unapologetically calls to increase the death rate of white Middle America by systematically targeting Caucasian females.‚ÄúThe white race is rightfully failing because it is a foolish, arrogant, and self-absorbed ethnicity that has racism infused into its very genes. While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‚Äòwhite question‚Äô will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves. They may try and fight the unstoppable tide, but their resistance will grow only weaker as the white race loses its ability to keep its head above water. We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.‚ÄùThe blog post was removed from Zakaria‚Äôs blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.CNN officials have refused to take action against their employee.‚ÄúEvery death of a white person brings tears of joy to my eyes,‚Äù Zakaria posted on his Twitter account shortly after having to remove his blog post, in what is believed to be a passive-aggressive response to his critics.Photo Credit: World Economic Forum"

Meyers announced the news on Thursday, November 23, during the Thanksgiving episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, alongside his parents, Larry and Hilary Meyers, and his brother Josh, who were his guests on the show.  ‚ÄúI want to take this opportunity now, you guys obviously know, my wife and I are expecting a second baby,‚Äù the late-night host said. ‚ÄúVery excited. Thank you! Very excited.‚Äù  His mother told the audience the story of when her son called her to give her the good news. ‚ÄúI get the phone call, and my Seth is sometimes a crier.

"Taylor Swift performs during her '1989' Secret Session with iHeartRadio on Oct. 27, 2014 in New York City. (Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.  ""How do you not know how awesome you are?"" Nicolle Wallace asked.  ""I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,"" said Swift.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Celebrities have always raised eyebrows over their religion of choice ‚Äì for Tom Cruise and John Travolta it's Scientology, while the likes of Madonna and Ashton Kutcher were proud followers of Kabbalah for a long time.  And now it's Justin Bieber's turn to spark controversy with his reported closeness to Hillsong Church, a global strand of Christianity that looks to recruit followers with music, dancing and community care projects.  But Hillsong has also faced accusations that it acts as a cult, as well as allegedly having attempted to cover up the child abuse allegations levelled against its founder's father.  It is also accused of pushing its congregations to donate cash and of using Bible verses selectively to set its own agenda.  So what is Hillsong Church? How is Bieber involved? And why do so many of its detractors believe it's a modern-day cult?  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  Hillsong and child abuse  Brian Houston, who founded the Pentecostal Christian movement in Australia, stood down his own father, William 'Frank' Houston, as a preacher in 1999 after hearing an allegation that Frank had sexually abused a seven-year-old boy.  In a letter sent to church leaders in 2001, Brian claimed that there was no reason for the information to be spread any further afield, prompting claims of an attempted cover-up when the letter was leaked.  ""Sadly there are always one or two people with their own agendas who will try and get mileage from other people's pain,"" Brian's missive told ministers.  Frank would go on to leave Hillsong and died of a stroke in 2004. Fresh allegations that he'd molested six other children in New Zealand in previous decades continued to dog the organisation.  An investigation by Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found none of the allegations against Frank Houston were ever reported to police.  The commission's report found Frank had sexually abused the seven-year-old boy, and had later admitted it to an assembly of church executives.  Hillsong 'using selective Bible verses' to encourage hefty donations  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  Those who have been to Hillsong services report that leaders are swift to imply followers must give as much money as they can to the church.  In Hillsong's own FAQs, there are six different ways to donate money listed - including using the church's own app to transfer money immediately. There are also calls on its website to set up a direct deposit or have an online account so cash can be sent electronically.  As with many other churches, Hillsong followers will find empty envelopes left on their chairs ahead of services to be filled with money or standing order forms, which are collected up by staff. Collection buckets are also sent around the church during a service, with the congregation urged to dig deep.  Hillsong also uses Bible verses, such as Proverbs, to encourage its followers to donate generously. ""The godly love to give,"" its own site quotes.  The movement is big on ""the Biblical principle of tithing"", which requests that believers donate the first ten per cent of their income to the church.  ""Tithes and Offerings received at Hillsong fund the vision and activities of our church,"" says Hillsong.  The 2016 Hillsong Church annual report found donations made up over half of its revenue - with another 19% stemming from the dozens of Christian rock albums it produces.  Hillsong and homosexuality  Hillsong does not believe in homosexuality, in line with the Old Testament, nor does it agree with equal marriage. When a director of one of its church's choir was found to be in a committed gay relationship, Hillsong's founder issued a statement clarifying that the news came as ""a complete surprise"".  In a blog post, Brian Houston told his followers: ""Hillsong Church welcomes ALL people but does not affirm all lifestyles.  ""Put clearly, we do not affirm a gay lifestyle and because of this we do not knowingly have actively gay people in positions of leadership, either paid or unpaid.""  Justin Bieber was accused of homophobia in 2016 after reportedly turning down a role in Uber Girl, reportedly because his character would have a sex scene with another man, the film's co-writer Pete O'Neill claimed.  However, Bieber's rep said at the time there was ""no truth"" to his being offered the role in the first place.  Speaking in tongues  (Image: Splash News)  The act of speaking in tongues - or in a language that needs a special person to interpret - has long been associated with the Pentecostal churches.  ""We believe that in order to live the holy and fruitful lives that God intends for us, we need to be baptised in water and be filled with the power of the Holy Spirit,"" the church states on its site.  ""The Holy Spirit enables us to use spiritual gifts, including speaking in tongues.""  But many Christians believe it amounts to 'false worship' and 'showmanship', including members of a Facebook group who claim to be former followers of Hillsong.  One member, who said they had been involved in Hillsong for a few years in their early twenties, said church elders believed those who had been 'saved' would be given the gift of speaking in tongues.  (Image: carllentz/Instagram)  They also claimed to have been disturbed by one pastor's 'healing' service.  ""A visiting pastor performed a 'healing' show, calling out people wanting healing to the stage,"" they recalled.  ""Some people went up and were 'healed'. This didn't sit right with me because there was a wheelchair bound person in the room who was ignored. Was this beyond God's power? Could God only heal afflictions that have no visible sign of it actually being healed? How must that wheelchair bound person have felt? I imagine he'd be thinking 'my faith must not be good enough yet'.""  Justin Bieber's close connection to Hillsong leader  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: carllentz/Instagram)  Bieber spent six weeks in 2014 living with Pastor Carl - one of the church's lead pastors who is frequently compared to a rock star thanks to his charismatic brand of teaching - and grew close to the minister's family.  According to GQ, the troubled pop star moved into Carl's home after a period of car-crash media stories and reputational crisis. While he was there the two ""worked through some stuff"" and Bieber cried that he ""wanted to know Jesus"" before begging on his knees to be baptised.  He's since attended Hillsong services and conferences - and was even suspected of cancelling the rest of his Purpose world tour in July 2017 so he could found his own branch of the church.  Pandering to celebrities  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  It's not just Bieber who's known to follow Hillsong - his friends Kendall Jenner, Hailey Baldwin and ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez have also been linked to the religious movement.  While it attracts a cool, millennial-focused crowd, Hillsong believes all souls need to 'know Jesus' - but celebrities appear to have a special place in its pecking order.  ""People say we cater to celebrities and I say, yes, we do,"" Pastor Carl told GQ.  ""Celebrities deserve a relationship with God. Celebrities deserve a place to pray.""  Is Hillsong a cult?  (Image: Splash News)  (Image: Splash News)  The church elders have batted away accusations that the movement is a cult - certainly, its followers seem to have made up their own minds about it.  But many of the movement's detractors claim Hillsong's focus on charismatic preachers, music and song-based performances, and its push for funds and donations give the church a sinister spin.  However, Bobbie Houston, who helped husband Brian found Hillsong, has previously denied any cult claims, insisting followers simply wish to worship their god."
"32 SHARES Share Tweet Whatsapp  Jamie Dornan has become a sex symbol since taking on the role of Christian Grey in the ‚ÄúFifty Shades‚Äù franchise. While many would assume he‚Äôs always been successful with the ladies, that was not the case when he was younger.  During his recent appearance at the Graham Norton Show, the 35-year-old actor revealed that he went through great lengths to impress girls in order to ‚Äúget lucky‚Äù. Just like many others, Dornan too had a typical awkward teenager story. Although one might say, his embarrassing story is more R-rated than romantic.  In ‚Äúone of the worst stories in my locker‚Äù, Dornan recalled, ‚ÄúI was quite small and wasn‚Äôt hairy at all ‚Äì I was 15 and looked seven. On one particular day, I was in an amateur drama play and was going to a party after. For my role, I had bits of a black wig glued to my face for a beard and I decided to keep it for the party so I would look older. I also decided to cut up the rest of wig and glue it to my private parts just in case I got lucky‚Äú.  That reckless move backfired on the young Brit when it came time to remove the improvised pubic hair. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get lucky and removing the bits of wig ripped out the very small amount of natural hair I had down there. It was a physically and emotionally painful experience!‚Äù  During the interview, the handsome star also shared about the ‚Äúawful‚Äù scene to shoot in ‚ÄúFifty Shades Freed‚Äú. In the movie trailer, we see the shirtless Christian Grey in blue shorts walking out of the beach in France. ‚ÄúThat was horrendous. If they just tilt the camera down, that whole moment was awful,‚Äù Dornan told the host.  ‚ÄúWe had the beach, semi-sort of closed off, but actually there were loads of people that we didn‚Äôt have control over.They want me to be sexy coming out of the water. But it‚Äôs not a sand beach! It‚Äôs one of those wee pebble beaches. Literally, you cannot look cool running out of the water,‚Äù he added.  Watch his confessions here:  Honestly, his awkwardness just makes adorable üòâ  Sources: Just Jared, Daily Mail."
"Fake news and fake history of family separation  Straight talk  By George H. Rodriguez  The liberal Washington Post is joining the chorus of pro-one borders, pro-illegal immigration groups that are upset that illegal alien families are being separated by immigration officials. They write an emotional opinion piece that manipulates historical facts.  Writer DeNeen L. Brown says America has a history of separating children from families. She uses Native American and black slave children as examples to compare to illegal alien children being separated from their illegal alien parents. But the differences in these three situations are great. How can anyone but a liberal blinded by misguided sympathy ignore the facts?  Native Americans did not come to the U.S. illegally from a foreign country. The policy of separating children from their families was terrible because they were American and they had not done anything wrong. Blacks were forced to come to the U.S. chained to ships and forced to work without pay or benefits. They had committed no crime other than to be a different skin.  Illegal aliens are foreigners who are not forced to come to the United States. They come willingly and, because of their decision, receive legal help, shelter, and food upon arrival and the detainment, even though they broke immigration laws. Illegal aliens make their own decision to travel to the U.S., endangering themselves and their children ‚Äî the result of breaking immigration laws is the separation of children and families. That‚Äôs the same as anyone who commits a crime, especially if they have children along with them when they commit the crime.  This seems to be another liberal media effort to make America look evil for protecting and controlling its borders.  What part of the word illegal don‚Äôt Ms. Brown and the Washington Post understand? Illegal aliens come here willingly and of their own decision, bringing and endangering their children. That was not the case with Native American and black slave children.  The ‚Äúhumane‚Äù solution is to deport the entire family quickly. We cannot continue to excuse and reward illegal immigration, and we cannot allow our nation to turn into the world‚Äôs orphanage for illegal alien children.  George Rodriguez, El Conservador."

"Sky high prices are reportedly keeping fans from buying tickets to Taylor Swift‚Äôs upcoming Reputation tour, per a story by the New York Post. Though her 1989 world tour boasted numerous sold out performances (it eventually became the highest grossing tour of 2015), it appears her considerably more expensive snake persona is a tougher sell.  Last month, her ‚Äúlongtime‚Äù tour promoter told Billboard, ‚ÄúBy the time all the tickets are sold next week, I‚Äôll be celebrating Taylor‚Äôs birthday with a cocktail in my hand and sold-out concerts all over the world.‚Äù But her birthday has come and gone, and not one date has sold out.  Reputation was the biggest-selling album of 2017 and the tour is shaping up to be far from ill-attended, so the Post‚Äôs headline, ‚ÄúTaylor Swift‚Äôs Reputation tour shaping up to be a disaster,‚Äù is a little much. It does, however, highlight the problems with unpredictable pricing, scalpers, and Ticketmaster in general.  The company‚Äôs ‚ÄúVerified Fan‚Äù program, which they would like you to believe is all about rewarding music lovers, appears to be nothing but a cash grab that takes advantage of Swift-obsessed teens with easy access to their parents‚Äô credit card numbers. People willing to drop $50 on merch, the Post reports, could ‚Äúimprove [their] position in line to purchase tickets.‚Äù And, once accessible, the tickets are often too expensive for many fans.  ‚ÄúI paid $150 for my ticket with amazing seats for the 1989 tour,‚Äù one fan wrote. ‚ÄúNow for the same seats I have to pay about $500.‚Äù  Advertisement  In related news, tickets to Katy Perry‚Äôs Friday show in New Orleans are currently starting at $23."

"GETTY Elephants at watering hole  It may not sound as if we‚Äôre heading out on a wild South African adventure but this is how our safari begins. We‚Äôre wrapped up all warm and cosy in a Land Cruiser while our guide, wearing nothing more than shorts and a T-shirt, turns and asks what we want to see. Lets go find some cats, we say. As the sun rises we bound off into Kruger National Park on a jeep convoy.  Thousands of animals roam this vast space, an area roughly the size of Scotland. While the park is home to 147 species, the main draw is the Big Five ‚Äì that‚Äôs lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo. Picking our way through the bush it‚Äôs difficult to spot anything.

The ‚ÄúLost Boys‚Äù star named his film ‚ÄúTruth: The Rape of 2 Coreys,‚Äù focusing on his sexual assault and the alleged rape of his late longtime friend and fellow child star, Corey Haim.  ‚ÄúI believe this title represents the truth I have been promising to tell and it also represents the truth of what happened,‚Äù Feldman, 47, told Us Weekly on Tuesday. ‚Äú[Haim] was physically raped, I was physically assaulted and as a result of those actions, and the fact that I had to carry that burden all those years, really it was a raping of not only our emotional lives, but also our collective work and career as The Two Coreys.‚Äù  Last year, Feldman launched an IndieGogo campaign seeking $10 million to ‚Äúcreate an affront‚Äù against child sexual abuse and expose an alleged pedophilia ring with his movie.  ‚ÄúI propose to do this by making a film that will be [the most] honest and true depiction of child abuse ever portrayed, by telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,‚Äù he said in a video about the ‚ÄúTruth project.‚Äù ‚ÄúI will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family until the project is released.‚Äù  Feldman‚Äôs allegations of pedophilia in Hollywood have resurfaced in light of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and director James Toback.

Judy Haim previously slammed Feldman for speaking of Corey Haim‚Äôs alleged sexual assault and abuse, even sending him a cease and desist in 2016, after which Feldman promised he‚Äôd stop talking about Corey Haim in the press.  She was particularly incensed at reports that a then-19-year-old Charlie Sheen allegedly raped Corey Haim when Haim was 13 on the set of ‚ÄúLucas,‚Äù an accusation Sheen himself has denied ‚Äî and sued over."

"Johnny Depp‚Äôs behavior on the red carpet premiere of his latest film ‚ÄúMurder on the Orient Express‚Äù was questioned on Saturday night after several news outlets accused the actor of showing up drunk.  The British newspaper The Sun reported that the actor ‚Äúallegedly reeked of booze‚Äù when he appeared on the red carpet and his security team had to ‚Äúpractically hold him up‚Äù as he made his way down the press line.  Other outlets, The Daily Mail and The Mirror, alleged that Depp was guided down the red carpet past fans and slurred his words when interviewed.  ‚ÄúAt one stage he even seemed to forget the name of his co-star (and the film‚Äôs director) Kenneth Branagh,‚Äù The Mirror reported.  RELATED: Hollywood agent suspended after Terry Crews‚Äô public sexual harassment accusations  A source told The Sun that Depp was spotted out partying in London the night before the premiere and said, ‚ÄúJohnny was having big old night and was told off for smoking three times while inside. He was annoyed people were staring at him, too.‚Äù  Depp‚Äôs rep has not yet commented on the rumor though another source reportedly said that Depp was ‚Äúnot drunk‚Äù despite the bad press.  ‚ÄúThese reports are completely false.

"Postby Guest ¬ª Sun Jun 14, 2009 3:22 pm  So things started going downhill after Jen was at the academy Awards show. And smiled at Pitt. Up till tpo that moment Crazy Jo-lie had kept Brad far from Jen. Make no mistake about it. Her frantic traveling all over the place was an attempt at keeping Pitt away from her and and any other person who might think they were a friend. She can't stand anyone but her having anything to do with Pitt . Including his own family. I knew it would backfire one day. Brad what took so long????? She suffers from an extreme mental illness. She doesn't have the kids in school for the same reason.  I do believe she thought it would last. Seeing how sexy and pretty she thinks she is. A man should and would do anything she tells them to.  I am under the impression her treatment of her surrogate Holly had a sort of wake up call to Pitt as to how utterly evil she is. You can bet she dismissed her like a piece of shite. A woman who carried twins for her. Started making Brad see her game of using and abusing.  And when Jen said her and Brad talk all the time on the phone you know that was news to little miss do as I say not as I do Angelina still talks to her ex's Jo-LIE.    Guess all the years of trying to force Brad to believe Jen was a shallow no good woman has a way of catching up to one. It took this long for Pitt to see just what had truly happened. Her spells have lost the power to confuse.In Touch said she has a terrible jealous streak and can't stand Brad even looking at a woman SHE DEEMS ATTRACTIVE IN ANY WAY. WE ALL KNOW HOW MUCH FUN THAT CAN BE.    The National Enquirer  Says Brad is so happy to have a separation from her.Brad's closest friends are woman and that drives Angelina nuts she hates sharing him  He was mad she took the salt role because she had promised him she would stay at home and be a mom.  I mean you can see her doing whatever she damn well wanted to. And he went along with it. But they have twin babies and my guess is she spends very little time bonding with them. What woman would not want to be able to stay with her new little babies. Not this woman. Sick behavior for sure. And the only thing keeping Brad from making it final is the kids.  Angie be careful what you wish for. Seems like 6 kids are going to be without a mom and dad in one place. Good luck with that"
"Khloe Kardashian had a lot of help from her own mom when it came to decorating her baby's nursery.  Khloe confirmed her pregnancy via a baby bump photo on Instagram in December and revealed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this year that she and Tristan Thompson are expecting a baby girl. E! News learned on Thursday she gave birth to their daughter. The news comes amid an alleged cheating scandal involving Tristan. The two have not commented.  Khloe's mother Kris Jenner has helped her a lot with her nursery, flying to Cleveland to lend a hand in person and also shipping decor and other baby products to the house, E! News has learned.  In early March, the two spent two hours shopping for baby gear, toys, furniture and clothes at Petit Tresor and Couture Kids in Los Angeles. Khloe picked out items in pink and neutral colors.

"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Eun Kyung Kim  One of the world's most eligible bachelors just took himself off the market.  Prince Harry is engaged to American actress Meghan Markle, Kensington Palace announced in a statement Monday.  ‚ÄúHis Royal Highness The Prince of Wales is delighted to announce the engagement of Prince Harry to Ms. Meghan Markle,‚Äù according to the palace statement. The couple got engaged earlier this month in London. Prince Harry also ""sought and received the blessing of Ms. Markle's parents,"" the palace said.  Several hours later, the couple appeared hand-in-hand for a brief photo opportunity in the gardens of Kensington Palace, where a beaming prince said he realized Markle was the one for him ""the first time we met.""  The couple plan to get married next May at St. George‚Äôs Chapel inside Windsor Castle. They will live in Nottingham Cottage, Harry's apartment at Kensington Palace.  Markle is a 36-year-old California native emerged from relative obscurity after news began to leak in the fall of 2016 that she was dating Prince Harry, 33.  The couple dated for more than a year before making their first official appearance together this past September at the Invictus Games in Toronto.  The newly betrothed couple, during their first public appearance together on Sept. 25, 2017, at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Canada. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The pair met in early July 2016 after being set up on a blind date set up by a mutual friend, the couple told the BBC in a joint interview. The prince had never heard of the actress, who in turn knew only superficially about the royal.  The happy couple, at a photo call with reporters Monday after news broke about their engagement. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  The couple kept quiet about their relationship until Prince Harry issued a rare statement last November scolding paparazzi for endangering the safety of his girlfriend and blasting coverage he found racist and sexist.  But even after that announcement, the couple did not make any public appearances together until this past May when the two appeared at a polo match benefiting two of Prince Harry‚Äôs charities. Markle cheered on Harry as he played, but the two did not arrive or leave the event together.  Shutterstock / MEGA  For the September opening ceremony for this year's Invictus Games, the two originally sat several rows apart, but the couple stepped out publicly for the first time just days later, when they arrived, holding hands, for a wheelchair tennis match. They were seen laughing and being affectionate with each other throughout the event.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle in early November, while the couple enjoyed a ‚Äúcozy‚Äù night in at his Kensington Palace apartment, where the two were roasting a chicken.  ‚ÄúIt was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee,‚Äù Markle said in a BBC interview following the announcement of their engagement.  The impending nuptials will be the biggest royal wedding since Harry's older brother, Prince William, married the former Kate Middleton on April 29, 2011.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge said in a statement they were ‚Äúvery excited for Harry and Meghan.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and see how happy she and Harry are together,‚Äù they said.  Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, also issued congratulations through Twitter.  ""The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness,"" Buckingham Palace said in a statement.  Prince Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring he designed with a center diamond from Botswana, where the two visited on vacation shortly after they met, and two outside diamonds from the personal collection of the Harry‚Äôs mother, the late Princess Diana.  It also will be the first time an American has married a British royal since King Edward VIII abdicated the throne in December 1936 to marry Wallis Simpson, a twice-divorced socialite. Like Simpson, Markle also is a divorcee. She was previously married to American film producer Trevor Engelson for nearly two years, divorcing in 2013.  In May, Prince Harry brought Markle as his date to the wedding reception of Kate's younger sister, Pippa Middleton. Royal watchers believe their attendance signaled how serious the relationship had become since it marked the first time Markle had mingled at a large gathering of royal family members.  Prince Harry is the fifth in line to the throne, behind the two children of his brother, Prince William, who is second in the line of succession behind their father. He will be bumped to sixth in line following the birth of William's third child next year.  Before he began dating Markle, the prince's romantic life had been calm and quiet for the past several years after a string of high-profile relationships. His most recent serious relationship, with model Cressida Bonas, ended in 2014 after two years together.  Follow Eun Kyung Kim on Twitter or Facebook."

"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Jackson's life is being made into a new stage musical  A new musical based on the life of Michael Jackson is set for a run on Broadway in 2020.  The show, which currently has no title, is being written by Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage.  The Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage company announced the news on Tuesday, but didn't say which theatre the show will play in.  The musical will encompass many of Jackson's greatest hits, including Thriller, Beat It and Smooth Criminal.  Christopher Wheeldon will direct and choreograph the show, which is likely to contain some of the recognisable dances moves from Jackson's music videos and tours.  Wheeldon won a Tony Award for best choreography in 2015 for his work on An American in Paris.  It is not known what role the Michael Jackson estate has in creating the show and whether the more controversial talking points from the star's life, such as his 2005 trial and acquittal over claims of sexual abuse, will be featured in the dramatisation.  This won't be the first time that Jackson's music has been featured in a stage production - Thriller Live opened in London's West End in January 2009.

"According to TMZ, Chris Brown is the father of a 9-month-old girl born of his secret union with a model named Nia! The child would have been conceived in September 2013. At that time, the love life of the rapper was difficult to follow, once Rihanna, once Karrueche ‚Ä¶ But finally the singer of ‚ÄúLoyal‚Äù has his heart set on the 26 years old model‚Ä¶  If ever since the couple leads a complicated relationship between the ‚ÄúLove you, love you nots‚Äù and Chris troubles with the justice, Karrueche has always supported her bad boy, saying she was ready to marry him even though he went to prison. But faced with this surprising news, the young woman decided to officially stop this tormented relationship through her Twitter account:  ‚ÄúListen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me.‚Äù  Apparently unaware of the existence of this child, Karrueche was also taken for a fool. In fact, the child‚Äôs mother is not a stranger to her.  TMZ found a picture where we can see Karrueche posing with her arm around Nia‚Äòs neck at a party in Las Vegas.

"Postby Guest ¬ª Wed May 02, 2018 1:05 pm  By Andrew Shuster | 3:29 pm, May 1, 2018    A tabloid report claiming Brad Pitt is seeking advice from George Clooney on his supposed romance with Neri Oxman is completely made-up. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn‚Äôt dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.    According to Woman‚Äôs Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney‚Äôs marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.    As the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called ‚Äúsource‚Äù tells the magazine, ‚ÄúGeorge loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It‚Äôs sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal.‚Äù    The outlet‚Äôs questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been ‚Äúadvising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.‚Äù The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt ‚Äúis very grateful‚Äù for Amal because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.‚Äù    The tabloid‚Äôs article, however, is nothing more than fan fiction. Pitt‚Äôs rep has told us on the record several times that the actor isn‚Äôt dating Oxman. This has been backed up by trusted publications such as People, which recently noted Pitt and Oxman have a ‚Äúprofessional friendship,‚Äù as while as E! News, which similarly reported that Pitt and Oxman are ‚Äústrictly friends.‚Äù    This article only seems to exist because Woman‚Äôs Day came up with a way to drag Clooney into his pal‚Äôs imaginary romance. In addition to the fact that Pitt and Oxman aren‚Äôt a couple, a mutual pal of ours and Clooney tells us on background that the actor‚Äôs friend hasn‚Äôt turned to him for advice about dating the MIT professor. This is just a fabricated story based on a phony premise.    It‚Äôs worth noting, this isn‚Äôt the first time Gossip Cop has had to debunk a bogus story about Clooney supposedly playing a role in his friend‚Äôs love life. We recently busted New Idea for making up a story about Clooney getting Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together. This latest article involving Oxman is equally untrue."
"Eminem Escapes From An Asylum In Twisted Visual For ""Framed""  Marshall debuts the long awaited video from his 'Revival' album.  After teasing fans with a short trailer last week, Eminem returned on Tuesday (April 3) to unveil the full version of the twisted visual for his horror-themed Revival cut ""Framed.""  At the beginning of the visual, a news reporter named Stan Dresden informs viewers that Eminem has escaped an asylum. While Em is watching the report from his living room, the news team and detectives are camped outside out his home waiting to make a move. Em takes on the role of a psychotic serial killer with multiple personalities (Slim Shady, Marshall Mathers, Eminem, etc.) who believes he's being framed for a string of murders because he has no recollection of all the wrongdoings his alter ego Slim Shady has done.  The rapper's multiple personalities are seen throughout the visual, which is set in places like a dark woods, asylum hallway and a blood-splattered living room where Em is accompanied by two dead bodies and multiple drawings. Despite repeatedly declaring his innocence, Em is finally caught as a detective enters his home to talk to him about his recent killing sprees. The detective calms the rapper down by using hypnosis and in the closing scene, Em is back in an asylum and begins to hallucinate before he's injected with an unknown substance and taken away.  The ""Framed"" visual follows Eminem's previously released videos for Revival tracks ""River"" featuring Ed Sheeran and the Beyonce-assisted ""Walk On Water.""  Watch the visual for ""Framed"" below.  This story was originally posted to Billboard."

"Twihards are having a hard time containing their delight because, as improbable as it sounds, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were spotted hanging out together at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles Saturday night.  And six years after their three-year relationship came crashing down over reports that Stewart was cheating on Pattinson with married director Rupert Sanders, rumors have been swirling that the two are considering a reconciliation.  CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device.  This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ‚Äì OUTSIDE OF THE CHATEAU MARMONT, LA 06/02/2018 pic.twitter.com/yozZSAGSIw ‚Äî Elishia (@multifandomacc5) June 3, 2018  Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.  The idea of the ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äôs‚Äù Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.  She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for ‚ÄúSnow White and the Huntsman,‚Äù who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.  When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.  Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.  But Pattinson‚Äôs engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs trouble in paradise,‚Äù with regards to Stewart and Maxwell‚Äôs relationship.

In papers filed on Dec. 22, the couple has agreed to share 50/50 joint custody and shall consult one another on all major decision relating to their son's health, education and welfare. The documents also state that they will equally divide all holidays and vacations with their son.

The ‚ÄúMission: Impossible‚Äù star recounted the event during a Friday interview on the Clay Cane show on Sirius XM. Rhames was responding to a question about how racism had affected his life.  Rhames said it was about 2:15 in the afternoon when he heard a knock on the front door.  ‚ÄúI open the door and there is a red dot pointed at my face from a 9 millimeter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey say, ‚ÄòPut up your hands,‚Äô literally.‚Äù  According to Rhames, he was confronted by three police officers, the captain of police and a police dog. The situation de-escalated after the captain recognized Rhames from their sons‚Äô playing sports together and apologized. He said police told him they were responding to a 911 call from a woman who ‚Äúsaid a large black man was breaking into the house.‚Äù  Ian Lawrence via Getty Images Ving Rhames filming scenes for ""Mission Impossible 6"" in London.  When Rhames and police questioned the woman who had allegedly made the report ‚Äï she lived across the street ‚Äï she denied ever calling, the actor said.  ‚ÄúHere I am in my own home, alone in some basketball shorts just because someone called and said a large black man is breaking in,‚Äù Rhames said. ‚ÄúWhen I opened up the wooden door, a 9 millimeter is pointed at me.

"YouTube singer Austin Jones was returning to the U.S. following a concert in Poland on Monday when he was taken into custody at Chicago‚Äôs O‚ÄôHare Airport. The 24-year-old was arrested on two counts of production of child pornography. If convicted, he could land in prison for a minimum of 15 years.  According to the Chicago Sun Times, Jones will remain in federal custody until his court hearing Wednesday because prosecutors say he is a ‚Äúrisk to the community and there‚Äôs a danger he‚Äôll flee.‚Äù  Court documents state that Jones was allegedly in communication with two underage female victims via Facebook in August 2016 and May 2017, and in both interactions, had asked the 14- and 15-year-old victims to ‚Äúprove‚Äù to him that they were his biggest fans by sending him sexually explicit videos.  In the criminal complaint, one girl admitted that she made 15 videos for Jones as recently as May 4th, in what she called an ‚Äúaudition.‚Äù She alleged that the YouTube star pressured her to ‚Äúwork really hard‚Äù even though she told him she ‚Äúmight pass out‚Äù and was tired from what he was asking her to do. At one point during the Facebook interactions, the victim allegedly acknowledged that Jones was 24, and he requested that she repeatedly acknowledge that she was ‚Äúonly 14.‚Äù  Jones‚Äô other alleged victim, whom he chatted with in August 2016, alleged that the singer told her she would get to perform a sex act on him if she were ‚Äúlucky.‚Äù In the chat, Jones allegedly acknowledged that he was 23 at the time and the victim was 14. Federal authorities said the girl sent Jones a total of 25 videos, including eight that were sexually explicit.  According to the complaint, once arrested Monday, Jones admitted to ‚Äúreceiving videos from the victims, and he admitted it was for sexual pleasure.‚Äù  Jones, who is best known for his own renditions of popular songs by artists like Justin Bieber, Twenty One Pilots and Fall Out Boy, has a following of more than 500,000 subscribers on his YouTube page and more than 300,000 followers on Instagram.  The singer came under fire in 2015 over allegations that he had lied about his age in order to solicit ‚Äútwerking‚Äù videos from underage girls, which lead to a lengthy Facebook apology and an emotional YouTube confessional.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm embarrassed. I‚Äôd have conversations online with girls that would involve me asking them to create a video of themselves twerking,‚Äù he wrote at the time in a since-deleted Facebook post. ‚ÄúSometimes I‚Äôd make videos of myself doing some twerk moves in return. Here‚Äôs the truth: I NEVER asked them to do anything more than send a twerking video. Nothing EVER went beyond that.‚Äù"

"When it emerged he had signed on to star in a prequel to Jason Statham's Transporter series many assumed he had turned his back Game Of Thrones.  But Ed Skrein has finally spoken out to say he would never have walked away from the plum role of Daario Naharis, and instead insisted 'politics' was behind his abrupt exit from the show.  The 32-year-old English actor gave a love it or loath it performance as the cocksure lieutenant of mercenary group the Second Sons, who ends up killing his fellow commanders to win the affection of Daenerys Targaryen, that still lives in the memory of fans.  Scroll down for video  Politicking: Ed Skrein has insisted he left his plum role on Game Of Thrones due to behind the scenes intrigue  He told TooFab: 'Contrary to reports I didn‚Äôt walk away. I wouldn‚Äôt walk away. There are very few things in my life I‚Äôve walked away from.  'This is a complicated industry and there‚Äôs always politics involved.'  However while he still seems disappointed about having to have left such a plum role after just three episodes, he insists he does not wonder about how things could have been different.  The rapper-turned-actor said: 'I never really look back, my journey has been unorthodox in many ways.  Un-Ed-iftying: After he lost his role as Daario Naharis it was given to the bland Dutch actor Michiel Huisman  'All I do is count my blessings and try to be as present as I can and I‚Äôm thankful for every step of this journey.'  Wise words indeed from the jolly cockney, who went by the rather questionable moniker of The Dinnerlady P.I.M.P. during his hip hop career.  While Ed's role was filled by the bland Michiel Huisman, Ed finds himself filling someone's shoes himself in Transporter Refueled, which hits screens on Friday.  The statuesque actor plays a younger version of dinky star Jason Statham's hardman chauffeur Frank Martin in the film, which sees the character face-off against some Eastern European gangsters.  Bald ambition: He is filling the shoes of follicly challenged action icon Jason Statham in Transporter Refueled  However he insists he felt no pressure taking over from the follicly challenged action icon, saying: 'It wasn't really daunting it all The daunting part for me, the pressure was from the inside.  'I want to make work that I‚Äôm proud of and that fulfills me creatively, that‚Äôs where the pressure came from.'  While it is unlikely his hairier rendition of the action character is unlikely to garner much critical acclaim, he stands a greater chance of winning some attention when he plays the villain Ajax in hotly-tipped 20th Century Fox Marvel spinoff Deadpool.  He said he had a great time getting physical with the film's star Ryan Reynolds, who plays the titular fast-talking mercenary character with a sick sense of humour.  Original and best: It is unlikely Ed will win over fans of Jason's popular portrayal of the hardman chauffeur  Ed said: 'Me and Ryan had incredible chemistry, we had this synergy. A lot of time, they don‚Äôt want to pair actors together, especially leads because we‚Äôre not stunt guys.  'We may make a mistake and if we make a mistake and break each others‚Äô noses or knock a tooth out. It's a lot of money and jobs on the line.  I was like to (the director), ""Get me in there, put me in, I‚Äôve done all this training, I‚Äôm ready.  'They were hesitant [but] I went straight in and we had a great synergy and we stayed the two of us for the whole day and I remember Ryan saying to me, ""I‚Äôve had such a great time getting beat up by you,"" and vice versa.'"

"Kim Kardashian West hopped onto Snapchat to defend her husband Kanye West's honor tonight, posting a series of videos that prove Taylor Swift gave West permission to rap about her on infamous The Life of Pablo single ""Famous."" (The line in question: ""For all my Southside niggas that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / I made that bitch famous."") Kardashian teased the reveal on Twitter earlier in the evening, and West's feud with Swift was the basis for one of the major plotlines on tonight's episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  In the footage posted on Snapchat, West asks Swift for permission to use a version of the line over the phone from his studio. She gives her consent and thanks him for bringing the line to her before recording and releasing it. It's still unclear just how much Swift knew about the ultimate phrasing of the line, but it's obvious she agrees its sentiment is acceptable. (If you'd rather read than watch, The Fader has transcribed the footage. You'll miss legendary producer Rick Rubin hanging out on a couch in the background, though.)  Here is the entire conversation Taylor & Kanye had, judge for yourself. pic.twitter.com/InTjvPGKe3 ‚Äî ShadyPopMusic (@ShadyPopMusic) July 18, 2016  At the beginning of this year, Swift and West had almost entirely reconciled after he famously interrupted her at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. That all changed when West released ""Famous"" and the rest of The Life of Pablo in February. Swift sent out a statement condemning the line and West's misogyny a few days after it was first played in public, and West used a series of tweets to claim that Swift had approved the line well before it was released. When she won the Grammy for Album of the Year a few days later, she used her speech to allude to unnamed enemies who ""will try to undercut your success."" It was widely assumed she meant West.  When Kardashian appeared on the cover of GQ last month, she confirmed that Swift had approved the line and suggested that her conversation with West had been caught on camera, only to get blocked by Swift's legal team once they learned about its existence. It seems like the existence of a letter from Swift's attorney couldn't keep Kardashian silent forever, and now we're left to wait and see how Swift reacts to having the rug pulled out from under her. Between this and the Nils Sjoberg fiasco, she's had a pretty rough week.  Update July 18th, 12:20AM ET: Taylor Swift has responded to Kim Kardashian West's Snapchat with her own posts on Instagram and Twitter. The picture ‚Äî a block of text claiming that West never played her the song or said he would call her ""that bitch"" ‚Äî was captioned with ""That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet."" Swift says that the video falsely paints her as a liar, when she wasn't actually played the song, making Kim and Kanye's actions ""character assassination.""  That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet. A photo posted by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Jul 17, 2016 at 9:14pm PDT  Why People Love Bass"

"The premium cable network has also announced that season four will bow in November.  No surprise here: Starz has extended Outlander for two additional seasons.  The premium cable network on Wednesday announced that it has renewed the Ron Moore drama based on Diana Gabaldon's best-selling book series for seasons five and six. Starz also revealed that the 13-episode fourth season of the time-traveling period soap will return in November. (A specific return date has yet to be announced.)  All told, the renewal is for 24 total episodes, with each season consisting of 12 episodes. That is Outlander's lowest per-season total after the freshman run consisted of 16 and seasons two and three were 13 apiece. From Sony Pictures Television and starring Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan, Outlander's seasons five and six will be based on material from the fifth and sixth books in Gabaldon's series, The Fiery Cross and A Breath of Snow and Ashes.  ""Fans can rest assured their beloved Claire and Jamie will be back facing new challenges, adversaries and adventures in seasons five and six as we delve into American history and continue the story of the Frasers as they settle in the New World,‚Äù Starz CEO Chris Albrecht said in a statement.  Season four is currently in production in Scotland and will consist of 13 episodes following Drums of Autumn, Gabaldon's fourth of eight books in the Outlander series. Season three averaged 5.8 million total viewers cross multiple platforms and ranks as the second-most-watched premium scripted series among women ‚Äî behind only HBO's Game of Thrones.  In addition to Sony TV, Outlander is produced by Tall Ship Productions, Story Mining & Supply Co. and Left Bank Pictures. The drama is executive produced by Moore, Maril Davis, Toni Graphia, Matthew B. Roberts and Andy Harries.  Outlander joins a scripted roster at Starz that also includes Counterpart, Howard's End, The Rook, Vida, Sweetbitter and Power, among others."
"(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason finale of ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù Season 3, which aired Tuesday.)  While offering up an overload of emotional information to Pearson family fans Tuesday, the midseason finale of ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù Season 3, called ‚ÄúThe Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning,‚Äù finally gave us the answer to the question viewers have been asking since the second season finale‚Äôs shocking flash-forward ending aired last spring: who the ‚Äúher‚Äù is that Future Randall and Future Tess are preparing to visit.  The answer: Randall‚Äôs mother, Rebecca Pearson (played by Mandy Moore).  Yes, just as ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù wrapped up the first half of its third season tonight, it was revealed that decades from now, Randall and his adult daughter ‚Äî along with Toby and now Beth ‚Äî are going to see ‚ÄúRandall‚Äôs mother,‚Äù as Beth puts it to her employee (apparently she‚Äôs running a ballet company now?), who she obtains a Pin the Tail on the Donkey game from, as she prepares to join Randall and daughter on this journey.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Midseason Finale Reveals Nicky's Fate - And It's Probably Not What You Were Expecting  Though this ‚Äúher‚Äù revelation didn‚Äôt come until the episode‚Äôs closing moments ‚Äî which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack‚Äôs little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War ‚Äî we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series.  The installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won‚Äôt win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.  That spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce?  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Melanie Liburd Is 'Really Excited' for Beth-Centric Episode - and What It Means for Zoe's Backstory (Video)  Because fans now have to wait until midseason to find out more about the future ‚Äî and present ‚Äî TheWrap has rounded up all the facts we‚Äôve previously gathered about ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äùs now-not-so-mysterious character, so you can theorize over the next piece of the puzzle ‚Äî what are the circumstances surrounding this foreboding reunion? ‚Äî for the next couple months.  See below for everything we knew ‚Äî before tonight ‚Äî about ‚Äúher.‚Äù  Also Read: Hold Up, 'This Is Us' Fans - Mandy Moore Says You Might Actually Like That Guy With the Flowers  She‚Äôs close to Tess, Randall and Toby  In the third season premiere, the final scene gives a few more clues as to who the unnamed woman might be. Tess and Randall arrive at some sort of facility, and while Tess goes to the bathroom, Randall gives Toby (Chris Sullivan) a call, and asks if he‚Äôs ‚Äúcoming down.‚Äù Toby says he doesn‚Äôt know, but Randall tells him the ‚Äúshe‚Äù would want him here, and Toby agrees that he probably should. We see Toby talking to Randall on the phone from a bed ‚Äî alone ‚Äî which made us wonder if perhaps the mystery woman could be his wife Kate (Chrissy Metz), or someone close to Kate, and Kate might be dead. Yikes!  ‚ÄúYou thought we made it sound like he was talking about Kate ‚Äî I would say that‚Äôs open to interpretation,‚Äù co-showrunner Isaac Aptaker told TheWrap at the show‚Äôs Season 3 finally in September.  Alright, now we know it‚Äôs not Kate, but ‚ÄúRandall‚Äôs mother‚Äù ‚Äî a person that is apparently close to Randall, Tess and Toby. And Sterling K. Brown told us that would be the case in the end, because anyone close to the Pearsons is close to Toby.  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You've Been Waiting For  ‚ÄúToby is part of our family now,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúSo anybody who Randall cares about, Tobias would obviously care about as well. That‚Äôs my brother.‚Äù  Tess hasn‚Äôt seen ‚Äúher‚Äù in awhile  Back on the Season 2 finale, we got our first glimpse of an older Randall and an older Tess. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to go see her, Tess,‚Äù Randall says. Tess responds that she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot ready,‚Äù and Randall says he‚Äôs not either.  The scene is cut in a way that makes us think Beth might be dying (but that was ruled out by Susan Kelechi Watson herself) or maybe something is going on with Deja, who in the Season 3 premiere agreed to let the Pearsons adopt her after her mother relinquished her paternal rights.  Brown also told TheWrap that there‚Äôs a specific reason he needs to coax Tess to see ‚Äúher‚Äù ‚Äî which of course we‚Äôll find out in due time.  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3 Premiere: Showrunners Break Down Jack and Rebecca's Awful First Date  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúYes, there‚Äôs a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn‚Äôt seen the ‚Äòher‚Äô for some time. And so there‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs time to go and she‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt.‚Äô There‚Äôs a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.‚Äù  This is as far in the future as we‚Äôll go  ‚ÄúThis future timeline is sort of the furthest that we‚Äôll go in these characters lives and where our series will wrap up,‚Äù Aptaker told TheWrap in September, backing up something Fogelman has previously talked about.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt imagine us going past this time period in the future so in terms of a timeline, this is our ending timeline,‚Äù Fogelman said in an interview with EW after the Season 2 finale last spring. ‚ÄúBut we may have other past timelines we‚Äôre going to introduce in the course of the series, and also other future story lines that we might introduce as well.‚Äù  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Mandy Moore Hints Season 3 Premiere Reveals More About Randall's 'Her'  ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôre going to give answers in that timeline, but it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a timeline we can‚Äôt revisit and sort of push the story forward in that timeline,‚Äù co-showrunner Elizabeth Berger told TheWrap. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to give a lot of satisfying answers regarding that timeline this season ‚Äî so they‚Äôre quickly in store.‚Äù  Answers were promised to be coming soon  ‚ÄúI think the plan is that, in the course of the season, you will get a lot of answers,‚Äù Fogelman said, during a panel after the LA premiere in September. ‚ÄúThe story is not about where it ends up, it‚Äôs about how you kind of get there‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not going to string it out over seven seasons or anything.‚Äù  Moore said Fogelman has, ‚Äútalked a lot about figuring out who [Randall] is talking about.‚Äù  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: Milo Ventimiglia Hints Jack's Little Brother Nicky Has Some Real Issues  ‚ÄúI think that every episode is offering a more fully realized picture of who that is,‚Äù Moore said in an interview with EW earlier this month. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not being dragged for the sake of being cheeky. I think it‚Äôs just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan‚Äôs old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we‚Äôre leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.‚Äù  Brown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already.  ‚ÄúIt is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won‚Äôt be something that comes out of nowhere,‚Äù Brown said. ‚ÄúDan has already spoken to the fact that we‚Äôve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that‚Äôs dealing with that particular ‚Äòher‚Äô as well. I think by about midseason, maybe episode 9 or so, the audience will know who that individual is.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis Is Us‚Äù Season 3 will return Jan. 15 on NBC."

"In case you didn‚Äôt know, John Stamos (of Full House fame) and his new wife Caitlin McHugh are really, really obsessed with all things Disney.  In fact, the pair, who had been dating for two years, got engaged at Disneyland in October. There, Stamos staged an elaborate engagement event for his then-girlfriend, including a short compilation of their favorite Disney films. It all ended with ""The Little Mermaid"" and the caption ‚Äújust ask the girl.‚Äù Of course, Stamos did. On Instagram McHugh posted, ‚ÄúI kissed the boy and said . . . yes!‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe loves Disneyland and [at the park], I got on my knee and asked her,‚Äù Stamos told PEOPLE of their engagement. ‚ÄúI pulled the ring out. I don‚Äôt know how she did it, but she went to hug me and slipped her finger right in it. When the park closed, we ran around the park in our Disney onesies.‚Äù  Since that day the two went on to get hitched in a gorgeous ceremony at the Little Brown Church in Studio City, California, then partied the night away at their home.  Now, just a week into their marriage, they are celebrating again at the Happiest Place on Earth.  As McHugh‚Äôs Instagram shows, the pair has been spending plenty of time at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. While there they‚Äôve even been spotted wearing matching mouse ears, though hers were a bit more spectacular as they came with a bridal veil.  McHugh shared even more of their journey through the park, where they stopped in at shops to look at tiny baby trinkets since they are expecting their first child this spring.  On his page Stamos shared his own adorable image of the pair as they smooched near the castle joking of their one-week anniversary, ‚Äúand they said it wouldn‚Äôt last.‚Äù  While this may be their last trip to the park before the baby‚Äôs arrival, odds are their upcoming bundle of joy will be a Disney baby, whether he or she likes it or not."

"Brody Jenner‚Äòs relationship with his father Caitlyn Jenner hasn‚Äôt always been an easy one to navigate.  On Wednesday, PEOPLE confirmed Caitlyn will not attend her son‚Äôs upcoming wedding to fianc√©e Kaitlynn Carter.  Caitlyn, 68, ‚Äúhas work commitments that have been set up for months and couldn‚Äôt be changed in the end,‚Äù a source told PEOPLE.  Nevertheless, the source said ‚Äúeverything is good‚Äù between the two, adding that Caitlyn ‚Äúwill be throwing a big party for them when the newlyweds return to town.‚Äù  And while there‚Äôs no bad blood over the wedding, Brody and Caitlyn haven‚Äôt always had such a smooth relationship.  Caitlyn Jenner and Brody Jenner Earl Gibson III/Getty  A Rocky Childhood  Caitlyn has long acknowledged that she was an absent father to her four oldest children Cassandra, Burt, Brandon and Brody.  While the older Jenner children were not regulars on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Brody did open up about his strained relationship with his father on the show in 2013.  (Caitlyn went by Bruce before transitioning in 2015. She now goes by Caitlyn and uses female pronouns.)  ‚ÄúI think Bruce is an incredible human being and I think that Bruce is a great father, he just wasn‚Äôt a great father to me,‚Äù he said.  Brody said Caitlyn and his mother Linda Thompson had a ‚Äúmessy divorce‚Äù when he was young, which created tension in the family.  ‚ÄúI grew up with my stepdad,‚Äù said Brody, referring to David Foster. ‚ÄúBruce was never around. I can‚Äôt tell you how many birthdays went by where Bruce wasn‚Äôt there. I resent him for that.‚Äù  Brody‚Äôs strained relationship with Caitlyn also caused a rift in his bond with sisters Kendall and Kylie. A source tells PEOPLE that Brody was ‚Äúnever close‚Äù with his step-siblings, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian after Caitlyn married Kris Jenner.  ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time with his dad when his dad married Kris, so he didn‚Äôt see them as much,‚Äù the sources says.  And while Brody spent time with Kendall and Kylie when they were younger, they‚Äôve grown apart.  ‚ÄúAs much as they love them, they‚Äôre not close,‚Äù the source adds. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unfortunate.‚Äù  Understanding Caitlyn‚Äôs Transition  Before transitioning, Caitlyn battled depression and identity issues, which caused her to pull away from her family.  ‚ÄúThe big, formative years for them, I was really struggling with those issues [of gender identity],‚Äù she said during a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in 2015.  Still, she takes full responsibility for not being there for her kids.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no excuse for not being a good parent, no matter how many problems that you have,‚Äù Jenner told ABC in 2017. ‚ÄúNo excuse for that.‚Äù  And the former Hills star has remained supportive of Caitlyn‚Äòs transition.  ‚ÄúThe first thing I thought was just like, ‚ÄòIt finally makes sense,'‚Äù Brody told ABC in 2017.  In fact, Brody said he actually prefers Caitlyn over Bruce.  John M. Heller/Getty Images;  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Bruce for a long time and I didn‚Äôt really get along with Bruce,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCaitlyn and I get along a little more, because Caitlyn is actually who she really is and she‚Äôs living her life finally now as the person she actually was.‚Äù  Brody said he was able to start fresh with Caitlyn and let go of his resentment toward his father.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like getting to know somebody ‚Äì your dad ‚Äì all over again, in a better way.‚Äù  Brody‚Äôs siblings have expressed similar sentiments about their father‚Äôs transition.  ‚ÄúIn seeing him come out to me and explain his true self, I was more proud right then to carry the last name Jenner, to be a part of the family, than at any time before,‚Äù said Brandon.  Rebuilding a Relationship  Both Brody and Caitlyn have been making more of an effort to spend time together in recent years.  In 2016, Caitlyn spent Thanksgiving with Brody and his siblings.  ‚ÄúThanksgiving with family is the best. And mine keeps getting bigger,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúI hope you all had a wonderful day with your families!‚Äù  In April, Caitlyn celebrated her future daughter-in-law at her bridal shower at the Santa Anita Park racetrack in Los Angeles.  ‚ÄúCaitlyn and Linda both love Kaitlynn. They‚Äôre so happy for Brody,‚Äù a source tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúBrody and Kaitlynn are just trying to focus on the positive and who is there to support them.‚Äù  Caitlyn shared a photo from the bridal shower, writing how happy she was to attend.  ‚ÄúWent to my first bridal shower,‚Äù Caitlyn captioned a photo of her and Carter, 29. ‚ÄúI had so much fun! PS so much better than Bachelor parties!‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy you were there!!!‚Äù Carter commented on the post. ‚ÄúIt meant a lot to me!!‚Äù"
"Alex Rodriguez only had kind words for his girlfriend Jennifer Lopez on her 49th birthday Tuesday.  ‚ÄúWhen we were kids, birthdays were exciting because it was all about the gifts we would be getting,‚Äù Rodriguez captioned an Instagram gallery of images. ‚ÄúA new bat, dance shoes, maybe a new CD (yes I‚Äôm old!).‚Äù  The 42-year-old continued, ‚ÄúI see firsthand how that‚Äôs changed for Jennifer, and how she‚Äôs found joy in sharing with others.

"Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.  But, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.  Emerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.  Associates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.  Several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.  One old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""  She certainly takes vigorous exercise.  Exercising more than is healthy  As well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.  Recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.  Although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.  Currently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.  The healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.  She is, then, clinically underweight.  Because she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.  Her agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.  Catherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don't know what the fuss is about.""  Those protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.  But Valentino says her figure is perfect  Miss Kidman looks stunning, posing in clothes by a string of designers.  (""She has the most perfect figure,"" coos Valentino.)  Her influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of Chanel No 5 perfume.  In media terms, she has blossomed since splitting from Cruise; it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand.  But the question many are asking is why Nicole, who has relocated to New York with her two adopted children, Conor and Isabella, is looking so tired and nervy?  And why, they are wondering in Italy, has she pulled out of the Venice film festival?  And why, they wonder in Hollywood, has she turned down a ¬£10million payday - the biggest of her career - to star in a film opposite Brad Pitt?  There are signs that Nicole - who said in the spring that she feared a ""burnout"" - is under a considerable amount of pressure, both emotional and professional.  She is still alone, despite a fling with rap star Q-Tip and a flirtation with rock star Lenny Kravitz, from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated.  Her romantic friendship with Russell Crowe has foundered, and he has now married his on-off girlfriend Danielle, who is expecting a baby.  How painful this must be for Nicole, who longs to have a baby herself.  Overwhelmed with grief after miscarriage  She was, by her own admission, almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to Cruise ended.  Those who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted.  ""I don't think two people could have been happier than Tom and I,"" she mused.  I was desperate to have a baby with Tom  ""He swept me off my feet and I fell madly, passionately in love. I was consumed by it. And I was desperate to have a baby with him. That's what I wish I'd done.""  Her vulnerable state of mind is not helped by a recurrence of the insomnia which has plagued her for much of her adult life.  Furthermore, she has been driven to the brink by film roles about rejected, depressed and oppressed women - with whom she identifies to a remarkable extent.  In an interview she said that she hesitated to play the suicidal Virginia Woolf in The Hours, because she feared the effect on her own state of mind.  ""I wasn't sure I could go through with it. Virginia Woolf's unhappiness was just too similar to my own.  Hesitated to play suicidal Virginia Woolf  ""I was afraid to do it because I thought it would be too painful,"" she said.  ""But I think characters come into your life sometimes because they're meant to ... I was able to use her and her knowledge.""  There are signs that she is no less troubled currently on the set of Stepford Wives in New York.  The crew are said to be muttering about delays because she does not want to film outside in strong sunshine.  Her representatives say this is utter nonsense. ""No one is more professional than Nicole,"" they aver, sternly.  But whatever the truth of those reports, one does wonder whether the film - a remake of the Seventies classic, about a town where wives are replaced by compliant domestic robots - has uncomfortable resonances for Nicole, whose Catholic beliefs were put aside by her Scientologist husband, and who, during her marriage, lost her identity in his.  What she yearns for is love - the love she gave to Cruise and which she still feels for him.  She yearns for love  ""I've said to Tom, I will be there for him for the rest of his life, always,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Tom and I had 11 years together. Your heart has to stay loving.""  She surprised everyone by admitting at the Cannes Film Festival that she would give up her career for love.  ""I won't do this for the rest of my life, there's other things that interest me,' she said.  ""I think when I fall in love, I'll stop doing as much of this because I want to settle down again.""  What she has experienced since then, though, are little more than dangerous flirtations.  Q-Tip, her escort at the premiere of The Hours, appeared to have been chosen because he is as unlike her former husband as it is possible to be.  Kravitz, meanwhile, took her to Puff Daddy's birthday party - again an event which would be anathema to strait-laced Cruise. In private, Nicole talks a great deal about concentrating on her children and trying to ""make it up to them"" - she feels immensely guilty about the divorce.  She also complains that she would like to find a man with whom she could have an intelligent conversation.  She is unhappily single  The Jude Law episode - when she was falsely accused of breaking up his marriage - was bruising and she felt humiliated that anyone would think she would steal another woman's husband.  Their meetings on both sides of the Atlantic were professional. In short, she remains steadfastly but unhappily single.  What a pity, for this is surely the golden period in Nicole's professional life. She took the Best Actress Oscar this spring for The Hours.  Later this year Cold Mountain, the Civil War epic directed by Anthony Minghella, will be released, and there is already an Oscar buzz forming about this bleak film.  Also later this year she will be seen in The Human Stain, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Then there is Birth, a film about a grieving widow, which she made early this year, and after that Stepford Wives, scheduled for release next year.  Because of delays in filming Stepford Wives, she has had to pull out of the Venice Film Festival, and because of the promotional schedule of Cold Mountain she has had to pull out of Mr and Mrs Smith, opposite Pitt.  Her diary is indeed creaking at the seams. And she is determined to make the most of her status while she can, despite the insecurity which leads her sometimes to fear taking on projects in case she is not good enough.  ""There was a time when part of me didn't really want to take on too many projects because I had other priorities like my marriage and my family,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Now I feel more confident. Also I find with two children that are older, that allows me a bit more time to devote to making films.  ""They don't need you every five minutes and they spend time with their father.  ""In any case I'm a pragmatist, and I won't always be offered these opportunities. Work while you can, I say.""  She is living very much the burnout life which she described in Cannes this year, travelling constantly and working hard.  Burnout lifestyle  ""You give so much of yourself and you've got to step away at some stage. You can't do it for ever,"" she said.  Could it be that the worryingly slight figure that emerged this week is evidence she is reaching the point of no return?"

"After months of speculation, Victoria‚Äôs Secret has officially announced the performers for this year's fashion show in Shanghai, which takes place on Monday.  Former One Directioner Harry Styles, Grammy winner Miguel, Hamilton alum Leslie Odom Jr. and Chinese pop sensation Jane Zhang are set to sing on the runway, VSFS executive producer Ed Razek said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe are incredibly thrilled to have them with us,‚Äù he added.  Styles performing on tour in September Getty Images  The announcement follows reports that Katy Perry, who was rumored to perform in Shanghai, was banned from entering China. Gigi Hadid, who was confirmed to walk in this year‚Äôs show, was also reportedly denied entry. Word spread that the event was turning into a ‚Äúmedia crisis,‚Äù but Razek denied those rumors.  ‚ÄúThe news reports I‚Äôve been reading from the US here in Shanghai regarding this year‚Äôs Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Show are not an accurate reflection of what I‚Äôm seeing and experiencing on site,‚Äù he told People.  ‚ÄúThe Chinese have been wonderful and enthusiastic hosts and partners,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúFrom granting more than 700 visas, collaborating with us on every detail and introducing us to local experts who have helped us elevate our event in this renowned fashion city. We appreciate their efforts and all they have done to make this event a success. We look forward to the live show Monday night and the international broadcast a week later.‚Äù  Zhang performing with John Legend in 2015 Getty Images  Razek also teased that this year‚Äôs event will be Victoria‚Äôs Secret‚Äôs ‚Äúmost ambitious show by far.‚Äù In addition to the four performers, 55 models (they most they‚Äôve ever had) from 17 countries will take the catwalk in Shanghai.  Styles, Miguel, Odom, and Zhang follow 2016's VSFS performers‚ÄîLady Gaga, Bruno Mars, and The Weeknd. Though their appearances were just confirmed, rumblings of their performances spread online weeks before today's announcement.    Styles fans noticed that the singer's label, Columbia Records, appeared to announce on Monday he'd be performing his song ""Kiwi,"" off his new album at the VSFS. Fashionista notes that the singer's next tour performance isn't until November 23 (three days after the fashion show is filmed) in Singapore.  R&B favorite Miguel also became a potential VSFS contender when rumors of his appearance surfaced on Twitter. The smooth crooner has a new album, War & Leisure, due out on December 1, which means he has plenty of new material to perform at the show.  Miguel has just been confirmed to be performing at the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. It will be aired on November 28th pic.twitter.com/zY34G4sKXT ‚Äî Daily Miguel (@DailyMigueI) November 14, 2017  Perry was speculated to appear at the VSFS after a letter surfaced online, allegedly showing her agreement to perform, although that's no longer true. She was supposedly replacing Taylor Swift in the lineup‚Äîthe Reputation singer was previously expected to make an appearance. Naturally the rumors of Swift, Styles, and Perry's castings caused a stir, considering Swift's romantic history with Styles (they briefly dated for a few months from 2012-2013) and her ongoing frenemy feud with Perry. But it looks like we'll be missing out on the drama this year.  The artists and models film in Shanghai on Monday, but the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show officially airs on November 28 at 10 p.m./9 p.m. central, on CBS."

"Bling, bling, will she get a ring?

"She‚Äôs doing just fine! Olivia Munn has landed a new gig hosting the Critics‚Äô Choice Awards 2018 amid reports that her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers has moved on with Danica Patrick.

"The Ocean's series is a collection of American heist films anchored by a trilogy edited, directed or produced by Steven Soderbergh. The original three films were written by George C. Johnson, George Nolfi, along with Brian Koppelman and David Levien, for each respective film. Released from 2001 to 2007, the trilogy is often cited as defining its genre and leading to a proliferation and commercialization of heist films throughout the world.[1][2]  Based on the 1960 Rat Pack film, Ocean's 11, the series has seen mixed to favorable critical reception and substantial commercial success. Collectively grossing US$1.17 billion worldwide, the most commercially successful rendition was the first, Ocean's Eleven (2001). It established the ensemble cast of George Clooney, Matt Damon, and Brad Pitt, as Danny Ocean, Linus Caldwell, and Rusty Ryan, respectively. A long list of supporting cast members maintain the trilogy. The first sequel, Ocean's Twelve was released in 2004 with the third and final film, Ocean's Thirteen, following in 2007. An all-female spin-off written and directed by Gary Ross, Ocean's 8 was released on June 8, 2018, 11 years to the day after Thirteen's release.  Inspiration [ edit ]  The Ocean's film series was inspired by the 1960 heist film, Ocean's 11, directed by Lewis Milestone and starring five of the Rat Pack: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Joey Bishop.[3]  Ocean's trilogy [ edit ]  Ocean's Eleven (2001) [ edit ]  Master thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney), just out of prison, plans an elaborate Las Vegas three-casino-heist to win back his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts). To that end, he recruits eight other thieves and con men to pull off the complex job, eventually stealing US$160 million.  Ocean's Twelve (2004) [ edit ]  The Ocean's crew is blackmailed by the Casino owner they stole from‚ÄìTerry Benedict (Andy Garcia)‚Äìinto paying him $198 million (their loot plus interest). The team is given two weeks to come up with the money so they travel to Europe to execute three heists. In order to extend the deadline they attempt to steal world's oldest stock certificate, issued by the Dutch East India Company in 1602. Worth ‚Ç¨2.5 million, the certificate is stolen just before the crew get there by a rival thief‚Äì""The Night Fox"" (Vincent Cassel). The rival thief proposes to the crew a competition to steal Hermitage Museum's Imperial Coronation Egg in order to find out who is the best there is in the world. In exchange for the competition, the rival thief offers to pay back the $198 million debt they have with Terry Benedict. With only a week left, the crew agrees and eventually loses the competition after a Europol detective, Agent Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), catches them in the act. After this it is revealed that The Night Fox's mentor, Gaspar LeMarc, was behind the heist all along. He told the Ocean's crew to go to the museum beforehand, switch out the real egg for a fake one and convince The Night Fox to steal it. After Danny Ocean explains this plot, he is given the $198 million promised and pays off Terry Benedict.  Ocean's Thirteen (2007) [ edit ]  Ocean and his crew plan to rig a new casino's opening night after its ruthless owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double crosses one of the gang, with plans to make his life a worthless cesspit of misery, a figurative Tartarus of unending misfortune which needs no explanation apart from a vengeful crew of incredibly skilled thieves.  Ocean's 8 (2018) [ edit ]  Soderbergh and George Clooney initially downplayed the possibility of an Ocean's Fourteen or subsequent sequels due to Bernie Mac's death in 2008.[4] However, a new Ocean's Eleven spin-off with an all-female cast led by Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney's Danny Ocean was put in development. It was conceived by producer Jerry Weintraub, Soderbergh and Clooney.

"Scheana Shay doesn‚Äôt even have to watch Vanderpump Rules to know how her relationship with now ex-boyfriend Rob Valletta has come off to fans.  ‚ÄúI will admit, I haven‚Äôt watched the last few episodes ‚Ä¶ last season, watching my divorce wasn‚Äôt as hard for me because I was in a very happy relationship, and I was madly in love with Rob,‚Äù Shay told costar and BFF Ariana Madix on the Tuesday, March 6, episode of her podcast, Scheananigans.  ‚ÄúWait, you were?‚Äù Madix said sarcastically.  ‚ÄúI kept it super low-key,‚Äù Shay joked.  As previously reported, the SUR waitress filed for divorce from her husband of over two years, Mike Shay, in November 2016. She started dating Valletta shortly after, and viewers have been quick to criticize their relationship, calling Shay ‚Äúpathetic‚Äù and ‚Äúcringeworthy‚Äù on Twitter because she is seemingly more invested in their future than he is.  ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm single, I‚Äôve been single for six months now, watching back me being that happy, love drunk girl, started to get a little hard,‚Äù Shay explained. ‚ÄúObviously, you can‚Äôt see every minute of every conversation ‚Ä¶ I know I look really stupid, and you know what? I was coming off a divorce. I got back with someone who I felt was my soulmate and was the one ‚Ä¶ You can‚Äôt fault me for being happy and being in love.‚Äù  ‚ÄúRob was very reserved on the show,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúHe is a person who lives his life on camera, acting and hosting, not for a reality show. For him, that was completely out of his comfort zone. He is a very private person ‚Ä¶ So for him, that was hard to have those raw emotions on there. The moments that we had in private are private moments. He did tell me he loved me. We were planning a future together, but then, just this world that he became a part of was too overwhelming for him to continue.‚Äù  Valletta defended Shay on February 26 after fans slammed their relationship: ‚ÄúNo one knows what happens behind closed doors and or when the cameras are off. But what I do know is that there are things that I never expressed on camera, but did in person. The reason I created space in our relationship was because of the world, not the person. @scheana and I have cared for and supported each other for 12 years no matter the circumstances or dynamic.

"Winter is coming thawing soon: HBO just revealed a few tantalizing details on the upcoming Game of Thrones prequel series.  ‚ÄúWe are doing a pilot that Jane Goldman wrote,‚Äù HBO programming president Casey Bloys confirmed for reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour on Wednesday. With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, ‚Äúwe‚Äôd be lucky to get one that we‚Äôre very, very excited about, and we did get that. We‚Äôre just starting the search for a director‚Ä¶ we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.‚Äù  HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. Per the official logline, ‚Äúthe series chronicles the world‚Äôs descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros‚Äô history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not the story we think we know.‚Äù  In addition to writing the pilot, Goldman (X-Men: First Class) will serve as showrunner, and will join Game of Thrones author George R.R.

"Just one week after making history at the box office, ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù has been given the Oprah Winfrey treatment. The media empress threw a ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù-themed party on Tuesday, complete with a cake, flip-flops, popcorn buckets and the superhero‚Äôs signature headpiece and wrist cuffs.  Winfrey documented the party preparations on her Instagram account with a series of videos. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ‚ÄòWonder Woman‚Äô day at my house,‚Äù she declared in the first, adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a party for 28 10-year-olds.‚Äù She proceeded to outfit a ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù cake with a topper featuring the superhero herself.

She‚Äôs also wearing the signature wrist cuffs as she raves about themed popcorn buckets and cups. She then displays pairs of ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù flip-flops, capping off her video series with a shot of the chef preparing some salad.  ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù raked in a whopping $223 million globally when it opened two weeks ago, making it the biggest opening for a film directed by a woman.

"Sofia Richie (born August 24, 1998)[1] is an American fashion model. She has been featured in campaigns by a number of major brands including Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors and Chanel. She is the youngest daughter of singer and songwriter Lionel Richie and adoptive sister to fashion designer and television personality Nicole Richie.  Early life [ edit ]  Sofia Richie was born in Los Angeles, California to parents Lionel Richie and his second wife Diane Alexander. She is the younger sister of Nicole Richie (who was adopted) and the biological sister of Miles Richie.[1] Sofia Richie's godfather was Michael Jackson. She reported that the visits to Jackson's Neverland Ranch were some of her favorite memories as a child, and she became close friends with his daughter, Paris.[2]  Richie grew up with an affinity for music like her father. She learned to sing at age 5 and to play the piano at age 7.[3] She made occasional appearances at her father's shows[2] and took vocal lessons from Beyonce's vocal coach, Tim Carter, when she was 14, as well.[3] She also worked in the studio with her brother-in-law (and Good Charlotte lead vocalist) Joel Madden.[4][3] She decided to move away from a music career, however, because of the pressure of living up to her father's stature in the music industry.[5]  Richie spent some time at Oaks Christian School‚Äînicknamed ""Celebrity High""‚Äîbefore being educated at home for several years while her father was on tour. She played soccer until age 16 when she broke her hip in a Segway accident.[5]  Modeling career [ edit ]  Richie began modeling at age 14 with a feature in Teen Vogue[4] and at 15 she got her first fashion contract with Los Angeles-based swimwear company Mary Grace Swim.[6] The next year, Richie signed with London-based modeling agency Select Model Management.[7]  Richie has featured in advertising campaigns for a number of brands including DL1961,[8] Madonna's Material Girl line,[2] Chanel,[9] Dolce & Gabbana,[9] Adidas, Michael Kors,[11] and Tommy Hilfiger.[9] She has done photoshoots for Elle and Vanity Fair[5] and has recently appeared on the cover of Complex[5] and Billboard magazine's style issue.[3]"
"TLC has officially severed its ties with former ‚ÄúCounting On‚Äù star Derick Dillard after he repeatedly made negative comments about one of the network‚Äôs other stars, Jazz Jennings.  On Saturday, the network released a statement on Twitter explaining that it has severed ties with Dillard after another round of comments against Jennings, who stars on her own series, ‚ÄúI Am Jazz,‚Äù which chronicles her life following her decision at a young age to transition from a male to a female.  ‚ÄúWe want to let our viewers know that Derick Dillard has not participated in ‚ÄòCounting On‚Äô for months and the network has no plans to feature him in the future. We want to reiterate that Derick‚Äôs personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúTLC is proud to share the story of Jazz jennings and her family and will continue to do so.‚Äù  The decision from the network comes after Dillard spoke for a second time about Jennings, arguing that he doesn‚Äôt believe that one can change their gender identity and refused to use feminine pronouns when discussing Jennings.  ‚ÄúI pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child. It‚Äôs sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what‚Äôs on tv these days,‚Äù he wrote in response to another commenter who brought up his older comments about Jennings.  As previously reported, Dillard, who came to fame alongside his wife Jill Duggar on TLC, previously took issue with Jennings saying that gender is ‚Äúordained by God.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat an oxymoron‚Ä¶ a 'reality' show which follows a non-reality. 'Transgender' is a myth. Gender is not fluid; it‚Äôs ordained by God.‚Äù  Jennings, who hasn‚Äôt directly responded to Dillard‚Äôs latest comments, said at the time:  ‚ÄúEvery day I experience cyber-bullying, but I keep sharing my story. Today was no different.‚Äù  Dillard continued to respond to his latest statements, saying that he‚Äôs just trying to have a mature discussion about his concerns as a Christian. He also speculated as to the capability of a child to make decisions about their gender identity. However, people on Twitter were mostly unimpressed with his justification, and it was enough to prompt the network to completely sever ties with him."
"[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]  XXXTentacion had been a rising star in hip-hop, landing a No. 1 album in March despite existing largely outside of the mainstream music business. He first gained popularity on the streaming platform SoundCloud and became something of a poster child for the digital age, with millions of young fans tracking his every utterance. But XXXTentacion was also mired in controversy and legal troubles, and was awaiting trial on charges including aggravated battery of a pregnant victim, false imprisonment and witness tampering at the time of his death.  Image Michael Boatwright was served an arrest warrant for first-degree murder in the killing of XXXTentacion. Credit Broward Sheriff's Office  On the day he was killed, the rapper visited Riva Motorsports with a friend. The police said two men followed XXXTentacion into the store and later, as he was leaving the dealership, blocked his vehicle and exited a dark-colored S.U.V. brandishing guns and demanding property. After a brief struggle, at least one of the suspects fired at the rapper, who was later pronounced dead at a hospital.  ‚ÄúThe investigation continues,‚Äù the Broward County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said in its news release on Wednesday.  Sheriff Scott Israel of Broward said that his department was withholding additional information about the arrest of Mr. Boatwright, and sealed the arrest report, as it continued to pursue the case, the Sun-Sentinel reported.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not releasing any information about it because we‚Äôre still looking for two other suspects, including Robert Allen,‚Äù Mr. Israel said. ‚ÄúIf we release more information about the case, it may hamper detectives‚Äô ability or impede their progress to make those other arrests and take those two individuals into custody.‚Äù  Since XXXTentacion‚Äôs death, his music has surged on streaming platforms, sending both of his official albums into the Top 5 on the Billboard chart; the single ‚ÄúSad!‚Äù also reached No. 1 last month. According to his associates, XXXTentacion had been close to finishing a new album, and had signed a $10 million deal for its release just weeks before he was killed."
"  Terry Crews arrives at an event in Beverly Hills, Calif., in November 2017. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Last October, as the #MeToo earthquake was beginning to rip through the Hollywood power structure following abuse allegations connected to producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Terry Crews significantly readjusted the national conversation.  In tweets, the ‚ÄúBrooklyn Nine-Nine‚Äù star laid out his own claims of experiencing sexual harassment. At a party in 2016, a ‚Äúhigh-level Hollywood executive‚Äù came up to Crews and ‚Äúgroped my privates,‚Äù the actor wrote. Crews later publicly identified the executive as Adam Venit, a longtime industry power-player who represented marquee names such as Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn. Crews went on to file a police report about the incident, as well as a lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor.  But Crews‚Äôs revelation reverberated well beyond his own case. His public stand detonated stereotypes by showing a 240-pound former NFL player could also be the victim of sexual assault, thus widening the lens of the #MeToo movement. Time included Crews among the ‚Äúthe silence breakers‚Äù named in the magazine‚Äôs person of the year feature.  Now, Crews‚Äôs legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.  ‚ÄúTerry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,‚Äù the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. ‚ÄúIt will be dismissed.‚Äù  According to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews‚Äôs allegation.  After news of the settlement and Venit‚Äôs exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: ‚ÄúACCOUNTABILITY,‚Äù he wrote.  That was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.  ‚ÄúPeople need to be held accountable,‚Äù the actor told ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù last November. ‚ÄúThis is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he‚Äôs one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, ‚ÄòWho is going to believe you?‚Äô‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,‚Äù Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. ‚ÄúAs I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man‚Äôs horseplay is another man‚Äôs humiliation.‚Äù  In his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. ‚ÄúVenit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews‚Äôs penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,‚Äù the lawsuit stated.  Crews, who was not Venit‚Äôs client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of ‚Äúcorporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.‚Äù  In court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.  According to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of ‚Äúthe lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.‚Äù  But the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency‚Äôs internal review determined that Crews‚Äôs allegation about Venit was ‚Äúindicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.‚Äù The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency‚Äôs motion picture group.  Venit‚Äôs demotion ‚Äî and now exit ‚Äî from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school. He later went on to represent some of the biggest movie stars in the business."
"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. She married John F. Kennedy in 1953. When she became first lady in 1961, she worked to restore the White House to its original elegance and to protect its holdings. After JFK's assassination in 1963, she moved to New York City. She married Aristotle Onassis in 1968. She died of cancer in 1994.  Early Life  Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. Her father, John Bouvier, was a wealthy New York stockbroker of French Catholic descent, and her mother, Janet, was an accomplished equestrienne of Irish Catholic heritage. Onassis was a bright, curious and occasionally mischievous child. One of her elementary school teachers described her as ""a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil."" Another teacher, less charmed by young Jacqueline, wrote admonishingly that ""her disturbing conduct in geography class made it necessary to exclude her from the room.""  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Onassis enjoyed a privileged childhood of ballet lessons at the Metropolitan Opera House and French lessons beginning at age of 12. Like her mother, Onassis loved riding and was highly skilled on horseback. In 1940, at the age of 11, she won a national junior horsemanship competition. The New York Times reported, ""Jacqueline Bouvier, an eleven-year-old equestrienne from East Hampton, Long Island, scored a double victory in the horsemanship competition. Miss Bouvier achieved a rare distinction. The occasions are few when the same rider wins both competitions in the same show.""  Onassis attended Miss Porter's School, a prestigious boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut; in addition to its rigorous academics, the school also emphasized proper manners and the art of conversation. There she excelled as a student, writing frequent essays and poems for the school newspaper and winning the award as the school's top literature student in her senior year. Also during her senior year, in 1947, Onassis was named ""Debutante of the Year"" by a local newspaper. However, Onassis had greater ambitions than being recognized for her beauty and popularity. She wrote in the yearbook that her life ambition was ""not to be a housewife.""  Upon graduating from Miss Porter's School Onassis enrolled at Vassar College in New York to study history, literature, art and French. She spent her junior year studying abroad in Paris. ""I loved it more than any year of my life,"" Onassis later wrote about her time there. ""Being away from home gave me a chance to look at myself with a jaundiced eye. I learned not to be ashamed of a real hunger for knowledge, something that I had always tried to hide, and I came home glad to start in here again but with a love for Europe that I am afraid will never leave me.""  Upon returning from Paris, Onassis transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and graduated with a B.A. in French literature in 1951. After graduating from college in 1951, Onassis landed a job as the ""Inquiring Camera Girl"" for the Washington Times-Herald newspaper. Her job was to photograph and interview various Washington residents, and then weave their pictures and responses together in her column. Among her most notable stories were an interview with Richard Nixon, coverage of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration and a report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.  U.S. First Lady  It was at a dinner party in 1952 that Onassis met a dashing young congressman and senator-elect from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy; he ""leaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date."" They were married a year later, on September 12, 1953. Onassis gave birth to her first child, Caroline Kennedy, in 1957. That same year, she encouraged Kennedy to write and, subsequently, helped him edit Profiles in Courage, his famous book about U.S. senators who had risked their careers to stand for causes they believed in.  In January 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S. presidency. Although Onassis was pregnant at the time and thus unable to join him on the campaign trail, she campaigned tirelessly from home. She answered letters, gave interviews, taped commercials and wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column called ""Campaign Wife.""  On November 8, 1960, Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by a razor-thin margin to become the 35th president of the United States; less three weeks later, Onassis gave birth to their second child, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. The couple had a third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy born prematurely on August 7, 1963, but lost the child two days later.  Onassis's first mission as first lady was to transform the White House into a museum of American history and culture that would inspire patriotism and public service in those who visited. ""Every boy who comes here should see things that develop his sense of history,"" she once said. Onassis went to extraordinary lengths to procure art and furniture owned by past presidents‚Äîincluding artifacts owned by George Washington, James Madison and Abraham Lincoln‚Äîas well as pieces she considered representative of various periods of American culture. ""Everything in the White House must have a reason for being there,"" she insisted. ""It would be sacrilege merely to 'redecorate' it‚Äîa word I hate. It must be restored‚Äîand that has nothing to do with decoration. That is a question of scholarship.""  As the culmination of her project, Onassis gave a tour of the restored White House on national television on February 14, 1962. A record 56 million viewers watched her televised special, and Onassis won an honorary Emmy Award for her performance.  As first lady, Onassis was also a great patron of the arts. In addition to the officials, diplomats and statesman who typically populated state dinners, Onassis also invited the nation's leading writers, artists, musicians and scientists to mingle with its top politicians. The great violinist Isaac Stern wrote to Onassis after one such dinner, ""It would be difficult to tell you how refreshing, how heartening it is to find such serious attention and respect for the arts in the White House. To many of us it is one of the most exciting developments on the present American cultural scene.""  Additionally, Onassis frequently traveled abroad, both with the president and alone, and her deep knowledge of foreign cultures and languages (she spoke fluent French, Spanish and Italian) helped garner goodwill toward America. She was so adoringly received in France that President Kennedy introduced himself as ""the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris."" Presidential advisor Clark Clifford wrote to Onassis, ""Once in a great while, an individual will capture the imagination of people all over the world. You have done this; and what is more important, through your graciousness and tact, you have transformed this rare accomplishment into an incredibly important asset to this nation."""

"Marvel‚Äôs Runaways are finally living up to their name.  The Hulu superhero series, from executive producers Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage (Gossip Girl), returns for its second season on Dec. 21 and EW has an exclusive look at the new trailer above.  At the end of season 1, the titular band of teens, after discovering their parents are supervillains, finally ran away from home. ‚ÄúThis year is much more the cat-and-mouse [game] and the two sides going to war,‚Äù says Savage. So, naturally, season 2 begins with the friends finding a new place to hide as they strategize on how to deal with their diabolical parental units. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in Griffith Park,‚Äù Savage explains of the hideout, which is called the Hostel in the comics that inspired the streaming series. ‚ÄúIt was originally built in the 1920s by a magician. It was lived in for many years, [but] perhaps sometime in the ‚Äô60s or ‚Äô70s there was an earthquake or mudslide that made it uninhabitable.‚Äù Adds Schwartz, ‚ÄúWe wanted it to be our equivalent of, like, the Batcave.‚Äù Teenagers really need a place to hang out‚Ä¶even if it‚Äôs an underground dust-filled mansion.  Greg Lewis / Hulu  In the above photo from episode 4, the gang enjoys a candlelit meal in the dining room with Molly‚Äôs (Allegra Acosta) enigmatic new acquaintance Topher (Jan Luis Castellanos). ‚ÄúHe is a character who‚Äôs from the comics,‚Äù Schwartz teases of the character also seen in the new trailer. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not all that he appears to be.‚Äù Interiors for the Hostel were constructed at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles and were massive. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the biggest set that Marvel Television has ever built,‚Äù says Schwartz. ‚ÄúWhen [comic co-creator] Brian K. Vaughan came to the set for the first time, he had tears in his eyes.‚Äù We‚Äôre pretty sure it wasn‚Äôt the dust.

"Two former partners of Chip Gaines in the creation of the Magnolia Real Estate Company are suing the ‚ÄúFixer Upper‚Äù star for fraud, claiming that Gaines bought them out without telling them that HGTV had decided to broadcast the show nationally ‚Äúand that the show prominently featured the ‚ÄòMagnolia‚Äô brand name.‚Äù  (Photo by Neal Klaeser)  In the 24-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court in Waco, Gaines‚Äôs two former partners, lawyers John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark, are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, as well.  Gaines‚Äô spokesman declined to comment on the suit, but his attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX Thursday, ‚ÄúWe are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.""  Lewis and Clark were equal partners with Gaines in founding the Magnolia Real Estate Company in 2007.  The suit says that for the first six years, the company largely operated in Waco with a single real estate agent.  The suit claims Gaines worked out a deal with HGTV for the ‚ÄúFixer Upper‚Äù program without telling his partners and that Gaines planned on featuring the Magnolia brand name.  Gaines bought their shares of Magnolia Real estate for $2,500 each, the suit says.  ""With this insider information in hand, Chip Gaines convinced plaintiffs to sell their membership interests in Magnolia Realty quickly to him before a public announcement that ‚ÄúFixer Upper‚Äù was picked up by HGTV.""  The suit, which also names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive, Scripps networks LLC and High Noon Entertainment which produces the show, claims Gaines pressured Lewis and Clark to sell ‚Äúbefore they discovered the company‚Äôs value was radically enhanced by ‚ÄòFixer Upper.‚Äô‚Äù  When Clark balked at the terms of the buyout, the suit alleges Gaines sent a text advising Lewis to tell Clark ‚Äúto be careful.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt come from the nerdy prep school he‚Äôs from. And when people talk to me that way they get their asses kicked. And if he‚Äôs not ready to do that he better shut his mouth. I‚Äôm not the toughest guy there is, but I can assure you that would not end well for [R]ick,‚Äù the text read, according to the suit.  Since the show debuted, the suit says, Magnolia has grown from a single-agent firm to one that employs ‚Äúover 93 real estate agents, and a support staff, and now operates in nearly every major city in Texas.‚Äù  In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for Lewis‚Äô and Clark‚Äôs interest, payment of salaries, bonuses in-kind benefits and distributions they would have received as partners"
"It's too early to tell if the film is even gonna happen, but it's not looking good for A.  Our insider says Kristen was approached to fill Jolie's hot-woman void in the franchise and met at least once with Timur Bekmambetov, the director of the series.  However, Angelina's participation in the project is still up in the air.  While her character died in the first installment of the film, Bekmambetov told MTV that he would bring her back in some capacity, in the sequel.  Only problem is A.J. reportedly backed out of the film. We hear details (aka money and exactly how much time she'd need to give to the flick) were never worked out, which is why Angelina is out, for now‚Äîbut she could possibly make a cameo if the film actually happens.  So can Kristen save the franchise?  Our dishy source says the Stewart-McAvoy version of the project might not come to fruition, but it remains a slim possibility‚Äîand wouldn't it be damn hot! (Sure would be a lot happier news than that horrible fake car accident stuff which had K.Stew fans in a tizzy yesterday.)  Kristen is set to start filming Breaking Dawn possibly as early as October, while the Wanted follow-up was originally slated to start shooting around the end of August.  No production date has been set in stone for the final Twilight flick(s), which is making it difficult, we're told, for many of the actors involved in the vampire franchise to figure out their schedule allowed for outside projects. Anyone remember Rachelle Lefevre?  Be careful before you sign up for other projects, dearies!  Neither Bekmambetov nor a rep for Stewart responded to E!'s request for comment. While no offer was officially given to Kristen, word is that Bekmambetov is‚Äîfor now‚Äîlooking at other projects for the fall, given the scheduling conflicts.  Bummer! Nobody kicks ass like K.Stew."

"Just because two people are in love and are great together doesn't mean the idea of marriage should continuously be forced upon them. For example, once again, Jennifer Lopez has said she's not marrying Alex Rodriguez ‚Äî at this point in time. The marriage question is one the World of Dance judge is repeatedly asked. It's also an exhausting topic that Lopez should no longer have to discuss during every interview.  During Thursday's The Ellen DeGeneres Show, host Ellen DeGeneres brought up Lopez's relationship with Rodriguez and the possibility of the two saying ""I do."" DeGeneres began the conversation by telling J. Lo and referring to A-Rod, ""He said that y'all are gonna be getting married.""  The former Shades of Blue star quickly denied that statement by declaring, ""He did not say that. He did not say that.""  The two went back and forth a bit in a joking manner about Rodriguez's supposed declaration of marriage. But, that wasn't enough to stop DeGeneres from, once again, asking Lopez, ""So, you'll be getting married?""  The multifaceted Lopez answered, ""I don't know. I don't know."" DeGeneres pushed further by stating, ""You should, cuz y'all seem very happy."" The Second Act star agreed with the latter. ""We are,"" she said. ""We've been together a couple years, it's nice.""  TheEllenShow on YouTube  Of course, DeGeneres didn't stop there and said about them having a wedding, ""It would be good to do for Christmas.""  However, rather than giving a verbal response, Lopez reacted with the most telling facial expression. Here it is:  At this point of the marriage conversation, Lopez was still laughing and going along with DeGeneres, but it also seemed like she didn't know what else to say. It was almost like The Fosters executive producer was ready to move on to something else.  Was DeGeneres mainly teasing? Yes. Is she happy for the duo and wants them to live a beautiful life together? Of course. Does she really care or is trying to force them to get married? No. The interview was all in good fun and one Lopez took extremely well. That said, it has to get old reciting the same thing over and over again about your personal relationship.  Andrew Toth/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  In a Harper's Bazaar interview published on March 15, Lopez once again said about getting married, ""I do believe in marriage. And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I‚Äôm not forcing anything right now. It‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs healthy; we communicate well.""  Then, during a June 11 Good Morning America interview, Lopez said about marrying Rodriguez, ""We have to take our time. I've made plenty of mistakes in my past and ... we're mature now."" She continued,  ""We're grown ups and we're going to take our time and we're going to do things at our own pace. And our life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work we're truly blessed. We don't need anything more right now.""  How many more times does she need to say it? They are content with the current status of their relationship. The two certainly aren't in any rush to walk down the aisle. Even if someone's just joking around with Lopez and Rodriguez about marriage, having to repeatedly field those types of questions and to reaffirm their happiness is tiring. Let's all just let them enjoy their relationship without the pressure of marriage."

"Chris Brown has opened up about his assault on Rihanna that landed him in court in 2009.  ‚ÄúI felt like a f**king monster,‚Äù the 28-year-old singer said in the documentary Chris Brown: Welcome To My Life.  Brown said the fight with Rihanna started when she became jealous that his ex showed up at a pre-Grammys party they attended.  ‚ÄúShe starts going off, she throws the phone, ‚ÄòI hate you!‚Äô, whatever, whatever, she starts hitting me, we‚Äôre in a little Lamborghini, you know she‚Äôs fighting me,‚Äù Brown claimed.  ‚ÄúLike I remember she tried to kick me, just like her beating s**t, but then I really hit her.

It‚Äôs a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street.  ‚ÄúShe grabbed my nuts. And when she did that, I bite her arm while I‚Äôm still trying to drive.‚Äù  Brown was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to assault and got five years of probation and was ordered to do six months of community service and attend domestic violence counselling.  In the documentary, the singer said his relationship with Rihanna was always violent.  ‚ÄúWe would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThere was always a point where we‚Äôd talk about it like, ‚ÄòWhat the f**k are we doing? Like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt like you slapping me.‚Äô If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, ‚ÄòOh, no I fell.‚Äô If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ever trying to put my hands on any female.‚Äù  Rihanna has not yet publicly responded to Brown‚Äôs version of events."

"How sad. Another Hollywood romance allegedly bites the dust. After dating for 9 months, ‚ÄòX-Men: First Class‚Äô star Michael Fassbender and Alicia Vikander have broken up, according to a new report.  Oh no! It seems like the summer of break-ups is not over yet! The latest reported romance to fall apart is the one between Michael Fassbender, 38, and Alicia Vikander, 26. The Steve Jobs star and the Swedish actress have allegedly split after nine months together!    Love is dead! Michael and Alicia have reportedly called it quits, a source tells Us Weekly. Aww, bummer. Alicia and Michael have been together for not even a year. They reportedly first met on the set of their film, The Light Between The Oceans, in late 2014 and sparked a new romance.  The last time Alicia and Michael were photographed together was in May 2015. The two attended the Formula One Grand Prix in Monaco, looking affectionate while posing in front of one of the sports cars. It may just be their romance ran out of gas?  Michael has a reported history of dating his co-stars, according to the Daily Mail. He was involved with his X-Men: First Class co-star, Zoe Kravitz, from 2010 to 2011. Afterward, he later was involved with his fellow Shame star, Nicole Beharie.  Though their romance is allegedly over, both Michael and Alicia‚Äôs careers are going strong. In addition to his turn playing the Apple co-creator in Steve Jobs, Michael will reprise his role of Magneto in X-Men: Apocalypse. As for Alicia, she‚Äôll appear opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller in Burnt. She also has been cast in the next Bourne movie, featuring Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones.  Michel and Alicia‚Äôs reported split is the latest in a long line of Hollywood break-ups. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their divorce after a decade together.

"Muslim convert and would-be domestic terrorist Everitt Aaron Jameson, who planned to carry out a Christmas Day massacre on Pier 39 in San Francisco, was a supporter of Antifa and counted amongst his favourite news organisations CNN, BuzzFeed and Al-Jazeera.The former US Marine was arrested after he told the FBI of his plan to carry out the atrocity, noting that December 25 would be ‚Äúthe perfect day to commit the attack‚Äù because Pier 39 would be crowded with people.Media reports confirmed that Jameson ‚Äúhad recently been posting and liking pro-terrorism content on Facebook‚Äù and had expressed support for the ISIS-inspired Halloween truck attack in New York. He converted to Islam two years ago.However, what those reports don‚Äôt mention is that the would-be terrorist also ‚Äòliked‚Äô numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.Jameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.He also liked a number of other far-left pages, including ‚ÄòTrump Resistance Movement‚Äô, ‚ÄòThings Trump Supporters Say‚Äô, ‚ÄòUS Democratic Socialists‚Äô, ‚ÄòProgressive Politics‚Äô, and ‚ÄòJeremy Corbyn‚Äô.Some of Jameson‚Äôs favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.The jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including ‚ÄòDocumenting Oppression Against Muslims, ‚ÄòIslam ‚Äì Religion of Peace‚Äô and ‚ÄòStunning Hijabs‚Äô, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.Jameson‚Äôs Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.As we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.A passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled ‚ÄòEuropean Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists‚Äô details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.During the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.According to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses. Members of Antifa have also met with Islamic terrorists to obtain weapons & training.FBI field report: Antifa has improvised explosives stored on college campuses.

"Robert Pattinson still has ‚Äòa lot of love‚Äô for Kristen Stewart! Does that mean he wants to get back together with her? Get the EXCLUSIVE details!    People LOVE when couples rekindle their romances, but is a reunion in the cards for Kristen Stewart, 27, and Robert Pattinson, 31? The Twilight alums were spotted ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù together on Feb. 11, and we‚Äôre hearing that the former couple are on good terms now! ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs taken a long time to get there, but Rob and Kristen are finally friends again,‚Äù a source close to Rob told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. ‚ÄúTheir break-up was so painful for Rob, and he felt so angry and humiliated by Kristen cheating, that at one point he doubted he would ever be able to fully forgive her. But, time heals and Rob‚Äôs now managed to put the past behind him and let bygones be bygones.‚Äù  But even though the pair have a past with each other, don‚Äôt expect them them to be getting together in the future. ‚ÄúRob and Kristen have so much shared history, they were together during the craziest time in their lives, they pretty much grew up together during the whole Twilight madness, and they really understand each other better than anyone else could. Rob still has a lot of love and respect for Kristen, but it‚Äôs evolved from romantic feelings into a deep friendship,‚Äù the insider added.  If you‚Äôre bummed that Bella and Edward won‚Äôt be living the rest of eternity together IRL, listen, I get it. We all are gunning for our faves to rekindle their lost love. Personally, I‚Äôm still not over the fact that Vanessa Hudgens and Zac Efron broke up! But, unfortunately, not every couple is Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. And also, Kristen herself has said in a monologue on Saturday Night Live that she is ‚Äúlike so gay dude.‚Äù She‚Äôs currently dating Victoria‚Äôs Secret model Stella Maxwell, 27. So yeah, Kristen and Robert aren‚Äôt getting back together any time soon, and that‚Äôs probably for the best. (And while we‚Äôre at it, quit it with the Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston shipping! They‚Äôre not getting back together! Stop it!)  HollywoodLifers, what were your thoughts on Kristen and Robert hanging out?"

"There's no need to worry about Ellen DeGeneres' marriage to Portia de Rossi. How do we know? DeGeneres said so herself.  The 55-year-old comedian took some time out of her talk show on Wednesday to address rumors that have surfaced in the last several months suggesting she and de Rossi are split-bound.  ""The other day I was at the hair salon getting these extensions put in,"" DeGeneres joked. ""And there were tabloids all over the hair salon... and on one of them, Portia and I were in the top right-hand corner. And I thought, 'Oh that's so sweet, they're honoring us.' But then I read the headline underneath. And it said, 'Ellen and Portia Marriage Crumbles.' And I was like, 'Oh, what happened? They seemed so happy.' And then I was like, 'Wait, I'm Ellen.' And I should know if that was happening.""  The talk show host's monologue took a more serious turn -- at least for a little while -- when she shot down the rumors.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so ridiculous to me. There‚Äôs not one ounce of truth to any of it. I‚Äôm very happily married. In fact, the only thing we ever argue about is who loves who more. That is all. It really is true,"" she said. ""And we argue if we‚Äôd let a kangaroo carry us around in its pouch for a year. I would. She wouldn‚Äôt. She‚Äôll change her mind. Who wouldn‚Äôt want to be in the pouch of a kangaroo for a year? Hopping around. And she‚Äôs like 'no' but anyway.‚Äù  And if an announcement about some big change in her life ever needs to be made, DeGeneres promised, ""I'll announce it here first.""  DeGeneres and de Rossi married in August 2008 after four years of dating. At the time, the talk show host called herself ""the luckiest girl in the world.""  Keep in touch!

"A lawyer representing the diver who Elon Musk recently accused of being a pedophile said on Wednesday that he sent the Tesla chief a letter that says that he‚Äôs preparing to file a libel lawsuit.  The development is the latest twist in the entrepreneur‚Äôs turbulent summer on Twitter and comes one day after Musk questioned why the diver hadn‚Äôt sued him if his claims were untrue.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs strange he hasn‚Äôt sued me? He was offered free legal services,‚Äù asked Musk in reply to @Yoda on Twitter.  Also Read: Elon Musk Needled for Tearful NY Times Interview About Having to Work Through His Birthday  Attorney L. Lin Wood, who is representing diver Vernon Unsworth, replied to the thread on Wednesday, saying that Musk ‚Äúshould check his mail before tweeting.‚Äù  Musk originally called Unsworth ‚Äî a diver that criticized Musk‚Äôs attempts to help the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave as a ‚ÄúPR stunt‚Äù ‚Äî a ‚Äúpedo guy‚Äù in July. Musk later apologized for his comment, saying it was ‚Äúspoken in anger.‚Äù  Also Read: Elon Musk Says He Won't Take Tesla Private After All  ‚ÄúYou published three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr. Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children,‚Äù Wood said in his letter, dated August 6, to Musk. ‚ÄúYou did so without any basis.‚Äù  Wood added that he‚Äôs prepping a civil libel complaint against Musk.  A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to TheWrap‚Äôs request for comment.  Even without a potential civil suit on his hands, it‚Äôs already been a controversial month for 47-year-old entrepreneur.

"Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt‚Äòs split in September 2016 was sudden and shocking ‚Äî but after an initial flurry of ugly accusations, the couple entered divorce mediation and largely kept their negotiations private.  Now their divorce has exploded into the headlines again as the couple battle over visitation and child support for kids Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne and Knox. Here‚Äôs a brief history of how things between them got so heated.  Their Shocking Split  Jolie and Pitt were last photographed together in public in July 2016, when they stopped into a Jamba Juice store in L.A. with Shiloh.  On Sept. 19, 2016 Jolie filed for divorce. She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split and asked for physical custody of their six children.  Pitt and Jolie with (from left) Pax, Zahara, Knox, Shiloh and Maddox in May 2014. Charley Gallay/Getty  Troubling Allegations and an Investigation  Pitt was investigated by the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services over allegations he got ‚Äúverbally abusive‚Äù and ‚Äúphysical‚Äù with one of his children on the pair‚Äôs private plane the day before Jolie filed for divorce.  A source told PEOPLE at the time that Pitt ‚Äúmade contact‚Äù with Maddox, then 15, in the shoulder area, but Maddox wasn‚Äôt injured. ‚ÄúThere was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have,‚Äù the source said.  DCFS concluded its investigation in November. ‚ÄúIt was a full and thorough investigation and the determination has been made that no charges should be brought,‚Äù a source said at the time, adding that there was no finding of abuse.  An Agreement to Keep the Divorce Private  Starting in October 2016, Pitt was allowed weekly visits, supervised by a therapist, with his youngest kids, a January 2017 court filing revealed. The papers stated that weekly visits of ‚Äúfive hours each‚Äù had been scheduled through the end of January. That same month, Jolie and Pitt put out a joint statement saying they had reached an agreement to hash out their divorce confidentially in front of a private judge and ‚Äúact as a united front.‚Äù  Custody Issues Surface  In the following year-plus, the exes kept the peace and got back to their lives. Jolie continued her advocacy work, produced an Oscar-nominated animated movie and resumed acting with Maleficent 2. Pitt starred in and produced numerous movies and started dating, according to source, being seen with MIT professor Neri Oxman in April.  Then in June 2018, their clash over custody wound up surfacing in public court documents. A judge ruled that Jolie could lose primary custody of their kids if she didn‚Äôt allow them each to form a ‚Äúhealthy and strong relationship‚Äù with Pitt. The judge set a detailed visitation schedule of when Pitt could spend time with the children in London, where Jolie has been filming for the summer, and in L.A. The ruled also granted Pitt unsupervised cell phone contact with the kids.  A spokesperson for Jolie called the public release of the documents ‚Äúdeplorable.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFrom the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs,‚Äù the statement to PEOPLE continued, ‚Äúwhich is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately.‚Äù  Pitt and Jolie at the 2014 Oscars. Kevin Mazur/WireImage  Pitt and Jolie in 2014.  A Child-Support Spat  Jolie‚Äôs attorney Samantha Bley DeJean filed papers on Aug. 7 stating that Pitt ‚Äúhas a duty to pay child support. As of present, [Pitt] has paid no meaningful child support since separation.‚Äù  In the documents, Jolie‚Äôs lawyer added, ‚ÄúGiven the informal arrangements around the payment of the children‚Äôs expenses have not been regularly sustained by [Pitt] for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file an RFO [request for a court order] for the establishment of a retroactive child support order.‚Äù  In a filing the next day, Pitt‚Äôs lawyer Lance Spiegel slammed Jolie‚Äôs filing as ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù and ‚Äúa thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.‚Äù The filing state that Pitt ‚Äúloaned‚Äù Jolie $8 million to help her purchase her current home and has contributed over $1.3 million ‚Äúfor the benefit of [Jolie] and the minor children.‚Äù  Jolie‚Äôs lawyer shot back in a statement calling Pitt‚Äôs filing ‚Äúa blatant attempt to obfuscate the truth and distract from the fact that he has not fully met his legal obligations to support the children.‚Äù Bley DeJean said Jolie is paying interest on the $8 million loan: ‚ÄúA loan is not, however, child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate.‚Äù"
"One of the Internet‚Äôs favorite coupled might have called it quits again.  Chris Evans, 36, and Jenny Slate, 35, are not together anymore after rekindling their relationship late last year, according to a new profile of the Infinity War actor in the New York Times. As Evans recalls a book he read while they were still together, the article states that the two called it off recently. Evans says he learned to listen more while reading Rebecca Solnit‚Äôs The Mother of All Questions: ‚ÄúThe hardest thing to reconcile is that just because you have good intentions, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs your time to have a voice,‚Äù the actor, now starring in Lobby Hero on Broadway, told the Times.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The on-again, off-again couple was spotted together again in October 2017 after first breaking up in February following nearly a year of dating. Flirty Twitter exchanges between the two soon followed, sending fans into a frenzy about the possibility of their reunion.  Emma McIntyre/Getty  The rumors gained more steam when Evans posted several videos of his beloved dog appearing to sing along to music while a woman who sounded suspiciously like Slate laughed in the background. PEOPLE later confirmed the rekindling in late November.  Slate spent Christmas with Evans and his family. She posed with his brother Scott for a selfie he posted to Instagram. ‚ÄúChristmas with my favorite Jew!‚Äù the look-alike Evans brother captioned the shot.  The former couple met on the set of their drama Gifted in 2016, where sources told PEOPLE their connection was undeniable. When they weren‚Äôt busy filming, Evans and Slate would spend much of their free time hanging out together.  Slate gushed about Evans on the The Secret Life of Pets‚Äò red carpet, telling Entertainment Tonight, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of like I got my dream seventh grade boyfriend. We didn‚Äôt know each other growing up, but we grew up about a half hour away from each other. We‚Äôve been friends for a while.‚Äù  She later opened up about her split from the superhero movie star, saying differences in their careers eventually led to their breakup.  ‚ÄúChris is a very, very famous person,‚Äù she said in a interview with Vulture. ‚ÄúFor him to go to a restaurant is totally different than for me to go. I sit in my window and I say ‚ÄòHi‚Äô to people on the street. I have more freedom because I‚Äôm not Captain America. I‚Äôm mostly a cartoon.‚Äù  Slate said the attention eventually became too much.  ‚ÄúThis is what I needed to do to feel normal,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúTo be alone.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Jenny Slate On What Makes ‚ÄúGifted‚Äù Costar Chris Evans Such A ‚ÄúBeautiful‚Äù Human Being  But in the months following their original split, Evans and Slate remained amicable and supportive, often praising each other in the press.  ‚ÄúWe all love each other so much, and it‚Äôs a real, real love,‚Äù Slate told PEOPLE while promoting their film Gifted. ‚ÄúI mean, I have gone on and on about how beautiful Chris is. He is, inside and out.‚Äù  Evans echoed her comments, saying she was his ‚Äúfavorite human.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the best. I‚Äôve never ever ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does,‚Äù Evans told PEOPLE of Slate. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll give you one sentence and there‚Äôs no fat to it. You‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòYou just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.‚Äô  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like an art form talking with her, because the visuals associated with her expression are just so colorful,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs so vulnerable, so honest, so interested in other people more than herself, she‚Äôs incredibly compassionate, there‚Äôs just nothing to not love about her.‚Äù"

"Melanie Martinez Rape Accuser Says 'I Had This Sick Need to Protect Her': Report  Former Dresses singer Timothy Heller says that a month before she accused former The Voice star Melanie Martinez of rape, Martinez attempted to get in touch with her after a long period of silence.  In an interview with Newsweek, Heller claims that after she tweeted last month asking ""what if I have my own story of abuse but I'm scared to ruin the persons life and I still love them in a fucked up way and the public really loves them and most probably wouldn't believe me,"" Martinez tried to contact her 20 minutes later, after the two hadn't spoke in more than a year.  On Monday (Dec. 4), Heller posted a lengthy tweet in which she described a night during which she ""repeatedly said no"" to advances from her ""best friend"" Martinez, claiming she kept the secret for years and alleging that Martinez performed oral sex on her and used a sex toy without her consent. Martinez adamantly denied the claims, saying she was ""horrified and saddened"" by them and that ""she never said no to what we chose to do together.""  After Heller's original tweet, she told the magazine, ""I started sobbing when I saw [Melanie] was calling me, and I blocked her."" She also claimed that Martinez attempted to call Heller's boyfriend and texted him several times seeking to get in touch with Heller, whom Martinez said she had recently dreamed about. ""Her fans see her as this angel who understands them,"" Heller told Newsweek. ""So I assumed no one was going to take me seriously if I explained what she did. I've been reading all the #metoo stories, and though I'm obviously in support of the people coming forward, I wasn't sure if my story of being assaulted fit.""  It is one of the rare allegations of sexual assault by a woman in the midst of the torrent of stories surrounding prominent men in entertainment, business, politics and sports assaulting or harassing women that launched the #MeToo movement, which Time Magazine named its Person of the Year on Wednesday (Dec. 6).  Heller's claims about what she says happened that night in June 2015 -- including pictures she gave the magazine of her in a mask and furry handcuffs that were allegedly taken on the night in question -- include her admission of being wracked with guilt for years as the pair remained friends.  ""I think I was invalidating my own experience for so long because she's not a man,"" Heller said. ""Plus, she was my friend, and I sat with what happened in silence because I didn't want to be malicious."" A representative for Martinez told Newsweek that ""Melanie stands by her statement.""

"Melissa Etheridge has revealed that smoking cannabis with her children has brought them closer together.  The GRAMMY-winning singer became an activist for the drug after using it for medicinal purposes during her battle with cancer and says her kids now refer to it as medicine.    WATCH: Melissa Etheridge Says Brad Pitt Was Almost Her Sperm Donor  ‚ÄúMy children have a very clear understanding of cannabis,‚Äù the 55-year-old mom of four told Yahoo during an interview for their Weed & the American Family report. ‚ÄúWhen I hold it without shame or confusion they can understand it as simple as if I was pointing to a bottle of Percocet and saying, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs mama‚Äôs medicine.‚Äô You take the naughtiness out of it and it‚Äôs not something kids then run to.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI have smoked with my older two,‚Äù Etheridge continued, referring to 20-year-old daughter Bailey and 18-year-old son Beckett. ‚ÄúIt was funny at first and then they realized it‚Äôs a very natural end-of-the-day and it brings you closer, so I‚Äôd much rather have a smoke with my grown kids than a drink.‚Äù  The Kansas native underwent a lumpectomy and several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004.

Going through chemotherapy is suffering‚Ä¶ and cannabis helps so many parts of just that. That‚Äôs just the beginning of what it does medicinally.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI smoked to be normal. I smoked to be out of pain. I smoked to lighten myself because you‚Äôre poisoning yourself with chemo,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt about being high. It was just [getting] to a place where I could communicate with my children, to where I could get up, to where I could eat, where I didn‚Äôt have to go to the hospital. It was great medicine.‚Äù  Despite beating cancer, Etheridge added that she still gets high today to maintain the ‚Äúhealth benefits,‚Äù like easing stress and sleeping better.

"From Miley Cyrus' secret marriage to her pregnancy, there have been a lot of rumours in the air lately about the Malibu hitmaker's personal life.  Recently her Thanksgiving tweet sparked speculation about the songstress being pregnant which apparently drove her so crazy that she took to Twitter to retweet the picture and addressed all the rumours.  Also read: Miley Cyrus pregnant? Malibu singer has a hilarious response to the baby bump rumours  She wrote: ""RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a s‚Äî ton of tufurkey.""  Even after that, Hollywood Life reported that the Wrecking Ball singer wanted to get 'pregnant ASAP' with fiance Liam Hemsworth.  An insider reportedly told the website, ""Miley's totally ready to start a family with Liam.""  Although she did not appreciate the speculations that she was pregnant ""because it is something she has thought about for a while that hasn't happened yet.""  RUDE!!! Not pregnant just eating a shit ton of tufurkey pic.twitter.com/rjNjquxvLb ‚Äî Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) November 23, 2017  The source reiterated: ""She wants to be married, she wants to start a family but Liam isn't 100% ready for all of that just yet. She can only hint about it so much.""  Hence those kinds of baby bump rumours have driven her crazy ""because she would want nothing more than for those rumours to be true.""  ""Miley is just waiting for Liam to be just as ready as she has become. She knows that it is all in time but if it was up to her, she would love to speed up the process,"" the source also told Hollywood LIfe.  But as usual, Gossip Cop exposed the truth behind all these speculations and claimed that the insider's statement is entirely fabricated.  Given that, the Hollywood Life's report looks contrary to its own insider's statements. While Miley herself rubbished all the pregnancy rumours on Twitter during Thanksgiving, how is it possible that she told the insider about her willingness to get pregnant?  Besides this, the songstress clarified in a radio interview a few months back that she is in no rush to have kids. Talking to 104.3 Myfm, Cyrus said, ""No, I love pigs more than kids, to be honest.""  Thus it is quite clear that the story about Cyrus wanting to ""get pregnant ASAP"" and ""have babies with Hemsworth"" is entirely made up."

"A dispute in Angela Merkel‚Äôs coalition over migration policy has swiftly escalated into one of the biggest tests of her chancellorship.The clash has opened a rift at the heart of the German leader‚Äôs own camp, between her Christian Democratic Union and its CSU Bavarian sister party. How the conflict is resolved will determine the chancellor‚Äôs fate, possibly as soon as Monday.Horst Seehofer, Merkel‚Äôs interior minister and the leader of Bavaria‚Äôs Christian Social Union, wants to force through a plan to send back migrants who have already registered for asylum in other European Union states. Merkel rejects the proposal as offloading the burden on neighboring states, and says it would kill efforts to forge a bloc-wide response to the continent‚Äôs struggle with migration.Bavarian lawmakers are fully behind Seehofer, while Merkel has wrested a majority in the larger CDU group for her position. The standoff is a replay of tensions that have periodically bubbled up between Merkel and Seehofer since the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016, only this time there is no obvious way out. Following are some potential scenarios:CompromiseThe two parties have managed to eke out a compromise after each previous conflict. Overtures could begin on Monday, when the CSU party executive meets in Munich. Seehofer could give Merkel what she wants: two weeks to forge bilateral accords with countries such as Italy and Greece to return registered asylum seekers.Merkel could also give ground, as for example the newspaper Die Welt advocates. She could put forward another proposal to assuage the CSU that may yield a compromise. But if she caves in to the Bavarian demands as they stand, it would be an unprecedented loss of authority that would render her a lame duck leader.No CompromiseIn the absence of a face-saving deal, the real clash could come as early as Monday. That‚Äôs when Seehofer has indicated he will start to implement his plan at the border. As interior minister, Seehofer has the authority to do so, even in the face of Merkel‚Äôs rejection. The only way for the chancellor to forestall a unilateral decision by her minister would be to fire him. Sacking her top Bavarian ally would be a historic first. If it happens, it‚Äôs hard to see how the coalition continues.Even if it doesn‚Äôt come to that and Merkel is given until the June 28-29 EU summit to reach bilateral agreements, it may only delayed the clash, since there is no guarantee she can win deals with other other EU states. She has already called the prospect ambitious.Confidence voteFor a coalition to dissolve, the German constitution says the lower house of parliament, or Bundestag, has to call a vote of confidence. The CDU and CSU, with a combined 246 seats, and the SPD with 153, have a majority of 44 seats in the 709-seat Bundestag. Such a move would be the ultimate measure of support for Merkel as chancellor. Even if she is unable to rely on the CSU, or indeed all of her own party‚Äôs votes, on the specific issue of her stand on migration Merkel might be able to attract the support of the Greens, which have 67 seats.Germany‚Äôs Sueddeutsche Zeitung said in an opinion piece on Friday that Merkel should short-circuit the squabbling and put her parliamentary support to the test with a confidence vote. It‚Äôs a tactic that her predecessor, Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder, used to force through military support for the U.S. after the Sept. 11 attacks. He used it again in 2005 amid a party rebellion, and this time lost the confidence motion, forcing new elections.Merkel resignsShould the chancellor view her authority as irretrievably compromised, she could throw in the towel. The Bundestag would be forced to elect a new chancellor to replace her, most likely from the CDU. Unless the governing parties agree to continue the coalition under a new leader, Germany‚Äôs ninth chancellor since World War II would serve in a caretaker capacity through to a new election.Split on the rightThe CDU and the CSU are sister parties, with a joint parliamentary caucus and electoral program. Think of the CSU as the center-right‚Äôs Bavarian chapter ‚Äî the CDU operates in all of Germany‚Äôs 16 states except Bavaria.So a breach would be drastic, but not unprecedented. In 1976, CSU chairman Franz-Josef Strauss called off the joint caucus, but the split was short-lived. For the Bavarians, going it alone would theoretically open a path for the CDU to campaign in Bavaria, weakening the CSU‚Äôs position.A hoax tweet that rattled markets on Friday raised exactly that possibility. It presented a fake quote from the CDU state premier of Hesse, Volker Bouffier, as saying his party should prepare to set up a Bavarian chapter for the next national election. Merkel‚Äôs chief spokesman, Steffen Seibert, quickly stepped in to say the report was invented. ‚ÄúWe should all remain calm,‚Äù he said."

"Beyonce is just one of many celebrities who has admitted to being demon possessed and worshipping Satan. Be aware of what your kids are being exposed to.  ‚ÄúRight before I performed for the BET awards, I raised my hands up and it was the first time I felt something else come into me. I knew that was going to be my coming out night at the award show,‚Äù explained Beyonce in a recent interview. Satan works overtime to deceive the masses through none other than the entertainment industry. Satanism is being promoted by hundreds of celebrities and we are blindly idolizing the very people who are Satan worshippers.  When speaking at a music festival in Wisconsin last week, a man standing in the back of the packed room, loudly confirmed my information regarding Beyonce and her demonic influence over our kids. I mean, who would just randomly YouTube search ‚Äúcelebrities who practice Satanism.‚Äù Well, I did and I was shocked. Check it out for yourself. At first, I just wanted to confirm what I had seen first hand while working in LA and verify some of the stories friends shared with me who had the 411 from the inside. What I discovered was shocking!  Back to Beyonce. This chick is one of the most powerful influencers of adults and children alike. However, many people don‚Äôt know that she has admitted countless times that she is possessed by a spirit guide she named Sasha Fierce. In Russian the meaning of Sasha is: defender of man. Deceptive, isn‚Äôt it? What she is promoting is deceiving man not defending man. Satan is the great deceiver. He twists the truth and she is one of his instruments.  What does possession mean? Possession is when a spirit or soul hijacks a body and takes over the function and control of that body. The person possessed is not consciously present and will usually have no memory of the actions that happened while possessed. Beyonce talks about how she‚Äôs a relatively reserved young woman but says, ‚ÄúWhen I see videos of myself on stage and on TV, I am like, ‚ÄòWho is that girl? That‚Äôs not me!‚Äô I wouldn‚Äôt dare do that!‚Äù Beyonce is possessed.  Click here to see a photo that shows Beyonce wearing the emblem of a goat‚Äôs head during a photo shoot. This symbol is used exclusively for Satanic worship. Millions of fans are actually worshipping Satan when engaging in her music, watching her videos and trying to copy her ‚Äúdance moves‚Äù without even knowing it! The reason this is so alarming is because music has been scientifically proven to be one of the most powerful medians for communicating a message. It bypasses the brain and goes straight to our emotions, thought-process, subconscious and the heart of the listener. Satan is using the music industry to lead many people astray. Here‚Äôs a clip that‚Äôs a must see to give you an in-depth look at Beyonce and how her demonic possession affects her millions of followers.  Sadly, Beyonce is just one of many celebrities who is working on behalf of Satan and encouraging us to follow and practice Luciferianism. It‚Äôs that serious. Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Fergie, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Kanye West and Jay-Z are some of the other more well known, professing Satanists. For example, Fergie states, ‚ÄúThe Devil comes and soon my conscious and unconscious might start to brawl as this cunning Demon takes me as it‚Äôs voodoo doll.‚Äù Katy Perry explains, ‚ÄúI swear I wanted to be the Amy Grant of music, but it didn‚Äôt work out and so I sold my soul to the devil.‚Äù Nicki Minaj has said in the past that there‚Äôs a crazy boy named Roman who lives in her and says things she would never say. She has told him to leave but he resists and she said he‚Äôs in her for a reason. Justin Timberlake boastfully announced, ‚ÄúAll you people out there, Satan is my master. He has always been.‚Äù As you can see, many stars tell their fans just who they follow. Are we listening?  Do we catch celeb‚Äôs words when they describe their involvement with the occult? We need to be educated on what role models we should follow so that we are not pulled into the devastating, deceitful destruction of demonic possession. Satan is attacking the masses with his lies and using the entertainment industry to carry out his plan. The word ‚Äúindustry‚Äô means ‚Äúproduction and construction.‚Äù What is Hollywood producing as a result of millions of fans idolizing celebrities who are promoting this message? The more research you do in regards to Satanism in the industry, the more your eyes will be opened and the dots will start to connect.

"Meghan Markle is counting the days until her royal wedding to Prince Harry. But even as Meghan joyfully prepares for her walk down the aisle and marriage to royalty, Markle reportedly is finding herself haunted by ghosts from her past. Ranging from Meghan‚Äôs former best friend, Ninaki Priddy, who allegedly betrayed Markle in a shocking way to jealous relatives and a possibly hostile ex-husband, those ‚Äúghosts‚Äù are darkening Meghan‚Äôs wedding plans, according to E! News.  Meghan Markle Reportedly Is Faced With Individuals From Her Past Who Want To Wreck Her Wedding Plans  While most of the people in Markle‚Äôs life are thrilled about her marriage to Prince Harry, some of those ‚Äúghosts‚Äù from her past are tormenting her, according to the publication.  ‚ÄúA few [individuals] seem hell-bent on trying to ruin the big [wedding] day. The torment Meghan Markle must be going through, thanks to a best friend from hell, jealous family members and a former spouse, is unimaginable.‚Äù  With a mere six weeks until Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the public Markle is focused on tasks such as getting fitted for her wedding dress, taking royal etiquette classes, and figuring out the politically charged seating arrangements. But it‚Äôs the behind-the-scenes antics that are reportedly the most intriguing.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, May 19, in St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Featured image credit: Chris Jackson Getty Images  Meghan Markle‚Äôs Brand Gets Makeover: Two ‚ÄúGhosts‚Äù Get Killed Off  As an actress, Meghan was viewed as a brand with a distinctive voice, including her popular social media accounts. But as Markle prepares to become a duchess and member of the royal family, she is having to reinvent that brand. Meghan was fond of her social media platforms, sources told E! News, but now she must follow in Prince William‚Äôs, Kate Middleton‚Äôs, and Prince Harry‚Äôs footsteps. The trio use the same @KensingtonRoyal handle, and Markle‚Äôs appearances with Harry now are reported on Twitter with that handle.  null  Initially, Meghan‚Äôs social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook, were among the ghosts who haunted her. But those platforms, as well as her lifestyle website, the Tig, have been deleted.  In addition to social media, Markle‚Äôs style when she dated Prince Harry first reflected her old life. Short skirts, ripped jeans, and low necklines turned heads as she stepped out with a member of royalty. But just as she deleted her social media, Meghan has laid to rest her actress-era fashion.  ‚ÄúGone [are Meghan Markle‚Äôs] short skirts and low necklines from her red-carpet days, replaced by more demure outfits of pants, skirts with longer hemlines, tailored coats and even a fashion-forward beret. Meghan 2.0 now looks every inch a style-conscious-yet-sensibly attired member of the regal elite.‚Äù  While Markle was able to deal with the end of her personal social media accounts, her website, and her former fashion in private, the people who form the ‚Äúghosts‚Äù in her life haven‚Äôt stopped haunting her.  Meghan Markle‚Äôs ‚ÄúGhosts‚Äù Include People Who Betrayed Her  E! News pointed to Meghan‚Äôs half-sister, Samantha, as an example of one of the ghosts from Markle‚Äôs past who she can‚Äôt escape. Markle‚Äôs relative alleged that Markle had always wanted to be a princess, labeling her a social climber. Samantha even began penning a memoir titled The Diary of Princess Pushy‚Äôs Sister and announced plans for a reality show.  One of the most hurtful ‚Äúghosts‚Äù from Meghan‚Äôs past, and the most shocking, however, is her former best friend, Ninaki Priddy. For 30 years, the two were like sisters, from growing up together to Priddy‚Äôs role as the maid of honor at Markle‚Äôs wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engleson.  null  But as invitations to Meghan and Harry‚Äôs wedding are issued, Markle has been wounded by Ninaki spilling her secrets, pointed out E! News.  ‚ÄúWhen [Meghan Markle‚Äôs former best friend] Ninaki started to spill stories of their intimate conversations, it was a betrayal that must have felt like a stab in the heart to Meghan. Ninaki [claims] she is a calculating manipulator who was so obsessed with Princess Diana she made it her aim to marry Di‚Äôs son.‚Äù  Markle‚Äôs concerns about what might be revealed or alleged about her past don‚Äôt end with the betrayal from her best friend, however. Biographer Andrew Morton, known for infuriating the Palace with his book Diana: Her True Story, is set to publish his version of Meghan‚Äôs life. Morton reportedly will portray Markle as intensely ambitious, driven to become a member of the royal family.  There‚Äôs one person in Meghan‚Äôs life who supports her, and that‚Äôs her future husband, Prince Harry. Harry previously said that when he found the right woman, he would ‚Äúensure we get to the point where we are actually comfortable with each other before the massive invasion into her privacy.‚Äù With that ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù currently taking place, it‚Äôs thought that Prince Harry will stand by Meghan no matter what those ghosts claim about his beloved bride."
"The Kardashian baby daddy drama continues, except this time, the spotlight is on Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. (Move over, Khlo√© Kardashian and Tristan Thompson!) With Kanye's behavior growing more erratic by the second, no one can blame the mother-of-three for wanting a divorce.  According to Life & Style, Kim believes Kanye is too focused on his career right now, and she's ""done with her husband always putting himself first."" When the rapper announced he'll be dropping two new albums in June, it was the final straw.  Trouble is, Kim and Kanye have kids in the mix ‚Äî North, 4, Saint, 2, and Chicago, three months ‚Äî who make the situation all the more complicated. ‚ÄúKim is pissed that [Kanye will] be off traveling the world promoting his music while she‚Äôs left at home feeling like a single mom with three small kids,‚Äù the source explained. ‚ÄúShe accuses Kanye of being selfish."" Kanye definitely doesn't see things that way. In fact, he ‚Äúdisagrees and blames ‚Äòselfish‚Äô Kim for their issues,‚Äù noted the source. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt believe Kim is always there for him.‚Äù  Despite the 40-year-old's reservations about his wife's support, Kim has been on Team Kanye since the beginning ‚Äî making his claims all the more outlandish. Even after her sisters Kylie, Khlo√©, and Kourtney all unfollowed Kanye on Twitter for his Trump-loving rant, she defended him.  In fact, Kim didn't just risk family, but friends too! John Legend and wife Chrissy Teigen both unfollowed Kanye in the wake of his ""MAGA"" tweets, Pedestrian reports, as did Harry Styles, Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, Teyana Taylor, and Travis Scott.  While the KKW Beauty mogul was willing to put up with Kanye's antics then, she's had enough. With two young children and an infant at home, it's just gotten out of hand.

Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she‚Äôs just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn‚Äôt work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore ‚Äúgroped her in the alley behind the‚Äù church they both attended in 1957. ‚ÄúIt was the most horrifying moment of my life,‚Äù she told MSNBC‚Äôs Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. ‚ÄúRoy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,‚Äù she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.Maddow then interviewed Dourif‚Äôs parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn‚Äôt say anything until he was running for Senator because they ‚Äúfeared for their lives.‚Äù Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion ‚Äúshe‚Äù and her ‚Äúhusband‚Äù Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit‚Äôs Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that ‚ÄúDourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.‚Äù‚ÄúWhy would Barack and Michelle Obama‚Äôs housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office ‚Äì someone of the opposing party,‚Äù Johnson writes. ‚ÄúThis stinks more than Malia Obama‚Äôs dorm room after one of her reefer parties.‚ÄùWhat exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source."

On Thursday she shared a rare image with all three sons  Stone was in a striped shirt with barely any makeup on and flashing ehr toned legs as she sat in front of her lap top with a bottle of San Pellegrino water.  Her kids were surrounding her on a sofa.  The caption read, '#family ‚ù§Ô∏è.'  She has 18-year-old Roan Joseph Bronstein, who she adopted with ex-husband Phil Bronstein in 2000.

"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority (approximately 73%) of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, ‚ÄúThis is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving (Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming) and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.‚ÄùAccording to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website."

"CLOSE Among her many unforgettable qualities, Diana was known for her fabulous style. From ditching her gloves to speaking to the people through her clothing, Diana's flawless style lives on. USA TODAY  Princess Diana and her mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II in London, August 4, 1987. (Photo: Associated Press)  Princess Diana mystified and irked the British royals in life, but in death she changed them in ways that strengthened the monarchy by making them seem a bit more like her ‚Äî warm, approachable, human.  Exhibit A has to be the 2012 London Olympics when Queen Elizabeth II, then 86 and celebrating 60 years on her throne, participated in an extraordinary video skit to open the Games, featuring James Bond actor Daniel Craig and ""the queen"" as a Bond girl skydiving from a helicopter into Olympic Stadium. Mouths dropped, especially those of her grandchildren, as tens of thousands of Brits watching cheered and roared.  RELATED: Princess Diana remembered  ""Would she have done that cameo had it not been for Diana, all those years earlier, who emboldened them to do things in a fresh way and be more relatable?"" says American biographer Sally Bedell Smith, who's written best-sellers about both the queen and Diana.  The Princess of Wales' feelings about the Windsors were as mercurial as she was, toggling between awe and admiration to rage and despair during the years she was the desperately unhappy wife of Prince Charles and the daughter-in-law of the queen and Prince Philip.  As the queen herself said at the time, there were ""lessons to be drawn"" from the story of Diana, and these are now apparent, says British PR consultant and royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams.  ""Diana's more approachable, endearing and emotional style, her conviction that the royal family had no heart, the way she appealed to the public in (interviews), all this was unique but had real impact,"" Fitzwilliams says. ""It is a tribute to the resilience of the Windsors that they have made certain changes yet kept the monarchy's mystique.""  Despite her troubles with her in-laws, Diana said she wanted to bolster the ties between the monarchy and the people; she was, after all, the mother of a future king.  ""It's vital the monarchy keeps in touch with the people ‚Äî it's what I try to do,"" she told former Times editor Peter Stothard at a lunch in 1994, according to Phil Dampier's new collection of Diana quotes, Diana: I'm Going to Be Me.  British royal reporter and broadcaster Katie Nicholl, author of several royal biographies, says Diana broke the royal mold: She did and said things considered ""very un-royal"" that had a positive effect, especially in the way her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, were raised to be aware of life beyond palace walls.  ""As they have said in recent interviews they are the princes and the men they are today largely because of the way Diana raised them and the things that she exposed them to from an early age,"" Nicholl says.  Queen Elizabeth and other members of Britain's royal family bow their heads as Princess Diana's casket moves slowly past the gates of Buckingham Palace in London, Sept. 6, 1997. (Photo: Associated Press/BBC TV)  ""There is a rawness in these interviews, an openness that Diana would have approved,"" says Fitzwilliams. ""The princes are following directly in her footsteps.""  Diana campaigned for ""politically sensitive"" causes not previously connected to the royals, including AIDS, homelessness and landmines ‚Äî issues that touched real people and people who had no voice, Nicholl says.  ""Ultimately, this was all very positive for the royal family even though the queen and others were concerned at points that some of the issues Diana was campaigning for weren‚Äôt synonymous with what royals should be doing,"" Nicholl says. ""To the people, Diana was seen as in touch. She was a princess, but one who wasn‚Äôt afraid to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in and that did the royal family a huge amount of good.""  No doubt the 1,000-year-old British monarchy already knew a thing or two about keeping in touch with the people (to do otherwise risked execution and exile over the centuries), but it was Diana ‚Äî equal parts beguiling and bewildering ‚Äî whose shocking death helped remind them of this fundamental survival skill.  After she was killed in a Paris car crash in 1997, an almost-as-shocking tsunami of grief washed over Britain and the world, and nearly swamped the royals.  Tucked away at their usual summer bastion of Balmoral, their vast estate in Scotland, they were unprepared for the unprecedented reaction back in London: The hysteria, the headlines, the 24/7 media coverage. Also, the persistent importuning, from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and many others, that the queen return, respond to the public grief, and put on a semi-royal funeral for Diana.  ""The queen has an unchanging style which has been perfection; the death of Diana was the one occasion where reliance on tradition and precedent were not appropriate and Blair was fortunately there to advise her,"" Fitzwilliams says.  The queen met all the demands and more, after first balking. She rose to the occasion with a stirring live speech to the nation (a rarity) before the funeral in which she paid tribute to Diana.  Queen Elizabeth II speaks from Buckingham Palace to pay tribute to Princess Diana, on Sept. 5, 1997. (Photo: AP)  In deed and metaphor, the queen bowed her head to Diana's coffin, and it was sincere. Diana was no longer a member of the royal family, and she had behaved in obnoxious ways in the years before her 1996 divorce, but she was still the mother of the queen's young grandsons; this was a gesture no loving grandmother would withhold.  ""Diana had a real effect on the monarchy,"" Smith says. ""They realized, in their practical and efficient way, that Diana had touched people in a special way, in accessibility and informality. They commissioned research, polling, focus groups, and they responded, not in a dramatic way, but in an incremental way. The queen did things a little more informally, she loosened protocol.""  Immediately, public opinion about the queen and her family swung back to its previous high levels. In the years since Diana's death, the royals have been more popular than ever, culminating in extravagant displays of affection for the queen during her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and for her 90th birthday in 2016.  Even Prince Charles and his second wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the longtime mistress Diana blamed for her marital woes, are popular (if only because they are not as widely despised as they were in 1997).  Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry inspect floral tributes to Princess Diana outside Kensington Palace, Sept. 5, 1997. (Photo: DAVID BRAUCHLI, Associated Press)  Victoria Arbiter, daughter of the queen's former press secretary and a royal commentator for CNN in New York, says ""little glimpses of Diana"" are everywhere apparent today. But she also gives credit to the queen.  ""You can't take anything away from the queen and her ability to adapt and evolve and meet the needs of the people at any one time,"" Arbiter says. ""Diana should be credited with many changes, one of which is the royal family is very much more hands on. They're getting much more involved on a visceral level as a result of Diana.""  Society's expectations have changed, Arbiter says. The deference and formality associated with the royals are disappearing. You might not see the queen sipping tea in a Starbucks, but she's no longer quite as remote as she once was.  ""It's been slow, gradual change,"" Arbiter says, ""and Diana was definitely the trigger.""      .  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xNwLFP"

"So Kim Kardashian is set to appear on Ellen today, which means she‚Äôll be the first family member to finally let everyone know what‚Äôs up with Khlo√© Kardashian and Tristan Thompson‚Äôs relationship. That is, if they even have one anymore.  To jog your memory, Khlo√© just gave birth to a baby girl named True and in the same week that happened, rumors of Tristan‚Äôs alleged affairs surfaced. Kim and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family had flown out to Cleveland, Ohio to be by Khlo√©‚Äôs side when she gave birth, and Kim is graciously sharing what it‚Äôs been like ever since.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  In a sneak-peek released last week, Kim said it's not going that great for the youngest Kardashian sister.  In Kim‚Äôs interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Kim said, ""Like, I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it besides it‚Äôs just so f*cked up."" Indeed it is, Kim.  And in the full interview clip, Kim said Khlo√© is taking some time for herself and True and isn't making any hasty decisions about her and Tristan's relationship.  According to Kim, Khlo√© is currently alone in Cleveland to have time to bond with her baby and is still on the fence about whether or not she and Tristan will stay together.  ""You know, I think she‚Äôs not thinking of anything,"" Kim said. ""I think she just wants a clear head and just wants to be alone with her baby and figure that out and the family‚Äôs flown out there a few times.""  She went on to say, ""I think it must be so hard to have your heart broken and fall in love all in a day or two, all happening at the same time and I think she just needs some [space].""  Kim said her whole family is just trying to be supportive of Khlo√©.  ""We really were rooting for Khlo√©, and we still are. She's so strong and she's doing the best that she can. It's a really sad situation all over.""  The only thing she didn't talk about was if she ever liked Tristan.  When Ellen asked her about her opinion of Tristan, Kim danced around the question and threw some shade toward him.  ""I kind of made this rule with my brother, if there's a baby involved, I'm not going to talk. I'm going to keep it cute and keep it classy and not talk too bad. I'm going to try not to say anything so negative because one day True is going to see this.""  And there you have it folks, a prime example of if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.  You can watch the full interview here:"

"We all get lazy from time to time and just want to quit everything, crawl back to bed under a layer of blankets and live there until we feel better. We might feel a bit guilty but a relaxing day in bed sounds awesome. Even though it‚Äôs a luxury which few of us can afford, at least we can all fantasize about it.If you‚Äôre one of those who are in desperate need of some peace and relaxation, NASA might offer you the perfect opportunity to do so and get payed on top of it. But it may involve a bit more relaxation than you‚Äôre prepared for.NASA has put out an ad looking for people who‚Äôre willing to take part in their ‚ÄúRest Studies‚Äù ‚Äì a study which will require participant to spend 70 straight days in bed, relaxing and smoking different types of cannabis, for which they will receive a salary of 18.000 USD. During the relaxation period participants are allowed to read books, play games, Skype and smoke weed. They can do whatever they want as long as it involves staying in bed, week after week, earning a cool 1200 USD per week.So what is the exact purpose of these studies?These studies have the purpose of figuring out the best way to preserve astronauts‚Äô health and safety during periods of prolonged space travel. Complete rest and relaxation is the best way to stimulate zero gravity in space because zero gravity actually means zero weight or strain on your muscle. Additionally, they wanted to see how marijuana will affect the body in such an environment.The Rest Study is a very convenient way to examine the changes our body endures during space travel.This study is designed to achieve three core tasks:Examining how the astronauts‚Äô changing physiology in space could affect the process of certain missions.Examining if the astronauts‚Äô physiological state could affect their ability to perform in particular tasks.Preparing countermeasures to combat any impairment that these physiological conditions may impose.The study‚Äôs participants were divided into two groups: exercising and non-exercising.The exercising group will have to exercise (on a specially designed equipment to maintain the laying down position and smoke cannabis), while the non-exercising group will just have to lie down and relax completely.The entire study will last somewhere between 97 and 105, depending on whether you‚Äôre in the exercising or non-exercising group.Once the study begins, during the initial 13 days (non-exercising subjects) and 21 days (exercising subjects) you can move around the bed rest area freely, in and out of bed. But once this period ends, for the next 70 days you‚Äôll be forbidden from leaving your bed. For 70 days you‚Äôll have to lie down, with your feet up, kick back and enjoy! You‚Äôll get out of bed only for a few tests and nothing more. 70 days of complete lazing.During the study, NASA will have to conduct bone, muscle and heart tests, as well as tests of your circulatory and nervous systems, your nutritional condition, and your body‚Äôs immunity system.But is it worth it?You may not think so at first, but spending two whole months in bed can be really excruciating. At some point you may feel like you can‚Äôt take it anymore but at least you can rest assured that your efforts will help in the advancement of human space travel.This will probably be your only opportunity to say that you‚Äôve actually helped send the first astronauts to Mars by just being your lazy self and doing nothing in particular but lying flat on your back.Source:http://mysteriousearth.net"

"[This story contains spoilers from the March 14 episode of The X-Files.]    When first-time The X-Files scribe Karen Nielsen wrote Wednesday‚Äôs episode, ‚ÄúNothing Lasts Forever,‚Äù she set out to tell a character-based piece.  ‚ÄúI wanted to have some character moments with Mulder and Scully ‚Äî that was super important to me,‚Äù says Nielsen. ‚ÄúI thought it would be interesting to have Scully reflecting on her religion. My sister is very Catholic, and I‚Äôm not. So I liked the dynamic of Scully being very Catholic and Mulder not; I related to that.‚Äù    What Nielsen didn‚Äôt know at the time was that her episode would shift back one to become the penultimate episode of the season and potentially the series as a whole. Wednesday's episode revolved around a cult led by a former actress (Fiona Vroom) who was obsessed with maintaining their youth and the woman (Carlena Britch) trying to save her sister from them. The installment also could be the last ‚Äúmonster of the week‚Äù episode the iconic series does with its core team intact as star Gillian Anderson has said this will be her final year playing Scully.  ‚ÄúThe pressure that society puts on women to be perfect, to be beautiful is intense, because we‚Äôre such a consumerism society that we have to prey off of women‚Äôs insecurity to sell, sell, sell,‚Äù Nielsen says. The writer, who doubles as the show's script coordinator, also made sure the female characters were well-rounded and the episode also featured an inclusive cast. ‚ÄúEspecially in Hollywood, you‚Äôre a write-off after 30. That pressure is quadrupled as an actress. That was a horrible and wonderful rabbit hole to go down [in writing]: having an actress try to hold on to her youth and obtaining that.‚Äù  Nielsen credits longtime X-Files writers James Wong (who directed the hour) and Glen Morgan with being the genesis of Scully‚Äôs (Gillian Anderson) religious origin story in the episode. When Scully was younger, her brother was sick, and her mother asked the family to pray for him. The first few days, a young Scully asked for a puppy ‚Ä¶ which she got shortly after her brother recovered. ‚ÄúIt was the architecture of Jim and Glen knowing this character for so long, and seeing the things that she should be coming from,‚Äù she says, calling the duo her ‚Äúdream team‚Äù collaborators. Morgan was also the one to suggest they have a visual callback to the mysterious coin Scully‚Äôs mother had on her when she died last season.    The hour ended up being pivotal for Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully, whose relationship has grown increasingly murky. The dynamic duo‚Äôs partnership was always complicated during the original run of the series: after years of closeness, they slept together in season seven ‚Äî a move that appeared to be responsible for the conception of Scully‚Äôs son, William ‚Äî but due to outside forces (and Duchovny‚Äôs increased absence from the franchise) they were never properly a couple. The second feature film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, found the two living together, away from the FBI life, but there was obvious tension in the relationship as they worked the movie‚Äôs case; they were broken up by the 2016 television revival.    However, they appeared to potentially reconcile early in season 11, when they slept together and arranged a couple of dates. But in true Mulder and Scully fashion, they simply seemed to be existing together (they still reside in separate homes, for instance) versus actively engaging the shift in their relationship and what it could mean. But Scully took a step forward to break them out of their standstill in the final scene of the episode: when Mulder mentioned they were good together, she simply asked, ‚ÄúAre we together?‚Äù  ‚ÄúTo me it was about having a honest moment,‚Äù Nielsen says, acknowledging the open conversation between the two was part of why the episode moved directly pre-finale. ‚ÄúWe need to be real, we need to be honest, we need to start saying something. They‚Äôve gone through so many emotional things with their son, coming back to the X-Files and things not going so smoothly. And [also] coming back to the relationship, because they were away from it for so long; to see where that relationship sits now. It‚Äôs exhausting not being honest when you get to that stage. To be true to these characters, you had to have a true moment. It‚Äôs what those characters needed.‚Äù    But what was it that Scully needs? ""I don‚Äôt know if any God is listening, but I am standing right here,‚Äù Mulder told his partner. ‚ÄúAnd I am listening. Right besides you, all ears. That‚Äôs my choice.‚Äù She paused, looked around at the empty church, before whispering her hope for her future in his ear. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not my 4-year-old self looking for a miracle,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my leap of faith forward. And I‚Äôd like to do it together.‚Äù    The audience is in the dark about Scully‚Äôs request during the hour, intentionally. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs between Mulder and Scully,‚Äù Nielsen notes. ‚ÄúHaving those private moments, it‚Äôs important for any couple.‚Äù And it won‚Äôt be revealed going forward, either: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll always be between Mulder and Scully,‚Äù she says with a laugh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for anyone else. That was their moment.‚Äù (Chalk it up to another unsolved mystery, a la the duo‚Äôs Christmas gifts to each other.)  With that exact sentiment remaining unspoken, it was essential the tone be handled correctly while filming the scene. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just [them] being honest with each other,‚Äù Nielsen notes. ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre used to having that playful banter with someone, when they‚Äôre suddenly honest, it takes you aback. It‚Äôs, ‚ÄòOh, we‚Äôre actually going to have a real conversation about this.‚Äô Sometimes those things can be scary. It was something from the heart, which can be terrifying for her to do, especially given how much she‚Äôs been through and how much her heart has been broken, especially this season. That‚Äôs where I wanted it to come from: her vulnerability.‚Äù    And, yes, in Nielsen‚Äôs mind, Mulder and Scully are meant to be together. ‚ÄúI feel like they‚Äôre each other‚Äôs soulmates and they know it,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey get in each other‚Äôs way, they‚Äôre complicated, they both have reasons why they hold back. They both have reasons they need each other. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve had such an up and down relationship: it‚Äôs not as easy as saying, ‚ÄòI like you, let‚Äôs make this work.‚Äô The world they live in just doesn‚Äôt allow for that. Their love for each other, mind and body, makes them go, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs nobody else.‚Äô There are so many moments you see them, they look at each other, and just from a look, [it‚Äôs] no one will get me like you do. That‚Äôs my personal take on it: they‚Äôre soulmates.‚Äù    What do you think Scully whispered to Mulder?"

Because Harry always had what Nicholl describes as ""a flirtatious relationship"" with Sheppard, when Bonas learned of his closeness on the dance floor, she was not happy.

"Miles Teller Busted for Public Drunkenness Uncooperative with Cops  Miles Teller Arrested For Being Drunk and Uncooperative In Public (UPDATE)  EXCLUSIVE  2:08 PM PT -- Miles just tweeted, ""Went down to SD to see my buddy before he deployed. I wasn't arrested I was detained bc there was no evidence to charge me with a crime.""  For the record, the San Diego PD tells TMZ Miles was arrested and booked for misdemeanor public intoxication. They also took a mug shot. Miles Teller was arrested early Sunday morning after he was literally falling down drunk and refusing to cooperate with cops ... law enforcement sources tell TMZ.  Teller was partying with a group of guys in San Diego when an officer noticed the actor was having trouble standing on the sidewalk. We're told the cop walked up to Miles and started questioning him, but he quickly became uncooperative.  Our sources say that's when Teller lost his balance and almost fell into a traffic lane. The cop cuffed him, and Miles had trouble standing in one spot.  Now the turning point. San Diego offers a detox program where cops will take someone who is drunk to a center run by volunteers. The center has cots where someone can stay for 4 hours and sleep it off. The cop offered to take Miles there but we're told he refused.  At that point Miles could have been arrested, but cops still took him to the detox center ... hoping he'd cooperate. That didn't happen. We're told he refused to follow directions so the staff rejected him.  At that point, Miles was arrested for being drunk in public ... a misdemeanor. He was in jail for around 4 hours and he was released without bail.  Miles' rep had no comment."
"Angelina Jolie abruptly split from her partner of 12 years and husband of two, Brad Pitt, in September 2016. But their divorce still isn‚Äôt final, a new report says, because they still haven‚Äôt agreed to terms about their six children.  According to E! News, Jolie is resentful of Pitt for essentially locking her down in Los Angeles, because he‚Äôs chosen a film that will be shot in LA to be near his kids. Jolie, meanwhile, had planned on taking them to Europe. ‚ÄúBrad is opposed to that and is blocking it from happening. Brad will be filming in LA for the summer and wants to see the kids on his regular custody schedule,‚Äù a source told E.  He currently sees his children - Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh, Knox and Vivienne - a few times a week. Jolie, according to the report, is ‚Äòfurious‚Äô at the situation.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split in September 2016. (Shutterstock)  Jolie recently took Shiloh and Zahara to Jordan to visit a refugee camp in January, and later travelled to Paris with all of her children. ‚ÄúAngelina has been in London and is free to travel for shorter periods of time,‚Äù the source says. ‚ÄúBrad isn‚Äôt opposed to that. But she can‚Äôt leave with the kids for several months.‚Äù  Jolie had initially filed for sole physical custody of the kids, but in November 2016, Pitt filed for joint custody. By December, they‚Äôd reached a temporary agreement, after the FBI concluded their investigation of Pitt regarding an alleged incident of child abuse on a private plane. No charges were filed and Pitt was cleared.  Pitt opened up about the custody battle in his 2017 interview to GQ Style, his first since the split. ‚ÄúI was really on my back and chained to a system when Child Services was called,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd you know, after that, we‚Äôve been able to work together to sort this out. We‚Äôre both doing our best. I heard one lawyer say, ‚ÄòNo one wins in court‚Äîit‚Äôs just a matter of who gets hurt worse.‚Äô And it seems to be true, you spend a year just focused on building a case to prove your point and why you‚Äôre right and why they‚Äôre wrong, and it‚Äôs just an investment in vitriolic hatred.

(Shutterstock)  An US Weekly report goes on to say that Pitt is committed to staying in LA, even if that means staying away from his rumoured new girlfriend, the MIT professor, Neri Oxman. ‚ÄúBrad and Neri are still very much in each other‚Äôs lives, although not as much as he would like,‚Äù the US Weekly source said.  But without even a draft of the settlement being written by either side, it just goes to show ‚Äòhow at odds they continue to be,‚Äô the report continued.

"The gloves are off in the marital breakup of the decade. But who will win in the battle of celebrity leaks and lawyers?  Celebrity marriages have not had the best of times: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale. Middle-aged, male A-list stars are taking a beating. The situation has become so dire that the celebrity news channel E! Online is predicting the ‚ÄúEnd of an era for celebrity idol worship‚Äù.  But nothing quite prepared the celebrity world for the totalling of Brangelina.  Brad Pitt: FBI evaluating whether to investigate airplane incident Read more  From alimony to palimony to the rise of the pay-as-you-go marriage (the wage-earning party to pay into a separation fund throughout the length of the marriage so there are no surprises when or if the marriage eventually ends), Hollywood couples have long been pioneers when it comes to marital innovation, but the end of Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie has left a nuclear pall over Hollywood-land.  The normally loquacious PR Howard Bragman, known for containing tabloid feeding frenzies, offered no advice. ‚ÄúJust sad to me,‚Äù he wrote in an email.  In some instances, say managers, both parties should be able to walk away with their careers and box-office potential enhanced. But the Brangelina marriage crack-up already looks to be heading in the opposite direction, with reports of the FBI looking into ‚Äúan incident‚Äù on a flight the Pitt-Jolie family took on 14 September.  Pitt was reportedly ‚Äúlawyering up‚Äù after the FBI announced the agency ‚Äúis continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThis one is going to end with both of them having their images bruised,‚Äù predicts Allison Hope Weiner, a lawyer and journalist who has covered Hollywood for more than 15 years.  What is clear is that in this confrontation nothing is left to chance and the leaks that appear in the media ‚Äì usually via celebrity website TMZ‚Äôs host Harvey Levin, are deliberate and highly strategised.  ‚ÄúThey know that if they can get to Harvey first, and he publishes first, they can set the tone because the rest of the media consider TMZ a first-party source,‚Äù says one talent manager familiar with the frontlines of Hollywood scandal. ‚ÄúAngelina needs some kind of leverage to go for full custody for the kids.  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre wise enough you can see that websites like TMZ granulate ‚Äì serialise ‚Äì everything because it creates entertainment product for them to carry it. They‚Äôre making money off it.‚Äù  It‚Äôs no mystery, then, that barely a week into the split, the children are already the focus of the battle. On Thursday, the LA Times received a leak that Pitt was subject to the FBI investigation over the private plane trip back from France last week.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Image conscious: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the Cannes film festival in 2011.

He allegedly went wild, screaming at the kids.‚Äù  The website continued: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre told the plane landed at an airport around 8pm, and witnesses say Pitt continued his rant on the tarmac, and even tried leaving in one of the fuel trucks.‚Äù  In her divorce filing, Jolie listed the couple‚Äôs date of separation as the following day, 15 September, and it was later suggested that the LA county department of children and family services had looked into the incident.

One source told People magazine: ‚ÄúHe was appealing to her to do this quietly ‚Äì not to save the marriage but to consider the wellbeing of the children ‚Äì and it was ignored. He is just wrecked by this.  ‚ÄúHe was willing to do anything, change any habit, change any lifestyle, to do what had to be done to make this work,‚Äù adds the source. ‚ÄúAnd by ‚Äòmake this work‚Äô that means doing what has to be done to make even a split one that is amicable and in the best interests of the children.‚Äù  Jolie‚Äôs demands are already clear: The actor, 41, has asked for physical custody of the children and is requesting that Pitt be granted visiting rights, while Pitt wants shared custody, sources have said.  While none of that is entirely new or surprising, the PR battle over both stars‚Äô parenting skills is well under way, according to Weiner: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs managed so the client looks like a loving and caring parent. In some cases, nannies are instructed to walk in the back so parents can be photographed with their children and look as if they have no professional help with parenting.  ‚ÄúMoreover, paparazzi are informed when to catch parents out at the park with their children, providing an opportunity for the star to be photographed ‚Äòspending quality time‚Äô with his or her child.‚Äù  How Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt defined the 21st-century fame machine Read more  Could a celebrity divorce ever be harnessed to engineer a career lift? The answer, in at least one high-profile case, seems to be yes.  When Gwen Stefani divorced British rocker Gavin Rossdale for allegedly cheating with the nanny ‚Äì ‚Äúthe two of us have come to the mutual decision that we will no longer be partners in marriage; we remain partners in parenthood‚Äù ‚Äì Stefani came swinging back with a new relationship (Blake Shelton), and heartbreak-linked new material: a duet (Go Ahead and Break My Heart); a hit album (This is What Truth Feels Like) and a TV show (The Voice).  ‚ÄúThey may say that but it‚Äôs a racket among the lawyers,‚Äù says the talent manager. ‚ÄúThey want to inflame and create issues that extend the back-and-forth. Then it becomes a media thing ‚Äì a crisis ‚Äì and that becomes licence to bill.‚Äù And that‚Äôs before the whole thing gets wrapped up in a non-disclosure agreement.  When Depp and Heard‚Äôs marriage hit the rocks earlier this year amid reports of domestic violence, a settlement was quickly agreed before any further damage could be inflicted.  The couple concluded their relationship with this, somewhat enigmatic, statement: ‚ÄúOur relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love. Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future.‚Äù  THE PRICE OF SEPARATION  Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren  The couple divorced in 2010 following reports of Woods‚Äô serial infidelity. Details of the financial settlement have not been disclosed, but US media reports suggest the former Mrs Woods will receive more than $100m (¬£77m).  Steven Spielberg and Amy Irving  Reports suggest the film director paid $100m to Irving after they divorced in 1989. The couple had been married for three and a half years but cited career-related pressures as a reason for separating.  Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise  The couple, pictured, adopted a son and daughter, Connor Antony and Isabella, and were married for 11 years, separating in 2001. Cruise cited irreconcilable differences. It was not disclosed how the couple divided their ¬£214m joint fortune.  Mel Gibson and Robyn Gibson  After their 30-year marriage ended in 2011, Robyn, the mother of Mel‚Äôs seven children, was reported to have been awarded half of her ex-husband‚Äôs estimated $850m fortune."

"I do ‚Äî again! Teen Mom OG‚Äòs Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer got married for the second time on Saturday, November 18.  E! News reports that the pair, who secretly tied the knot in May, a day before Edwards headed to rehab, wed in a church ceremony that Standifer told E! was their ‚Äúoriginal, intended‚Äù celebration.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been in the works since the day we got engaged,‚Äù she told E! ‚ÄúIt was never just decided upon ‚Äî we knew from day one this was going to be it.‚Äù  Standifer said that Edwards‚Äô ex-fiance, Maci Bookout, had been invited to the wedding and the pair‚Äôs son, Bentley, 9, didn‚Äôt know that she and his dad were already married.  Edwards proposed to Standifer over a romantic meal in December 2016, which was shown in an episode of Teen Mom OG that aired earlier this year.  As Us Weekly previously reported, Edwards checked into rehab earlier this year to address substance abuse issues.  His decision to seek treatment came after Bookout, with whom he shares son Bentley, 8, tearfully spoke about her ex‚Äôs problems on the MTV hit and accused him of driving while under the influence of Xanax.

"Splash; Cindy Ord/Getty; Robert Kamau/GC Images (2); Felipe Ramales/Splash  Selena Gomez is a master in the art of quick changing.  The songstress, 24, was spotted on Monday on her busy promo circuit in New York. As she swapped outfits from one appearance to the next, her style staples of the day were her Louis Vuitton‚Äôs crystal flower sandals that featured black suede baby goat leather and a transparent heel. You too can get the same shoe as Selena for $1,060.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  For her first look, Gomez styled her Vuitton heels with a Jacquemus mini dress in the early morning. The navy ensemble was loose at the top and fitted through the body with a large button accenting the crossover V-neckline and split skirt. With a price tag of $696, the star‚Äôs outfit cost nearly $2,000.  Next, the 13 Reasons Why executive producer stopped by the Elvis Duran and The Morning Show. Wearing the same LV sandals, Gomez changed into a bright orange dress from Christopher Kane‚Äôs pre-Fall 2017 collection. Her colorful look featured a deep V-neckline and a side slit.  After, Gomez visited the SiriusXM studios for her Morning Mash Up interview wearing a black slip dress over a white tunic. Her Victor Glemaud resort ensemble was styled with Tura Inc sunglasses and her go-to Vuitton heels.  Then, SelGo had all eyes on her when she opted for a matching neon pink-and-white printed polo shirt and pants set from Miu Miu‚Äôs Fall 2017 ready-to-wear collection. She changed up her hairstyle by gathering her beach waves into a high ponytail, and she gave her Louis Vuitton heels a fashion break by changing into silver Gianvito Rossi heels.

"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about ""the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love.""  Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation‚Äôs favorite couples ‚Äî but it didn't always look that way.  Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.  But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.  Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question.  ""We were always going to get married,"" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. ""Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn‚Äôt have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.‚Äù  Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise.  Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise ‚Äî and they now have their first child on the way.  When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. ‚ÄúWe were sort of in that wedding glow,‚Äù Bass explains. ‚ÄúIt felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.‚Äù  Waddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass‚Äô face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. ‚ÄúHis jaw was on the floor.‚Äù  Bass added, ‚ÄúIt felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.‚Äù The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings.  Other Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. ""Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,"" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass‚Äô groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: ‚ÄúWells was like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care man. I‚Äôm there.‚Äô‚Äù  The morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.  Looking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show ‚Äî and potentially the series ‚Äî would ever resume. ‚ÄúI felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,"" he now says. ""I trust everyone that‚Äôs a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.""  In the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set ‚Äî something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode. Though new Paradise drinking rules were later put in place, the newlyweds said alcohol wasn't an issue during their wedding. ‚ÄúNo one drank that much. It wasn‚Äôt like a crazy affair,‚Äù Bass says, while Waddell says she didn't even have time to drink at her own wedding.  ""Paradise is a great parody of life,"" says Bass. ""I love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love. It‚Äôs very American. We‚Äôre ridiculous, but it‚Äôs awesome.‚Äù  And he still disagrees that Paradise is ""a drunk hookup show,"" something both Harrison and ABC reality chief Robert Mills echoed to THR earlier this week. ""There‚Äôs sexuality on the show,"" Bass says. ""The parts that are shown are sort of the fun, wild parts, but there‚Äôs so much more that happens, like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other. People don‚Äôt really drink that much. The show was more about relationships and discovering yourself.‚Äù  Waddell adds, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.‚Äù  Waddell, now 13.5 weeks pregnant, says their baby is the size of a peach. The pair, who are due around Valentine's Day, are calling it a ""love child"" and will find out the sex of the baby in a week or so.  ""We‚Äôre out of our minds with excitement,"" she says.  ""The Bachelor producers are some of our greatest friends now,"" she adds. ""We were texting them pictures of our ultrasound, that‚Äôs how close we‚Äôve become.""  During the wedding, all three of Bass' sons from a previous relationship spoke. Waddell described 16-year-old son Nathan's speech as being incredible because he called Carly ""Mom."" ""He‚Äôs an introvert so him getting up at all and saying the things he did meant so much to us,"" she says.  As for the rest of the Paradise season ‚Äî which returns to ""being Paradise"" after addressing the shutdown in the first two weeks ‚Äî Bass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch.  ""There‚Äôs going to be another couple this season that takes our place,"" says Bass, whose advice to making it as a couple is to ignore the negativity. ""You can‚Äôt let the haters affect your relationship,"" he adds. ""There‚Äôs no way it doesn‚Äôt affect you, but you have to work through that together. It‚Äôs crazy how one person‚Äôs tweet affects you.""  Waddell adds, ""Just be real and be honest."""

"Edie Falco‚Äôs role as Leslie Abramson in Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders reunited her with Dick Wolf, and she told One Chicago Center about it.  Edie Falco is starring as hotshot defense attorney Leslie Abramson in Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, but it‚Äôs not her first time working with Dick Wolf.  Before Falco was an award-winning actress, one of her first TV roles was recurring on the original Law & Order as another defense attorney (and Jack McCoy‚Äôs ex-girlfriend), Sally Bell.  One Chicago Center spoke to Edie Falco about Menendez Murders bringing her back into the Dick Wolf world, and if she approached playing a lawyer any differently the second time around.  ‚ÄúIt was not intentional,‚Äù she told us of being cast in another Wolf project almost 20 years later. ‚ÄúI was looking for a good script, something interesting to do, and this came along. I liked the fact that I knew the people at the helm.‚Äù  Did she attack the role of Leslie Abramson with any significant differences to how she played the equally fierce Sally Bell? ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that I did,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think so much is in the script, and all you have to do is what‚Äôs in front of you.  ‚ÄúA lot of the testimony was taken straight from Abramson‚Äôs words, so you approach it [the] way that you would any role.‚Äù  The series may be called Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, but the show makes Abramson the star. It‚Äôs Falco who is front and center on the show‚Äôs poster, and the story is partly told through her eyes as she finds out about Lyle and Erik Menendez and then becomes the lead attorney in their trials.  Of course, Edie Falco has been the main draw of a program before; she was critically acclaimed for the title role in Showtime‚Äôs Nurse Jackie, too. She‚Äôs used to being the headliner, so she didn‚Äôt mind getting top billing in this particular project.  ‚ÄúI figure if they want me to do it and I agree to do it,‚Äù she explained, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all capable, and I understand the motivation behind the person that I‚Äôm playing. It‚Äôs become less of a deal.‚Äù  With everything that she‚Äôs done over her career, from Nurse Jackie to Broadway, from Law & Order to The Sopranos, Edie Falco has been there and done that in the TV world. She‚Äôs one of the small screen‚Äôs best actresses, so we asked her to tell us what about being Leslie Abramson in Menendez Murders could possibly challenge her.  ‚Äú[There was] a great deal of frustration, just over the actual story,‚Äù she reflected. ‚ÄúI do hope at the end, viewers will understand that there were so many things involved in this trial‚Äîand I venture to guess other trials as well‚Äîthat were politically based.  ‚ÄúIt was the climate in Los Angeles at the time, it was relationships between lawyers, and all this stuff that had nothing to do with these guys and their parents.‚Äù  Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on NBC.

"    Mariah Carey is famous for loving ""moments."" It could be a ""butterfly moment."" Or a ""hot tub moment."" But right now, it's a ""Las Vegas moment."" The sexy superstar just wrapped up Mariah: #1 to Infinity, her first-ever Vegas residency, where she performed all 18 of her #1 hits at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Fans who didn't catch Mimi's Vegas show will get another chance in December when she returns to the Colosseum for All I Want for Christmas Is You, a holiday concert series that, yes, will be sure to feature that iconic, titular hit. (For those unable to head out West for the holidays, you can also catch Mariah's Christmas shows at New York's Beacon Theatre.) On top of these performances, the pop star has her hands in two film projects: the first, All I Want For Christmas Is You, is an animated movie based on her holiday hit and out this November and the second, The Star, is another animated feature out the same month in which she wrote the film's titular song.  At our cover shoot, Carey's outfits channel the glittery, over-the-top extravagance of her new city. ""I think this is kind of a fairy princess moment,"" she says of one sparkly gold tulle gown. ""And I took off my shoes to be very Cinderella,"" she adds. ""Although I don't know that Cinderella went as plunging in the neckline."" So, an adult, glamorous Cinderella? ""Adult, glamorous...yeah, I guess so,"" she says. ""If I have to be an adult, sure.""  Click through for more Mariah photos from our 'Las Vegas' cover story!  What made you decide to do a show in Las Vegas?  Well, I just thought it would be something in between albums, because now I'm working on a new album and new singles, and I just thought it was a great place to be able to be. Because I have twins [Moroccan and Monroe], who just turned six...to have them be in one place for a period of time rather than, like, touring for all that time [is great]. They go with me.  And they say 'What happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas.' Do you have any of those kinds of moments that you really cut loose?  Well, it's hard because sometimes it's like two nights on back to back so I don't really [go out] -- it's not like, 'WOO HOO,' let's, like, go wild on the Las Vegas strip, but occasionally some of my friends and I will drive around, have fun, go to different places, do whatever.  If your friend was going to Las Vegas for the first time, besides seeing your wonderful show, are there other things you would suggest they do?  Well, if they have kids they should take them to the dentist that [my kids] go to, because it's a kids' dentist and they have all these games there...I'm sitting here waiting to go to the dentist, like, 'Let me get to Vegas so I can get to the dentist!'  I can't imagine many people would recommend going to Las Vegas for a dentist.  Darling, you've got to take care of your teeth.  Your fans love your many 'Mariah moments.' You know, like your 'butterfly moment' or an 'off-the-shoulder moment' is something you're always loving. Are there any moments you're particularly feeling these days?  I like good moments. There's often moments that I'm like, 'This is not a good moment.' But usually when I'm like, 'It's a moment,' I really mean it in a good way.  What about a diva moment?  I've never had a diva moment.  No?  No...Actually, I have had diva moments, and then people can't handle it. I guess it's a little intense, because I come from a true diva: My mother is an opera singer. And that's a real diva, you know -- Juilliard diva. And so other people that are like, 'I'm a diva,' it's like, 'Honey, you don't know what a diva is, you didn't grow up with my mom.' [Laughs] And I mean it as a compliment, or I wouldn't be the person I am without experiencing that. And so when people hear me say, like, 'Dahling da da da da' and talk that way, it's kinda like I'm channeling my mother. Not that she says 'dahling' all the time, but like that voice is... it's like I inadvertently do it, and I don't do it to be disrespectful, I just do it and it just happens and it's like, [in diva voice] 'I don't even know why.'  So you can't fight it; it's in your blood.  I can't fight it, no.  If you could start a rumor about yourself, what would it be?  Start a rumor about myself? Oh, do we have to do that? Can't we just leave it to all the other people who love to start rumors? I don't know. I've already said that I insist on having puppies everywhere I go, which would be great! Like, that would be great, no?  You're such a huge star, but can you remember the last time you were starstruck?  There's always people who I admire and when I see them [I get starstruck]. The last time I saw Prince, he came to my dressing room. I had said I wanted to go visit him to say hello because we've met before.When he was living we had had lots of conversations, and he helped me through certain moments that were not easy. I don't want to get too depressing, but I was having a conversation with Prince and then I looked around the room and I noticed that everyone in the room was looking up and staring like they couldn't believe he was standing there. But I would always be a little bit starstruck [when] I [saw] Michael Jackson as well.  Finally, in three words, tell me what it's like to be Mariah Carey.  Pshh, three words!?  You can do more, but that's the challenge.  [Laughs] So many things...Sooo. Many. Things. Those are my three words.

"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Jamie Lee Curtis says in a new interview that she'd happily reprise her iconic role as Laurie Strode in a sequel to 2018's Halloween revival, if director David Gordon Green returns. There's no question that the newest Halloween, which wipes the slate clean with all other sequels in the long-running franchise, is a rousing success. Strong critical reviews gave way to a massive debut at the box office, one of the highest ever in October.  Green's Halloween certainly benefited from a return to the same basic premise as John Carpenter's classic original, trading in decades of increasingly messy follow-ups for a direct line to the Michael Myers that terrified audiences in the first place. The director went back to basics for this one as he avoided the supernatural and went for a renewed focus on the psychological. Clearly, Curtis was happy with the job that Green did, as are theatergoers. And despite the film's commercial success, that's likely not on the legendary actress' radar as far as whether she'd do another Halloween. But the director is.  Related: Halloween's 5 Timelines Explained (And Which Movies You MUST See)  As she explained simply in a new interview with Empire Magazine Australia (via Bloody Disgusting), Curtis says she'd be in for another Halloween sequel if Green takes the helm once again. It's certainly possible, since the original plan from Blumhouse was to shoot two Halloween sequels back-to-back. Producers ultimately decided that making two films at once was too risky. But now, it sure looks like another film will follow, with or without Green behind the cameras. ""If David Gordon Green called me up and said let‚Äôs do another Halloween, I would do another Halloween,"" Curtis said.  Producer Malek Akkad expounded upon Blumhouse's decision to keep it to one sequel in a recent interview. Essentially, he found it too ambitious to shoot two Halloween films without knowing how the first one would be received. Well, the next Halloween is reportedly already in motion, but the latest report suggests that Green and co-writer Danny McBride wouldn't be on board for it. That could change, but if Jason Blum is determined to pull a Paranormal Activity and crank out the next sequel in time for Halloween 2019, he'll need a decision from the director pretty quickly.  It's also possible that money talks. Halloween is already becoming one of Blumhouse's highest-grossing films after just one weekend, and it's doing so on a typically tight Blumhouse budget. At over $90 million domestically already, the film has a good chance to ultimately blow by Paranormal Activity ($107.9 million) and Paranormal Activity 3 ($104 million) and settle in at No. 3 behind the studio's crown jewels, Get Out and Split. Green may not necessarily need the money, but it might be hard for the director to turn away from that kind of financial success, especially when he was originally planning to do at least two films anyway.  Still, based on Curtis' comment in her interview, she may not be interested in another appearance as Laurie Strode unless Green is back. It's hard to blame her; Green had established himself as a formidable cinematic storyteller with Stronger, and showed off his horror chops to thrilling effect with Halloween. He and Curtis certainly make a fine duo, but 2018's Halloween may ultimately be the only time they team up.

"It has been seven years since Jennifer Aniston and John Mayer called it quits.  But according to Andy Cohen, the iciness between the actress, 47, and the singer, 39, still hasn't thawed.

"Just when you think literally no stone has been left unturned when it comes to Kylie Jenner 's reported pregnancy , another headline or five emerges. Today's, featuring a theory from her fans that's made some serious waves since it broke, is a big one. According to Twitter, Kylie hasn't been MIA lately because she's hiding a baby bump‚Äîinstead, fans believe she's been keeping out of the spotlight because she already had the baby. (Yep, you read that right.)  Of course, let's remember that Kylie in no way is obligated to give us an explanation: It's completely up to her if and when she's comfortable sharing her own news. But Kylie is a public figure, and Twitter exists. Remember how on Monday everyone was super bummed when the Kardashian family's Christmas card did not, as many hoped, confirm Jenner's rumored pregnancy? And then some very dedicated fans unearthed a couple blurry photos that appear to show her with a baby bump‚Äîdated from all the way back to September?  Now twitterers are saying that, based on the size of her supposed bump in those photos from three months ago (which, BTW, is in no way ""proof"" of anything ), the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sister must have had her baby by now. Another, auxiliary, theory: Jenner is for sure going to announce the birth on New Year's Eve, so we won't have to wait too much longer. And there's yet another theory about the Christmas card reveal.

"Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have moved on in their professional lives since they got separated last year but rumours about their personal lives keep swirling on the internet. A recent report claims that the A-list Hollywood actress is upset about the thought of her estranged husband dating another woman and keeps track of him through their common friends.  ""Angelina's hyper-aware of what Brad's up to, she's always trying to keep tabs on him. They still have friends in common and she quizzes them for info. She knows Brad's ready to start dating again,"" a source told Hollywood Life.  The report by the entertainment website claims that the 42-year-old Salt actress ""hates the idea"" of Pitt moving on in his life ""emotionally"". ""It's a hard pill for her to swallow and that's got her wanting to do the same. She's very competitive and hates the idea of him beating her to the punch. Plus it drives her crazy that he's emotionally moved on since she really hasn't.""  The actress is currently focussing on her family and was often spotted going out with her six children. Pitt, on the other hand, is having a busy filming schedule and is reportedly ready to date again. Recently, he has been linked with Ella Purnell, a British actress who is 32 years younger than him.  ""Right now Angelina's still not started dating but she has been getting closer to pulling the trigger. Hearing Brad is looking to date again made her feel motivated to find someone too. Even though her mind really isn't in that space she hates the idea of 'losing' to him. She's started forcing herself to open her eyes and look around and a few guys have caught her eye,"" the Hollywood Life source claimed."

"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva  NORRISTOWN, Pa. ‚Äî Bill Cosby, who once embodied the idealized American father on a wildly popular sitcom, was convicted of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that the famed comedian drugged and assaulted them.  The jury found Cosby, 80, guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from his other accusers in the courtroom.  The verdict was one of the first major courtroom victories for the #MeToo movement, which has exposed sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond.  Upon the reading of the first guilty verdict, several of Cosby's accusers sobbed and shook with joy. Cosby's head was bent slightly, eyes shut.  Although Cosby has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, testified that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004.  Constand maintained her composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.  Cosby lashed out at prosecutors as they asked Judge Steven O'Neill to revoke his bail, suggesting that he was a flight risk.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele noted Cosby's wealth and said he had a plane.  ""He doesn't have a plane, you asshole! I'm sick of it, you asshole!"" Cosby exclaimed.  Cosby faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count. He remains free on bail until sentencing. But he is unlikely to spend much time in jail.  O'Neill said that because of Cosby's age and his medical condition ‚Äî his eyesight is poor ‚Äî ""I am not going to simply lock him up."" Cosby has to surrender his passport and must remain in his nearby home, the judge said.  Lili Bernard, an accuser who once appeared as a guest on ""The Cosby Show,"" the groundbreaking 1980s sitcom that introduced an upper-middle-class black family to American viewers, let out a wail as the verdict was read. She began to cry, and court personnel escorted her from the courtroom.  ""I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,"" she told reporters through tears outside the courthouse.  Cosby's attorneys said in brief remarks that they would ""very strongly"" appeal the verdict. Cosby's first trial ended in a mistrial in June.  ""We are very disappointed by the verdict,"" Tom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, said outside the courthouse. ""We don't think Mr. Cosby's guilty of anything, and the fight is not over.""  Steele lauded Constand and the other accusers for their bravery in standing up to Cosby over the years.  ""The most important person in this is Andrea Constand ‚Äî 14 years later, it may be easy to forget that she was the first courageous person that stood up in public,"" Steele said during a news conference. Constand stood next to the prosecutors, her hands folded in front of her, but she didn't speak.  ""Her quiet courage and her actions through this have helped victims stand up,"" Steele said. ""I hope and I pray that our actions have shown that we will stand up with those victims.""  Janice Baker-Kinney, who testified that Cosby gave her Quaaludes and sexually assaulted her, told MSNBC after the verdict that ""the relief is overwhelming.""  ""I'm shaking with relief, and I can't stop sobbing,"" she said.  Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents several of Cosby's accusers, praised the verdict while the women stood behind her, shoulder to shoulder, their arms around one another.  ""I truly hope that his long list of victims will now be able to find some kind of peace,"" she told reporters.  The decision came Thursday afternoon on the second day of deliberations. Earlier, the judge read back part of the testimony of the defense's star witness, who said Constand once said she could frame a ""high-profile person.""  The jury was also read back Cosby's testimony in a deposition he gave in 2005 after Constand filed a civil suit against him. In it, the comedian admitted giving a woman Quaaludes to have sex with her.  Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million in 2006 to settle the civil case.  The verdict was the dramatic culmination of an 18-year case that spanned two criminal trials and multiple police investigations. Afterward, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Notre Dame both announced that they were rescinding honorary degrees they had bestowed on Cosby, while Temple University, where Cosby received his bachelor's degree in 1971 and where he was a trustee for more than 30 years, said the conviction ""provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect"" to an honorary doctorate it gave him in 1991.  Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden portrayed Cosby as a sexual predator who used his TV image as a man of wholesome values to target women he believed he could silence. Prosecutors called five other women who alleged that Cosby also sexually assaulted them in a manner similar to the way he assaulted Constand.  ""He preyed on Andrea Constand the same way he preyed on all those five women,"" Feden said.  Last month, O'Neill ruled that the additional accusers could testify so the prosecution could try to establish that the assault on Constand fit a pattern or that Cosby knew what would happen when he drugged Constand.  Attorneys for Cosby asked pointed questions about the accusers' histories of drug abuse, criminal backgrounds, personal relationships and sex lives.  Defense attorneys were especially hard on Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel.  Mesereau asked Dickinson whether she had spread false rumors about being pregnant with Sylvester Stallone's child. She said the remark was an honest mistake.  Bill Cosby arrives at court for deliberations on Thursday. Brendan McDermid / Reuters  ""I had sex with two men that month. He wasn't the only contender,"" she said, garnering smiles from the jury.  Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss described Dickinson in closing arguments as a ""failed starlet"" and ""an aged-out model.""  ""It sounds like she has slept with every single guy on the planet,"" Bliss said. ""Is Ms. Dickinson really the moral beacon that women's movements want?""  The defense also suggested that Constand and the other accusers were making false accusations in the hope of gaining fame or fortune.  They repeatedly pointed to the $3.4 million payout that Constand received from Cosby in 2006. And they highlighted Allred's proposal in 2014 to set aside a $100 million fund for victims of Cosby if he was unwilling to waive the statute of limitations to allow his accusers to confront him in court.  Some of the questions and arguments drew scorn from observers in the courtroom.  Bernard, who sat in the courtroom for much of the trial, called the defense's closing argument highly offensive.  ""It was based solely on rape myths, on victim blaming, on victim shaming and on a character assassination of really credible witnesses, of very righteous victims, of victims that were clearly telling the truth,"" Bernard told reporters as the jury deliberated Wednesday.  ""It was just a display of utter misogyny and buffoonery, and you know, I'm just, like, 'Wow, how low can they go?' "" she said.  The #MeToo movement was a cloud over the defense's closing arguments Tuesday, with Bliss telling jurors that they shouldn't allow it to influence their decision.  ""Don't get me wrong ‚Äî bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,"" Bliss said. ""We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality.  ""But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,"" she added.  Meredith Mandell and Adam Reiss reported from Norristown. Daniella Silva reported from New York."

"Khlo√© Kardashian has put Tristan Thompson‚Äòs cheating scandal behind her ‚Äî but the drama is about to unfold on this season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Calling into On Air with Ryan Seacrest on Thursday, Kim Kardashian West revealed that some of the aftermath will be documented on season 15, which premieres Sunday. (Khlo√©, 33, and Thompson, 27, welcomed their first child together, daughter True, on April 12 ‚Äî just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.)  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to give too much away, because we genuinely had those conversations and sometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren‚Äôt,‚Äù said Kim, 37. ‚ÄúIt was more maybe when Khlo√© wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do.‚Äù  Kim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.  ‚ÄúIt was definitely new territory for us when you have a new baby coming into the world,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think ultimately, we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there‚Äôs a baby, you know?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHer motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy,‚Äù she added of Khlo√© standing by Thompson. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôll support that.‚Äù  Reflecting on Khlo√© going into labor in Cleveland while the rest of the family was in Los Angeles, Kim said her sister wanted to keep the news under wraps.  ‚Äú[Khlo√©] didn‚Äôt want anyone to know she was in labor so my mom just left and got on a plane,‚Äù said Kim. ‚ÄúThen me and my other sisters get on another plane and we were like, ‚ÄòThis is so stupid, we all need to be together and go through this!‚Äô And it was so much drama getting there. You‚Äôll see it all ‚Äî season 15. ‚Ä¶ This season, honestly, it‚Äôs one of our best. It‚Äôs so crazy. And I‚Äôve seen crazy.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khlo√© Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal  Kim has been most outspoken member of the family about the cheating scandal, previously calling it ‚Äúso f‚Äîed up,‚Äù which resulted in Thompson blocking her on Instagram. They‚Äôve since smoothed things over, and Thompson officially unblocked her after she playfully teased him about it while they were celebrating Khlo√©‚Äôs birthday together in June.  Though Khlo√©‚Äôs decision to reconcile with Thompson initially didn‚Äôt go over well with her famous family, a source told PEOPLE at the time that they ‚Äúrespect her decision.‚Äù  ‚ÄúEveryone knows Khlo√© plans on staying with Tristan, so things have been civil so far,‚Äù said the source. ‚ÄúThey still have opinions about Tristan‚Äôs bad behavior, of course, but no one wants to upset Khlo√©.‚Äù  RELATED: Tristan Thompson Says Khlo√© Kardashian Knows His iPhone Passcode in Wake of Cheating Scandal  Last week, another source told PEOPLE that it‚Äôs been a ‚Äútough learning lesson‚Äù for Thompson.  ‚ÄúThe whole family had to deal with the public‚Äôs perception of him and his relationship with Khlo√© changing dramatically,‚Äù said the source. ‚ÄúHe also doesn‚Äôt fully ‚Äòget‚Äô that she‚Äôs been through this before [with ex-husband Lamar Odom], except that this time there‚Äôs a child involved.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhen he got with Khlo√©, he tried to adapt to the best of his ability but he struggled with being part of such a high-profile family and crossed lines he shouldn‚Äôt have,‚Äù added the source. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt expecting such major backlash from the public and it‚Äôs been a lot for him to handle.‚Äù  Nevertheless, the source said everyone just wants the best for the couple and their baby girl.  ‚ÄúThe whole family is there to support both him and Khlo√© through everything,‚Äù said the source. ‚ÄúBut they also need his commitment in order for the relationship to succeed. All of them are really hoping for a positive outcome for Khlo√©‚Äôs sake.‚Äù  Season 15 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!"

"(CNN) In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem ""came to stomp"" Tuesday night, calling the President everything from ""Donald the b----"" to a ""racist grandpa"" in an explosive 4.5-minute freestyle rap.  The Detroit rapper challenged his fans at the BET Hip Hop Awards to ""decide who you like more"" -- Eminem or Trump. He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle ""Campaign Speech"" and in Big Sean's ""No Favors.""  ""And any fan of mine who's a supporter of his, I'm drawing in the sand a line, you're either for or against, and if you can't decide who you like more and you're split on who you should stand beside, I'll do it for it for you with this. F--- you,"" he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.  A request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.  The latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called ""The Storm,"" comes as anticipation for Eminem's eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump's comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President's own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.  ""I appreciate you @Eminem,"" Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.  The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in ""Campaign Speech.""  Here are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:  1) 'A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust'  Here's the full verse: ""We better give Obama props 'cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s--- to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.""  Here, Eminem is likely referencing Trump's war of words on social media with North Korea's Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as ""little rocket man.""  2) 'Trump, when it comes to giving a s--- you're stingy as I am'  This line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.  3) 'Racism's the only thing he's Fantastic 4 cause that's how he gets his rock off, he's orange'  4) 'Cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump'  Here's the full verse: ""That's why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we're not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That's why he keeps screaming, 'Drain the swamp,' cause he's in quicksand.""  Here, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.  5) 'All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm'  ""But this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he's bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.""  Here, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.  6) 'Who's going to pay for his extravagant trips'  Full verse: ""He says he wants to lower our taxes, then who's going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?""  Last month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.  7) 'Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more'  Full verse: ""Same s--- that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that's black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.""  Here, Eminem is referring to Trump's former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.  8) 'This racist 94-year old grandpa'  This line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America's racist past.  9) 'To him, you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured'  ""He says you're spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b-------, Unless you're a POW who's tortured ... cause to him you're zero cause he don't like his war heroes captured. That's not disrespecting the military.""  Eminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military -- a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump's previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, ""I like people that weren't captured, OK?""  10) 'F--- that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s--- balled like Donald the b----'  You can check out hip-hop's strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE."
"Solange Knowles is not taking any nonsense after her sister Beyonc√© lost out on the biggest Grammy of the night, Album of the Year, to Adele.  After Adele received the award, she tweeted a link to Frank Ocean's Tumblr post, in which he accused the Grammys of ""cultural bias"".  Ocean wrote his post in response to an interview with Grammy Awards producers Ken Ehrlich and writer David Wild, in which they claimed the artist's decision to abstain from the ceremony was due to a ""faulty"" performance in the 2014 Grammys.  In his lengthy note, Ocean criticised the Grammys for giving Album of the Year to Taylor Swift's 1989 over Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly during last year's ceremony.  He said he considered performing at this year's Grammy tribute to Prince, but ""then I figured my best tribute to that man's legacy would be to continue to be myself out here and to be successful.""  ""Winning a TV award doesn‚Äôt christen me successful. It took me some time to learn that,"" he wrote.  ""Believe the people. Believe the ones who‚Äôd rather watch select performances from your program on YouTube the day after because your show puts them to sleep. Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I‚Äôm one of the best alive.""  ""And if you‚Äôre up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I‚Äôm all for it.""  Ocean didn't submit his two 2016 albums, Endless and Blonde, for consideration, explaining: ""That institution certainly has nostalgic importance. It just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.""  ‚ÄòI‚Äôd rather this be my Colin Kaepernick moment for the Grammys than sit there in the audience.‚Äô"
"It's off--""canceled,"" if you will. After two seasons and 20 episodes, the E! network on Tuesday announced they will not renew The Arrangement, one of its two scripted series, for a third season.  The fictional celebrity drama, which certainly never mined the Church of Scientology and the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for source material, aired what turned out to be its series finale on May 13. That episode, titled ""Suite Revenge,"" was--at least for a short time--regarded as the Season 2 finale. It was seen by 432,000 viewers and drew a 1.8 rating in the 18-49 demo.  ""Over two seasons, E!'s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,"" wrote an E! spokesperson in a statement to Deadline on Tuesday. ""While we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.""  The Arrangement was produced by Universal Cable Productions and starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan.  The series stylized itself as a high-stakes Hollywood love story exploring the bizarre and sinister underbelly of incredible fame. Ratings for its first season in the spring of 2017 were fruitful by cable standards, having drawn an average of 1.3 million viewers overall and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo. Most commendably, the show became the year's second-most watched new scripted cable drama with women ages 18-34.  Despite its strong start, ratings for Season 2 declined by double digits and the show reached its low point in the middle of this year's 10-episode spring run with a stretch of episodes viewed by 400,000 people or less.  ""Sad to say I got the call that #TheArrangement won't be coming back for a 3rd season,"" tweeted creator, executive producer and writer Jonathan Abrahams early Tuesday night. ""There's grieving to be sure but also gratitude for the opportunity and the experience of working with so many wonderful and talented people. Thanks for all your support, twitter peeps. Much [love].""  As of now, The Royals stands alone as E!'s only remaining scripted series; sticking out like a bearskin hat in a mob of reality programming (Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Total Bellas, Botched) and celebrity docuseries like Citizen Rose, Very Cavallari and Model Squad.  For its part, The Royals also suffered a marked downturn in ratings this year. Its fate is additionally in limbo following the December 2017 ouster of creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn over sexual harassment allegations.  While a twin-killing of scripted fare could be in the offing at the network, E! is reportedly in the early stages of developing a scripted pilot from writer Michael Patrick King called Juicy Stories.  On Tuesday night, Arrangement creator Jonathan Abrahams fielded tweets from disappointed fans of the show. In reply to a question about whether depressed ratings in Season 2 ultimately doomed the series, he wrote: ""Yes. Definitely not for the reason that other show got canceled today...""  E! is owned by NBCUniversal."

"Zendaya , queen of one-of-a-kind style and woke interviews , has the whole ""authenticity"" thing down pat. To her, the thought of not being 100 percent true to herself is cringeworthy‚Äîhence, why she was literally cringing as she revisited some of her old videos from her short stint as a vlogger.  The Spider-Man: Homecoming star posted a video in which she watched and critiqued YouTube videos created by her 14-year-old self, Elle reports . The peppy girl in the videos‚Äîwhose catchphrase is ""don't forget to smile""‚Äîis admittedly quite a bit different from the Zendaya the world is used to seeing slay on red carpets and take down trolls on Twitter .  ""When I was younger, I genuinely felt that I had to make a persona that matched Rocky, which is the character that I used to play,"" she says of the old clips, referencing her character on Disney Channel's Shake It Up.

She goes on to mock her own, totally forced body language and word choices, and she even admits that her haters back in the day may have had a point.

The 29-year-old teamed the eye-catching tee with black cropped leggings and pastel-coloured Nike trainers and accessorised with a large black handbag, which she slung across her body, and a large pair of sunglasses.  Shore looks great: Ashley Tisdale wore an electric pink vest with the words Beach Bum across the front in capital letters as she went to a salon in the West Hollywood neighbourhood of Los Angeles on Wednesday    Clutching a bottle of water and a blue notepad in one hand, she stopped on the sidewalk to check something on her smart-phone.  It's not clear what Ashley had done at the hair salon as her blonde tresses still showed a couple of inches of dark roots.  Missing from her trip was fianc√© Christopher French. The pair started dating in December 2012 and got engaged eight months later after Christopher proposed at the top of New York's Empire State Building, slipping an enormous double halo, cushion-cut diamond ring on her finger.    Although a date for their nuptials is unknown, Ashley recently had a Bachelorette party and told E! News last year: 'I have a wedding planner so that's a lot easier.'  Beachy keen: The 29-year-old teamed the vest with black cropped leggings and pastel-coloured Nike trainers    Meanwhile, both Ashley and Christopher have been busy with their careers.  Young & Hungry, the series she exec produces and stars in and he produces the music for, has been nominated for a Teen Choice award, news which she shared excitedly on Instagram.    'WHOA!!!! I produce that show! I know @wree!! Congrats to the beautiful @wree and Young and Hungry cast on the Teen Choice nominations! #GOVOTE'.  Christopher added his best wishes in a tweet, saying: 'Huge congrats to the entire @YoungandHungry team on the Teen Choice nom! Proud to be part of such an awesome group on a killer show #govote.'

The supermodel and mom of two recently announced on Instagram that she won't take her clothes off anymore for ""an empty cause.""  Lima, 36, explained that the idea struck after talking to a friend who explained that she was ""unhappy in her body.""  ""Then it made me think ... that every day in my life, I wake up thinking, how do I look? Was I going to be accepted in my job?"" Lima, who is from Brazil, wrote. ""And in that moment I realized that (the) majority of women probably wake up every morning trying to fit in a stereotype that society/social media/fashion etc., imposed.""  She added that women can't continue ""living in a world with such superficial values.""  ""It's not fair for us,"" Lima wrote. ""Beyond fair, it's physically and mentally not healthy.""  Supermodel Adriana Lima says she won't take her clothes off anymore for 'an empty cause.' She made the announcement in an Instagram post about the stereotypes and pressure women face. Getty Images  The model also wrote about the ""pressure"" she faces as a model, adding that she has her own insecurities.  Not taking her clothes off except for worthy causes appears to be Lima's way of taking a stand against the beauty standards women face. But it will be a stark change from her history with Victoria's Secret. Just last month, the lingerie giant hosted its annual fashion show in Shanghai, featuring Lima and other high-profile models, including Alessandra Ambrosio and Candice Swanepoel, strutting the runway in bright-colored lingerie separates and outrageously festive wings.  Lima wrote that it's time for her to ""make that change.""  ""It will start with me,"" she wrote. ""I refuse to embrace that. I am next to you. And I stand by you."""

"This week, in the midst of rising panic and gathering storms, some lucky paparazzi spotted the tabloid equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster.  In an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, these fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu immediately made waves. To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx‚Äôs PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they‚Äôre just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors ‚Äúone hundred percent not true.‚Äù Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve learned about society today is that they‚Äôre so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they‚Äôre so thirsty to find any story‚Ä¶ Sometimes when you read the stuff you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòWow! That‚Äôs so not true!‚Äô‚Äù Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not something I want to answer.‚Äù  Despite JamKat‚Äôs press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they‚Äôve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx‚Äôs friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx ‚Äúis very happy with [Holmes].‚Äù Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, ‚ÄúI have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen them together. He‚Äôs never told me he‚Äôs dating her.‚Äù  Still, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie‚Äôs relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston‚Äôs phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That‚Äôs because Foxx and Holmes‚Äô intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes‚Äô 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.  Long before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior‚Äîthe alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.  One of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney‚Äôs 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise‚Äôs second marriage: ‚ÄúI was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.‚Äù  According to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige‚Äîa good friend of Cruise‚Äôs‚Äîbecame suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney‚Äôs film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige‚Äôs calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, ‚Äúauditing‚Äù Cruise, and ‚Äúre-educating‚Äù the couple‚Äôs adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.  A 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, ‚ÄúThe organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: ‚ÄòWhat do you think of Tom Cruise?‚Äô‚Äù The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: ‚ÄúIn a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.‚Äù  When Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement ‚Äúspecifically about Cruise,‚Äù claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: ‚ÄúBy the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology‚Äôs Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise ‚Äòwants someone with her own power‚Äîlike Nicole.‚Äô When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.‚Äù (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast‚Äôs requests for comment prior to publication.)  By April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs couch.  According to journalist Tony Ortega, who‚Äôs covered the church since 1995, ‚ÄúKatie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.‚Äù Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress‚Äô Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, ‚ÄúJessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.‚Äù Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples‚Äô six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise‚Äôs best man at his and Holmes‚Äô 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that ‚Äúhis wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,‚Äù in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard‚Äôs belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.  As The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise‚Äôs young daughter, Suri: ‚ÄúWhen Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org‚Äîan elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a ‚Äòbillion-year contract.‚Äô‚Äù Cruise and Holmes‚Äô hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri‚Äôs relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn‚Äôt seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in ‚Äúmore than 1,381 days.‚Äù This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church‚Äôs practice of ‚Äúdisconnecting‚Äù congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.  A RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx‚Äôs secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, ‚ÄúKatie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she‚Äôs not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,‚Äù the source continued. ‚ÄúKatie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms‚Äîand got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.‚Äù  And the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes‚Äô bizarre ex."
"When it comes to fashion, no one competes with Rihanna. Heading to Indio, California to take in Coachella this weekend, she left the flower crowns and body paint at home, showing up in looks direct from the catwalk. While the star has always had fun pushing the limits of festival dressing‚Äîwho can forget last year‚Äôs epic Gucci bodysuit or the Matthew Adams Dolan deconstructed denim?‚Äîthis go round proved her most daring. Pulling out transparent Y/Project, custom Chrome Hearts, and a face-covering balaclava that rendered her almost incognito, she took style risks few others would attempt‚Äîexactly what she and Fenty creative director Jahleel Weaver were going for. ‚ÄúCoachella should always be fun and disruptive,‚Äù shared Weaver via email. ‚ÄúWe had such a moment last year with the Gucci crystal bodysuit and mask, so how do we top that?‚Äù  when u finna run outta hangers.

Case in point: the moment the balaclava turned up at Alessandro Michele‚Äôs autumn/winter 2018 Gucci show, it was destined to be worn. ‚ÄúRi and I both instantly loved it when it came down the runway,‚Äù says Weaver. ‚ÄúSo we started to think of what‚Äôs the next opportunity to wear this? The Gucci team is so great to us and such a pleasure to work with and they made it happen.‚Äù The love at first sight rule also applied to the gauzy Y/Project creation, which came with extreme UGGs that made it an outside the box choice: ‚ÄúIt was just so NOT Coachella that it made us love the idea even more.‚Äù  Advertisement  extra af. #chella18 A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 15, 2018 at 11:38am PDT  Making these unique pieces work requires styling magic and foresight, and Weaver gives credit where it‚Äôs due. ‚ÄúI have an amazing assistant Amir that really helps me stay organised and calm which allows me to just focus on all these crazy ideas,‚Äù he says. Though he‚Äôs mum on when we‚Äôll see the next jaw-dropping Rihanna outfit, their partnership ensures plenty of great fashion on the horizon. ‚ÄúWhat I love about Ri is that she‚Äôs such a non-conformist, which pushes your boundaries of creativity,‚Äù says Weaver. ‚ÄúNothing is off limits.‚Äù  This article was originally published on Vogue.com."

Although Abraham was estranged from him at the time of his death, she wrote in her book My Teenage Dream Ended that Underwood was ‚Äúmy first love, my only true love.‚Äù  Sitting down with Bethenny Frankel on her show Bethenny in 2013, Abraham said she would have married Underwood had he not died.  ‚ÄúI probably wouldn‚Äôt be where I am if I had that life,‚Äù Abraham said.  In December, the mother of one posted a video on Instagram with her daughter on the eighth anniversary of Underwood‚Äôs death.  ‚ÄúIn loving memory of Daddy Derek 12/28/2008 we love and miss you and we wanted to share this video with others who lost a loved one around the holidays,‚Äù she wrote in the caption."
"Usher performs at the Openair Frauenfeld Music Festival in Frauenfeld, Switzerland, July 6, 2017. (Photo: Nick Soland, EPA)  Usher has responded for the first time to accusations he exposed sex partners to genital herpes, filing a legal document containing a broad denial without actually specifying whether he has or had the sexually transmitted disease.  Usher's lawyers on Tuesday filed an answer to a lawsuit brought last month in Los Angeles Superior Court by Quantasia Sharpton and an unnamed man and unnamed woman who claim to have been Usher's sexual partners.  Usher is seeking to have their lawsuit dismissed, citing a ""general denial"" of its allegations and 13 more specific reasons why he claims the suit has no merit.  His reasons include legal technicalities, such as the statute of limitations, lack of standing by plaintiffs, the improper joining of plaintiffs in one suit, insufficient facts, and failure to meet legal standards.  But the singer also argues that any of his alleged conduct was ""unintentional,"" and that the plaintiffs themselves have ""unclean hands."" That's a legal doctrine meaning a plaintiff is not entitled to a remedy because the plaintiff has acted unethically or in bad faith in some way.  ""Plaintiffs are barred from recovery for alleged willful conduct by Defendant because any alleged conduct by Defendant, which is expressly denied, was unintentional,"" the singer's response says.  Usher asserted that he ""was not the cause of any alleged harm"" suffered by the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs ""assumed the risk"" of any alleged harm.  The lawsuit should be dismissed, Usher argues, ""because any harm that any plaintiff alleges to have suffered was caused in whole or in part by that plaintiff's own negligence."" He does not specify the nature of the alleged negligence.  Usher's four-page response to the Sharpton lawsuit is his first official statement about the case since Sharpton and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, announced their pursuit of the singer (full name Usher Raymond IV) for allegedly not disclosing an STD diagnosis prior to sexual contact.  California law says that individuals who know they have an STD are guilty of a misdemeanor if they do not disclose their status to partners before engaging in sexual acts.  At a press conference last month, Sharpton said she does not have herpes. But she claimed there are ""others"" who do but are too embarrassed to say so publicly.  ""I am doing this so that he does not do this to anyone else,"" she said, urging the singer to reveal his status. ""Usher, if you are negative, please say so. If you are positive, you need to warn your sex partners, so that they can make their own informed decisions.‚Äù  The Sharpton lawsuit, which does not specify how much the plaintifs are seeking in damages, asserts that Usher contracted herpes before his encounters with the plaintiffs. Bloom said those happened after 2012.  Bloom called Usher's response to the lawsuit ""a standard legal answer. We look forward to taking Usher's deposition soon and to proving our case in court,"" she told USA TODAY.  Usher's publicist has not yet responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.  CLOSE Attorney Lisa Bloom says 3 of her clients had sex with pop icon Usher. According to Bloom, her clients said Usher did not disclose he had genital herpes before having sex.

"There are thousands of religions in world that humans devote their whole lives to, but the one religion that almost everyone subscribes to? That would be coffee. Saturday, Sept. 29, is National Coffee Day, and in celebration of the most important day of the year, I‚Äôve rounded up the best caffeine-infused beauty products from Birchbox to wake you up and keep you going. Ingesting coffee does one thing for your insides, but on your skin? That‚Äôs a whole other (wonderful) story.  ‚ÄúCoffee is useful in skincare because it‚Äôs rich in antioxidants that protect the skin, as well as caffeine to help the body get rid of excess fluid,‚Äù Dr. Joshua Zeichner, Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells Elite Daily. ‚ÄúApplying caffeine topically may improve the appearance of both cellulite and undereye puffiness, and by helping constrict blood vessels, it flushes away excess fluid that accumulates which makes the fat look more prominent,‚Äù he says.  Not only is coffee an anti-inflammatory, explains Zeichner, but it can help reduce redness, while antioxidants prevent skin damage from free radicals. ‚ÄúTopically applied, caffeine may help protect against some skin cancers at the molecular level,‚Äù he says.  Check out these Birchbox faves for caffeine-infused picks that won‚Äôt have you yawning. I promise.  Courtesy of Birchbox  ORIGINS GinZing‚Ñ¢ Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer ($29.50, birchbox.com)  An oil-free moisturizer infused with panax-ginseng and coffee beans, the Origins GinZing gel will boost your skin‚Äôs radiance and hydration each morning.

Kiehl‚Äôs Eye Fuel ($22.50, birchbox.com)  Like food for your undereyes, the Kiehl‚Äôs Eye Fuel will hide all traces of a hangover or a restless night's sleep. The cooling cream contains caffeine and Vitamin B3 to instantly reduce puffiness and dark circles.  Courtesy of Birchbox  Est√©e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules ($112, birchbox.com)  Don‚Äôt be fooled by their size‚Äîthese ampoules are stronger than they appear. Each ampoule contains ChronoluxAI technology to help reduce visible irritation and soothe stressed out skin. Unlike other coffee-infused products that you slather on in the AM, Estee Lauder suggests applying this formula in the PM, after your serum and before your moisturizer.  Courtesy of Birchbox  Clarins Detox Booster ($39, birchbox.com)  This green juice for the skin helps bring your complexion back to life. Enriched with green coffee extract, a plant from tropical Africa and rich in caffeine, this booster should not be used alone‚Äîmix in 3-5 drops with your favorite moisturizer, serum or mask or foundation.  ARROW REVITALIZE Undereye Brightening Serum ($18, birchbox.com)  This undereye makeup pen not only conceals dark circles and puffiness, but the ginseng and caffeine-infused formula works to instantly soothe puffy bags. Bonus: the product comes in two shades, including light/medium and medium/deep.  Courtesy of Birchbox  JUARA Coffee & Creme Skin Smoothing Body Ritual ($58, birchbox.com)  Reinvigorate your body with this two-step skincare system, including a body scrub and body moisturizer. Infused with Indonesian coffee beans and candlenut oil, you‚Äôll forget you‚Äôre actually in your shower and not the trendy coffee shop down the street.  Courtesy of Birchbox  100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream ($26, birchbox.com)  Not only does this pick contain caffeine from coffee beans, but it also uses green tea to de-puff undereyes while increasing circulation. It‚Äôs formulated with natural and organic ingredients, like antioixdants and rosehip oil, for a gentle yet effective treatment."
"Taylor Swift is releasing a new song.  The Reputation singer served up another three-panel Instagram post on Thursday, featuring a snippet of ""Gorgeous"" -- the third release off her upcoming album, along with an announcement that the full song will be available at midnight Eastern time.  While it's hard to really tell from the short bite where the song is going (note to pop artists: snippets are evil and we hate them), what can be heard is a baby voice saying the song's title, followed by a short arpeggiated progression that almost feels like a Bleachers/LCD Soundsystem (circa ""Dance Yrself Clean"") hybrid. Check it out below.  MORE: Taylor Swift Holds First Secret 'Reputation' Listening Party in the UK  Thematically, Swift again seems to unintentionally (or... come on, probably intentionally) bring fr enemy Kanye West into the narrative. ""Gorgeous"" is the title of the second track on West's critically acclaimed My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album, which was widely seen as saving his career after the infamous 2009 VMA mic-grabbing moment. Additionally, the child's voice in the teaser could be heard as referential to the preaching little girl that kicks off West's Life of Pablo album.  ... Or maybe we're just too deep in the feud-shade conspiracy for our own good. Honestly, that's just as likely.  MORE: Taylor Swift vs. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian: The Complete Timeline of Their Rollercoaster Relationship  Either way, we are clearly in the thick of a long-awaited Swift season and could not be more pumped!

"The backlash surrounding comedian Kathy Griffin‚Äôs reviled photo shoot depicting her holding the severed head of President Trump hasn‚Äôt let down since it first exploded earlier this week.  In just the last few days she‚Äôs been dumped by CNN, Squatty Potty and several venues across the country. Even friend and ‚ÄúNew Year‚Äôs Eve Live‚Äù sidekick Anderson Cooper was quick to distance himself from his former co-host, calling her photo ‚Äúdisgusting.‚Äù Now many are asking whether the comedian can survive her self-inflicted wound ‚Äî one that‚Äôs increasingly threatening to derail her career.  ‚ÄúBeing dropped by CNN definitely hurts her visibility,‚Äù Matt Hiltzik, a New York-based communications consultant whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, Alec Baldwin and Justin Bieber, told TheWrap. ‚ÄúHer business will be fine. But her opportunities to grow beyond her core base will be limited.‚Äù  Also Read: Fox News Panel Ponders If 'Wonder Woman' Is Patriotic Enough  After widespread condemnation over her graphic photo, Griffin apologized on Tuesday, begging for forgiveness and acknowledging she ‚Äúwent too far.‚Äù But on Friday, she held an impromptu press conference with attorney Lisa Bloom, telling reporters she‚Äôs been bullied by Trump‚Äôs family while vowing to mock the president even more in the future.  But if the intent was to quash the flurry of negative headlines that have dominated the news cycle in recent days, it may have missed the mark.  ‚ÄúKathy Griffin claims ‚Äòconspiracy‚Äô at mad, looping press conference,‚Äù proclaimed Salon.

Good luck with that. Is she trying to say she‚Äôs the victim? I think 99 percent of the people would disagree with that.

This will go away if she just shuts up.

"SONGBIRD turned fashion mogul Jessica Simpson is bursting at the seams, looking anything but pulled together lately. But it‚Äôs not her shocking 40-pound weight gain or sloppy attire that has loved ones worried. Rather, it‚Äôs her wine-swilling, bingeand-purge lifestyle that‚Äôs endangering her health and could ultimately cause her children to be taken from her.  ‚ÄúPoor Jess really seems to be losing it,‚Äù confides a friend. ‚ÄúLately, she‚Äôs been looking trashed, slurring her words, not making sense ‚Äî no wonder people think she‚Äôs drunk, on drugs or both.

"Simone Alexandra Johnson is a model and the eldest daughter to Dywane Johnson; father, the famous ring wrestler known as the rock, who switched into the movie industry in 1999 and Dany Garcia; mother, a film producer, talent manager, business person and philanthropist.  Simone Alexandra Johnson Wiki, Age  Simone was born on August 14, 2001, in Davie, Florida United state but it was not long before her parents Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia got a divorce in 2008 after being together for 10 years.  She has tried within her power to keep her profile low despite being the daughter of a wrestler and movie star and the only means she uses to get to the world about herself is through social media platforms especially on her Instagram page where has over 189 thousand followers. Her captions on most of her pictures tell how amazingly she has moulded herself into becoming a strong woman. More so, her dad once made a post on his Instagram page about how he believed women are as strong as hell.  Dwyane Johnson is not the only wrestler in Simone‚Äôs lineage, her grandpa and great-grandfather are wrestlers and they have all derived their stage names from adding the ‚ÄòRock‚Äô to it.  Simone welcomed a baby sister Jasmine Johnson with her stepmom Lauren Hashiann, Jasmine was born in the month of December 16, 2015  See Also: Dany Garcia Wiki, Bio, Relationship With Dwayne Johnson, Age, Net Worth  Simone Alexandra Johnson‚Äôs Height and Body Stats  As a typical American, Simone has golden brown eyes and dark hair; she is 5‚Äô10 ft tall and she models for IMG models. On November 15, 2017, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association named Simone Alexandra Johnson the Golden Globe Ambassador for the 75th Golden Globe Awards. The newly renamed Ambassador position was previously called the ‚ÄúMiss Golden Globe‚Äù where basically her function is to present awards and escort presenters on and off the stage as well as presents some awards herself.  Dwyane Johnson once publicly announced how he has not approved of Simone dating just yet, in his own words, he boldly said he would choke anyone who comes around her with that intention. However, on Simone‚Äôs part, she has put full concentration on her career and studies not having time for side attractions despite her many followers on social media platforms.  Simone noted in an interview that she intends to pursue a business degree in college and embark on a career in sports entertainment after which she would then like to transit to talent management just like her parents, obviously indicating how much she looks up to her parents as role models.  Simone Alexandra‚Äôs Relationship with Dwayne Johnson  Most people thought Dwayne Johnson‚Äôs bond with his daughter Simone would be shaky when his divorce from her mother was finalised, however, the bond only got stronger and she is often seen as her father‚Äôs alibi. It has also been said that Simone can be hilarious because she even uses father‚Äôs lines on him ‚Äòcan you smell what the rock is cooking‚Äô.  The random statement of girls being closer to their fathers rather than their mothers is expressively displayed in Simone‚Äôs life. Dwyane Johnson has severally displayed affection for his daughter Simone not only in the private aspect of her life also in public.  He has been his daughter‚Äôs inspiration and role model as she really wants to follow his footsteps when she gets older. She has also picked interest in being a WWE superstar in the nearest future. If she finally accomplishes this dream, she would be the fourth generation in her lineage that belong to the wrestling world.  See Also: Dwayne Johnson‚Äôs Height, Weight And Body Measurements  Dwayne Johnson Daddy Duties  Dwyane Johnson has proven in many ways that he is a great and super dad to his daughters and he never fails to show how proud he is of them. He let Simone follow him to all his super duper occasions and events. At the age of 15, Simone has amazingly walked down a lot of red carpet occasions while her father proudly showed her off. One of the trendy news Hollywood gave about Simone in 2017 was derived at the People‚Äôs Choice Award 2017 where Simone turned heads at the red carpet in an elegant black dress and her father Johnson gave her a gentle amazing kiss on the cheek before he accepted his award.  It is quite beautiful how Simone has not wasted the opportunities rendered by her parents into modelling her to be an amazing young woman. Considering the rumour of her Father Johnson planning to run for elections in 2020 we would expect an amazing first daughter."
"As they prepare to welcome a child together in the wake of ongoing cheating allegations, Khlo√© Kardashian and Tristan Thompson‚Äòs future together is unclear.  ‚ÄúThis is supposed to be the most joyous time in her life and it‚Äôs been ruined and that‚Äôs probably what hurts most of all,‚Äù a family source tells PEOPLE about Kardashian, 33, who is due with her first child ‚Äî a daughter ‚Äî with Thompson, 27, any day now.  On Tuesday, photos and videos surfaced of the NBA player allegedly getting close to an unidentified woman at an N.Y.C. lounge over the weekend. TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.  Despite the allegations of infidelity ‚Äî a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is ‚Äúa serial cheater‚Äù ‚Äî the insider says the mother-to-be is likely to stay with Thompson.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a hopeless romantic and she‚Äôll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She‚Äôs having a child with Tristan, and she‚Äôs going to try to rebuild this,‚Äù the source says.  Adds the source: ‚ÄúKhlo√© could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That‚Äôs actually even worse.‚Äù  Prior to meeting Thompson, Kardashian was in a nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Odom. They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 ‚Äî one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) ‚Äî but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player‚Äôs cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  Khloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom  ‚ÄúKhlo√© spent so much time with Lamar just excusing away the obvious, turning a blind eye to what was so clearly happening, that it would be impossible for her not to feel like a fool if she made the same sort of mistakes again and just ignored that N.Y.C footage [of Thompson[. That‚Äôs not the way a man deeply in love with the mother of his child behaves. It‚Äôs just not. And Khlo√© can‚Äôt lie to herself and tell herself otherwise,‚Äù the source says.  RELATED VIDEO: Did Khlo√© Kardashian‚Äôs Boyfriend Get Too Close to Another Woman Right Before She Gives Birth?  ‚ÄúThe thing about Khlo√©, though, is she‚Äôs a big believer in knowing someone‚Äôs back story and understanding how it motivates them. With Lamar, her heart broke for everything he‚Äôd been through in the past, losing his mom and his grandma and his baby boy, and she used that as a justification for why he struggled so much with addiction and cheating. She‚Äôs got a big heart ‚Äî too big sometimes,‚Äù the source shares.  Thompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016, when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with Thompson‚Äôs first child, 16-month-old son Prince Oliver. Neither has addressed whether he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig.

A source previously told PEOPLE she planned on giving birth there, and her famous family would fly in, including mother Kris Jenner, who is already in Ohio with Kardashian.  While her future with Thompson remains unknown, the Good American jeans founder is focusing her attention on her unborn daughter.  ‚ÄúThe only thing Khloe can do now is focus on her baby,‚Äù the source says.‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs happened over the last 24 hours changes a lot of things, but it doesn‚Äôt change everything: It doesn‚Äôt change that Khlo√© has dreamed of becoming a mom, already loves her baby so much, and that soon her dream is going to come true.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt wait to meet her little girl, can‚Äôt wait to hold her,‚Äù says the insider, adding, ‚Äúand so for right now, the focus is just on getting to that day as safely and healthily as possible.‚Äù"

"The feud continues between these frenemies.  Days after Kim Zolciak-Biermann was accused by fellow Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes of being a ‚Äúracist,‚Äù the mother of six has obtained legal counsel, PEOPLE confirms. (A rep for Leakes had no comment.)  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  ‚ÄúShe put #KKK on the Instagram post. I‚Äôve hired legal counsel at this point. It‚Äôs just that bad,‚Äù she told Larry King on Larry King Now Tuesday.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism,‚Äù said Zolciak-Biermann, who hasn‚Äôt seen Leakes since the feud ignited. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on a show with all African-American women and I‚Äôm the only one that‚Äôs ever been on the show that‚Äôs Caucasian, so it‚Äôs the card that sometimes they play and it‚Äôs gross. And I won‚Äôt allow it.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI probably won‚Äôt shoot with her again,‚Äù she shared.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take this lightly. It‚Äôs one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,‚Äù Zolciak-Biermann, 39, told E!‚Äôs Daily Pop on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis is far beyond just having an opinion.‚Äù  The reality star‚Äôs decision to hire legal advisors comes on the heels of a public feud that involves herself, her 20-year-old daughter Brielle Biermann and Leakes.  On Thursday, Leakes, 49, slammed Brielle over claims of ‚Äúprejudice‚Äù after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes‚Äô home and allegedly found cockroaches. Leakes shared her response to an old video that showed Brielle in her bathroom with what appeared to be black bugs.  In addition, Leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of Brielle on her own Instagram account.  ‚Äú@briellebiermann We don‚Äôt have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p‚Äî-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f‚Äîing with me and mine!‚Äù Leakes wrote in the comments section.  ‚ÄúGo somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner Yo trashy mama should have taught you better! My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn‚Äôt even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash,‚Äù she concluded.  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Bierman Over Daughter‚Äôs Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar ‚ÄòRacist‚Äô  Also on Thursday, Brielle responded in the comment section of her own Instagram post after a follower accused her of calling Leakes a ‚Äúblack roach.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not calling BLACK people roaches!

Then, Leakes responded in the comments of a separate Instagram account, calling the Biermann duo ‚Äúracists.‚Äù  ‚ÄúKim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home, (which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well) was pure disgusting, racist, learned behavior etc,‚Äù Leakes wrote, adding, ‚Äúchildren are NOT off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way, post disrespectful things on social media and so on. Kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.‚Äù  Zolciak-Biermann told her side of the story to defend Brielle, saying RHOA fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season.  ‚ÄúFirst off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down .. until her DM‚Äôs blew up! She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well!‚Äù Zolciak-Biermann wrote on Instagram.  ‚ÄúBrielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA! Nobody would have ever seen this video! Nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting, however I will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough, but you WILL NOT make it seem as though my daughter did ANYTHING wrong! She never posted this video nor would she! As you see here I myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for RHOA. END OF STORY,‚Äù Zolciak-Biermann concluded.  In a follow-up post, Zolciak-Biermann wrote a lengthy statement.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that‚Äôs her last resort. (It‚Äôs convenient that I‚Äôm not racist when we are getting along.),‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúIn a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it‚Äôs heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she‚Äôs upset. I think everyone including Nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down. Nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies. There is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said. I will NOT stand for these slanderous comments!‚Äù  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Returning to ‚ÄòReal Housewives of Atlanta‚Äô for Season 10!  Later, Leakes responded to Zolciak-Biermann‚Äôs post with another statement of her own.  ‚ÄúKim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia, Sheree, Marlo, Porsha and Kandi while we were filming in Spain. Now she has the nerve to make a pitty post! No one from Kim‚Äôs household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree‚Äôs plus 1. She is a huge lier,‚Äù Leakes wrote.  ‚ÄúAll this season I have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home. I STILL continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go!

"Earlier this week, Dolce & Gabbana designer Stefano Gabbana commented on a picture of Selena Gomez to call her ugly. Miley Cyrus isn't about to stand for that, and she voiced her opinion on the matter via Instagram comments.  One of Miley's fan accounts posted this picture a day ago, of Selena and Miley at an event together.  And Miley commented on the picture more than once, writing ""Well what that d*ck head said (if it‚Äôs true) is f*king false and total bull sh*t."" In another comment, she wrote, ‚ÄúShe fine as f*ck.‚Äù  Here's a screenshot of the comments, because obviously receipts are important:  Instagram @MileyOfficially  Stefano has a long history of feuding with celebrities, including Miley. Last summer, Miley's brother Braison modeled in a Dolce & Gabbana show. After the fact, Miley posted a picture of him on the runway saying how proud she was, but also criticizing the company's politics.

"In anticipation of her next big moment, Cruz had an intimate phone conversation with a friend who has been there since the early days, before she made history: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow.  GWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt.  PEN√âLOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].  PALTROW: Wow. We‚Äôve been friends for a long time. We‚Äôve been through so much together.  CRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don‚Äôt spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it‚Äôs like it was only yesterday.  PALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become √¢¬Ä¬®a ballerina?  CRUZ: That‚Äôs what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn‚Äôt realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That‚Äôs when I stopped dancing.  PALTROW: Do you miss it?  CRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.  PALTROW: It‚Äôs totally like that. How did you get your first job?  CRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jam√≥n Jam√≥n [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.  PALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?  CRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can‚Äôt be sure.  PALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.  CRUZ: I‚Äôve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, ‚ÄúAre you afraid of aging?‚Äù That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.  PALTROW: It‚Äôs amazing, Hollywood‚Äôs obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.  CRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I‚Äôve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm proud of the values I have, because I don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre up to me‚Äîthey just come from the way I was raised. I‚Äôm rooted by the things I‚Äôve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, ‚ÄúWhat the fuck? I‚Äôm not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn‚Äôt deserve that.‚Äù Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, ‚ÄúCome on, it‚Äôs 2017. Why do women still have to be talking about this? It‚Äôs crazy.‚Äù That sense only got bigger when I had children."
"There's been a surprising lack of footage from the upcoming adaptation of Stephen King's The Dark Tower.  Outside of an early leak of the trailer back in October, alongside footage shown to attendees at CinemaCon, we've only now gotten its first trailer ahead of its August release.  However, with such a Disney-dominated start to the year - between trailers for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, The Last Jedi, Spider-Man: Homecoming, and Thor: Ragnarok - perhaps Sony has bided its time so the relatively risky film doesn't get drowned out by the competition.

The last living member of the knightly order of gunslingers, Roland's fabled quest is to find The Dark Tower that is rumoured to be the nexus of all universes before it's destroyed by The Man in Black, Walter; a warlock who has already reigned destruction on the people of Mid-World.  That rivalry was on full display when both Elba and McConaughey took to Twitter for a series of taunts, culminating in the first release of footage from the film ahead of its official trailer release.

"Michelle Obama has some summer workout motivation for you The former First Lady is keeping up her White House traditions  Michelle Obama may not be in the White House anymore, but she is determined to continue with some of the traditions she established while she was there. The former First Lady has revealed that she still hosts regular ""boot camp weekends"" with her friends like she used to, and took to Instagram to share some photos from their most recent meetup.  GALLERY: See inside Michelle and Barack Obama's new home  Posting a series of snaps of herself and a group of women exercising in the park, Michelle wrote: ""When I was at the White House, I often hosted boot camp weekends for my close girlfriends. It didn't matter that we were all at varying fitness levels. Our boot camp weekends were a reminder that if we want to keep taking care of others, we need to take care of ourselves first. And even though I'm no longer at the White House, I've continued this tradition and wanted to share some photos.""  VIEW GALLERY  Michelle Obama hosted a boot camp weekend for her friends  The mother-of-two continued: ""My girlfriends have been there for me through all kinds of life transitions over the years ‚Äì including a pretty big one recently! ‚Äì and we've done our best to stay healthy together. Whether it's a boot camp or a walk around the neighbourhood, I hope you and your crew can find some time this summer to be healthy together.""

The 53-year-old said she always wants to be in the best health she can possibly be, telling Prevention: ""I always want to be on the cusp of being in the best shape that I can be. What I'm discovering is that the older you get, the more work you have to do to stay there. When I was younger, I could eat whatever I wanted, as long as I exercised; or if I didn't exercise and just watched what I ate, I'd maintain. Well, now I have to do both.""

"Barton: Medicare Drug Program Drawing Participants by the Thousands WASHINGTON - U.S. Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, made the following statement today during the full committee hearing on the Administration's FY '07 Health Care Priorities: ""Good afternoon. Let me begin by welcoming Secretary Michael Leavitt today to the Energy and Commerce Committee. We look forward to hearing him testify about the Administration's Fiscal Year 2007 Health Care Priorities. ""First, Mr. Secretary, I want to thank you for your assistance in developing the important reforms we put into place for the Medicaid program starting this year. As a former governor yourself, you understood and appreciated the need to improve this program. Through passage of the Deficit Reduction Act, we will sustain Medicaid for those people who most often need health care and to get good get their health care through good jobs in a thriving economy instead of from a government welfare program. The reforms we adopted recently are beginning to rescue the program from the threat of financial collapse. I look forward to working with you to see that the governors get the tools they need to better manage the program and deliver its benefits to the poor of their states. ""I want to briefly highlight at least some of the changes in the law that have not recently received the public attention that they deserve. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 115,000 disabled children covered by the Family Opportunity Act will receive improved health care services as a result of the recently passed Deficit Reduction Act. The new law will provide access to new home and community based care to 120,000 individuals; and it will facilitate 100,000 nursing home residents to return to their communities through the Administration's Money Follows the Person Demonstration. These are the true results of Medicaid reform - better access to better care for those who most need our assistance. ""There is still much to be done to improve long-term care service delivery and financing as well as to promote Medicaid managed care. I have received the administration's proposals regarding additional improvement to the Medicaid program and I look forward to working with you this year on them. ""This year the secretary and the administration also are required to administer the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Making this program succeed is a high priority of yours, and it is a high priority of this committee that I chair. ""Since it began, critics have tried to make patients believe that they are not smart enough to understand the new Medicare drug benefit, that it provides inadequate coverage, and that signing up isn't worth their time because it cannot save them any money. The critics are simply wrong. They were wrong when they complained about the Medicare prescription drug card. They were wrong when they said nobody would offer any insurance plans. And they are wrong now. ""Some sense political advantage in condemning the program and others can't bring themselves to admit that free markets actually work. Transparency and competition will drive down prices and provide lower costs to consumers. Even if the critics don't get it, Medicare beneficiaries certainly do. That is why over 3.6 million Medicare beneficiaries have already signed up for the new benefit. You told me earlier today that there are close to 24 million Americans that have been enrolled in the program, through one means or another, and enrollment is increasing at approximately 250,000 people per week. That sounds like a success story to me. If you add that to the fact that the premiums which we estimated at $37 a month is now down to an average $27 per month, that appears to me to be a successful program. ""This is a huge undertaking and there are going to be glitches. My goal is the same as yours: Get rid of the glitches. The committee will work closely with yourself and Dr. Mark McClellan at CMS to get problems noticed and solved. We will have the first of what will likely be several hearings on this topic on March 1, when Dr. McClellan will testify before the Health subcommittee. I expect that we ask him very direct questions about where the problems are and what CMS is doing to fix them. ""Another high priority for the committee will be the reauthorization of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and related programs. I want to restate my deep commitment to reauthorizing the NIH and would ask for the secretary's assistance in working out the technical details so that we can enact this long overdue legislation. In addition, the authorization for the Ryan White CARE Act has now lapsed. I believe that funding unauthorized programs is not a responsible practice, and I anticipate that the committee will work to reauthorize these programs this year. ""I also intend to work with you this year on ways to reform Medicare reimbursement, and particularly focus on physician payment reform. In order to preserve access to Medicare services for future generations, we must look at how we are spending our Medicare dollars today and what are the incentives are for our physician community to continue providing quality health care. ""Another top priority of the committee will be to work with you on the proposals outlined in the Administration's budget to provide consumers with greater access to comparative price and quality data about their health care providers. I could go on, but my time has expired."" ####"
"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it‚Äôs hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn‚Äôt sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‚Äòdiscriminatory manner,‚Äô particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‚Äòno‚Äô vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the ‚Äúimposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.‚ÄùTo have a ‚Äòno‚Äô vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:‚ÄúIt is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.‚ÄùSince taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights."
"P!nk Hands 12 -Year-Old Superfan the Mic at Her Concert & Is Blown Away: Watch  Many people can only dream of the chance to sing their favorite artist's song right in their presence. For 12-year-old Victoria Anthony, that dream came true at Pink's concert in Vancouver on Saturday (May 12).  Back on May 1, Anthony shared a video of herself on Twitter directed to the ""Beautiful Trauma"" singer: ""when you come here, I really want to sing at your concert,"" she wrote. Anthony then gave a few examples of her incredible singing voice, including the hashtag #vicandpink in the caption to help gain traction and -- hopefully -- the attention of her idol.  After being picked up by Canadian news outlets, Pink recognized the young pop star in the making in the crowd at the show. While Anthony didn't get to go on stage, Pink did hand her the mic -- and was instantly floored.  Anthony belted out a flawless solo version of Pink's hit ""Perfect,"" drawing a roaring applause from the crowd and a stunned response from the singer. Judging by her reaction, it's safe to assume Pink thought Anthony was pretty ""perfect"" herself.  ""Thank you for that,"" the still-amazed Pink said after returning onstage. ""How do you follow that?""  Watch Anthony give Pink a run for her money below, and see the video she tweeted that made it all happen."
"Amanda Knox has revealed she is still haunted by her Foxy Knoxy nickname years after her infamous murder trial as she launches a new show in which she interviews other 'vilified' women like Mischa Barton and Amber Rose.  Knox, the American exchange student convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial.  Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong.  Knox, now 30, was referred to at the time as a 'sex-mad American party girl' and an 'evil temptress'.  Amanda Knox is launching a new show for Vice in which she interviews women, including Mischa Barton, (pictured above) who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality  Knox has revealed she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life  'I could have been the kinkiest person in the world it and it shouldn't have mattered because it has nothing to do with the evidence of the case,' Knox told Newsweek.  'The fact that I was accused of orchestrating a rape game - it was so absurd.  'The prosecutors and police looked at me and talked about me like I reeked of sex, that I was the weird, odd one out.  'They took that to mean I was somehow guilty of something, instead of checking their judgment and letting the evidence speak.'  In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said her Foxy Knoxy nickname often made it feel like she was living a double life.  'I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox a real person exists and Foxy Knoxy an idea of a person exists,' she said.  'I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based on that two-dimensional version of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long.  Knox wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports. One of the women she interviews is model Amber Rose (above) who has publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'  Knox's show The Scarlet Letter Reports premiere's on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Pictured above is a behind the scenes look at her interview with Mischa Barton  Knox (right on right) and Barton (left) filmed a segment of the show speaking about how the OC actress filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her  'I'm not alone in that. As soon as you've been labelled something, as soon as you've been given that catchy salacious nickname, the real you is gone and you are absorbed into this template character.'  Knox now wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports.  The show, which is for Vice's Broadly and will be broadcast on Facebook Watch, includes Knox's interviews with women including Mischa Barton, Amber Rose and Brett Rossi.  Barton filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her, while Rose has previously publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'.  'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA.  'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality.  'Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.'  Knox, above in 2007, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her British roommate  Knox was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life. She has been dating her author boyfriend Christopher Robinson since 2015  Knox said she came up for the idea for her new show before the #MeToo movement started in October 2017 when scores of women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment and rape.  'It's an incredible time to be a woman. We're redefining what it means. I'm amazed and so grateful to be a part of it. I never thought I would be here,' Knox told Newsweek.  'Not too long ago, I thought I would be spending the best decades behind bars for something I didn't do.'  Knox, a student from Seattle, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher.  She was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life.  Knox started dating and then got engaged to musician Colin Sutherland in 2015.  The couple split sometime that year and Knox started dating Seattle poet and author Christopher Robinson in late 2015."

"After more than a decade, actor Billy Bob Thornton shared what led to his divorce from actress Angelina Jolie in 2003.  Thornton has married six times, but his relationship with Jolie‚Äîwho is 20 years younger than the Goliath actor‚Äîwas among his most notable. Jolie was Thornton's fifth wife. The former spouses met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999. At the time, he was engaged to Big Little Lies star Laura Dern. Thornton and Jolie tied the knot in 2000, but they separated three years later.  ""I remember our time together as really being great,"" Thornton, 62, said on The HFPA in Conversation podcast Wednesday. ""We just had different lifestyles. Hers is a global lifestyle, and mine is an agoraphobic lifestyle, so that's really‚Äîthat's the only reason we're probably not still together maybe, because of a different path in life we wanted to take.""  Thornton said he's maintained a friendship with Jolie since their divorce. ""Angie is still a friend of mine, and she's a great person, and she's done so much,"" he told The HFPA. ""She makes movies that are important to her whether they succeed or fail, she still does what she believes in, and I'll always respect her for that.""  When Thornton and Jolie were together, they were known for their seemingly eccentric ways. They had an immediate attraction, which ultimately led Thornton to allegedly part ways with live-in fianc√©e Dern without warning.  Dern learned of Jolie and Thornton's relationship after receiving calls from tabloids.  ""I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I've never heard from him again,"" Dern said in Talk magazine 2000. ""It's like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.""  Jolie notably had Thornton's name tattooed along her arm, and they both wore a vial of each other's blood around their necks. The former pair announced their plans to adopt a child‚ÄîMaddox Jolie-Pitt‚Äîfrom Cambodia together in March 2002, but it was later disclosed that Jolie adopted her eldest kid as a single parent.  Since parting ways, the Bad Santa actor married puppeteer Connie Angland in 2014. Jolie is in the midst of a custody battle with former spouse Brad Pitt.  Representatives for Jolie did not immediately return Newsweek's request for comment regarding Thornton's remarks.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images"
"The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert‚Äôs May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert‚Äôs slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump‚Äôs mouth is good for ‚Äúis being Vladimir Putin‚Äôs [expletive] holster.‚Äù The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert‚Äôs mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it ‚Äì minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Trump called Colbert ‚Äúno-talent guy.‚Äù Colbert‚Äôs monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.

"Are wedding bells in the future for Mariah Carey? The iconic singer reportedly popped the question to her bae, Bryan Tanaka, and the two are busy planning their big day!  Did Mariah Carey, 47, have a vision of love when looking at boyfriend Bryan Tanaka, 34, one that left her feeling all sorts of emotions?

These two aren‚Äôt waiting around for one sweet day to tie the knot. While love takes time, Mariah and Bryan are already busy making wedding plans. ‚ÄúMariah would love to get married in May at the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui,‚Äù the insider told OK!, ‚Äúwhere she and Bryan first went public with their romance.‚Äù Mariah and Bryan struck up a relationship in late 2016, with Mariah low-key confirming the romance in February 2017 by calling Bryan her ‚Äúboyfriend.‚Äù  Mariah‚Äôs ‚Äúalso toying with the idea of a winter wonderland wedding,‚Äù the source says. ‚ÄúAfter all, she is the queen of Christmas!‚Äù Could Mariah have the fantasy holiday wedding she‚Äôs always wanted, saying ‚ÄúThank God I found you‚Äù to her honey, her all?

"This story contains spoilers for the ‚ÄúOutlander‚Äù season 2 finale and vague plot details from the third book in Diana Gabaldon‚Äôs series of novels, ‚ÄúVoyager,‚Äù on which season 3 will be based. If you want to go into season 3 with no knowledge of what might come, turn back now.  Season 2 of ‚ÄúOutlander‚Äù began with a disoriented Claire Fraser (Caitriona Balfe) returning through the standing stones at Craigh na Dun, alone and pregnant, to reluctantly reunite with her first husband, Frank (Tobias Menzies) in 1948. In the premiere, we saw Claire and Frank negotiating how they might raise a child together, with their relationship irrevocably strained by the events of Claire‚Äôs absence and the man she fell in love with during that time away.  Sunday‚Äôs finale, titled ‚ÄúDragonfly in Amber,‚Äù showed us the harrowing moments leading up to that reunion, as Claire‚Äôs second husband, Jamie (Sam Heughan) convinced her to return to her own time in order to protect her and their unborn child, since he believed that he was destined to die with his men at the Battle of Culloden.  That seemed like the end of Claire and Jamie‚Äôs story (although fans of Diana Gabaldon‚Äôs novels already knew that there‚Äôs plenty more of this tale to be told, with eight books currently published and more to come ‚Äî not to mention the fact that the show was already renewed for season 3 and season 4), until Claire discovered that Jamie survived both Culloden and the execution of Jacobite soldiers that followed the battle, meaning that there was a chance they could still reunite if she went back through the stones ‚Äî albeit after 20 years apart.  Related 'Outlander' Producer on Dealing With 'Different Sensitivities' in Depicting Sexual Assault 'Outlander' Recap: Brianna Is Brutally Attacked in 'Wilmington'  Given the number of books in Gabaldon‚Äôs series (and the fact that viewers would probably riot if Sam Heughan suddenly disappeared from the show), it‚Äôs not much of a spoiler to say that Claire and Jamie will someday find each other again. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of challenges to season 3 ‚Äî there‚Äôs a period of time where Jamie and Claire are apart; he thinks that he‚Äôs lost her, or at least that she‚Äôs alive and well but in the future, so what is he living for? What sort of man is he now?‚Äù Heughan observes. ‚ÄúShe will eventually return, but they‚Äôre both older, so what is Jamie, who is the man he‚Äôs become‚Äù in the time since they last saw each other?  Those questions ‚Äî ‚Äúwho is Jamie without Claire, why is he still surviving, what has he got to live for when he‚Äôs lost the woman that he loves‚Äù ‚Äî will be central to the character in season 3, according to Heughan.  And therein lies both the tragedy and romance at the heart of the ‚ÄúOutlander‚Äù series, which, despite its genre-bending sensibilities, incisively explores the sometimes harsh realities of a lasting relationship, with all the triumphs, complications, joys and heartbreaks that go along with it. When they find their way back together after decades spent separated, Claire and Jamie will have to relearn what it means to be a couple, something that Balfe admits she‚Äôs eagerly anticipating in season 3.  ‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs going to be most exciting is the reunion between Claire and Jamie and them discovering each other again and falling in love all over again,‚Äù she tells Variety. ‚ÄúI think both of them have probably held each other up on a pedestal for 20 years, so in many ways, they‚Äôre going to have to destroy that image first before they can fall in love with the person right in front of them, and that‚Äôs going to be really interesting. I love the complexity of that, because you can‚Äôt be in love with a ghost, and Claire is in many ways in love with Jamie‚Äôs ghost, as Jamie is in love with her ghost, and that‚Äôs not the people they are when they see each other again.‚Äù  The season 2 finale may have jumped ahead in time to introduce us to Claire and Jamie‚Äôs daughter, Brianna, on the cusp of adulthood, but we still have 20 years of lost time to revisit, and the show isn‚Äôt likely to skip over all of it, especially since those life experiences will inevitably have shaped who Claire and Jamie are now that they‚Äôre middle-aged.  ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm so excited about as well next season is we‚Äôll see, hopefully, some of her progression as a mother,‚Äù Balfe says. ‚ÄúSo even though we‚Äôve jumped forward in episode 13 [to see Claire] at 50, hopefully we‚Äôll see some of that journey between late 20s and 50.‚Äù  While the actors had yet to read scripts for season 3 when they spoke to Variety before the finale aired, Gabaldon‚Äôs ‚ÄúVoyager‚Äù gives us some hints as to what we might see in the new season, including a final showdown between Jamie and Menzies‚Äô Black Jack Randall, who was destined to die on Culloden Moor.  ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve read the books you will know that Randall will appear again,‚Äù Heughan teases. ‚ÄúI know that Diana has written the scene of how they ended up [back together], so hopefully ‚Äì and who knows, I haven‚Äôt read the script yet, but hopefully, we‚Äôll get to see Jamie and Randall in the Battle of Culloden.‚Äù  We‚Äôre also likely to see Frank again, to give viewers a sense of the realities of his relationship with Claire. We know from some of Brianna‚Äôs comments in the finale that her parents‚Äô marriage wasn‚Äôt particularly idyllic in its later years, and Menzies confirms that the tentative plan is for season 3 to explore the couple‚Äôs dynamic following the move to Boston, including ‚Äúthe disintegration of their marriage out there‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs slightly ‚ÄòWho‚Äôs Afraid of Virginia Woolf‚Äô in Boston, which hopefully will be really exciting stuff to dig into.‚Äù  Balfe agrees, ‚ÄúThe relationship between Claire and Frank is so rich and complex, I‚Äôm really looking forward to that.‚Äù  After the political intrigue of this season, Heughan says season 3 ‚Äúfeels like a very new chapter,‚Äù with trips to tropical climates that are far removed from the chill of Scotland. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of travel involved, and I think that‚Äôs the joy of the show ‚Äî it‚Äôs never the same thing, it‚Äôs constantly moving, so next season should be quite an adventure.‚Äù  What are you most looking forward to seeing in ‚ÄúOutlander‚Äù season 3? Weigh in below."
"Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that he has ‚Äúwoken up‚Äù to the ‚Äúevils of the music industry‚Äù and he needs to take a break from the industry because it is ‚Äúcontrolled by the absolute worst kind of people ‚Äì pedophiles.‚Äù  Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Saturday 22nd July he shared what he described as a ‚Äúhorrific story‚Äù with the congregation and explained why he felt he had to quit his world tour.  Describing a party on tour ‚Äì attended by the upper echelon of the music business, including executive VPs of development, producers, power agents and international financiers ‚Äì Bieber said he was encouraged to sexually abuse a young child who had been bought to the party for the sexual gratification of the industry elite.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to do this. I really didn‚Äôt. They said this kid was drugged, it was horrible,‚Äù Bieber said, explaining that it was made clear to him that he would gain entry to the ‚Äúbusiness side of the industry‚Äù if he ‚Äújoined the club‚Äù by passing the initiation rites.  ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt just be a performer, I‚Äôd be a mogul. That path would open up for me, like it did for Jay-Z.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the difference between being a millionaire and being a billionaire.‚Äù  But Bieber told the congregation that he couldn‚Äôt do it.  ‚ÄúTo join the club I‚Äôd have to do bad things to this poor kid. But then I realized that even that wasn‚Äôt enough for them. I‚Äôd also have to kill this little child.‚Äù  Bieber said he had heard rumors about this type of initiation in the music industry, but he had not been confronted with it before.  ‚ÄúI got told they secretly film these parties. Once they‚Äôve got you on video doing something like that, they own you.‚Äù  Bieber said his conscience is clear because he didn‚Äôt participate, but the fate of the drugged child is haunting him.  ‚ÄúThey said this kid was raped by a few different guys. They said he was bleeding. I got out of there but I heard he died and that haunts me.‚Äù  This allegation from Justin Bieber adds to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.  According to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy ‚Äúpeople with parasitic interests‚Äù who ‚Äúsee you as their prey.‚Äù In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that ‚ÄúClearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.‚Äù  If you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating ‚Äòfake news.‚Äô But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood and music industry system.  In recent months Nicole Kidman and Lindsay Lohan also spoke out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry ‚Äì and it cost them their lives.  Justin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. But as more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision."

"Phaedra Parks can cross ‚ÄúHousewife‚Äù off her long list of job titles.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 43-year-old attorney, mortician, philanthropist and mother of two will not be returning to The Real Housewives of Atlanta for its 10th season, multiple sources confirm to PEOPLE.  Her dismissal from the hit Bravo show, which was first reported by E! Online, comes after a tough four-part reunion, in which she admitted to spreading inflammatory accusations to Porsha Williams that said Kandi Burruss and her husband Todd Tucker had planned on drugging Williams and their mutual friend Shamea Morton in order to take advantage of them sexually.  Williams had come under fire for repeating the accusations throughout the season because she believed the claims had come directly from Burruss. Problem was, Parks had only heard the information from a still-unnamed source.  ‚ÄúI repeated it because I heard it,‚Äù Parks said in the final episode of the reunion. ‚ÄúSomething was brought to me.

"Kellyanne Conway slammed officials who in the wake of the latest historic mass shooting were calling for action on gun legislation. | Matt Rourke/AP Conway: Politicizing Texas shooting 'disrespectful to the dead'  White House counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday criticized Democrats for ""pointing fingers"" and calling for increased gun control measures in response to the deadly Texas shooting over the weekend, saying the quick reaction is ""disrespectful to the dead.""  ""The rush to judgment, particularly by people who just see politics and Trump derangement in every single thing they do, it doesn't help the victims, and it's disrespectful to the dead,"" Conway said during an appearance on ""Fox & Friends"" Monday morning.  Story Continued Below  Conway lamented Sunday's lethal shooting, which left at least 26 dead after a gunman opened fire on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, during a worship service on Sunday ‚Äî the deadliest mass shooting in state history. ""There is evil among us,"" she said.  The counselor to the president also slammed officials who, in the wake of the latest historic mass shooting, were calling for action on gun legislation.  ‚ÄúIt's so beyond any type of reasonable response that anyone should have ‚Äî why people see politics immediately,"" she said, hitting liberal politicians and celebrities for ""taking to Twitter in the comfort of their very luxurious lives and pointing fingers.""

This isn‚Äôt a guns situation.‚Äù  It was unclear what led Trump to say the shooting was a result of ""mental health."" Officials are still investigating the motive behind the shooter's outburst.  The president said it was too soon to rehash the gun control debate, though, echoing a common refrain from Republican officials after recent mass casualty shootings.  The White House similarly dismissed calls for fast action in response to the lethal Las Vegas shooting last month that claimed the lives of more than 50 and left more than 500 injured.

"Lady Gaga Alberto E. Rodriguez/ Getty Images  The INSIDER Summary:  Lady Gaga's new documentary will discuss her struggles with chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, "" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,"" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people ""physically, mentally, and socially."" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.  George Clooney Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla  In addition to Gaga, Morgan Freeman has specifically spoken about dealing with fibromyalgia. In an interview with Esquire, the actor described the pain. ""Up and down the arm,"" he said. ""That's where it gets so bad. Excruciating."" The actor doesn't let this pain stop him from doing some of the things he enjoys like golfing or walking, but he can't fly pilot jets or drive.  According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the ""pain is a microphone"" and it ""does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,"" Variety reports. Here's hoping ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" which will be available on September 22 on Netflix, inspires others suffering to transform the pain."

Talented: Laura made her major film debut playing Peter Parker's high school girlfriend Liz in last year's Spider-Man: Homecoming  Just over a week ago Justin opened up about his split from ex wife Jennifer Aniston, telling the New York Times their separation was different than a normal couple's would have been because it was so 'amicable'.  '[It] doesn't have that seismic shift of an ordinary couple, where everything is, like, you have to tear a baby in half,' he said.  'Neither one of us is dead, neither one of us is looking to throw hatchets at each other. It's more like, it's amicable. It's boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be. It was heartbreaking only in a sense that the friendship would not be the same, as far as just the day to day.'  The Maniac star went on: 'But the friendship is shifting and changing, you know, so that part is something that we're both very proud of.'"
"CLOSE According to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges despite his ex-girlfriend accusing him of being violent towards her. USA TODAY  A former girlfriend of Ryan Phillippe has accused him of throwing her down a staircase. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges in the domestic violence case that resulted in a lawsuit being filed by a former girlfriend.  Frank Mateljan, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY that his office will not be pursuing the matter further.  ""The City Attorney's Office was referred this matter following an investigation by the LAPD,"" he said in a statement. ""After a thorough review, the matter was set for a City Attorney office hearing, during which both parties were present, detailed the incident, were advised on the law and given guidance as to how to avoid similar incidents in the future.  ""Separate hearings were held in August and September. No further action has been scheduled following our office hearing, though we do reserve the right to file charges up to one year after the incident.""  On Monday, model Elsie Hewitt, 21, sued the actor for $1 million, alleging assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Phillippe denies the accusations.  ""The claims are false,"" Phillippe's rep, Nicole Perna, said to USA TODAY in a statement.  Later in the evening, he expanded on his thoughts in a tweet confirmed by Perna.  ""I am saddened and disgusted by these false allegations being circulated about me,"" he wrote. ""At the time these allegations were initially made, I fully cooperated with law enforcement and a thorough investigation was conducted.""  He continued, ""As a man, raised by women, in a household where women's right's, feminism and advocacy were very much at the forefront, I am sickened that my name can be found in any article where domestic violence of any kind is being alleged.""  Hewitt's lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, says Phillippe, who is 22 years her senior, became increasingly possessive and violent towards her (often while under the influence) during their three-month relationship.  The document states that during their relationship, she observed Phillippe, 43, ""repeatedly abusing a panoply of legal and illegal drugs, including without limitation: cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms and steroids.""  Things reached a boiling point over the July 4th holiday, according to the suit, when Hewitt and a friend came to his house to pick up personal items she would need for an upcoming modeling job.  Phillippe, she describes, was ""discernibly drunk and high"" at the time, and became increasingly ""agitated and hostile."" In an effort to diffuse the situation, Hewitt asked to speak with him privately upstairs.  When that plan failed, she called her friend to come upstairs while she cleared out her belongings from his bedroom.  At that point, the lawsuit says, Phillippe grabbed Hewitt by the arm (""so tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm hours later"") and ""violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.""  She made a second trip up the stairs only to be cornered, kicked and thrown down the stairs again. As and her friend fled, he cursed and screamed ""get the (expletive) out of my house, you crazy (expletive)!""  Soon afterward, she sought treatment at the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where police filed a report, noting ""visible injuries to (Hewitt's) legs, back, arms, shoulder and face"" and granted her a week-long emergency protective order, which was served at Phillippe's home on July 6.  The day beforehand, Hewitt says he texted her saying he was ""so sad"" and contacted her friends via private message on social media that he was ""heartbroken"" and ""in disbelief"" that police had come to his home.  ""I can't believe she'd do this to me,"" he allegedly wrote, adding he ""would never hurt her like she's claiming. I didn't hit or punch or kick her.""  The friend who witnessed the encounter replied, ""I saw the whole thing Ryan, you literally were grabbing her and threw her down the stairs.""  Hewitt is seeking $1 million in punitive damages, citing emotional distress and the impact physical attack had on her ability to work as a model since her ""income and career (are) largely contingent upon her physical features.""  Phillippe's publicist released a statement flatly denying the account.  In his tweet, Phillippe noted, ""I have been a public figure for almost 25 years and many untrue things have been said or written about me in the past. That is something you learn to accept if you choose a profession like mine. This time is different.""  He also took offense at the notion of using this type of accusation for personal gain: ""Domestic violence is a very real and tragic issue for many women the world over and should never be used to vengefully slander or as a ploy for monetary gain. This is wrong. This is not who I am. Every one of my accuser's allegations (is) false.""  Phillippe was previously married to Reese Witherspoon, who filed separation papers in 2006 after seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 2008.  They have two children together: 18-year-old daughter Ava and 13-year-old son Deacon. He also has a 6-year-old daughter from his relationship with Pitch Perfect actress Alexis Knapp.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yc3HrN"

"If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with making a mistake, what‚Äôs wrong is not making the effort to make it right,‚Äù and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her.

Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex‚Äôs antics.‚Äù  She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. ‚ÄúA week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,‚Äù she claimed. ‚ÄúHe never even mentioned her.‚Äù Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer ‚Äúwould be an idiot to believe he‚Äôd be faithful,‚Äù she said.

Speaking to The Fix, Sean shared the criteria he had given producers for his dream partner.  He said: ""Someone who‚Äôs funny. Someone‚Äôs who loyal. Someone who wants to have good fun. Having someone to go and have fun with and do different things and learn different things. And someone who's trustworthy.""  Channel 9 6 He was unable to hide his disappointment, although he was matched with someone who was 100% his type on paper  Channel 9 6 Jo was delighted to see her hunky new husband and said she felt like she had won the lottery  But despite Jo ticking all the boxes, he simply didn't fancy her.  Sadly for Jo, she really did think she had struck gold with her mystery man.  At the wedding she said: ""He's got kind eyes. He seems genuine. I fancy him.  ""This could work. My expectations have been met and then some. To infinity and beyond... Sean D and Jo sitting in a tree.  Channel 9 6 Jo couldn't stop talking about how good looking her new man was  ""My expectations have been met, and then some. To infinity and beyond. Winning! Jackpot! I've won the lotto!  ""The experts have been spot on! He is for me. He couldn't be any more perfect.""  But Sean felt very differently, which made for awkward viewing for people at home.  He said, ""Um, she's probably not what I imagined, no.  Channel 9 6 Later Sean looked despondently at the table as Jo stared at him adoringly  ""There's not like a massive spark straight away, but I'm sure she's feeling the same way.""  People tuned in at home were on the edge of their seats as the mismatched pair continued to totally misread one another's body language and reactions to each other.  All I really wanna watch is Jo & that sad sack Sean #MAFS ‚Äî DeluxeStormBorn‚Ñ¢ (@deluxe_tm) January 31, 2018  However, Sean has since explained his frosty reaction to likeable Jo - it's all because of his exercise addict ex-girlfriend who he's still a bit hung up on.  He said that after she got addicted to exercise, their 10 year relationship ended and he was stuck caring for their plethora of pets including llamas and cats - and he is still traumatised and tired.  Sean said: ""We had a five-acre property together, and she ran out of time for me and the animals.  Channel 9 6 Sean later described kissing his wife as ""gross""  ""It was really hard because I had to take responsibility of the farm. I got all the animals. When we broke up, we had nine dogs, two alpacas, and two horses.  ""It was difficult breaking up, it wasn't like either of us did anything wrong - there was no cheating or anything like that.

"Barring a fluke, Aquaman will probably cross $500 million worldwide sometime today or very early tomorrow. The DC Films superhero flick has earned $483m worldwide, including $72.7m in its domestic debut, so it should be over/under $80m domestic by the end of today. For reference, National Treasure fell 40% on its first Monday on Christmas Eve after a $44m debut weekend in 2007 while The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, which opened a week earlier in 2012, fell 60% on day four after a then-record $84m Fri-Sun haul. So, yeah, barring an unexpected collapse, the Jason Momoa/Amber Heard adventure is already a sizable hit for the Dream Factory, and it‚Äôs on course to be their biggest domestic and global grosser of 2018.  It is standard practice after any DC Films movie to examine what its success (or relative failure) means for the brand as a whole. It may be too early to explore the long-term impact, but at a glance, DC Films is now in a position where not every film has to justify the entire IP or the overall fate of the studio. Warner Bros. had a pretty damn good 2018, offering a slew of mid-priced domestic winners (A Star Is Born, Crazy Rich Asians, Ocean‚Äôs 8) and big-budget tentpoles that did okay in North America and broke big overseas (Ready Player One, The Meg, Rampage) and thus finally declaring that they won‚Äôt be entirely defined by DC Films and the J.K. Rowling brand.  One thing the relative commercial and critical success of Aquaman means is that the series won‚Äôt necessarily live or die by the fate of each movie. Maybe Shazam will be another goofy treat, and since it‚Äôs from New Line as well as Warner Bros., I‚Äôm presuming it‚Äôs budgeted closer to The Fellowship of the Ring than The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Maybe Todd Phillips' Joker will be a halfway-decent 1980s crime drama that happens to be a Joker origin story. Or perhaps not. But each new film will, as long as some of them are decent (and WB has other IP and non-IP hits to crow about), be allowed to stand on its own without much concern about the overall fate of the brand being taken into account.  Coincidentally enough, today marks 33 months since the release of Zack Snyder‚Äôs Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. After Snyder‚Äôs Man of Steel earned mixed reviews and grossed ‚Äújust‚Äù $668 million worldwide, Man of Steel 2 morphed first into a Superman sequel that happened to involve Batman and eventually into an official backdoor pilot for the DC Films franchise. So the poor reviews and quick-kill box office ($873m but from a $422m global launch) wasn‚Äôt just about whether the movie made money (it did) or justified itself artistically (that‚Äôs a coin toss, especially in its compromised theatrical cut), but how it laid the groundwork for the sequels and spin-offs to come. Much of the conversation revolved around what the film said about the overall DC Comics film franchise.  This is what happens when a studio positions a new biggie as not just a big movie (or even a big sequel) but as a launching pad for a would-be cinematic universe. It was a distinctly less stand-alone movie than, for example, Sony‚Äôs The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (whose marketing emphasized the barely-there cinematic universe implications). Superman (Henry Cavill) met Batman (Ben Affleck), Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg). We briefly met The Flash (Ezra Miller), Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). The film set up a looming threat from Apokolips and hinted at an endgame similar to Injustice: Gods Among Us (a popular DC Comics fighting video game where Superman goes world-crushingly rogue after Lois Lane is murdered).  Oh, and it ended with Clark Kent perishing in battle with the presumption that he would be resurrected in Justice League. The grim, hyper-violent and barely comprehensible sequel was discussed in terms of its quality and in terms of what it meant for the overall DC Films franchise. It earned nearly $900 million but was so divisively received that it caused significant changes for Suicide Squad (which ended up being recut by the company that produced the first crowd-pleasing theatrical trailer) and Justice League (where Joss Whedon eventually took over from Zack Snyder and delivered a soft remake of The Avengers). As a backdoor pilot for a cinematic universe that was intended to replace WB‚Äôs Harry Potter grosses and stand toe-to-toe with the MCU, it was a disaster.  But the success of James Wan‚Äôs Aquaman, both critically and (thus far) commercially, means two big things for the DC Films franchise. First, it means that they can keep the established continuity intact while going in a different direction (or many different directions) for the likes of Cathy Yan's Birds of Prey, David Sanberg's Shazam and Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman 1984. It may not have ‚Äúsaved the DCEU,‚Äù but it most certainly saved the DC Films continuity and prevented a more overt reboot. Ditto (presumably) Shazam, whose trailer explicitly references the events of Batman v Superman even while telling a more kid-friendly adventure fantasy. Secondly, for what it‚Äôs worth, it means we can now judge Dawn of Justice as its own thing instead of a foundation for a rickety house.  As a stand-alone film, even the 180-minute (and R-rated) ‚Äúultimate edition‚Äù has many of the same problems it did 2.5-years-ago. The critical title fight is still based on miscommunication and misdirection, so it‚Äôs not really the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight wanting to beat the hell out of each other. The first two hours is mostly just Lex Luthor (an underrated turn from Eisenberg) slaughtering innocents behind the scenes while Batman and Superman blame each other and brood. The desire to make Luthor into a full-blown puppet master makes the plot more complicated and confusing than it needed to be. And, like Man of Steel (and Chris Nolan‚Äôs The Dark Knight Rises), the film‚Äôs first plot-filled/character-centric half is more compelling than its action-packed second half.  Absent the misguided notion of introducing a four-quadrant super-franchise with a film like Batman v Superman, the picture works as an Elseworlds movie. It is still one of the most beautiful-looking superhero movies I‚Äôve ever seen, and how I wish Larry Fong had shot Justice League too. While too many superhero team-up movies and shows tend to isolate their heroes and minimize their contact with the outside world, Batman v Superman has a sprawling supporting cast and is as much about the regular people as it is about Batman and Superman. As a visually-majestic and highly quotable superhero drama that blends gritty realism with apocalyptic fantasy while trying to examine Superman‚Äôs role in a world where his every action is politicized, it‚Äôs at worst a noble failure.  Like Ang Lee‚Äôs Hulk or even Jon Favreau‚Äôs Iron Man 2 (which is a superhero sequel as a sitcom bottle episode), Zack Snyder‚Äôs second DC Films movie is an engrossing misfire both for what it attempts and beautiful it often looks and sounds. There‚Äôs certainly nothing else like it in the sub-genre. It will likely age well as its own thing now that it no longer carries the burden of an entire cinematic universe (and arguably an entire movie studio) on its doomed, misguided shoulders. That it turned out to be the most potent (and sadly accurate) political metaphor for the 2016 presidential election (Batman = Sanders, Superman = Clinton, Luthor = Trump) of that year only adds to its skewed legacy. And now Aquaman has set it free."
"Gotti is a 2018 American biographical crime drama film directed by Kevin Connolly, and written by Lem Dobbs and Leo Rossi. The film is about the life of New York City mobster John Gotti and his son, and stars John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Spencer Lofranco, Victor Gojcaj, and Stacy Keach.  The film languished in development hell for several years with numerous directors and actors, including Barry Levinson and Al Pacino, attached at various points. Principal photography finally began in July 2016 in Cincinnati, Ohio and concluded in Brooklyn, New York in February 2017.  The film was originally set to be released in the United States on December 15, 2017, but, just two weeks prior, Lionsgate, the slated distributor, sold the film back to its producers and studio, delaying its release.[6] On March 12, 2018,[7] its new release date was announced for June 15, 2018 by Vertical Entertainment and MoviePass Ventures, after premiering at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival. Gotti was negatively reviewed by critics, who lamented the writing, aesthetics, and performances, although its use of makeup received some praise; Travolta's performance received mixed reviews.[8] It is one of the few films to hold an approval rating of 0% on the website Rotten Tomatoes.[9][10][11]  Plot [ edit ]  The film chronicles the three-decade reign of crime boss John Gotti, and his rise as the head of the Gambino Crime Family in New York City, along with his son, John Jr., and his loyal wife, Victoria.  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  Development history [ edit ]  In September 2010, Fiore Films announced that it had secured the rights from Gotti Jr. to produce a movie about his life.[12] The film, tentatively titled Gotti: In the Shadow of My Father, was to be directed by Barry Levinson, who eventually left the project. Nick Cassavetes and Joe Johnston were then also attached at different points to direct, as were Al Pacino, Lindsay Lohan and Ben Foster to star in various roles.[13] Joe Pesci was cast as Angelo Ruggiero early in development and gained 30 pounds in order to properly portray him. After having his salary cut and being recast as Lucchese underboss Anthony Casso, he sued Fiore Films for $3 million; the case was settled out of court.[14][15] Chazz Palminteri, who had played Paul Castellano in the TNT made-for-TV film Boss of Bosses, was also initially cast to reprise Gotti's predecessor.[16]  Casting [ edit ]  On September 8, 2015, it was announced that the project was moving forward with Kevin Connolly as director.[17] Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films, Fiore Films and Herrick Entertainment would be financing the film, with Lionsgate Premiere handling the domestic distribution rights.[17]  On July 27, 2016, the complete cast for the film was announced. It included Kelly Preston as Gotti's wife Victoria; Stacy Keach as Aniello Dellacroce, the underboss of the Gambino crime family who mentored Gotti; Pruitt Taylor Vince as Angelo Ruggiero, a deferential friend of Gotti; Spencer Lofranco as John Gotti Jr., Gotti's son; William DeMeo as Sammy Gravano, Gotti's right hand man who later became an FBI informant and helped them in bringing down Gotti; Leo Rossi as Bartholomew ""Bobby"" Boriello, Gotti's enforcer; Victor Gojcaj as Father Murphy, with Tyler Jon Olson and Megan Leonard.[18]  Filming [ edit ]  Principal photography on the film began in Cincinnati, Ohio, on July 25, 2016, with locations including Springfield Township. The locations were staged to resemble setting of the film, New York City.[19][20] Filming also took place on Jonfred Court in Finneytown, and Indian Hill.[20][21] Filming was also done at Butler County Jail.[22]  The film's shooting was previously scheduled to take place in New York City, because of its setting there, but it was relocated to Cincinnati. One reason to relocate was Ohio's revised Motion Picture Tax Credit to benefit films' creators.[23] Filming for some scenes took place in Brooklyn on February 21, 2017, concluding principal photography.[24]  Release [ edit ]  The film was originally set to be released in a limited release and through video on demand on December 15, 2017, through Lionsgate Premiere. Producers began seeking a new distributor in order for the film to receive a wide theatrical release, as opposed to the original release it was initially intended to have, with Lionsgate selling the film back to the producers and studio.[25][26] On March 12, 2018, Connolly announced that the film would be released on June 15, 2018.[27] On April 12, 2018, it was announced Vertical Entertainment was the film's new distributor.[2] On April 25, 2018, it was announced that MoviePass Ventures, a subsidiary of MoviePass, acquired an equity stake in the film and will participate in the revenue generated from the film.[28][29] The film premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival on May 15, 2018.[1]  Reception [ edit ]  Box office [ edit ]  Gotti began its limited release in 503 theaters and was projected to make $1‚Äì2 million in its opening weekend. It made $105,000 from Thursday night previews at 350 theaters and a total of $1.7 million in its opening weekend, finishing 12th.[13] According to their own reports, MoviePass accounted for 40% of tickets sold, leading one independent studio head to tell Deadline Hollywood: ""It used to be in distribution, we‚Äôd all gossip whether a studio was buying tickets to their own movie to goose their opening. But in the case of MoviePass, there‚Äôs no secret: They‚Äôre literally buying the tickets to their own movie!""[30] In its second weekend the film dropped 53% and made $812,000, finishing 12th.[31]  Critical response [ edit ]  Gotti was not screened in advance for critics,[32] but the Cannes premiere was attended by reviewers from IndieWire and The Hollywood Reporter, who both gave the film negative reviews .[33] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 0% based on 39 reviews, and an average rating of 2.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Fuhgeddaboudit.""[34] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 24 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics, indicating ""generally unfavorable reviews"".[35]  Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a negative review, writing: ""...it's not only that the film is pretty terrible: poorly written, devoid of tension, ridiculous in spots and just plain dull in others. But the fact that it mostly portrays John Gotti as a loving family man and altogether likable guy, and his son John Gotti Jr. as a victim of government persecution, may be a first in the history of the genre.""[4] The New York Post's Johnny Oleksinski called the film ""the worst mob movie of all-time"" and wrote, ""...the long-awaited biopic about the Gambino crime boss' rise from made man to top dog took four directors, 44 producers and eight years to make. It shows. The finished product belongs in a cement bucket at the bottom of the river.""[36] Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film one out of four stars and said, ""Insane testimonials from Gotti supporters at the end are as close as this [film] will ever get to good reviews.""[37]  Rotten Tomatoes controversy [ edit ]  Observers were quick to note a large disparity on Rotten Tomatoes, between the audience approval score of 80% and the 0% critics' score during the film's opening weekend.[38][39][40][41][42] As of August 12, 2018 , the audience score was down 27% to a score of 53%.[34]  On June 19, Dan Murrell of Screen Junkies noted that the disparity ""made no sense"" and suspected vote manipulation on behalf of the studio.[39] Accusations against the production studio and marketing team increased after the release of a marketing push suspected to be trying to hit back at the critics. The campaign proclaimed to consumers to ignore the ""... trolls behind a keyboard"",[42] and ""Audiences loved Gotti but critics don't want you to see it... The question is why??? Trust the people and see it for yourself!""[38][41][39][40] Observers also noted the abnormally high number of reviews, 7,000, compared to other films that did better at the box office that weekend, such as Incredibles 2 which logged 7,600 reviews and grossed 105 times more than Gotti.[39][41]  Rotten Tomatoes staff issued a statement stating they didn't find any evidence of tampering and that ""All of the ratings and reviews were left by active accounts.""[42] As of June 19, 32 of the 54 written reviews were found to be from first-time reviewers on the site, who had also only left a review for Gotti itself, and 45 of the accounts were created the same month.[39] Many of the accounts also wrote a review for American Animals, which along with Gotti are the only films to be owned by MoviePass through its company MoviePass Ventures,[39][41] which was responsible for 40% of tickets sold.[30] Jim Vorel of Paste suggested this was done to try to prop up MoviePass's ""unlimited movies"" business model.[39]"
"Alex Pall, the Grammy-winning deejay who is one half of the powerhouse EDM-pop duo The Chainsmokers, found himself in hot water on Tuesday when his now ex-girlfriend Tori Woodward shared photos she alleges are of him kissing another girl.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The pictures of Pall‚Äôs apparent indiscretion were captured at a residential location by CCTV and posted to Woodward‚Äôs Instagram Stories in a series of snaps ‚Äî each with a series of savage messages thrown his way.  ‚ÄúAlex is disgusting. Men are trash. Don‚Äôt ever forget it,‚Äù Woodward wrote on one of the surveillance shots, which Woodward later accused Pall of reporting to Instagram after it was deleted by the social network site.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll look you in the eyes and tell you they love you. Then destroy you without a second thought,‚Äù she captioned another snap, which appeared to show Pall, 32, kissing the mystery woman.  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Reps for Pall and The Chainsmokers did not immediately respond to PEOPLE‚Äôs request for comment about the incident, but Woodward ‚Äî who has dated Pall since February 2014 ‚Äî claimed this wasn‚Äôt the first time he had been unfaithful throughout their long relationship.  ‚ÄúAfter hours of begging him for scraps of honesty, I chipped away just enough to confirm that this is not the first time he‚Äôs remorsely [sic] cheated on me,‚Äù she wrote in another post, listing some of the other women she had questioned him about. ‚ÄúThat ‚Äòpsycho bitch‚Äô from Vegas, the ‚Äòlame Instagram model‚Äô caught on video and countless others he looked me in the eyes and swore on his life he never touched.‚Äù  According to Woodward, Pall allegedly gave her excuses for the infidelity but didn‚Äôt apologize.  ‚ÄúConsistent outright denial faded to him explaining that because all men do it, it‚Äôs not that bad. And in different words, that because he‚Äôs famous now, he had a different rulebook for decency,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs perhaps the most amazing is that he HASN‚ÄôT EVEN APOLOGIZED.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat he has done is everything he possibly can to stop this from coming out, from looking [like] the kind of person who does what he‚Äôs done,‚Äù she claimed. ‚Äù ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre better than this.‚Äô That‚Äôs right I am, but you‚Äôre not.‚Äù  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Tori Woodward/Instagram  Woodward turned her heartbreak into empowerment by her message‚Äôs end, writing, ‚Äúif there was ever a time to hold powerful men accountable for their disgusting behavior, it‚Äôs now.‚Äù  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be that guy. Don‚Äôt let your friend or brother or business partner be that guy. Basic respect for women in your life should not be such a hard standard to hold each other to,‚Äù she said.

"Ed Sheeran Reveals 'Love Yourself' Was Originally Written For His New Album 'Divide'  It's no secret that Ed Sheeran had a hand in writing Justin Bieber's megahit ""Love Yourself,"" but the British singer-songwriter recently revealed that the Biebs actually wasn't the original artist in mind when he penned it. Without Bieber, though, the chart-topping tune would still be nonexistent -- or may have never even come to fruition.  ‚ÄúThat was a song I had written for Divide. It just wouldn‚Äôt have made it,"" Sheeran explained in an interview with Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio Monday morning (Jan. 9). ""And then Justin took it and did his thing on it, and released it as a single and made it what it is. So going from a song that would have never been released to [being] the biggest song of last year -- it just became Billboard's #1 of 2016 of the whole year, and [was] nominated for Song of the Year at the GRAMMYs -- it just shows you that you shouldn‚Äôt always write stuff off.‚Äù  Sheeran didn't elaborate on what kind of touch Bieber had on the song, but he made sure to give the Purpose singer some credit. ""[Justin] did have input on it, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was just all me.""  Those who pay close attention to Bieber's Twitter may have noticed that Sheeran also had a role in another one of the Bieb's 2016 hits: the Major Lazer/M√ò collaboration ""Cold Water."" But before Sheeran actually heard the track, he didn't realize he had written yet another smash for Bieber.  ‚Äú‚ÄòCold Water‚Äô was a weird one because I didn‚Äôt even know that song existed,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt was a song I must‚Äôve half-written somewhere at a time where I was writing a lot of songs and I did it at Benny Blanco‚Äôs house and then I got an email from Diplo just being like, ‚ÄòYo! That ‚ÄòCold Water‚Äô song is dope! Can I have it?‚Äô And I was like, ‚ÄòI have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about,‚Äô so I just didn‚Äôt reply. And then he emailed and was like, ‚ÄúYo, Justin [Bieber] wants to hop on the ‚ÄòCold Water‚Äô song. Is that cool?‚Äô And I‚Äôm just like, ‚ÄòWhat are you talking about?‚Äô... And then the song came out and it was number one and I was like ‚ÄòOh, that song!‚Äô I remember doing it, but it was really, really slow. I remember hearing it and being like ‚ÄòThat kind of sounds like me. Oh wait, it was me.'""  While fans may never get to hear Sheeran's versions of ""Cold Water"" or ""Love Yourself"" -- though he did give one live performance of the latter in December -- they did get a sneak peak last week of what's to come with Divide. Sheeran released ""Castle on the Hill,"" an homage to his hometown of Suffolk, England, and the sexually charged ""Shape of You,"" which both shot to the top of iTunes on Friday (Jan. 6), and set a Spotify record in their first 24 hours of release.  Sheeran revealed on Jan. 12 that Divide will be dropping March 3, and has previously said that he will be sharing a few more new tunes from the LP prior to its release.

"Kim Kardashian will not leave Kanye West despite all the rumors.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have seen their names mentioned in hundreds of rumors over the years and they aren‚Äôt slowing down. Amid the backlash that West is receiving for making controversial comments, reports are coming out that their marriage could be coming to an end soon. Most of those rumors also insinuate that Kardashian is planning to end the marriage.  According to a recent report from Grazia, Kardashian is planning to leave West and even has an ‚Äúescape plan‚Äù to leave him.  ‚ÄúThings between her and Kanye are at a breaking point. The marriage has been under increasing pressure lately and she fears all the controversy Kanye is causing is reflecting negatively on her and her family. There‚Äôs concern this marriage is on borrowed time. Kim may come across as his long-suffering wife, but she has been ready to leave on a number of occasions and has had multiple exit strategies in place over the years.‚Äù  Gossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Kardashian has ‚Äúexit strategies‚Äù and an ‚Äúescape plan‚Äù in place to get away from West. She has shown some frustration with his controversial comments, but the two seems to be doing just fine despite all of the rumors.  ‚ÄúNone of this adds up to a divorce. In fact, Kardashian‚Äôs rep has already gone on record to tell Gossip Cop it‚Äôs ‚Äòfalse‚Äô she‚Äôs intending end the marriage. That will be evident in a few days, when the couple marks their fourth wedding anniversary on May 24.‚Äù  Kardashian has come out and publicly joked that West is the cause of her first gray hair.  ‚Äú[Kanye] gave me my first gray hair this week, and I am blaming that on him.‚Äù  That is nothing to write home about as far as divorce rumors are concerned. She also went on to state that West is doing well and is out in Wyoming working on new music.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs doing really good. He‚Äôs in Wyoming recording, he has a couple of albums coming out, so he‚Äôs just focused on that.‚Äù  West even took to Twitter to post a picture of Kim with fire emoji‚Äôs as the only description. Obviously, he still finds his wife incredibly beautiful.  Rumors are going to continue swirling. Nothing is going to change on the fake report front when it comes to Kardashian and West, but this report can be ignored now that Gossip Cop has debunked it."
"LOS ANGELES‚Äî(Spoiler alert: This column has spoilers about the movie, ‚ÄúInterstellar.‚Äù) Why was Matt Damon‚Äôs casting in ‚ÄúInterstellar‚Äù kept under wraps until recently? This question and more were answered by spouses Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, director and producer, respectively, of the sci-fi/adventure/drama.  ‚ÄúInterstellar,‚Äù written by Chris and his brother Jonah, follows a team of explorers as they travel beyond the galaxy to find another home for humankind since Earth is nearing its end.  While ‚ÄúInterstellar‚Äù features some stunning visual images of the voyage, the film succeeds more when it delves into relationships through a family, that of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an experienced pilot, and his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet).  ADVERTISEMENT  Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn portray Murph at various ages while Casey Affleck plays the older Tom. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, John Lithgow and Topher Grace round out the cast.  Excerpts from our interview:  Why did you keep Matt Damon‚Äôs casting a secret?  Chris Nolan (C): I imagined Doctor Mann a bit like from Joseph Conrad‚Äôs ‚ÄúHeart of Darkness.‚Äù You have Kurtz, this character that you hear about. Everybody says, ‚ÄúOh, he‚Äôs great. Maybe you‚Äôll get to meet him.‚Äù I really love the idea for an audience to go, when they see him, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs Matt Damon. It‚Äôs going to be okay.‚Äù  Matt very graciously agreed to do it. He didn‚Äôt have to shoot for long. So we didn‚Äôt want to market the film using him because he‚Äôs not in it very much. We didn‚Äôt want to mislead people. But Matt is a very important part of the movie. It‚Äôs fun to watch with an audience who doesn‚Äôt know because they haven‚Äôt heard about it.  Matt has the most amazing ability to project integrity and warmth. So he turns up in the film and he‚Äôs got a plan and it‚Äôs all going to be okay. For me, to realize that he‚Äôs a frail human being and subject to cowardice and all the terrible weaknesses that we all have‚Ä¶ he loved that challenge. I loved what he did with it.  Emma Thomas (E): If people get to watch the film twice, it‚Äôs so great watching Matt when you know what‚Äôs really going on.  C: When people see Matt‚Äôs face, they are like, oh, okay. It‚Äôs the lift that the movie needs at that point. Structurally, you have a lot of talk in the 20 minutes before. There‚Äôs a lot of negativity, a lot bad things happening. The film is very much going to a dark place at that point. So getting that lift in that way with a great actor and movie star coming on screen, is a good thing.  ADVERTISEMENT  How has the dynamics between the two of you evolved over the years?  E: (Laughs.) We love working together‚Äî obviously, with Jonah as well‚Äîin a large part because, when you are working with somebody whom you are tied to beyond by blood or marriage, there‚Äôs a lack of agenda. Or as Chris once said, I (Emma) have an agenda. He knows what it is. (Laughs.)  But there‚Äôs a level of trust that is fantastic, particularly when you are making a big movie like this one. I am often asked as a producer and when Chris is the director, ‚ÄúWhen do you tell Chris, no, he can‚Äôt have that?‚Äù The truth is, I am very lucky because Chris is also a producer. He takes every aspect of the filmmaking process very seriously.  He is very helpful in terms of trying to figure out how we make the film for the correct budget, and so on. To me, it‚Äôs never absolutely saying no. I tell Chris [how I feel about] certain things. We have discussions. But ultimately, it‚Äôs Chris‚Äô vision. He always has a very strong idea of what a film is going to be. He‚Äôs the director and it‚Äôs very much his film.  I see my job as being very much a facilitator for that, filtering out the things that he doesn‚Äôt have to worry about so he can concentrate on getting the film made.  C: It‚Äôs fantastic working with people you have worked with a long time and have a high degree of trust in. Emma is always very objective, which is great‚Ä¶ I consider Emma a very good gauge (from a moviegoer perspective) because she‚Äôs not particularly interested in science-fiction or science. (Laughs.)  I show her the film and ask, ‚ÄúAre you following the emotional threads?‚Äù What‚Äôs wonderful about working with someone like Emma is that I get an honest opinion, good or bad, instantly. There are no politics to it.  This film‚Äôs working title or code name was ‚ÄúFlora‚Äôs Letter,‚Äù a cinematic letter to your daughter. How is your relationship with your kids reflected in the story?  C: The relationship between a father and his children was clearly something I related to very strongly in the script. Murph was originally written as a boy in my brother‚Äôs draft. I changed the character to a girl‚Äîjust instinctively. It may well be because Flora, my eldest, is a girl.  You do have different relationships with sons and daughters. It really paid off with Matthew because what he was very determined about was that his character‚Äôs love for his children should be equal for both. The character having a girl and a boy took the burden off the idea of favoritism. It‚Äôs not that he loves Murph more than he loves Tom. There‚Äôs just a different relationship. And Murph is more interested in science and the things that have driven her father‚Äôs life.  E: Girls are much more complicated, I feel. And boys are rather‚Ä¶  C: Simple.  E: I wouldn‚Äôt say simple.  C: That‚Äôs what you were thinking, though.  E: It‚Äôs complicated. It‚Äôs one of my favorite things about the film. I almost don‚Äôt think of it as a big, spectacular space movie. I really love the relationships. They feel very real to me as the mother of a girl and boys.  When I watch Mackenzie‚Äôs performance, she feels incredibly real to me. I [see] my own daughter in her. Going back to the code name question, I will just say that we have always had code names for our films‚Äîour kids‚Äô names. It was just Flora‚Äôs turn (laughs).  What are the kids‚Äô ages?  E: Now that‚Äôs a difficult question (laughs). They are 12, 11, 9 and 7. Flora is the oldest.  Emma, you were quoted as saying that Chris could not have done this film 12 years ago when you didn‚Äôt have kids. Can you both talk about that?  E: I am not saying that Chris couldn‚Äôt have made this film 12 years ago. But there‚Äôs such a heart, such a reality to the relationships in the movie. The reason we pick a movie to make‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs a long process‚Äîis that you have to feel an affinity for the story. You have to want to put that story up on the screen.  The place that Chris and I are in now is very different from where we were 12 years ago. This is a story that we are interested in telling. It‚Äôs also a movie that is fun to watch with our kids. We watch different movies now than we did 12 years ago because the kids came along.  C: The simple answer is, I don‚Äôt know if I couldn‚Äôt [have done this movie 12 years ago], but I wouldn‚Äôt have and I didn‚Äôt. Becoming a father was a very big change in my life, something that affected my outlook and the kind of stories that I am interested in telling and in ways that I would have never been able to predict and not in simple ways.  We did a press conference yesterday and Matthew was asked about being a father. He said he could have played the part even before he had kids. What I didn‚Äôt say to him because I didn‚Äôt want to embarrass him‚Äîbut I am going to embarrass him now‚Äîis that I would have found it very difficult to cast someone who wasn‚Äôt a father. Matthew was absolutely the right person to play the role. He‚Äôs a terrific father.  Why did you choose a Dylan Thomas poem to use in the film?  C: Those lines at the end‚Äî‚ÄúDo not go gentle into that good night‚Ä¶ Rage, rage against the dying of the light‚Äù‚ÄîI have [not] heard a better way of expressing the sentiment of death, dying, the end of the world, any of those things. There‚Äôs such a raw emotion in those words; they speak to me so strongly. I didn‚Äôt want to write my own version of that. Another example, which I didn‚Äôt use, would be of TS Elliot saying, ‚ÄúThis is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.‚Äù  (E-mail the columnist at rvnepales_5585@yahoo.com.

"Since the #MYCALVINS campaign kicked off last year, it has seen a rollout of some of music and fashion‚Äôs brightest stars take centre stage. The first instalment of the campaign saw Solange, Kelela and Dev Hynes model both denim and underwear into one whilst the second instalment saw A$AP Rocky and his A$AP Mob swag their way through a barn in the famous jeans. The most recent edition saw supermodel Cindy Crawford‚Äôs children Kaia and Presley Gerber show us what it means to be family ‚Äì the main focus of the campaign.  When it comes to famous families there probably isn‚Äôt one that stands out more than the Kardashians (even if it is just because you love to hate them), making them the perfect choice to front the latest set of images. Fronted by the Kardashian and Jenner sisters (Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie if you needed reminding), it sees them in white underwear lounging on a giant blanket from the SS18 show.  Elsewhere, Kim wears a Canadian Tux (double denim if you‚Äôre not familiar) and Kylie sports a matching black and white set from the runway show. Although Khloe and Kourtney have not been the faces of any high fashion campaigns before, Kim starred in Balmain‚Äôs AW16 campaign alongside husband Kanye. Kylie and Kendall also fronted the AW15 season for the Parisian house. Not to mention Marc Jacobs, Fendi, Givenchy under Kendall‚Äôs belt too.  The campaign drops at a time where rumours are circling as to whether Kylie is pregnant or not. Eagle-eyed fans will note that she is pictured artfully covering her stomach with a CK blanket. Conspiracy?! No doubt Kris‚Äôs plan for the family (and new baby ‚Äì hi Chicago!) will be unveiled soon. Meanwhile, the campaign will continue to run throughout the season. Keep an eye out for who will front it next."
"Chrissy Teigen doesn‚Äôt mind calling out her husband for the whole world to see.  The supermodel took to Twitter to roast John Legend for stealing all ‚Äï yes, all ‚Äï of her phone chargers.  ‚ÄúYes @johnlegend I buy and leave all the phone chargers all around the house just so you can unplug them all and take them to work with you. all of them!‚Äù Teigen wrote on Wednesday, her words dripping with sarcasm. ‚ÄúI love that you love chargers! they‚Äôre all for you! I just love you that‚Äôs why I buy them. because you love them!‚Äù  The ‚ÄúLip Sync Battle‚Äù commentator tweeted then that she was going to purchase a unicorn charger so Legend might avoid taking it:  @johnlegend take this one u thief ‚Äî christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 8, 2018  As one Twitter user put it, the two are facing a ‚Äúpower struggle.‚Äù  It sounds like the two of you are facing a bit of a... power struggle.    I'll show myself out. ‚Äî Jon S.

You. You are why I need 50000 chargers on my rider. ‚Äî Ruby Rose (@RubyRose) February 8, 2018  Many others shared their power struggles:  This is marriage summed up in one tweet. ‚Äî Katieüë∏üèº (@katiemylady__) February 8, 2018  I‚Äôm married to the same kind of person.

When the musician posted a beautiful ‚Äï but low-quality ‚Äï photo on Instagram for his wife‚Äôs birthday, Teigen simply commented ‚ÄúHow about a hi-res,‚Äù a reference to the blurriness of the picture.  They also use outlets like Twitter to help each other, like the time Teigen seemingly couldn‚Äôt find one of the couple‚Äôs toilets (yes, really). Luckily, Legend knew what happened and tweeted an explanation.  And despite all the charger-stealing and blurry pictures, Teigen told Us Weekly in a 2016 interview why she won‚Äôt ever leave Legend."

"After several weeks of fun, heartfelt performances, Sasha Pieterse's Dancing With the Stars journey has come to an end, and the actress admits that she's sad to say goodbye.  Pieterse and her pro partner, Gleb Savchenko, were eliminated at the end of DWTS's Disney Night on Monday, and the pair spoke with ET's Keltie Knight after the show.  ""I'm not mad, I'm just really bummed. I really wanted to be here,"" the Pretty Little Liars star shared. ""It sucks, but I made some amazing friends, I had such a good time, and I feel like I'm just grateful.""  One thing she's particularly grateful for is Savchenko, whom she's become fast friends with over the course of the season. They're so tight, in fact, that Pieterse's pro partner is going to give a few lessons to her fiance, Hudson Sheaffer.  ""[Gleb] can't get away from me that easy, he's going to teach my fianc√© how to dance,"" she said, smiling.  WATCH: Sasha Pieterse Channels 'The Little Mermaid' on 'DWTS's Disney Night, Reveals She's Lost 37 Pounds  Going into Monday night, Pieterse and Savchenko were tied with five other couples for fourth place, having earned a score of 24 out of 30 for their foxtrot during the show's Most Memorable Year night last week.  So, while they weren't near the top of the leader board, they had been in past weeks and they weren't really on anyone's list of stars who were expected to go home tonight. (The same goes for Frankie Muniz and Witney Carson, who were one of the other couples to earn a 24 last week and also found themselves in jeopardy during Monday's elimination.)  PHOTOS: The Complete List: 'Dancing with the Stars' Winners  Savchenko admits that the elimination was just as much a shock to him as anyone. ""I never thought it would happen. I thought we have another couple of weeks at least,"" he said. ""But it's a dance competition, someone's gotta go and unfortunately it's us.""  ""I'm so proud of my partner,"" he added. ""She came so far, she did such a good job tonight. You've shown such a huge improvement and as a teacher, I'm really, really proud of you.""  Throughout the season, Pieterse, 21, got candid with Savchecko and her fans about her battle with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a hormone imbalance that led to her gaining nearly 70 pounds in around two years. On Monday, she revealed that, since joining the show, she'd managed to lose 37 pounds and previously said that the show has helped her to start ""feeling like me again.""

""It really has been an incredible experience and you can't really describe it unless you're doing it. It's been amazing for my soul, for me just getting back to who I am, [and] obviously for my body and my health,"" she shared.

"Steven Bochco, a producer whose boundary-pushing series such as ‚ÄúHill Street Blues‚Äù and ‚ÄúNYPD Blue‚Äù helped define the modern TV drama, has died. He was 74.  Bochco had been battling a rare form of leukemia for several years. He had a transplant in late 2014 that was credited with prolonging his life. A family spokesman told the Associated Press that he died in his sleep on Sunday after a battle with cancer, but did not release details of a memorial service.  Working with different collaborators, Bochco co-created some of TV‚Äôs most popular series for more than 20 years while helping to create the template for modern hourlongs featuring large ensemble casts, serialized storylines and edgy content.  The recipient of numerous industry awards, including the Humanitas Prize and Peabody honors, Bochco was nominated for an Emmy 30 times in his capacities as producer and writer, winning 10.  On ‚ÄúNYPD Blue,‚Äù he consciously set out to expand the parameters of what was acceptable on broadcast television, and he recalled sitting with then-ABC Entertainment chief Robert Iger ‚Äî who went on to become CEO of the Walt Disney Co. ‚Äî drawing naked figures, determining exactly how much of the body could be shown.  Related 'NYPD Blue' Follow-Up Series Lands Pilot Production Commitment at ABC 'NYPD Blue' at 25: Dennis Franz, Amy Brenneman, Gordon Clapp Reflect on Legacy  Bochco launched such series as ‚ÄúHill Street Blues‚Äù ‚Äî a ground-breaking, Emmy-winning cop show ‚Äî and ‚ÄúL.A. Law‚Äù for NBC before entering into a landmark 10-series deal with ABC in the late 1980s. The relationship produced some clear hits (‚ÄúNYPD Blue,‚Äù ‚ÄúDoogie Howser, M.D.‚Äù) and notable failures, including the musical police drama ‚ÄúCop Rock‚Äù and the serialized courtroom drama ‚ÄúMurder One,‚Äù which followed a single murder trial over an entire season. As virtual proof the latter was ahead of its time, Bochco essentially revived it in 2014, under the title ‚ÄúMurder in the First,‚Äù for TNT, where it ran for three years.  Asked how he could risk gambling on a musical like ‚ÄúCop Rock‚Äù given the richness of his ABC pact, Bochco once joked, ‚ÄúWith my deal, how could I not?‚Äù  Bochco wasn‚Äôt above engaging in public spats and power struggles, from complaining about his treatment by network executives to tussling with recalcitrant stars. In one of the highest-profile tiffs, his rift with David Caruso during the first season of ‚ÄúNYPD Blue‚Äù led to the actor‚Äôs exit, a considerable gamble for a series in its first season. Bochco replaced him with former ‚ÄúL.A. Law‚Äù co-star Jimmy Smits, and the program went on to run for 11 years.  Although Bochco often consciously pressed against boundaries and seemed to delight in testing censors, he recalled that the breakthrough storytelling style of ‚ÄúHill Street‚Äù was born more out of necessity than design.  ‚ÄúWe had so many characters that we realized we couldn‚Äôt service 10 or 11 characters within the confines of a single episode, so the only way that we could really do justice to the size of the world was by creating storylines that spilled over the margins,‚Äù he told the New York Times.  The producer also had a way of celebrating even his failures. When ‚ÄúCop Rock‚Äù came to an end after a mere 11 episodes, what turned out to be the final episode incorporated a musical sequence where a fat lady literally sang, signaling its cancellation.  Bochco also appeared to relish nettling his critics, saying that the pressure campaign waged against ‚ÄúNYPD Blue‚Äù ‚Äì which helped prompt dozens of stations not to air the show when it premiered ‚Äì ultimately helped promote the series and turned it into a hit.  Steven Ronald Bochco was born in New York, the son of a violin virtuoso (which inspired his production company‚Äôs onscreen logo). He attended NYU and subsequently Carnegie Institute of Technology, receiving a degree in theater.  He started his writing career in the 1960s. Credits included ‚ÄúColumbo,‚Äù with an episode directed by Steven Spielberg, who also came up through the ranks at Universal Television.  Bochco wrote such features as ‚ÄúThe Movie Maker‚Äù and ‚ÄúSilent Running‚Äù before he began to steadfastly focus on television and create his own shows, including ‚ÄúDelvecchio,‚Äù a drama starring Judd Hirsch. Later came ‚ÄúBay City Blues,‚Äù about a baseball team, which didn‚Äôt last.  With ‚ÄúHill Street Blues,‚Äù Bochco and co-creator Michael Kozoll broke the dramatic mold, featuring a huge ensemble cast and gritty narrative while juggling various subplots. NBC was in the ratings cellar at the time, but its patience with prestige programs like ‚ÄúHill Street‚Äù and ‚ÄúCheers‚Äù was rewarded after ‚ÄúThe Cosby Show‚Äù premiered in 1984, turning its Thursday lineup into a ratings juggernaut.  Beyond his own career, Bochco helped shepherd along those of several other prominent writers, hiring David Milch on ‚ÄúHill Street‚Äù and enlisting David E. Kelley ‚Äî then a Boston lawyer ‚Äî to work on ‚ÄúL.A. Law.‚Äù  When the Producers Guild of America honored Bochco with its David Susskind lifetime achievement award in 1999, his track record of quality programs was cited as ‚Äúthe standard all television producers strive for.‚Äù  For all of his success with police dramas and legal shows, Bochco produced a wide variety of series, from the animated satire ‚ÄúCapitol Critters‚Äù to ‚ÄúPublic Morals,‚Äù an edgy comedy on which he collaborated with Jay Tarses that also ran into standards-and-practices problems.  Although major successes eluded him in his later years, Bochco remained active and in demand, taking over as showrunner of ‚ÄúCommander in Chief‚Äù ‚Äî an ABC drama that featured Geena Davis as the first female U.S. president ‚Äî and co-creating ‚ÄúOver There,‚Äù an FX series that focused on soldiers in Iraq and their families back home. The latter, introduced while the war was ongoing in 2005, engendered controversy because of the timing and subject matter.  Bochco also produced the legal drama ‚ÄúRaising the Bar‚Äù for TNT that ran two seasons in 2008 and 2009.  The producer also tried his hand at novels, writing ‚ÄúDeath by Hollywood,‚Äù a darkly comic satire with a struggling screenwriter as its protagonist. His struggle with leukemia prompted him to write his autobiography, ‚ÄúTruth is a Total Defense: My Fifty Years in Television,‚Äù which he self-published in 2016.  Bochco was loyal to his friends ‚Äî certain actors appeared in his shows time and again ‚Äî but could also nurse a grudge. He also became disenchanted with what he saw as creative interference from the networks, hewing more toward cable.  Bochco‚Äôs association with the business extended to his family. His second wife, Barbara Bosson, co-starred in ‚ÄúHill Street Blues,‚Äù and his sister, Joanna Frank, had a recurring role on ‚ÄúL.A.

"CLOSE TV host Maria Menounos had to pick just the right time to tell her family that she had a brain tumor. Time  Maria Menounos at the 2015 Annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. (Photo: Michael Loccisano, Getty Images)  NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî Maria Menounos says she has been diagnosed with a benign brain tumor and has announced her resignation from E! News.  Menounos tells People magazine that she underwent surgery last month to remove a golf-ball-sized tumor discovered in February. Menounos says 99.9 percent of the tumor was removed during the seven-hour procedure on June 8. She says there's a small chance that it could come back.  E! says Monday that Menounos is leaving the network after three years. The cable network says it believes Menounos will tackle her health struggles ""with the same fierce dedication she is known for.""  Menounos, who is also caring for her mother battling stage-four brain cancer, wrote a lengthy Instagram post on Monday thanking her supporters, her doctors and her fianc√© Keven Undergaro.  ""First I wanna say thank you all for the well wishes, prayers and support. It's been a crazy time here in our home. I want you all to know that I'm ok! Seriously I'm recovering well and should be as good as new very very soon! Luckily I don't need any further treatments but I can't say the same about my mom. So please keep her in your prayers,"" she captioned the photo of her and her mom.

"Caitlyn Jenner has spoken out about Rob Kardashian‚Äôs social media rampage, in which he posted naked photos of ex-fianc√©e Blac Chyna.  The I Am Cait alum, 67, weighed in on the situation while appearing on The View on Friday, July 14, along with revenge porn victim Mischa Barton and her lawyer Lisa Bloom, who is also representing Chyna. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a tough deal. We‚Äôve had to deal with this, obviously in our family,‚Äù Jenner said. ‚ÄúRob was stupid for doing that. He kind of apologized.‚Äù  Jenner clarified that he has not had much of a relationship with Kardashian, 30, in recent years, though. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never met Blac Chyna, never met the kid [Dream Kardashian]. Rob, I haven‚Äôt really haven‚Äôt had a serious conversation with in years,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve kind of been out of that scene, so I really can‚Äôt comment on what‚Äôs going on there.‚Äù (The rest of the Kardashians have also distanced themselves from Jenner after the former Olympian made damaging claims in her memoir about ex-wife Kris Jenner.)  When asked by the View cohosts if she was surprised by Kardashian‚Äôs actions, the former decathlete replied, ‚ÄúGuys ‚Äî I know because I used to be over on that team ‚Äî can be really stupid and do stupid things. I‚Äôve tried to warn my kids ‚Äî all of them, I‚Äôve got a lot of kids ‚Äî you‚Äôve got to pick your friends, and it‚Äôs hard to do. You can be tremendously deceived, and it‚Äôs not your fault, but you have to pick your friends wisely.‚Äù  The Arthur George sock designer could be facing legal trouble after he went on an explosive social media tirade on July 5, in which he claimed the 29-year-old model cheated on him and that he paid for her bills, cars, jewelry and weight-loss surgeries. He also posted several nude photos of Chyna on Instagram and Twitter.  The Lashed Cosmetics founder obtained a temporary restraining order against him on Monday, July 10. That same week, a source told Us Weekly that the exes ‚Äúhaven‚Äôt spoken‚Äù since the social media war. As long as Rob obeys the order of protection, Chyna won‚Äôt pursue a criminal investigation, Bloom told Entertainment Tonight. ‚ÄúFor now, Chyna has said she does not want to go to the police or pursue the criminal route,‚Äù Bloom told the outlet.  If Chyna changes her mind, however, sexual privacy attorney and expert Carrie Goldberg told Us that Kardashian could face major consequences for sharing naked photos without his ex‚Äôs consent. ‚ÄúIt is a misdemeanor and it is punishable by up to six months in jail and then also a fine,‚Äù Goldberg told Us, adding that Chyna could also sue her former Rob & Chyna costar for financial damages.  Since the incident, Kardashian has apologized. His actions ‚Äúwere a spontaneous reaction that he regrets,‚Äù his attorney Robert Shapiro told TMZ on Monday. ‚ÄúRob‚Äôs only concern is for the well-being of baby Dream.‚Äù  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"Third generation Greek immigrant John Stamos has long been a proud American, and now that he‚Äôs also become a proud papa for the first time, he‚Äôll be sharing his patriotism with his new son, Billy.  Stamos, 54, will be bringing nearly 2-month-old Billy along on his first cross-country trip as the Fuller House star/producer returns to host PBS‚Äôs annual broadcast of A Capitol Fourth, the national 4th of July celebration in Washington, D.C.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  It‚Äôs been a celebratory year thus far for Stamos, who wed model/actress Caitlin McHugh in February and welcomed their new baby ‚Äì named after his late father ‚Äì in April. But the timing of the new arrival made Stamos wonder if he‚Äôd be able to return to host the 38th annual 4th of July broadcast from the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol again this year after deeply enjoying his debut stint in 2017.  John Stamosand Caitlin McHugh Rachel Murray/Getty  ‚ÄúFortunately, I‚Äôve been able to take off work now, but I said, ‚ÄòWell I don‚Äôt know if I could do [the concert] again, because I‚Äôm having a little baby,‚Äô ‚Äù Stamos told PEOPLE at a photo shoot to promote the celebration. ‚ÄúAnd they said, ‚ÄòWell, what can we do to get you?‚Äô ‚Äú  The solution? Family road trip! ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòWell, I got to bring the kid, then.‚Äô So we‚Äôre bringing Billy! And PBS just sent this really cute onesie that says ‚ÄòFuture Host,‚Äô and all this patriotic stuff.‚Äù  It‚Äôll be baby Stamos‚Äô first cross-country excursion, coming on the heels of a slightly not-so-smooth local road trip, Stamos admitted. ‚ÄúIt was Mother‚Äôs Day and Caitlin‚Äôs birthday, so we went down to Laguna [Beach], and it was the first time we didn‚Äôt have a nanny ‚Äî that was rough!‚Äù he laughed. ‚Äú[But] so far, it‚Äôs been a dream, and when I look at him, I feel like I‚Äôve been thinking about that face for a long time.‚Äù  Stamos said that fatherhood has been everything that he expected it would be, and it‚Äôs deepened his connection to his country. ‚ÄúI always knew it was going to be like this,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúIt took me longer than it should‚Äôve, but I knew that I would be a family and be contributing to this country, and holding onto the morals and the values that my parents had, that I like to think of the world having. It‚Äôs a time to be kind and graceful to people. It just takes so much energy to block all the negativity. I‚Äôm really trying to get people together.‚Äù  As a bonus, Stamos‚Äô longtime friends and frequent, if unofficial, bandmates ‚Äî the iconic, multi-platinum selling music legends The Beach Boys ‚Äî will join him in the nation‚Äôs capitol as both performers and the recipients of the fifth annual A CAPITOL FOURTH‚Äôs National Artistic Achievement Award, with Stamos presenting.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just the biggest glorified fan, really,‚Äù Stamos said of his connection to the group, which goes back to the 1980s, appearing in their music video for ‚ÄúKokomo,‚Äù frequently joining them on stage behind the drum kit and executive producing the 2000 miniseries The Beach Boys: An American Family. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a fan who gets to hang out with them.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: New Dad John Stamos Opens Up About Fatherhood & Reveals Which Parent His Son Looks Like  So much so that the band has become as close as family: founding member Mike Love even got ordained and officiated Stamos and McHugh‚Äôs wedding ceremony.

But they‚Äôre coming there for a different reason, to see something. Here I felt they were part of it.

I let the producer and the director know, ‚ÄòI may stop and talk to somebody,‚Äô and we did it.

"Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara 'found love' while shooting biblical epic - report BelfastTelegraph.co.uk Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara have long been friends, but are said to have ""found love"" while shooting Mary Magdalene in Italy last year (16). https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/joaquin-phoenix-and-rooney-mara-found-love-while-shooting-biblical-epic-report-35359969.html https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/news/article35359968.ece/08b80/AUTOCROP/h342/cover_media_cmg95c39be0-84b3-485c-9ac4-66db72a2befb_0  Email  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara have long been friends, but are said to have ""found love"" while shooting Mary Magdalene in Italy last year (16).  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara's friendship reportedly turned into romance when they were shooting upcoming film Mary Magdalene.  The pair have long been close friends but it was while filming the biblical epic, in which Rooney plays the title character and Joaquin stars as Jesus Christ, in Italy last year (16) that they are said to have ""found love"".  A source told the New York Post's gossip column Page Six that the new relationship is the reason neither star attended the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday (08Jan17), where Rooney's movie Lion was up for four gongs.  ‚ÄúThey were holed up together in the desert (instead),‚Äù the insider added.  While images emerged of Joaquin and Rooney shooting Mary Magdalene, they were also seen spending time together off set, including sharing cigarettes on the balcony of a room at their hotel in Matera, southern Italy, last November (16).  The claims surrounding Rooney's new romance comes after reports she has split from director Charlie McDowell after six years together. Both Rooney and Charlie's representatives had no comment when contacted by Page Six, and the pair have not been photographed together since August (16).  Despite Page Six's report, Joaquin's representative has denied the actor and Rooney are anything apart from ""good friends"".  ‚ÄúThey worked on (2013 film) Her, Mary Magdalene and their next movie (Don‚Äôt Worry, He Won‚Äôt Get Far on Foot, due for release in 2018),‚Äù his rep said. ‚ÄúThey are and have been good friends for quite a long time.‚Äù  Joaquin has previously been romantically linked to actresses Liv Tyler and Anna Paquin, and DJ Allie Teilz. He hit headlines in 2014 when he announced he was engaged to a yoga instructor who had helped him ""harness his hog"", but it was later revealed to be an unusual joke.  ¬© Cover Media  Belfast Telegraph Digital"
"The Second Amendment has continuously been under assault in the United States and in the United Nations. Most often, the attacks came from Democrats and other leftists who have long wanted to see a disarmed populace, with only the government and military maintaining access to firearms. Liberals know that an armed population will not willingly become slaves.The United Nations has long worked, on an international level, to undermine the right of individuals to keep and bear arms, particularly the right of Americans to do so. In a recent document, it sounds like representatives of the United States promised ‚Äúfull implementation‚Äù of the UN‚Äôs gun-control agreement, and in doing so essentially forfeit the Second and Tenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Perhaps most interestingly of all, the mainstream media has been entirely silent on the issue‚Ä¶ perhaps they don‚Äôt want to laud this win and stir up patriots?The Third Review Conference for the UN‚Äôs Programme of Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons concluded at the end of June. Apparently, American ‚Äòrepresentatives‚Äô at the conference agreed to begin developing ‚Äòlegal frameworks‚Äô (generally, laws and regulations) that will enforce ‚Äúproper management‚Äù of ‚Äúsmall arms and light weapons‚Äù stockpiles.It seems that this agreement also includes ‚Äòstockpiles‚Äô owned by American citizens.The United Nations, an extremely corrupt international government organization with a long track record of failure and few (if any) successes to its name, is hoping that the United States will help it to track (and likely, confiscate) firearms in the country.The conference put out a plan that included demands for a massive database of all organizations, parties, and individuals that manufacture, own, sell, trade, or transfer firearms or ammunition.This will serve as a means for the United Nations to find ‚Äòillicit‚Äô ammunition and firearms.Of course, given the UN‚Äôs history of pushing for gun control measures, it‚Äôs not beyond the pale to believe that the organization would declare wide swaths of firearms illegal, or that home manufacture of ammunition for private use or resale is illegal.If the United States passes a law, or an executive order, to compel it to cooperate with the UN‚Äôs gun control objectives, that could mean that the government would actually seize such equipment on behalf of the international agency.However, it gets worse still. The ‚ÄòProgramme of Action‚Äô also allows UN ‚Äòpeacekeepers‚Äô to go to member nations to ‚Äòassist‚Äô in meeting the goals of the program.So, if the organization decides that the United States should hand over its civilian-owned AR-15s for destruction, and then decides that the process is taking too long, they could send their blue helmet and beret-wearing goons to American shores to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô speed the process up.The conference produced a list of six points to which all member states agreed.Firstly, they all agreed to establish laws in their nations to support the effective implementation of the Programme of Action (PoA).Secondly, they agreed to strengthen ‚Äòcoordinated approaches‚Äô nationally for implementing the PoA.Thirdly, they promised to include women in the mechanism related to said implementation.Fourth, the representatives agreed to create a ‚Äònational point of contact‚Äô to act in the role of liaison between nations and the UN.Fifth, they promised to ‚Äòmake better use‚Äô of existing data to push various social and corporate policies in order to be ‚Äòin compliance‚Äô with UN demands concerning women, disarmament, and ‚Äònon-proliferation,‚Äô which generally means not making new firearms for the civilian market.Finally, they agreed to ‚Äòsignificantly reduce‚Äô illicit flows of small arms through means such as ‚Äòvoluntary surrender‚Äô programmes and ‚Äòillicit weapons‚Äô recovery.In other words, the United States government is expected to help push an absurdly anti-Second Amendment set of demands on the American people.If they don‚Äôt push that set of rules upon the people swiftly enough, then the UN will decide if it wants to send armed peacekeepers to the nation or not.This agreement is wildly unconstitutional, and that‚Äôs being kind. It violates the Second Amendment, obviously, by its very nature, but it goes further than that.By requiring that state governments, county governments, and local governments bend to the wills of the federal government (and international government), it violates the Tenth Amendment, which states that powers not given to the federal government in the constitution are ‚Äúreserved to the states respectively.‚ÄùThe idea of a ‚Äòliaison‚Äô between the federal government and the UN is also legally questionable.Apparently, the United States‚Äô representative(s) don‚Äôt see a problem with this kind of unconstitutional nonsense.Perhaps it‚Äôs time that Donald Trump remove the United States from the United Nations, an organization that does little more than take money from America and hands it to corrupt nations via poorly-run bureaucracies.Perhaps, before the UN lectures America and other nations for recognizing the rights of their citizens to keep and bear arms, it should look at its own failures to stop the ‚Äòillicit firearms trade.‚ÄôUN Peacekeeper operations are infamous for leaving behind firearms, particularly in the third world. There‚Äôs a reason that, among the millions of Ak-pattern rifles in Africa, there are also hundreds of thousands of G3‚Äôs and CETME rifles from European militaries; the UN leaves them behind when they deploy.If the UN pushes the issue, they‚Äôll likely find that the United States is not so quick to acquiesce as third-world nations who constantly have their hands out for ‚Äòfree‚Äô stuff. If they‚Äôre going to attempt to undermine the laws of a nation, perhaps they should no longer operate out of the nation with legal immunity."
"Of all the couples that walked the Oscars red carpet together on Sunday night, it‚Äôs likely none had the same symbolic significance as Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino. The actresses were among the earliest to come forward with their stories of being sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein, bringing into stark relief the impact Weinstein had on their careers and on Hollywood at large. Sorvino, who won an Oscar in 1996 for the Weinstein-released Mighty Aphrodite, told The New Yorker she believed that, by turning down Weinstein‚Äôs advances, he had actively discouraged other filmmakers from working with her. Judd, who spoke to The New York Times for the first blockbuster story about Weinstein, said at the time, ‚ÄúWomen have been talking about Harvey amongst ourselves for a long time, and it‚Äôs simply beyond time to have the conversation publicly.‚Äù (Weinstein has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.)  In December, Peter Jackson told New Zealand‚Äôs Stuff that executives at Miramax told him about both Judd and Sorvino, ‚Äúthey were a nightmare to work with and we should avoid them at all costs. This was probably in 1998. At the time, we had no reason to question what these guys were telling us‚Äîbut in hindsight, I realize that this was very likely the Miramax smear campaign in full swing. I now suspect we were fed false information about both of these talented women‚Äîand as a direct result their names were removed from our casting list.‚Äù  Sorvino tweeted an emotional response to Jackson‚Äôs revelation:  Speaking to Vanity Fair‚Äôs Krista Smith on the red carpet, Judd and Sorvino spoke about the goals of the Time‚Äòs Up movement: ‚ÄúI want people to know that this movement isn‚Äôt stopping, we‚Äôre going forward until we have an equitable and safe world for women,‚Äú Sorvino said:  During the ceremony, Judd will present an award alongside two other women who have accused Weinstein: Annabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek. As Rebecca Keegan reported from the Oscars rehearsals, Sciorra‚Äîwho claimed to The New Yorker that Weinstein raped her, and that her career suffered as a result‚Äîseemed visibly overwhelmed to be onstage.  Though the Time‚Äôs Up movement, which announced its presence forcefully with pins and an all-black dress code at the Golden Globes, announced it planned to look beyond the red carpet in its activism, Judd and Sorvino‚Äôs united presence was a reminder of how striking, and symbolic, a red carpet appearance can be.

"Travis Scott has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after being arrested during a concert in Arkansas in May 2017 on charges including inciting a riot, Us Weekly confirms.  The 25-year-old rapper‚Äôs attorney Jon Nelson tells Us that his client‚Äôs case was quietly resolved in January through plea negotiations. Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges ‚Äî inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child ‚Äî were dismissed.  ‚ÄúObviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,‚Äù Nelson says. ‚ÄúTo think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor‚Äôs office finally did the right thing ‚Äî they made an offer that he agreed to. ‚Ä¶ If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.‚Äù  The attorney added that he believes the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from Scott‚Äôs record.  The Rogers Police Department told Us at the time of the arrest that the ‚ÄúGoosebumps‚Äù rapper ‚Äúencouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concertgoer safety.‚Äù He was taken into custody at the Benton County Jail and released later in the evening.  The news of Scott‚Äôs guilty plea comes just a few days after he became a father with girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who gave birth to the couple‚Äôs daughter, Stormi, on Thursday, February 1. A source exclusively told Us that the 20-year-old reality star is ‚Äúloving starting a family‚Äù with Scott, whom she began dating in April 2017.

"Two years into a relationship with her boyfriend, actress Vanessa Kirby was shocked to wake up one day and find out she was married to Tom Cruise.  While filming ‚ÄúMission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout‚Äù with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.  ‚ÄúEven though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‚ÄòThe next wife falls at his feet,'‚Äù Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. ‚ÄúThe most disconcerting thing was the people I didn‚Äôt think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‚ÄòAre you OK?‚Äô I don‚Äôt think they believe anything they read now because you just can‚Äôt.  ‚ÄúNone of it is real,‚Äù Kirby added. ‚ÄúTo be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äù actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,‚Äù Kirby shared. ‚Äú[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he‚Äôs my best friend, so that‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.‚Äù  She added, ‚ÄúIf you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don‚Äôt, then it‚Äôs not.‚Äù"
"We‚Äôve got people in charge of important shit who don‚Äôt believe in science, the actor said Thursday night in Los Angeles.  Harrison Ford got political on Thursday night at 3Labs in Culver City when he was honored by Conservation International, a nonprofit environmental group he has been involved with for 26 years.  ""We face an unprecedented moment in this country. Today's greatest threat is not climate change, not pollution, not flood or fire,"" Ford said during his acceptance speech of the Founders' Award. ""It's that we've got people in charge of important shit who don't believe in science.""  He went on to criticize those politicians who let ""political or economic self-interest denigrate or belittle sound scientific understanding of the causes and effects of human pressure on the environment.""  Ford serves as executive vice chair of Conservation International, which celebrated its 30th anniversary at the event. The group aims to protect nature and specifically focused on a 'No Forests, No Future' theme at the gala, highlighting the Amazon rainforest and its importance in addressing climate change.  ""I'm here tonight for one reason: I care deeply for the natural world. It's not about me, it's not about me at all, it's about this other world we're going to leave behind,"" the actor said. ""If we don't stop the destruction of nature, nothing else will matter. Jobs won't matter, our economies won't matter, our freedoms and ethics won't matter, our children's education and potential won't matter, peace, prosperity. If we end the ability of a healthy natural world to sustain humanity nothing else will matter, simply said.""  Ford has been deeply involved in the environmental cause for several decades, meeting with lawmakers, businesses and communities to discuss how to improve conservation policy and practices.  ""Other than my family, doing this work has been the most important thing of my life,"" he said. ""Nature doesn't need people, people need nature.""  Music festival Rock in Rio and SC Johnson were also honored at the event, which drew Calista Flockhart, Sophia Bush and Arielle Kebbel, with a performance by Vanessa Carlton. Conservation International showed its virtual reality film Under the Canopy as well, giving guests a real-life look into the Amazon.  ""If you protect tropical forests, if you end tropical forest deforestation, it would be the equivalent of basically taking every car in the planet and making it into a Tesla overnight, that's how important it is. The epicenter of that is the Amazon,"" said M. Sanjayan, the group's CEO and an environmental news analyst.  Conservation International launched the largest tropical forest restoration project in the world this year as a result, and Ford will have continued involvement in these worldwide environmental projects.  ""We're not going to depend on governments alone, we'll help equip communities and businesses to lead,"" he said. ""It's a long road but I have hope."""
"Engraged over new co-host Ryan Seacrest‚Äòs brazen bid to move Live to Los Angeles, daytime diva Kelly Ripa has told bosses, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done!‚Äù  RadarOnline.com has learned the popular chatfest is in chaos after Ripa, 46, told network honchos she‚Äôs fed up watching them kiss up to Seacrest ‚Äî and she‚Äôs not going to take it anymore!  ‚ÄúKelly‚Äôs announced that if push comes to shove, she‚Äôs ready to walk,‚Äù said an insider close to the syndicated show.  PHOTOS: Kelly Ripa‚Äôs 8 Most Shocking Secrets & Scandals Exposed  ‚ÄúKelly‚Äôs given them an ultimatum ‚Äî it‚Äôs her way or the highway!‚Äù continued the insider. ‚ÄúShe feels that she was stabbed in the back over the whole Michael Strahan fiasco, and she‚Äôs not going to allow it to happen again!‚Äù  According to sources, Ripa exploded when Seacrest pushed for Live with Kelly and Ryan to be moved permanently to Los Angeles to suit his schedule ‚Äî after ABC announced he‚Äôll return as host of the rebooted American Idol next year.  That meant Seacrest, 42, would have to be in L.A. on Sunday nights to film Idol, then board a red-eye flight to New York to be on set for Live on Monday morning and host his radio show.  PHOTOS: Truce! Kelly Ripa & Michael Strahan‚Äôs On-Air Feud Is Finally Over  Apparently that was too daunting for Seacrest ‚Äî and he pushed for the L.A. move.  ‚ÄúAfter Ryan made his demand, network brass wanted Kelly to uproot her family and move to California,‚Äù tattled a source close to Seacrest. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when Kelly put her foot down and said, ‚ÄòNo way!'‚Äù  ‚ÄúKelly pointed out that her production company with husband Mark Consuelos, Milojo, is based in New York and so is Live,‚Äù said the source.  PHOTOS: Kelly Ripa Spotted For The First Time Since Ditching Michael Strahan On ‚ÄòLive‚Äô  ‚ÄúShe also pointed out that her son, Joaquin, is about to begin high school in New York City. Producers have offered to have Joaquin home-schooled or provide a tutor for him, but she won‚Äôt pull him out of school.‚Äù  Producers are trying to convince Ripa to get on board ‚Äî even if it‚Äôs just during the period when Idol goes live, the source said.  Besides that, ratings have been tanking since Seacrest signed on, and ‚Äúbosses are telling Kelly [the move] will help the ratings because they‚Äôll have access to all the stars in Hollywood,‚Äù spilled the source.  PHOTOS: Lawsuits, Arrests, & More! Inside ‚ÄòSelfish‚Äô Michael Strahan‚Äôs Biggest Scandals  ‚ÄúBut Kelly feels once again the show that bears her name is being hijacked from her ‚Äî which is what happened with Michael Strahan!‚Äù  Since Live launched in 1983, it‚Äôs always been filmed in New York City ‚Äî although the hosts have changed, with Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford, Strahan and guest hosts playing musical chairs.  The source added: ‚ÄúKelly‚Äôs fuming that ABC would even consider it! All of her family and friends are on the East Coast ‚Äî and now she has to pack up and move for Ryan‚Äôs sake? That‚Äôs got to make her steaming mad!  PHOTOS: Kelly Betrayed Again! Michael Leaves ‚ÄòLive‚Äô To Co-Host GMA Already  ‚ÄúShe promised not to let this happen again to her and the show after Strahan jumped to Good Morning America. Now history seems to be repeating itself ‚Äî and she won‚Äôt have it!‚Äù  Another insider on Live told Radar: ‚ÄúKelly quit the show once before and she‚Äôd do it again! When she was angry with ABC for favoring Michael, she refused to come to work for a week. Now that ABC is treating Ryan like royalty, Kelly could be gone for good. She‚Äôs very emotional and thinks with her heart, not her head. Kelly needs to think she‚Äôs the top priority.‚Äù  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

"Ellen DeGeneres is desperate to save her marriage to Portia de Rossi. That‚Äôs why Ellen‚Äôs been urging her to attend counseling sessions with her, according to a new report. They‚Äôve hit a rough patch in their relationship and apparently Ellen wants them to get back on track before they head towards a divorce.  Things have gotten so bad between Ellen and Portia that they‚Äôve been fighting non-stop, both at home and in public. In fact, one insider said that Ellen and Portia often get into heated arguments on the set of her daytime talk show. To make matters worse, Ellen hates it when other people gossip about her personal problems. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs been pushing Portia to attend counseling sessions with her as one last effort to save their crumbling marriage.  One source close to the situation told Life & Style Weekly, ‚ÄúEllen has been in counseling, both solo and with Portia. Part of their therapy is to go on more date nights. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been seen out and more together lately. It‚Äôs all about spending quality time together, but still giving each other space during the workday.‚Äù  Yet, the last time Ellen and Portia were spotted together was back on February 25th during a pre-Oscars party in Los Angeles. Since then, Portia has been keeping her distance from Ellen, or at least in public. One of the reasons why Portia is looking for a way out is because she‚Äôs tired of having to constantly listen to Ellen and her demands. Previous reports even indicated that Portia was fed up with Ellen‚Äôs controlling behavior. Insiders say that Portia is fed up with Ellen calling all the shots at home. She feels like she lives in a golden cage with Ellen. If that weren‚Äôt enough, Ellen likes to have the last say, especially when it comes to her career, personal and even day-to-day choices.  Of course, time will only tell if Ellen and Portia‚Äôs counseling will save their marriage. Tell us, do you think Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are having marital issues? Could that be the reason why they haven‚Äôt been spotted in public together for several weeks now? Ellen herself has not made any comments about her personal life.

"Jennifer Aniston doesn't need your consolation, advice or Brad Pitt to validate her existence  ""I just want Jen to be happy *bursts into tears*""  ""But she's Rachael!! She has to find love!!""  ""I keep wondering when that girl will find love""  ""If Jennifer Aniston can't find love, what chance do the rest of us have at happiness!""  As a journalist covering films and entertainment, these are first few thoughts I chanced upon/overheard about the world's highest paid Girl Next Door, Jennifer Aniston. News of her divorce with (now-ex) husband Justin Theroux made headlines on 16 February, and it's all anyone can talk/opine about.  As is common with news of this nature (by which I mean one that dominates pop culture), what followed next were memes about Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston now being single (hey, have we forgotten Angie is single too?).  Brad Pitt about to drive by Jennifer's house like...#JenniferAniston pic.twitter.com/TRNL9LQaq7 ‚Äî Jackie (@Jackieannroth) February 15, 2018  tell jennifer aniston i‚Äôm single ‚Äî aidan (@aidan) February 16, 2018  Jennifer Aniston: single ‚úîÔ∏è  Brad Pitt: single ‚úîÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz ‚Äî coloradain√∫til (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018  Somewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her ""Hey, let's grab coffee and catch up"" text to Brad Pitt. https://t.co/pXLGo7O4Mp ‚Äî Madeline Hill (@mad_hill) February 15, 2018  If Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston reunite.

But humour notwithstanding, there are several issues with our response to Aniston's breakup.  First of all, it's a break up. Need I remind any of you what it feels like to end ties with someone who was your partner for over five years (married for 2, together for 7)? It feels like the pits. The last thing you want to do is scroll through twitter and find your face attached to way too many memes about getting back together with a man that left you for another woman. Pretty sure Jennifer, right now, is thinking ""thanks but no thanks"".  We are so obssessed with happy-endings and romance that practicality, self-happiness seem to matter very little.  Has it occurred to noone that maybe, just maybe, Jennifer Aniston wants to be alone? That after a whirlwind of two marriages and much heartbreak, maybe it would better for her to be by herself? Would that be too bad? Why is it so hard for us to imagine Jennifer Aniston being alone? Or single? Does being single automatically mean someone is not happy?  Remember, the statement that those two gave out with the news of their divorce was this: ""This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.""  Doesn't sound any bit the heartbreak to me. If anything, Jennifer Aniston is probably happier being by herself and away from the world's baggage involving her love life. Besides, I'd like to see people trying so hard to couple up the single male actors in Hollywood.  Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she's with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.  Besides, in my humble opinion, Aniston is way beyond Brad Pitt's league. If she *had* to get together with someone in the near future, I sincerely hope it is with someone new.  Leo DiCaprio, single at 43: wow, LAD what a legend. Jennifer Aniston, single at 49: what‚Äôs wrong with her? Why can‚Äôt she find love? Why can‚Äôt she hang on to a man?#everydaysexism ‚Äî Kelly Jackson (@Kelly_Jackson88) February 16, 2018  It‚Äôs so insulting to Jennifer Aniston that anyone would suggest she‚Äôll get back with Brad Pitt now she‚Äôs single. I really hope she doesn‚Äôt! ‚Äî Serena Marchetta (@SerenaEvelyn) February 16, 2018  Updated Date: Feb 16, 2018 17:17 PM"
"Michael Jackson‚Äôs daughter, Paris, thanked the late music icon ‚Äúfor the magic‚Äù in an Instagram post early Tuesday morning, on what would have been the King of Pop‚Äôs 59th birthday.  ‚ÄúBirthday wishes to the love of my life, the one person who showed me what passion truly was, the one that gave me solid morals to live by and how to dream,‚Äù she wrote.  The 19-year-old, who made headlines Sunday for speaking out against ‚ÄúNazi, white supremacist jerks‚Äù at the MTV Video Music Awards, shared a 2001 photo of herself kissing her dad. In it, Jackson is seen wearing his iconic white sequin glove.  ‚ÄúI will never feel love again the way I did with you,‚Äù her post continued. ‚ÄúYou are always with me and I am always with you. Though I am not you, and you are not me, I know with all my being that we are one. And our souls will never change in that way. Thank you for the magic, forever and always.‚Äù  In what Rolling Stone dubbed as her ‚Äúfirst-ever in-depth interview‚Äù following her father‚Äôs June 2009 death, the model-actress opened up about the close-knit relationship she had with her father, saying, ‚ÄúI feel him with me all the time.‚Äù She was 11 years old when she spoke at his memorial service on July 7, 2009, calling him the ‚Äúbest father you could ever imagine.‚Äù  Jackson, who is currently filming the second season of Fox‚Äôs ‚ÄúStar,‚Äù is the sole daughter of mother, Debbie Rowe, and father. She has two brothers, older sibling Michael Joseph Jackson Jr. and the younger Prince Michael Jackson II."
"Despite all the she-said, she-said in the Taylor Swift/Katy Perry feud, Ed Sheeran said in a recent interview that he thinks the back-and-forth is overblown.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she needs [to be defended] at all,‚Äù he told People magazine at the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame 48th Annual Induction and Awards Gala. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think feud songs are a hot thing ‚Äì there‚Äôs always been beef songs.‚Äù Sheeran specifically cited Carly Simon‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre So Vain‚Äù as an example of a classic ‚Äúdiss track‚Äù; Simon revealed in 2015 that she penned the 1972 hit with Warren Beatty in mind.  Earlier this year, Perry incurred the wrath of many Swift fans after the release of her hit ‚ÄúSwish Swish,‚Äù which many interpreted as a direct attack on the ‚ÄúWildest Dreams‚Äù singer.  ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you come for me / No, not today / You‚Äôre calculated / I got your number / ‚ÄòCause you‚Äôre a joker / And I‚Äôm a courtside killer queen,‚Äù one verse partly reads.  (As though confirming that the song was indeed about Swift, Perry changed the lyrics to hold a more conciliatory tone during a live-streamed concert: ‚ÄúGod bless you on your journey, baby girl.‚Äù Days earlier, Perry had delivered that same line when chatting with Arianna Huffington about Swift.)  ‚ÄúI am ready to let it go,‚Äù she said at the time. ‚ÄúI forgive her and I‚Äôm sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from here. I think it‚Äôs actually like, I think it‚Äôs time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I‚Äôm saying? ‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs a lot of other things out there in the world that people need to be focused on, and I truly, like God bless her on her journey. God bless her. Honestly.‚Äù  Earlier this month, Swift seemed to make a not-so-subtle point when she announced the release of her entire back catalog on all streaming services ‚Äì just as Perry dropped her fourth studio album, Witness.  Perry and Swift‚Äôs fallout dates back to 2014, when Swift suggested in a Rolling Stone interview that Perry had once stolen backup dancers out from under her, effectively throwing a wrench in their friendship.  Swift‚Äôs hit from that same year, ‚ÄúBad Blood,‚Äù is widely assumed to be about Perry.  As for Swift and Sheeran, their platonic friendship is rock-solid. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gotten matching Scottish folds, made each other arts and crafts Christmas presents, vacationed with our families, and had each other‚Äôs backs,‚Äù Swift told Rolling Stone earlier this year. ‚ÄúHe is the James Taylor to my Carole King and I can‚Äôt imagine a time when he wouldn‚Äôt be.‚Äù"
"Jamie Foxx walked off an interview with ESPN after the host asked the Academy Award-winning actor about his rumored relationship with actress Katie Holmes.

"God save Meghan Markle! The Duchess Of Sussex has run into some issues when it comes to her royal behavior, but she has her husband Prince Harry to support her through it!  Meghan Markle was just accused of breaking royal protocol and ‚Äúdisrespecting the Queen‚Äù when she crossed her legs at a royal engagement. Shortly after, she attempted to hold Prince Harry‚Äôs hand in public ‚Äî which just isn‚Äôt what the royals do. Still, she‚Äôs only been a Duchess for a month and a half, so the Royal Family is cutting her some slack, even though she‚Äôs incredibly hard on herself. ‚ÄúMeghan does worry about messing up, she worries terribly, because she wants to do everything perfectly, so she really beats herself up when she gets even the tiniest thing wrong. But, there is so much to remember, so many minuscule little details, it‚Äôs kind of mind-blowing really‚Äìand all incredibly high pressured too, as it‚Äôs all under a microscope at the same time,‚Äù a palace insider told HollywoodLife.com exclusively.  ‚ÄúThe funny thing is that the Queen is actually incredibly gracious to Meghan, she doesn‚Äôt put any pressure on her at all, it‚Äôs actually quite the opposite, and Harry is so loving and supportive, he‚Äôs constantly telling Meghan how amazing she‚Äôs doing, and how quickly she‚Äôs learning, and she is!‚Äù Aww! Listen, if the Queen doesn‚Äôt have a problem, we don‚Äôt have a problem.  At Meghan and Harry‚Äôs royal nuptials on May 18, the duchess seemed ready to commit to her role as a royal ‚Äî singing God Save The Queen flawlessly, and crossing her legs at her ankles. Her few faux pas, while understandable to the royal family, are reportedly devastating to her. ‚ÄúThe British press is constantly jumping on each and every little faux pas though, and publicly reprimanding Meghan, it‚Äôs horrible really, and some days she ends up in tears,‚Äù the insider revealed. ‚ÄúHarry is so protective of Meghan, and he hates how some of the newspapers write about her, it reminds him of his mother, and the way she was treated by the press, and sometimes Harry worries that nothing has really changed.‚Äù Recall, the British tabloids were incredibly tough on Princess Diana, but if Meghan is anything like her she‚Äôll continue to handle herself with impeccable class!"
"Speaking with Michelle Miller, the British actor admitted to opting for more independent movies after he shot to superstardom playing vampire Edward Cullen in the wildly popular Twilight series. On auditioning for entirely different roles post-Twilight, Pattinson said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôll come down from an ivory tower to be‚Ä¶‚Äô I mean, these movies are hard for me to get. Literally, I‚Äôm just as much trying to convince people, like, every single time. And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm, like, Leo [ DiCaprio ] or something!‚Äù  In the interview, it was revealed Good Time producers Josh and Benny Safdie were initially hesitant to work with Pattinson, but later discovered their opinions on the actor were far from accurate. On breaking free from his once perceived image as a teen heartthrob, the star said, ‚ÄúI think so much of life people are trying to put you in a box and define you all the time.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just exciting to have a job where you‚Äôre allowed to consistently break the walls of the box around you.‚Äù  Pattinson went on to talk about the vast amount of media attention he‚Äôs received since taking on the role of a lifetime in the Twilight series, despite his best-efforts to keep his personal life under wraps. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm quite an open person,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be one of those people who‚Äôs just like, ‚ÄòOh, no comment,‚Äô ‚Äôcause I just think you just look like an idiot if you‚Äôre in it. But then the annoying thing happens as well, then you answer in these kind of vague ways which kind of create these weird conspiracy theorists.‚Äù  The star added, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to deal with it. And so I thought in a way to kind of stop feeding it, you just try and say ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna talk about it.‚Äô And also, it kind of makes you feel like that‚Äôs the only way you can get some kind of strength.‚Äù Watch Pattinson‚Äôs full interview below!"

"The Anti-Defamation League says Larry David‚Äôs Saturday Night Live monologue ‚Äì in which the Curb Your Enthusiasm creator pondered his dating options in a concentration camp ‚Äì was ‚Äúoffensive, insensitive & unfunny all at same time.‚Äù  The ADL‚Äôs stance, tweeted by the organization‚Äôs CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, was in line with plenty of Twitterers who started slamming the bit before the show‚Äôs cast made its goodnights.  ‚ÄúHe managed to be offensive, insensitive & unfunny all at the same time Quite a feat,‚Äù wrote Greenblatt.

It comes as little surprise. Earlier it was reported by Consequence of Sound that Eminem and The Weeknd would be joining Beyonc√© for this year's festival, but requests for confirmation of the new headliners were not returned from producers.  Beyonc√©, who has made guest appearances at Coachella with husband Jay-Z and her sister, Solange, was supposed to headline at last year's music festival, but had to postpone after becoming pregnant with twins.

Eminem, one of the biggest Grammy Award-winning rap artists of all time, returns to Coachella on a Sunday night after making a guest appearance with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg in 2012 in the now legendary set featuring a hologram of Tupac Shakur.

Top R&B artists on the bill besides Beyonc√© and The Weeknd include SZA, who recently headlined Saturday Night Live, Grammy winner Miguel and Daniel Caesar, who is breaking this year out of Canada.

Various genres of rock are represented by the return of War On Drugs, the sister group HAIM, the Brian Wilson-influenced Fleet Foxes and Portugal. the Man.

Electronic music also has been drawn bigger crowds at Coachella in recent years than rock and its mix with pop music well represented with Kygo, Chromeo and ODESZA.  Other noteworthy artists of that genre include Petit Biscuit, a French DJ and music producer who turned 18 less than two months ago. He is half of the indie-pop duo Mount Dreams, but released his first solo album, Presence, in 2017. He'll perform on Sunday, as will British house DJ and music producer Hannah Wants, a former professional women's soccer player.  The lineup appears to have been booked with a sensitivity to increasing female participation and ethnic diversity. An interesting booking is Los Angeles Azules, a Mexican group fusing traditional cumbia and electronic music.  The festival has become known in the industry for its leadership in fine art and cuisine, and this year will again offer the four-course Outstanding in the Field dinner in the VIP Rose Garden for $225 a person.  Coachella has dominated industry polls as the top outdoor music event since it began in 1999. It was recently named the Billboard Top Festival of the Year.

She toys with the ""I've got a boyfriend"" line for a bit, and, during one song-writing session, seems keen on this lyric, which leads into the ""You're so gorgeous"" chorus:  I‚Äôve got a boyfriend/he‚Äôs older than us/I haven‚Äôt seen him in a couple of months/I go through phases when it comes to love/I‚Äôm nothing that you want, but I must say you're so gorgeous...  Watch it at the 3:00 mark:  At first glance, this could suggest the ex Swift is singing about is Harris; the two spent a lot of their relationship apart because of Swift touring for 1989 and Harris playing DJ gigs around the world. Swift went to the Met Gala, the night she and Hiddleston hit it off, alone.  But Swift dated Hiddleston right before being seen for the first time with Alwyn in October 2016. Hiddleswift first got together in June and lasted until September.  A lot of the time during their relationship, Hiddleston was in Australia shooting Thor: Ragnarok‚ÄîSwift even visited him over there and was spotted with the Thor cast at the movies‚Äîafter they had a pretty intense start.  Hiddleston and Swift arriving in Australia together in July 2017. Getty Images  At the time of the Hiddleswift split, a source told E! that Swift ""felt he wanted to take the relationship to be too public, and she was not happy about it and thought it was too much publicity."" If this original ""Gorgeous"" lyric really is inspired by Hiddleston, it may have been that the flame the two had also burned out (perhaps Hiddleston's alleged thirst for publicity extinguished it), and Swift moved on."
"The 'Scorpion' star and longtime music producer are planning to tie the knot.  Katharine McPhee and David Foster are engaged, The Hollywood Reporter can confirm.

"Kylie Jenner is on the cover of Forbes' ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue. Forbes Magazine  Kylie Jenner may be the youngest sibling of the Kardashian/Jenner clan, but she is also the family member bringing in the most cash.  Jenner, who's on the cover of Forbes' August 2018 ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, is worth roughly $900 million, according to the magazine.  According to Forbes' calculations, that makes her not only the Jenner or Kardashian with the highest net worth, but the 27th-richest self-made woman in the United States. For comparison, Forbes estimates that Jenner's older sister Kim Kardashian West is worth roughly $350 million.  Jenny Cheng/Business Insider  The 20-year-old's net worth has skyrocketed thanks to the success of Kylie Cosmetics. Forbes conservatively values the company at $800 million, with an estimated $330 million in sales last year. Jenner is both the face of the company and the sole owner.  Forbes' Natalie Robehmed detailed how Kylie Cosmetics has found success by harnessing Jenner's immense social-media following and slashing costs by outsourcing labor. There are only five full-time employees, with Jenner's mother, Kris Jenner, handling finances and public relations in exchange for a 10% management cut, the report says.  Kylie Cosmetics is dealing with slowing growth ‚Äî Forbes reports that revenue grew just 7% last year, with lip-kit revenue dropping an estimated 35%.  However, the magazine says it would take more than a slow year of sales to stop Jenner from reaching billionaire status and making history.  ""Another year of growth will make her the youngest self-made billionaire ever, male or female, trumping Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23,"" Robehmed reported."

Parks‚Äô departure comes after the finale of the four-part season 9 reunion revealed that she spread a rumor that Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home fellow cast member Porsha Williams. When host Andy Cohen said that she was caught in a ‚Äúmegawatt lie,‚Äù Parks said, ‚ÄúWhat more can I do? I apologized already and the person I‚Äôm most concerned about is Porsha.

"Share this article:  Caitlyn Jenner made a plea for respect for the transgender community as she accepted the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPY Awards.  ‚ÄúThis transition has been harder on me than anything I could imagine,‚Äù Jenner told the audience at the Microsoft Theater Wednesday night. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the case for so many others besides me. For that reason alone trans people deserve something vital. They deserve your respect.‚Äù  Jenner, formerly known as 1976 Olympic decathlon champion Bruce Jenner, received the award to recognize ‚Äúthe courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years,‚Äù according to ESPN.  Bruce Jenner, who said he has long suffered from gender confusion and told ABC earlier this year that he identifies as a woman, was re-introduced to the world as Caitlyn Jenner on June 1 with a flashy photo spread and feature story in Vanity Fair magazine.  Later that day, ESPN announced plans to give Jenner the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, which is presented ‚Äúto individuals whose contributions transcend sports.‚Äù  ‚ÄúBruce has received many accolades over the years for being one of the greatest Olympians of our time but the ESPYs are honored to celebrate Bruce becoming Caitlyn,‚Äù ESPYs executive producer Maura Mandt said.  ‚ÄúShe has shown the courage to embrace a truth that had been hidden for years, and to embark on a journey that may not only give comfort to those facing similar circumstances, but can also help to educate people on the challenges that the transgender community faces.‚Äù  Previous recipients of the Arthur Ashe Courage Award include Muhammad Ali, Jim Valvano, Pat Tillman, Robin Roberts and Nelson Mandela. Michael Sam, the first openly gay player to be drafted by an NFL team, received the honor last year.  The selection of Jenner to receive the award has generated some criticism ‚Äî notably from sportscaster Bob Costas, who dubbed the choice ‚Äúcrass exploitation.‚Äù  Some critics suggested that the honor should have gone to Lauren Hill, who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor but continued to pursue her dream of playing college basketball.  The Indiana native made the team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and played in four games ‚Äî while helping to raise more than $1 million for pediatric cancer research.  Hill died on April 10 at age 19.  Hours before the ESPYs ceremony, organizers announced in a statement to USA Today that Hill will be honored during the show ‚Äî noting that the recognition had always been planned, but was not previously announced.  The ESPY Awards honor celebrities from sports and entertainment to recognize major sports achievements and salute ‚Äúleading performers and performances.‚Äù  Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry received the best male athlete award, beating a field that also included Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers and Houston Texans defensive end J.J. Watt.  MMA fighter Ronda Rousey received the best female athlete award over University of Connecticut basketball guard/forward Breanna Stewart, skiing star Lindsey Vonn and tennis champion Serena Williams.

"It's time to say goodbye to a dear friend. We may not have known him for long, but he certainly made an impact on us while he was here. Farewell, King Stache.  Earlier today, Henry Cavill shaved off his beloved mustache, the source of so much controversy late last year. As a tribute, the Justice League and Mission Impossible star posted a video on his Facebook page to honor his former facial hair.  The video features Cavill in a bath robe telling fans that King Stache is indeed gone. He shared it to his page with the simple message ""#ShavedButNotForgotten.""  You can watch the full video above!  ""I know, it's hard to recognize me without King Stache,"" Cavill said to the camera, before turning his attention to himself in the mirror. ""Sometimes, I have a hard time recognizing myself.""  It was only a matter of time before Cavill threw some shade onto the infamous mustache incident. As you surely recall, the actor had the mustache while filming Mission: Impossible - Fallout and was brought back to the set of Justice League for extensive reshoots. Since he wasn't allowed to shave the facial hair due to his obligations to Mission: Impossible, the mustache had to be removed from Justice League via CGI. We all know how that went.  Staring right into the soul of the camera, Cavill said, ""It's hard for me to admit, this it NOT CGI.""  The video concludes with Sarah McLachlan's ""I Will Remember You"" playing over a montage of photos featuring King Stache. Of course, one of these images is the Cavill's CGI'd face, showing how terrible it looked without the mustache.  Fans have mourned the loss of the beautiful stache all morning. Popular fan artist BossLogic even paid tribute to King Stache by creating a poster, bidding goodbye to the facial hair.  So long, King Stache. You may be gone, but you'll never be forgotten."

"In her own words, Barbra Streisand is explaining the decision to clone her beloved curly-haired Coton du Tulear dog Samantha, who died in 2017.  ‚ÄúI was so devastated by the loss of my dear Samantha, after 14 years together, that I just wanted to keep her with me in some way,‚Äù the music icon, 75, detailed in an op-ed for the New York Times, published on Friday.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  ‚ÄúIt was easier to let Sammie go if I knew I could keep some part of her alive, something that came from her DNA,‚Äù Streisand recalled. ‚ÄúOne of the reasons I chose cloning was because I couldn‚Äôt find another curly-haired Coton.‚Äù  Before the dog crossed the rainbow bridge, the proud pet owner had cells taken from Sammie‚Äôs mouth and stomach.  ‚ÄúWe sent those cells to ViaGen Pets in Texas. We weren‚Äôt even sure if the cells would take,‚Äù Streisand explained, adding, ‚ÄúA friend had cloned his beloved dog, and I was very impressed with that dog.‚Äù  RELATED: Barbra Streisand Cloned Her Dog: Here‚Äôs the History of Pet Cloning and How Much It Costs  Barbra Streisand and her dog Sammie KMazur/WireImage  While anxiously waiting for the test results to determine whether cloning was possible, Streisand adopted not one, but two dogs in the absence of Sammie.  The first was a rescue: Maltipoo dog Sadie, who is lovingly named after her first dog which was gifted to her by the cast of Funny Girl when she turned 22.  And the second was a straight-haired Coton de Tulear named Miss Fanny, whom Streisand got from Sammie‚Äôs breeder after it was revealed that Miss Fanny‚Äôs mother is named Funny Girl.  RELATED: PETA Is Trying to Convince Barbra Streisand and Other Celebs to Stop Cloning Their Pets  After welcoming two four-legged members into her family, Streisand was surprised with the call she had been anticipating.  ‚ÄúNot only did the cloning process take, but it produced four puppies! Unfortunately, the runt of the litter died before the puppies were old enough to be delivered to me,‚Äù she said.  Happy New Year from my three girls‚Ä¶ Pink, Blue & Violet. pic.twitter.com/YW1T317Iyd ‚Äî Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) January 2, 2018  So the puppies plus Sadie and Miss Fanny meant she suddenly had five dogs in her home ‚Äî which she admitted was a lot even for her.  Describing herself as a ‚Äúperson who was used to taking my dog everywhere with me, and who never had more than one dog at a time living in my house,‚Äù Streisand said she chose to give away Sadie to her manager‚Äôs assistant and one of the puppies to the teenage daughter of her A&R rep.

Ultimately, leaving her with three Coton du Tulears: Miss Fanny and cloned Sammie look-alikes she named Miss Scarlett and Miss Violet after putting one in a red sweater and the other in a purple sweater.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit overwhelming. But we love them so much. Each puppy is unique and has her own personality,‚Äù Streisand said, though she added: You can clone the look of a dog, but you can‚Äôt clone the soul. Still, every time I look at their faces, I think of my Samantha‚Ä¶and smile.‚Äù"

"Radio personality Leeann Tweeden accused Minnesota Senator and comedian Al Franken of grouping her without consent on Thursday, November 16.  ‚ÄúIn December of 2006, I embarked on my ninth USO Tour to entertain our troops, my eighth to the Middle East since the 9/11 attacks,‚Äù Tweeden began in a blog post she wrote for the California radio station KABC, where she hosts a morning talk show. ‚ÄúMy father served in Vietnam and my then-boyfriend (and now husband, Chris) is a pilot in the Air Force, so bringing a ‚Äòlittle piece of home‚Äô to servicemembers stationed far away from their families was both my passion and my privilege.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFranken had written some skits for the show and brought props and costumes to go along with them,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúLike many USO shows before and since, the skits were full of sexual innuendo geared toward a young, male audience.‚Äù  The model, who said she was ‚Äúonly expecting to emcee and introduce the acts,‚Äù then detailed what allegedlyy happened when Franken wrote a skit that included her and a kiss.  ‚ÄúOn the day of the show Franken and I were alone backstage going over our lines one last time,‚Äù Tweeden wrote. ‚ÄúHe said to me, ‚ÄòWe need to rehearse the kiss.‚Äô I laughed and ignored him. Then he said it again. I said something like, ‚ÄòRelax Al, this isn‚Äôt SNL‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt need to rehearse the kiss.‚Äô He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.‚Äù  Tweeden continued: ‚ÄúHe repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‚ÄòOK‚Äô so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn‚Äôt be so nice about it the next time.‚Äù  The sportscaster said she felt ‚Äúdisgusted and violated‚Äù and when she performed the skit with Franken on stage, she turned her head so he couldn‚Äôt kiss her on the lips again.  Tweeden wrote that on the way home from the tour later that year, she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she was sleeping.  ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt believe it,‚Äù Tweeden wrote. ‚ÄúHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it‚Äôs funny?‚Äù  Franken released a statement shortly after the accusations broke.  ‚ÄúThe first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more I want to say, but the first and most important thing ‚Äî and if it‚Äôs the only thing you care to hear, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äî is: I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI respect women,‚Äù he continues. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt respect men who don‚Äôt. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.‚Äù  Franken also added, ‚ÄúWhile I don‚Äôt remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women‚Äôs experiences. I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate.‚Äù  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!

"By Bang  Jennifer Aniston is ""casually dating"" again following her split from husband Justin Theroux.  The 'Horrible Bosses' star is moving on from husband Justin Theroux and is enjoying ""seeing where things go"".  A source told Entertainment Tonight: ""Jennifer really relied on her friends to get her through the tough times. During that time, she was able to heal and be comfortable with dating again. Jennifer has never felt she needed a man, but she loves love. Jennifer is casually dating, but right now nothing serious. She is just having fun, seeing where things go. She won't fall in love anytime soon. All her friends are around her. That is the best supportive group.""  Neither the 'Leftovers' actor nor the former 'Friends' actress have spoken about the split since they released a joint statement on the end of their two-and-a-half-year marriage following increased speculation about the state of their marriage.  They said at the time: ""In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship. Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another."""

Chris, known for playing Marvel's Thor, once told BW magazine that he relocated his family to the laidback coastal town because he felt living in LA was 'suffocating and overwhelming'.  'Looking for a new wife according to @womansdayaus and other misleading outlets!': The Thor star has poked fun of the split rumours in the past on social media  'Don‚Äôt worry love, I would be mad too if some magazines keep trying to keep us apart': Elsa played along with poking fun of the rumours with Chris and confirmed to fans they were very much still happily wed  The more famous Chris becomes, the more rumours about his 'tumultuous' marriage to wife Elsa appear on the covers of magazines.  And the Thor star recently spilled about how he really feels about false rumours about his relationship making headlines.  Speaking to The Times in January, the former Home And Away star admitted he tries to avoid reading the rumours because they irritate him so much.  'I just try to ignore it,' Chris told the publication of how he deals with the reports.  'I stay off the internet but occasionally someone says to me, ""You might want to react to this one."" Most of the time I'm like, ""Why did you even tell me that? There's nothing I can do about it. It just p**ses me off.""'  'There's nothing I can do about it. It just p**ses me off""' Speaking to The Times in January, the former Home And Away star admitted he tries to avoid reading the rumours because they irritate him so much  It's not the first time the pair have expressed frustration about the 'rocky romance' rumours, with Chris previously taking aim at a specific publication.  Tagging Elsa, Chris wrote on Instagram: 'Looking for a new wife according to @womansdayaus and other misleading outlets! Honey you still love me right?'  In another post which featured Chris looking serious in a Tag Heuer advert, Elsa chimed in with: 'Don‚Äôt worry love, I would be mad too if some magazines keep trying to keep us apart,' adding the hashtags #dontcrackunderpressure #seeyoutomorrow #loveyou."

"Hold onto your sanity, Jelena shippers, because your two favorite people might be friends again. According to reports, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have been hanging out as friends over the last couple weeks. They've been hanging out with groups of mutual friends, TMZ reports, and The Weeknd is apparently totally cool with it/knows all about it. So are Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber friends for real this time? Did Bieber perform his song ""Friends"" for her and was like, ""Selena, girl, can we be friends plz?"" Maybe!  The exes were reportedly seen platonically hanging out at Gomez's house in Studio City with a group of friends this past Sunday, Oct. 22. TMZ released photos that reportedly show Gomez pulling into her house on Sunday night and Bieber's car following just 10 minutes after. There's also a photo of what appears to be Gomez and Bieber walking out of her house, but only the tattooed arm of a guy can be seen in the photo, so it's hard to confirm that it's actually the Biebs. Still, fans are completely losing their minds, seeing as if their beloved Jelena won't get back together in a romantic way, friendship is a good second.  Try not to faint, Jelena fans, but these are the reported photos of Gomez and Bieber hanging out this past weekend.  Some fans are like, ""OMG YASSSSSS,"" while others are like, ""Meh.""  Gomez and Bieber reportedly got back in touch around the time she revealed she had a kidney transplant earlier this summer.  Gomez revealed the news in a moving Instagram post on Sept. 14 that read,  I'm very aware some of my fans had noticed I was laying low for part of the summer and questioning why I wasn't promoting my new music, which I was extremely proud of. So I found out I needed to get a kidney transplant due to my Lupus and was recovering. It was what I needed to do for my overall health. I honestly look forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these past several months as I have always wanted to do with you. Until then I want to publicly thank my family and incredible team of doctors for everything they have done for me prior to and post-surgery. And finally, there aren't words to describe how I can possibly thank my beautiful friend Francia Raisa. She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me. I am incredibly blessed. I love you so much sis. Lupus continues to be very misunderstood but progress is being made. For more information regarding Lupus please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org/ -by grace through faith  One of Gomez's best friends, actress Francia Raisa, was her kidney donor, and Gomez penned a beautiful thank you to her in her Instagram post. Raisa posted about the experience on her own Instagram shortly after Gomez. She said,  I am beyond grateful that God would trust me with something that not only saved a life, but changed mine in the process. This was part of our story, and we will share it soon, but what is important now is that this is not the only story.For more information regarding Lupus, please go to the Lupus Research Alliance website: www.lupusresearch.org -- Love you sis, so glad we‚Äôre on this journey together. ‚ù§Ô∏è xx  In August, Bieber released the single ""Friends"" with BloodPop. It's about wanting to be friends with an ex, and fans immediately thought ""Friends"" was about Selena Gomez.  BloodPop¬Æ on YouTube  The ""Friends"" lyrics go:  Do you wonder why I've been callin'? Like I've got ulterior motives  No, we didn't end this so good  But you know we had something so good  So I'm wonderin'  Can we still be friends? (oh) Can we still be friends? (oh)  Doesn't have to end  And if it ends, can we be friends?  Can we be friends? Can we be friends?  Sounds to me like someone is trying to platonically reconcile with an ex! But honestly, these two probably don't write all of their songs about each other... I'm just sayin'. Gomez has a new single coming out on Oct. 25. called ""Wolves."" She released the ""Wolves"" lyrics on Oct. 24 and they're super romantic. Fans are assuming it's about her current boyfriend, The Weeknd, and they're pumped. But, it's safe to say Jelena shippers are having a good day today."

"Artist, DJ, and producer Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, died Friday afternoon in Oman, according to a statement from his rep. He was 28.  ‚ÄúIt is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúHe was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.‚Äù  One of the most popular and successful electronic dance-music artists of all time ‚Äî he scored a No. 4 hit on the Billboard 200 in 2013 with ‚ÄúWake Me Up‚Äù and regularly appeared in the Top 5 of Forbes‚Äô ‚ÄúHighest-Paid DJs‚Äù lists ‚Äî he retired from live performing in 2016 at the peak of his success, citing health reasons. He had suffered from health problems for several years, including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. He had his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014.  He posted the following statement on his website last year:  ‚ÄúWE ALL REACH A POINT IN OUR LIVES AND CAREERS WHERE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO US.  For me it‚Äôs creating music. That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do.  Related Celebrities Who Died in 2018  Last year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it.

The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new.  Hope you‚Äôll enjoy it as much as I do.‚Äù  Bergling was born in Stockholm on Sept. 8, 1989. He began DJing as a teenager and released his first single in 2007. He released a large number of singles and remixes in the following years and rapidly built a reputation as a live act. He broke through with his 2010 hit ‚ÄúSeek Bromance,‚Äù which charted in several European countries; he signed a publishing deal with EMI the same year. He explained his chosen DJ name as ‚Äúthe lowest level of Buddhist hell,‚Äù chosen because his real name was already being used by another Tim Bergling on MySpace.  His 2011 single ‚ÄúLevels,‚Äù which was later nominated for a Grammy Award, vaulted him into the mainstream, charting in multiple European countries and topping the chart in his native Sweden. ‚ÄúSunshine,‚Äù his 2012 collaboration with David Guetta, was nominated for a Grammy for best dance recording. In September of that year, he became the first DJ to headline New York‚Äôs prestigious Radio City Music Hall; at those two shows, he previewed a new song with Mike Posner titled ‚ÄúStay with You.‚Äù  His proper debut album, ‚ÄúTrue,‚Äù was released on September 2013, much of which was previewed during his headlining set at the Ultra Music Festival earlier that year. The album featured ‚ÄúWake Me Up,‚Äù a collaboration with Aloe Blacc, which topped the charts in multiple countries across the world and was No. 1 for a record 14 weeks on Billboard‚Äôs Dance/Electronic Songs chart; it was also the U.K.‚Äôs fastest-selling single of 2013. Other singers on the album included Adam Lambert and Audra Mae. He also worked with Madonna during this period and contributed to two songs on her 2015 album ‚ÄúRebel Heart,‚Äù although both parties seemed unhappy with the collaboration and Avicii said the final versions were quite different from his demos.  The extent of his popularity was reflected in a 2014 ‚ÄúSaturday Night Live‚Äù digital short called ‚ÄúWhen Will the Bass Drop?,‚Äù with comic Andy Samberg playing a fictional mega-DJ named ‚ÄúDavvincii‚Äù (although he was made up to look more like David Guetta).  However, as his popularity rose, his health declined. He was hospitalized in March 2014 and cancelled several tour appearances; not long after, he collaborated with Carlos Santana and Wyclef on the official FIFA World Cut Anthem ‚ÄúWe Will Find a Way.‚Äù Also that year, he produced a song on Coldplay‚Äôs album ‚ÄúGhost Stories.‚Äù He released his second full-length album, ‚ÄúStories,‚Äù in October 2015.  In March of 2016, he performed at the Ultra Music Festival, premiering new material, but 10 days later announced that he was retiring from performing. He made a final live appearance in August in Ibiza. In December, he parted ways with longtime manager Ash Pournouri.  In August of 2017 he released a six-track EP entitled ‚ÄúAvici,‚Äù which he said was the first of three installments that would be his next album. He followed a month later with a full-length documentary called ‚ÄúTrue Stories,‚Äù which was largely about his retirement. In it, promoters are seen trying to convince him to continue touring, even though he‚Äôs in obvious physical pain. ‚ÄúI looked at myself like, ‚ÄòF‚Äî, you should‚Äôve really stood up for yourself more there. Come on, Tim!,'‚Äù he said of the documentary to Rolling Stone in an interview published last September. ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I stop the ship earlier?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI needed to figure out my life,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúThe whole thing was about success for the sake of success. I wasn‚Äôt getting any happiness anymore. Now that I have more time in the studio, I want to learn as much about other genres as possible.

"Brad Pitt may be finding love again, but a source close to him EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that the actor doubts the ‚Äòright guy‚Äô exists for Angelina Jolie. Ouch!  After causing everyone who still believed in true love to shudder collectively after hearing that the two of them were breaking up, Brad Pitt, 53, and Angelina Jolie, 42, still don‚Äôt seem to be on the friendliest of terms after their split.

"(CNN) George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.  The couple, through the The Clooney Foundation for Justice, have made a $1 million donation to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) that will fund a joint initiative to combat hate groups.  The move comes more than a week after an August 12 ""Unite the Right"" rally sparked violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead and 19 injured. Two Virginia state troopers who were monitoring the protests were also killed in a helicopter crash.  ""What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate,"" they said.  In the aftermath of the event, President Donald Trump was criticized for his unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in a press conference given days after the unrest.  ""I think there is blame on both sides,"" Trump said during a news conference August 15.  George Clooney appeared to reference the President's comment in an additional statement, provided to CNN by a representative.  ""Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality. There are no two sides to bigotry and hate,"" he said.  The Clooney Foundation for Justice was formed in 2016 to ""advance justice in courtrooms, classrooms and communities around the world,"" according to a mission statement on its website.  George and Amal Clooney, who recently welcomed twins, serve as the foundation's presidents.  ""Like George and Amal Clooney, we were shocked by the size, ugliness, and ferocity of the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville,"" said SPLC President Richard Cohen in a statement. ""It was a reflection of just how much Trump's incendiary campaign and presidency has energized the radical right. We are deeply grateful to the Clooney Foundation for standing with us at this critical moment in our country's fight against hate.""  The SPLC said it tracks more than 1,600 extremist groups operating in the U.S.  Further details about the joint initiative are expected to be announced at a later date, the organization said."

"Breaking News: FBI Uncovers Evidence That 62 Million Trump Voters are All Russian AgentsAnonymous sources within the FBI have revealed to The Times that they have new evidence indicating that everyone who voted for Donald Trump is an agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB). An unknown portion of these voters may have had their minds controlled by a Russian space-beam, agents close to the investigation say.The allegation that 62 million Americans appear to be employed by Russian intelligence services has rocked the Bureau, and it is reported that multiple agents have taken their own lives, given that realizing just how deep this Russian hacking conspiracy runs blew their minds ‚Äî literally.This shocking new revelation comes after it was confirmed as a fact that Russia did Wikileaks because Donald Trump personally called Vladimir Putin and asked him to. It was also revealed earlier this week that Alex Jones (real name ‚ÄúAlexi Jonesinov‚Äù) is a Russian sleeper agent who was ordered by the FSB (formerly the KGB) to post news articles on the internet saying that Donald Trump would be a good President.However, the revelation that 62 million Americans are taking orders directly from the Kremlin is a revelation of a whole other order, which FBI agents are struggling with how to deal with.It was determined by Puerto Rican federal judge Mizu Tomazaki that it is a crime to support Donald Trump or to post positive things about him on the internet. 9th circuit judges Weinberg, Steinman and Goldenstein upheld the ruling. Despite this, the logistics of rounding up 62 million people and locking them in prison present a difficult task to overcome.It may also be that not every voter is a direct agent of the FSB (formerly the KGB), and some may have been under the control of a mind control beam in space.‚ÄúWe have not determined for sure that everyone who voted for Trump was paid directly by the Kremlin, given that it is highly possible that the Russians used a space-beam from a satellite to control their brains from a facility in St. Petersburg, and moved their bodies like puppets to the polls to check the Trump box,‚Äù one current agent familiar with the investigation told the times, describing the process of using a satellite-mounted space-beam to control people‚Äôs actions as ‚ÄúRussian neuro-brain hacking.‚ÄùWhen asked for comment on these reports by The Times, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations of space-beam mind control by the FSB (formerly the KGB) were ‚Äúridiculous,‚Äù ‚Äúoutrageous‚Äù and ‚Äúgoofy.‚Äù However, Peskov suspiciously asked ‚Äúvere is Moose and Squirrel?‚ÄùNSA chief Mike Rogers said that though it is a well-established fact that going all the way back to Soviet times, the Russians have used space-beams to control people‚Äôs brains, he‚Äôs ‚Äúnever seen anything on this scale before.‚ÄùThe Times also sought comment from President Trump; however, when asked about these allegations, he began screaming in Russian and jumped in a big truck and drove off down the road.You are all nuts‚Ä¶almost 1/2 of America voted to make Trump the legal president, and you keep teling us we don‚Äôt matter. Install Hillary by force or some other act of politics, and you will have a civil war on your hands. And just in case you haven‚Äôt noticed, Trump‚Äôs people have most of the guns."
"In the wake of multiple sexual misconduct allegations Mario Batali issued another apology to fans via his newsletter on Friday. According to People, the whole thing has caused fresh outrage about the chef online. In the newsletter, Batali wrote:  ""As many of you know, this week there has been some news coverage about some of my past behavior. I have made many mistakes and I am so very sorry that I have disappointed my friends, my family, my fans and my team. My behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility.""

"Delta Force Raids Obama Stronghold in Thailand[Note: Please view our newest article on Trump‚Äôs attack against Deep State assets: FBI RAIDS HOME OF HILLARY CLINTON COLLABORATORDuring the pre-dawn hours on Christmas Day, Delta Force operators launched a precision strike against an Obama-controlled stronghold in Thailand, says an active Secret Service agent who claims President Trump green lit the operation following a series of telephone calls to United States military commanders and to Thailand Prime Minister Nik Bukharin.A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa, Japan to the United States Embassy in Bangkok, and held position while Trump cleared the incursion with his Thai counterparts.According to our source, the Trump administration learned that Obama, by proxy, owned a mansion and a 400-acre estate on the outskirts of the city of Si Sa Ket, approximately 500 km from Bangkok. On paper, the land was owned by the allegedly defunct Solyndra Corporation, a startup solar company to which Obama gave 2.2 billion taxpayer dollars in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Solyndra declared bankruptcy, and the money vanished. Despite apparent poverty, Solyndra maintained real estate holdings valued at over 800 million dollars in a half-dozen Southeast Asian countries. The Trump administration connected the dots, linking Obama to the Thai property, after asserting Presidential privilege and subpoenaing flight records that demonstrably proved Obama had travelled to Si Sa Ket six times as president and an additional four times in the past year.In a June 2009 edition of the Washington Beacon, conservative author Thomas Clearwater wrote, ‚ÄúSolyndra does not appear to be a legitimate institution, and is likely a shell company or slush fund used or owned by Obama to launder his dirty money.‚ÄùOur Secret Service source supports that contention.‚ÄúObama holds real estate, vast sums of currency, and shadow companies across the globe, under many aliases.

""The situation is extremely hard and complicated, but I do have my own priorities and things that I need to focus on. He's just not my biggest concern anymore,"" Kourtney mused after telling her mom to ask Scott herself if she was so worried about him.  The predictably unpredictable son of a moneyed New York family who became a reality-TV star at 24 and is now invested in the luxury house-flipping trade has had his raw moments with the family before, especially when Kourtney finally let him go in 2015 and he felt that his relationships with Kris, Khloe and Kim were slipping away. But it took literally years before anyone, Kourtney included, knew what was really going on with her and Scott, since the two of them still went on cozy-looking trips and spent as much time with the kids together as possible.

"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have been through a lot over the past six months. Following Jolie‚Äôs divorce filing in September, the two engaged in a bitter custody battle before eventually smoothing things out. How did they go from enemies to friends in such a short time?  According to E! News, things went downhill after Pitt was accused of child abuse stemming from an incident on a private plane with his oldest son, Maddox. The allegations created a lot of buzz in the media and led to an investigation by the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services. Pitt was also accused of having a drinking problem and cheating on Jolie with Marion Cotillard, his co-star on the film Allied.  Although the failed marriage appeared shockingly sudden, inside sources claimed the couple had been experiencing issues for a long time.

[Image by Heng Sinith/AP Images]  ‚ÄúThings had been volatile in their relationship for a little while. They had crazy fights and wouldn‚Äôt speak for a bit. They would take some time apart, go on location, calm down and miss each other,‚Äù an insider shared. ‚ÄúBut, no matter how bad it got, Brad, especially, was never planning on walking away. Every so often, Angelina threatened divorce, but in Brad‚Äôs eyes, their lives were stressful because they were raising six kids, things were always going to work out.‚Äù  Pitt was eventually cleared of the abuse allegations, but not before suffering significant damage to his public image. To make matters worse, the two were fighting a nasty custody battle that granted Pitt only supervised visits with his six children. The situation didn‚Äôt turn around until 2016 came to a close.  Jolie was spotted in Cambodia promoting her film, First They Killed My Father, in February. The actress took all six children for the trip and finally talked about the split for the first time. In her emotional interview, Jolie admitted that the breakup had been hard on the family but assured everyone that they were working things out.

Following Jolie‚Äôs telling interview, insiders revealed that Brad Pitt was actually in Cambodia with the kids while Jolie was promoting the film. The actor secretly traveled to the country so that he could spend time with the brood, signaling a major shift in his relationship with Jolie.  ‚ÄúThey have made some progress and are taking small steps in the right direction. Both are in agreement on putting the kids first. So that part of the equation is better,‚Äù an insider revealed.  Pitt‚Äôs relationship with Jolie is far from perfect, but it has come a long way since September. Although he was accused of abusing his oldest son, sources claim that Pitt has patched up they relationship and things couldn‚Äôt be better.  ‚ÄúThe kids have always adored Brad and have a very solid relationship with him,‚Äù a source explained.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BTwltdEBhcj/?taken-by=gq&hl=en  The source added that Jolie actually regrets how everything played out in the early months of the divorce. According to ET Online, Jolie recently allowed the kids an overnight stay with Pitt for the first time since the split. The children reportedly enjoyed their short stay with their father, who is now communicating with Jolie on a regular basis.  While Pitt is enjoying more freedom with the kids, Radar Online reports that Jolie is planning on throwing herself a post-breakup party. The actress is allegedly having the party in London and believes it will help her move on and forget about the divorce.  Tell us!

"Hands shaking and heart pumping, athletes from all over the world take to the podium with tear-stained faces, radiant smiles and unbridled euphoria. They watch in genuine wonderment as their nation‚Äôs flag rises and the stadium resounds with the thunderous tones of their national anthem. These awe-inspiring moments draw the eyes of half the world to the Olympic Games, where spectators marvel at the unfathomable tenacity and strength of the world‚Äôs best athletes.  Yet those triumphant moments provide only superficial insight into an athlete‚Äôs tumultuous trek to victory. Their journeys took stamina and determination, but for too many athletes, it also took much more: their innocence, pride, self-worth and well-being, a merciless charge in exchange for success.  In too many cases, the winner is expected to take it all ‚Äì the psychological and physical pain, the sexual abuse and the animosity of teammates in silence and with unfaltering national pride. Nowhere is this more evident or troubling than in USA Gymnastics.  Clad in sparkly, red-white-and-blue spandex, the female USA gymnasts are images of strength, grace and patriotism. Winning consecutive Olympic golds in 2012 and 2016, in addition to world championships in 2011, 2014 and 2015, the USA Women‚Äôs Gymnastics program has distinguished itself as a force to be reckoned with. The women have not only racked up quite the collection of gold medals, but they have also accrued millions of views and brought abundant media attention to the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.  During the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 38.7 million viewers tuned into NBC‚Äôs broadcast of the Women‚Äôs Gymnastics final, where the U.S. women dominated. In fact, in 2012, four of the five members of the ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù ranked in the ‚ÄúTop 10 Most Clicked Athletes‚Äù on NBC‚Äôs Olympics.com, with Gabby Douglas leading with over 23 million clicks to her page. These women are the pride and joy of the U.S. Olympic Committee, not to mention national and international sensations.  You might also like: Michigan State Freshman Claims She Was Gang Raped by Basketball Players  However, recent history has given a glimpse behind the curtain, revealing a revolting and disturbing truth: USA Gymnastics has created a deplorable culture that values its precious reputation more than the health and safety of its athletes. But the thinly veiled facade is beginning to fade, most notably with the well-founded sexual abuse allegations against USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, by over 150 women and girls, according to CNN.  Among those victims were gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber. They each had a story to tell, rife with gruesome details of long-term abuse.  It is the dismaying story of McKayla Maroney, a ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù member and silver medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, that perhaps most aptly encapsulates both Nassar‚Äôs menace and USA Gymnastics‚Äô negligence. In the fall of 2017, Maroney made a startling announcement via Twitter that Nassar had abused her from the time she was thirteen years old until she left gymnastics in 2016, according to Time Magazine.  ‚ÄúI had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting,‚Äù Maroney said. The gymnast recounted a particularly traumatic event on a flight to Tokyo when Nassar gave her a sleeping pill. The next thing Maroney remembered was waking up alone with Nassar in his hotel room enduring one of his ‚Äútreatments.‚Äù She was 15 years old.  While it is shocking that a predator like Nassar was able to worm his way into this esteemed organization and continue his abuse for years without notice, the organization‚Äôs handling of the travesty was unprofessional, unpardonable and downright unethical.  While USA Gymnastics commended Maroney‚Äôs courage when she publicly announced the horrors she endured, it soon came to light that a year earlier, the organization made her ‚Äúsign a non-disclosure agreement as part of a financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment,‚Äù according to NBC.  On Dec. 20, 2017, Maroney filed a lawsuit on the grounds that the agreement she signed was ‚Äúhypocritical, immoral and in this case illegal,‚Äù said Maroney‚Äôs attorney. In response, on Jan. 16, 2018, USA Gymnastics ensured that it would not hound Maroney for any money should she choose to speak out. But even with this turnaround, the sheer reality that this rectification was even necessary is utterly unspeakable.  A symphony of voices rose in corroboration of Maroney‚Äôs claims, and 156 women delivered grievous and powerful statements in front of Nassar‚Äôs very eyes during a seven-day-long trial. Aly Raisman, team captain of both the ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù and the ‚ÄúFinal Five,‚Äù has become a vocal advocate for her fellow victims and delivered a harrowing testimony at Nassar‚Äôs trial.  ‚ÄúI have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully. And both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success,‚Äù Raisman said. ‚ÄúBut did they reach out when I came forward? No.‚Äù  You might also like: Love or a Gold Medal? Two Olympic Ice Skaters Break Up to Win  But the sins of the organization did not develop overnight. In fact, this sickening culture laid down its roots many years ago. The Washington Post reported that since 1982, ‚Äúmore than 290 coaches and officials associated with the United States‚Äô Olympic sports organizations have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct,‚Äù spanning 15 Olympic sports. Yet even aside from all the sexual abuse, the organizations‚Äô transgressions still run deep, and if you pay close enough attention to history, the signs are evident.  One of the Olympics most spectacular and inspirational moments for the U.S. occurred during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, when U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug was exhorted by coach Bela Karolyi to perform the last vault on a critically sprained ankle. Despite her injury, she completed the vault, and led the U.S. women to victory over the Russians for the first time ever. However, malevolence lurks even in the Games‚Äô most glorified moments.  The first feeling the video elicits from viewers is almost always one of admiration for the 18-year-old Strug, who somehow miraculously landed on one foot. But when you witness the agonizing pain on this young girl‚Äôs face, and Karolyi‚Äôs seemingly heartless coercion, the picture slowly turns from heartening to unsettling. To make matters worse, one of the doctors helping Strug off the stage is none other than Larry Nassar himself.  From being forced to practice on broken limbs, doping at the urging of coaches and acquiescing to irrational diets, Olympic athletes withstand unthinkable afflictions and tribulations en route to domination at the Games.  The 2017 feature film ‚ÄúI, Tonya,‚Äù provided yet another startling reminder of the cutthroat nature of the Games; it resurrected the 1994 attack on U.S. Olympic ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, which soon implicated Tonya Harding, her own teammate and possible conspirator in the attack.  You might also like: Randolph College‚Äôs Meredith Alwine Is Lifting Herself to the 2020 Olympics  Without the most fundamental trust and security shared between teammates, coaches and doctors, the Olympics will cease to be a place where athletes can flourish. It will become their personal hell. Olympic gold medal winner Shawn Johnson even went so far as to say in a YouTube video on her channel, ‚ÄúI think gymnastics is the best sport in the entire world, but if I had a daughter right now, I wouldn‚Äôt put her in it.‚Äù  With news stories, personal testimonies and unearthed history inundating almost every media platform, it has become increasingly difficult to look past the Games‚Äô faults and focus on their worth. In order to preserve an honorable tradition and progress in a positive way, major reform is necessary.  The U.S. Olympic Committee needs to genuinely recommit itself to cultivating an organization characterized for its emphasis on unity, not duplicity. In addition, the U.S. Olympic teams must forge environments that do not alienate future generations of athletes, but instead encourage and ignite the most inspired work and dedication they can give.  There is a black, rotting hole corroding the Games from the inside, and now is the time to wipe it out. Let the upcoming PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games be the birthplace of a new era, so when these world-class athletes take the stage, country flags ascending and anthems blaring, they can be filled with authentic, unadulterated ardor for the organization and country whose names they proudly bear."
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Donna Freydkin  Since actress Christina Applegate was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and had a double mastectomy thereafter, she‚Äôs taken steps to change her entire lifestyle, from the food she eats to the rest she gets. She also founded the Right Action for Women, which helps at-risk women pay for MRI screenings and testing.  But the actress revealed in a TODAY.com exclusive that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis: She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. Read on for our conversation with the actress, who‚Äôs busy raising her daughter Sadie, 6, with musician hubby Martyn LeNoble.  First off, let‚Äôs catch up on your health. How are you doing?  You're the first person I'm telling this. Two weeks ago, I had my ovaries and [fallopian] tubes removed. My cousin passed away from ovarian cancer in 2008. I could prevent that. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve taken control of everything. It‚Äôs a relief. That‚Äôs one other thing off the table. Now, let‚Äôs hope I don‚Äôt get hit by a bus.  What message do you want to send to women?  If you‚Äôre BRCA positive, it‚Äôs highly possible you‚Äôll develop cancer in your lifetime. The first thing is to be really diligent about what you‚Äôre putting into your body, as far as what kind of food you‚Äôre eating. Organic is expensive. I get that. I don‚Äôt want to alienate anyone who can‚Äôt pay for that. But maybe skip your morning latte and get organic vegetables for the week. Try to stay away from the foods that are filled with chemicals. Be a little more diligent and carve out as much of the bad stuff that you can. The other big killer is stress. That‚Äôs a hard thing to say to people especially right now. We‚Äôre living in a bizarre time. We‚Äôre bombarded by what‚Äôs going on in our world. Breathe deeper. That‚Äôs a big one for me. I used to be a stressed out person. I‚Äôm not anymore. I try to find the lining in everything in life.  Christina Applegate Stacie McChesney / Getty Images  I know you eat super clean.  We grow our own vegetables. That‚Äôs not an option for everyone. But just get a tomato plant! We‚Äôre a 100 percent organic house. My daughter is a vegetarian and practically vegan. That‚Äôs her choice. That‚Äôs how she eats. We‚Äôre really conscious about what we buy. Get some kale! Plant some green kale in your backyard and throw it into everything.  It‚Äôs pretty impressive that you founded Right Action for Women, because these tests cost a fortune and most women can‚Äôt afford them.  We‚Äôre at this place where we need to sit down and figure out the future of what it is that we‚Äôre doing and get into more of the BRCA tests for women. That‚Äôs a huge cost for a lot of people who don‚Äôt have perfect insurance. If you do know you have the gene, it gives you an empowerment about your lifestyle. I‚Äôve been a stay-at-home mom and focusing on my daughter the last two years. We‚Äôre moving forward now.  It must weigh on you that you have a daughter, and it must make breast cancer that much more of a personal issue  Of course. The chances that my daughter is BRCA positive are very high. I look at her and feed her the cleanest foods. I try to keep her stress levels down. I‚Äôm doing everything I can on my end knowing that in 20 years, she‚Äôll have to start getting tested. Hopefully by then there will be advancements. It breaks my heart to think that‚Äôs a possibility.  Do you get checked out regularly?  I don‚Äôt need mammograms anymore. I don‚Äôt have breasts. I go every six months to my oncologist. It used to be every three months. They still check me out as if I had all my parts. That‚Äôs never going to go away. If you know you‚Äôre high risk, you need to go start as soon as possible.  Otherwise, what‚Äôs your life like these days?  I feel good. I keep my life really simple. I‚Äôm very fortunate right now to have that freedom to not work. I love being my daughter‚Äôs mother and being 24/7 here with her, doing what I need to do, making her meals, taking her to soccer. I work at her school six or seven hours a week. I‚Äôm all in. That is my job. I love my life right now. I‚Äôve been very fortunate to be able to take a minute and it‚Äôs been wonderful."

"Where there was fire, ashes reman!  After officially ending their relationship in 2015, the Amazing Spider-man co-stars joined the small but growing club of celebrities with friendly separations. And it‚Äôs only clear that there‚Äôs still much love between former couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.  I mean, the guy teared up when she won her Best Actress Academy Award, for crying out loud! And both Emma and Andrew have said in numerous occasions that even after their split, they still love each other very much.  Well, it seems like those weren‚Äôt just empty words.  According to The Sun, Stone has been making multiple trips to London to see Garfield perform in his play Angels in America. She‚Äôs watched the show several times and allegedly ‚Äúalways‚Äù goes back for a backstage visit. ‚ÄúThey have even been sneaking out of the back door holding hands,‚Äù a source close to Garfield told the outlet.  While Emma spent some time in the UK earlier this year shooting her new film The Favourite, a further trip to London paved the way for them to reconnect. ‚ÄúAndrew‚Äôs feelings for Emma never softened and now they are growing close once again,‚Äù the source said.  Emma, 28, and Andrew, 34, enjoyed an on again off again romance for four years. In the early 2010‚Äôs, these two were Hollywood‚Äôs sweethearts after meeting during screentest for The Amazing Spider-Man. The couple went public in 2011, via the classy and showbiz means of a joint appearance during her Saturday Night Live monologue. Everything is love and smiles until rumors aired that the pair was taking a break from their relationship in early 2015. They finally announced their so-called definitive separation later that year.  Yet, here we are, cheering for Emma and Andrew once again.  ‚ÄúThe familiarity they have with each other seems to bring them back to a place to try again and again. So, I wouldn‚Äôt say that they are back to being an official couple just yet, but the future is probably going to be something where they are together. It is basically just a matter of time,‚Äù the source said.  We choose to remain optimistic!"

The Daily Beast: ""Trump: Media Is ‚ÄòEnemy of the American People‚Äô "" ‚Äî ""President Trump on Friday afternoon tweeted, then deleted an outwardly hostile message calling various media outlets the people‚Äôs real enemy. 'The FAKE NEWS media,' he wrote, citing The New York Times, CNN, and NBC News, among others,'is not my enemy. It is the enemy of the American people. SICK!' The message was deleted shortly after its posting, but numerous users screengrabbed the tweet for posterity. Several minutes later, the president re-posted the message, with slight tweakings: he added CBS and ABC to the roster of 'fake news' outlets, and removed the 'SICK!' from the back end."""
"Welcome to the rest of your life, kid.  Beloved chubby-cheeked royal person Prince George is officially on the quest for knowledge.  The 4-year-old eldest son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (and soon to be big brother to a second sibling) was escorted by Prince William to his first day of school at Thomas Battersea School in London on Thursday morning. Because this is 2017, the whole ordeal was captured for Instagram, and thus, for eternity.

"High-powered stars from pop (Miley Cyrus), R&B (Mary J. Blige), country (Miranda Lambert) and rock (the Killers) will take part in twin tribute albums for Elton John and Bernie Taupin. Revamp and Restoration are due out on April 6th.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always a huge compliment when an artist loves your song enough to take the time and effort to rework it,‚Äù Elton John said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs songwriters, Bernie and myself are thrilled when singers we admire and respect as much as those on Revamp and Restoration choose to add their own unique twist in the process.

"The territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East over the past week have prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success.""We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,"" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.""He said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission.But California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.During the Iraq War, Schiff said, ""We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.""Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,"" he said.He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could ""aggravate"" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight.McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.""George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,"" he said.For now, Schiff said there is an ""ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS."" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said."
"Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff‚Äôs Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG‚Äôs testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI‚Äôs failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine‚Äôs Day.‚ÄúWe constantly promote ‚Äòsee something, say something,‚Äô and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‚ÄòSee something, say something‚Äô is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,‚Äù Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel‚Äôs removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn‚Äôt the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine‚Äôs Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel‚Äôs order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff‚Äôs office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff‚Äôs office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel‚Äôs son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff‚Äôs office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff‚Äôs car that read, ‚ÄúOur new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?‚ÄùThe tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff‚Äôs office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history.During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment.‚ÄúI would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,‚Äù DeSantis said.‚ÄúSheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,‚Äù Putnam said.Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel‚Äôs removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country.In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, ‚Äúthe only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.‚Äù However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs."

Anne-Marie recently told The Hollywood Reporter that she was not a victim of harassment at the hands of Ben.  'This was for the camera.

That never stopped you before from getting them ti****s out,' Ben says back to her in the interview that lasted for more than five minutes.

'He did invite me once at the Toronto Film Festival to go up to his suite for an interview. Of course I did not go. He said, ""I would be more comfortable in my suite."" I said, ""Umm, no.""

Among the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents‚Äô Dinner‚Äîfor, it seems, they weren‚Äôt professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally‚Äîas well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe ‚Äôs Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast‚Äîbut perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf‚Äôs jokes about Trump‚Äôs wealth (‚ÄúMr. President, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you‚Äôre doing fine‚Äù) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.  Sanders was reportedly seated in Wolf‚Äôs direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: ‚ÄúI loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale ,‚Äù Wolf said to her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what‚Äôs Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.‚Äù  The New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders‚Äôs seeming gameness for taking the criticism‚Äî‚ÄúThat @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,‚Äù she wrote on Twitter‚Äîa perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents‚Äô Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf‚Äôs speech), said, ‚ÄúWashington is so thin-skinned .‚Äù (She would know .) Celebrities like Rosie O‚ÄôDonnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf‚Äôs performance‚Äîthough, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.  But there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf's own, in response to Sean Spicer's tweet that ""Tonight's #WHCD was a disgrace."" ""Thank you!"" she responded.  Also, while the president was off in Michigan, remarking, as always, on the size of the crowd at his rally, Wolf closed the night with a reminder: Flint, Michigan, still doesn‚Äôt have water."

"It will be a huge lifestyle change. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pictured. Ben Birchall - WPA Pool/Getty Images  The royal wedding is (almost) upon us. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will tie the knot on Saturday, about two years after they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend.  Markle's new life will look drastically different from her life before she met her future husband. Not only will she move from the United States to the United Kingdom and become a British citizen; she'll also transition from an acting career to being full-time royalty.  In the couple's first interview after announcing their engagement, Markle, who is 36 years old, addressed her decision: ""I don't see it as giving anything up, I just see it as a change.""  She added that she had already been working on the television series ""Suits"" for seven years. ""So we're very, very fortunate to be able to have that sort of longevity on a series and for me, once we hit the 100-episode marker, I thought, 'You know what? I have ticked this box and I feel really proud of the work I've done there and now it's time to, as you [Harry] said, work as a team with you.""  In addition to playing Rachel Zane on ""Suits,"" Markle also appeared on the soap opera ""General Hospital."" She's been everything from a United Nations women's advocate to a freelance calligrapher, and she recently shut down her lifestyle blog, ""The Tig.""  While nothing will expressly prohibit Markle from acting, INSIDER's Kristin Salaky and Talia Lakritz reported that royals are forbidden from being politically active and from publicly discussing their political views.  Markle and Prince Harry say they're on the same page about wanting to change the world  Markle's experience marrying into royalty isn't something most of us can relate to. But the general theme of making big life changes for your partner is universal.  As Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg frequently tells young women, ""The most important career choice you'll make is who you marry.""  Legendary investor Warren Buffett said much the same thing in a conversation with Bill Gates at Columbia University. He told the audience: ""The most important decision many of you will make, not all of you, will be the spouse you choose,"" since ""you will move in the direction of the people that you associate with.""  INSEAD professor Jennifer Petriglieri said on an episode of the Harvard Business Review's podcast ""Women at Work,"" that couples, in order to maximize both partners' satisfaction, should have a conversation twice yearly about what they're ""aiming for individually and together"" in the near future.  In fact, in the post-engagement interview, Markle mentioned that she and Prince Harry had had this type of conversation on an early date: ""It was really one of the first things we connected on, it was one of the first things we started talking about when we met, was just the different things that we wanted to do in the world and how passionate we were about seeing change.""  In the same interview, Prince Harry responded to a question about whether he feels a sense of responsibility for Markle leaving acting behind. ""Of course,"" he said, adding that, ""I still have to have some pretty frank conversations with her to say, you know what you're letting yourself in for, it's a big deal, and it's not easy for anybody.""  Prince Harry went on: ""Whatever we have to tackle together or individually, will always be us together as a team.""  More on the royal wedding:"

"I don't know why I chose to watch the Miss Universe Pageant this past Sunday, December 20. I usually don't enjoy those types of shows, but I'm very glad I watched, because I was able to see Steve Harvey make his now-famous mistake in announcing the winner of Miss Universe 2015. My happiness has nothing to do with schadenfreude, though, as I take no pleasure in the suffering of others.  The reason why I felt fortunate to witness this incredibly awkward moment was because it illustrated to me an important lesson both in human frailty and in human resilience. It was one of the worst possible things that could go wrong -- a horrendous faux pas played out in front of an audience of millions, followed by a surprising and excellent recovery which I saw as tremendously reassuring.  When we look at various lists our top fears, the fear of public speaking is always very close to the top, and it's because of of the underlying fear of making a fool of oneself.  Shame is a major source of anxiety for human beings. The sensation of shame is particularly painful because it includes not only feeling bad and stupid, but also small and ridiculous. Public shame is the worst of all. The anguish of being humiliated in front of our peers -- or, worse, those who we're hoping to impress -- can be excruciating.  Many people avoid speaking in public altogether for the express purpose of not allowing themselves to be put in a position that might result in their experiencing shame. Many people would rather do just about anything than speak in public.  So, when Steve Harvey botched the announcement of the winner of Miss Universe 2015, he realized one of our worst fears: he looked really bad in front of the contestants, his bosses and millions of people all around the world.  Mr. Harvey did the thing that we all fear when we contemplate speaking in public. He messed up. But then he turned around and surprised us. He recovered.  We can be so anxious about the possibility of looking foolish in public that our thoughts go no further than to the dreaded possibility of public humiliation.  We can't imagine standing there, as Mr. Harvey did, with egg on our face, having demonstrated our ineptitude to the masses. Equally, we wouldn't have contemplated how we might react if such a situation were to occur. We simply imagine that we'd die, right then and there, or at least wish that we were dead.  What Mr. Harvey showed us -- and why I was so happy to witness his big blunder -- was that we can mess up, look foolish and then we can make things right again.  Mr. Harvey showed us that it's possible for us to fall on our face but then stand up, brush ourselves off and carry on with our dignity intact. He showed us all-too-human fallibility, but also real class, courage and resilience.  I was very impressed by the way Mr. Harvey handled his error. He owned up to it, apologized for it, explained what happened without being defensive, and even begged the audience not to blame his error on the contestants.  He took responsibility for what had happened and he did the right thing. He didn't try to save face, minimize his mistake or laugh it off. He was serious, humble and appropriately contrite. He knew he'd messed up, and he did his best to make things right.  That night, all of us who were watching the pageant collectively cringed as we witnessed Mr. Harvey's mistake. We felt horrible for the young women involved and embarrassed for Mr. Harvey.  But then, as I reflected upon what I'd just seen, I realized that, although it was an incredibly uncomfortable moment, it was also an enormously valuable lesson for all of us to take in.  I really appreciate the way Mr. Harvey handled this situation. In fact, he did millions of people a huge favour. He realized one of our worst fears in as public a forum as one could imagine. And he didn't die. His head didn't explode. He didn't run off the stage and commit ritual suicide.  No, Mr. Harvey messed up, owned up, corrected the situation and survived. And he demonstrated to all of us that we too can mess up and survive, if we're willing to do the right thing, as he did.  So, Steve Harvey, thank you.  I know you weren't planning on being such an excellent role model, but as is often the case when things go sideways, amazing surprises can happen. Amazing choices can be made and powerful lessons can be learned.  The next time I get up on a stage somewhere and I'm about to give a talk, I'll remember Steve Harvey and the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. I'll remember that the worst happened and nobody died. I'll take a deep breath and remind myself that if he could mess up in front of millions of people and survive, I really have nothing to worry about, after all.

"This just in: Eminem uses dating apps to find potential partners, because celebrities are just like us, I guess?  The rapper recently sat down with Vulture to talk about his new album Revival, but he also opened up about his love life. Em's been single for a while now, and it turns out that he's turned to the internet for a quicker, easier way to meet new people.  ""It's tough. Since my divorce I've had a few dates and nothing's panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public,"" he said. ""Dating's just not where I'm at lately.""  When asked if he uses dating apps to meet people, the rapper admitted to using Tinder.  ""And Grindr,"" he said, adding, ""I also used to go to strip clubs. What can I say? Going to strip clubs is how I was meeting some chicks. It was an interesting time for me.""  Whatever works, right? In any case, Eminem doesn't seem stressed about being single, with the rapper explaining, ""Am I lonely? No, I'm good. Thanks for asking though.""

Kardashian asked the president to pardon Alice Marie Johnson, a woman serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense.  Before the meeting, Kardashian tweeted a birthday message for Johnson.  Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you üôèüèº‚ú® ‚Äî Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018  But people on Twitter just couldn't believe that this was actually happening.

Charles Kushner was jailed from 2005 to 2006.  The young Kushner even carried a wallet that his father made for him while serving prison time for his white collar crimes.  Since the experience, Kushner has vowed to make prison reform a key issue as a senior White House adviser, according to Vanity Fair. He's lobbied for the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that helps inmates transition back into society more smoothly with job training and drug treatment programs. The bill, which passed the House last week, also gives inmates with nonviolent charges the chance to finish their sentences in halfway houses and house arrest. It's also seen its fair share of criticism.  Kardashian has been scrutinized for defending her husband Kanye West after his controversial tweets supporting Trump and far-right figures. But prison reform is something that she's been vocal about in the past; on Monday, she tweeted her support for Matthew Charles, a former inmate who turned his life around after 21 years of incarceration. Charles is required to serve another 10 years because his original release was a clerical error.  This man is sentenced to 35 yrs for selling drugs. He serves over 21 yrs, is released, finds a job, new relationship, starts a new life, & now is being sent back for another 10 yrs because the original release was an error. This man has completely rehabilitated himself. So sad https://t.co/msLsMSHGxh ‚Äî Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 28, 2018  She also shared a tweet about a man who was sentenced to only 90 days of house arrest after raping a child.  Since he doesn‚Äôt have to go on the sex offender registry, let it be known in the court of public opinion instead:    His name is LYLE BURGESS in California and he is the founder of auto part company RARE PARTS INC    Spread the word. Let everyone know what he is, since the law won‚Äôt. https://t.co/ar2WPtLJG9 ‚Äî Kelly (@kellyblaus) May 27, 2018  Kardashian has also hinted at political aspirations. In an unaired clip from Khloe and Lamar, she pondered running for mayor of Glendale, a town in the greater Los Angeles area, because of its prominent Armenian population. (It's worth noting that Glendale doesn't have mayoral elections ‚Äî instead, its city council appoints a member to serve as mayor for one year.) Despite her past misinformation about the town's bureaucratic structure, it's possible that she used this meeting to sow seeds for future political gain.  Kardashian hasn't made a public statement about the meeting yet, aside from tweeting the birthday message for Alice Marie Johnson. Is there a chance we'll get to see a behind the scenes of the meeting on the next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians? Possibly ‚Äî although season 15 doesn't have a premiere date yet. A Variety report revealed that the Kardashian/Jenner/West empire milked a deal with E! that will keep them on the air until 2020."

"An explosive report from Life & Style states that their two and a half year marriage was 'dysfunctional from the get-go' and 'never a real marriage.'    According to pals of the former Friends star, Jen would often end up at best friend Courteney Cox‚Äôs house in floods of tears.  Getty  'The way Jen sees it, Justin simply refused to change,' says the source. 'Especially when it came to his relationship with other women.'    Just weeks after they announced their shock break up, Justin took to Instagram to promote a homeless pets shelter. However eagle-eyed fans were quick to notice that the star hashtagged Selena Gomez, a former friend of Jen‚Äôs and one of many females who Justin was rumoured to have got a little too close to during their relationship.    'Justin is a classic ladies‚Äô man and flirt, and it always drove Jen up the wall,' spills the friend.

"The Kardashians have awoken many feelings in their viewers, with one of those feelings being envy. It is sometimes irresistible to not envy them. I mean, come on!! Their jobs seem pretty easy, they get paid millions of dollars, travel all around the world, dress to the nines, look gorgeous all the time and have a close knit family.  It seems like they have it all right? Well‚Ä¶ that is for you to decide. The reality of things is that even if they became famous for doing reality TV, everything that we see on the screen is not real at all.  Read this list and realize just whose life you would rather have. You might realize how amazing your life is and why you wouldn‚Äôt change it for the world.  advertising  14 They will never have a 'normal' life again  via:youtube.com  This family is so famous they will probably never have normal lives again. They are Michael Jackson famous, if anything they are harassed more than he was. They can't even leave their homes without needing to look flawless as the paparazzi are always waiting to catch their every move. Wouldn't you go crazy?  13 Their Beauty is Not As Real As It Seems  via:www.thekyliejenner.com  advertising  They make money out of their beauty, it is one of their most important assets, along with their bums. That is why it's no surprise that they have to invest millions of dollars in looking absolutely perfect every day.  It‚Äôs been reported by the Daily Mail that Kim Kardashian spends over $130,000 dollars a year on beauty treatments alone. With that amount of cash anyone would look flawless.  So next time you envy her beauty just think she pays a very high price tag to look that way.  12 Pressure to be Beautiful  Via: Youtube.com  Women around the world feel this constant pressure as well, but can you imagine how stressful it must be when your income depends on it and you have millions of eyes on you?  Kylie Jenner is one of the main examples of the pressure that can lead to an already beautiful girl to get a cosmetic procedure to look a certain way. She was not even 18 years old when she got her lips pumped to (I‚Äôm assuming) look like her older sisters, whose looks are reported as ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù thanks to all of that cash they spend on it.  Pretty ironic isn‚Äôt it? That the older Kardashians negatively influenced their younger sibling into getting cosmetic procedures to looks like them.  11 Stolen Childhoods  via:www.yournextshoes.com  advertising  Kylie and Kendal have spent nearly half their lives recorded by the cameras for the world to see. They‚Äôve had to deal with very personal issues and have cameras record their every reaction, limiting their privacy.  Teenage years are very difficult for most human beings; it is a difficult stage that involves a lot of changes and behavior that many of us wish to forget. These young girls have the entire world watching their every move, their lives, the failures and successes and it‚Äôs all being recorded for the world to remember.  The last years of their childhood was spent with other people around their house just recording everything, with their sisters putting on a show. Can you imagine what this can do to the mind of a child?  Kylie and Kendal don‚Äôt deserve our envy. They deserve our compassion.  10 The Kardashians Have Suffered Great Pain  via:www.dailymail.co.uk  They‚Äôre humans with lives that have not been all perfect and they still smile, laugh and go on. They seem so happy most of the time and that‚Äôs actually something nice to see given that they‚Äôve also had to deal with very painful events in their lives.  Their marriages and relationships have been ridiculed, especially Kim's 72 hour marriage to Kris Humphries. Khloe has the whole world giving opinions on her marriage and Kourtney is dealing with a very public breakup.  9 They Have to Deal With a Lot of Humiliation  via:radaronline.com  advertising  To us the Kardashians might seem powerful; they are after all celebrities with millions of fans. Nevertheless in the celebrity world there are certain ‚Äúcategories‚Äù, do not be fooled by their millions of fans.  Within the Hollywood celebrity world the Kardashians are far away from being a part of the exclusive A list. They have actually been heavily criticize by BIG names in the entertainment industry like Jon Hamm, Daniel Craig, Michael Buble, Mariah Carey, Cher, Reese Witherspoon and even Barak and Michelle Obama.  They are considered too trashy, fame obsessed and foolish. Barack Obama doesn‚Äôt even like it when his daughters watch their show.  8 Their Fame is a Result of a Scandalous Sex Tape  via:darkhorsenews.com  It‚Äôs no surprise to anyone that the Kardashians/Jenners owe their fame to Kim‚Äôs scandalous sex tape. As Barbara Walter said in an interview with the Kardashians ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt act, you don‚Äôt sing, you don‚Äôt dance. You don‚Äôt have‚Ä¶. Forgive me, any talents‚Äù.  Their fame came mainly as a product of Kim‚Äôs sex tape and Kris Jenner‚Äôs excellent capacity for marketing it to their advantage. If it wasn‚Äôt for that, it‚Äôs very, extremely unlikely we would know their names today.  advertising  7 Kylie and Kendal Went Through their Dad‚Äôs Gender Transition  advertising  We all love Caitlin, there‚Äôs no doubt about that. The world felt proud when Bruce was brave enough to go through the public transition of becoming Caitlyn.  Nevertheless for Kylie and Kendal it was a pretty big emotional trauma. It was, after all, saying goodbye to their father Bruce and saying hello to Caitlyn.  Anyone in the world would find this emotionally difficult, and to make matters worse Kylie and Kendal had to go through it in the public eye. In several chapters of Keeping Up With The Kardashians you can easily notice a troubled Kylie finding it hard to come to terms to her father‚Äôs decision.  6 They Live Superficial Lifestyles  via:www.eonline.com  According to Psychology Today, leading a materialistic and superficial life style can enhance the probability of developing depression.  It is the lack of spiritual and emotional fulfillment that can help create mental health issues, especially when narcissism is involved in the formula.  As we can see the Kardashian/Jenners expose every detail of their lives. Not only on their reality T.V. show but also on their social media, perfectly yet falsely portraying themselves in their best snapshots. These symptoms are categorized as symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder, which can lead to emotional trauma.  5 They‚Äôre Self Obsessed  via:www.thedailybeast.com  advertising  What the world needs is more empathetic human beings who are concerned about the well being of others, not people who are only concerned about themselves.  The Kardashians have famously portrayed themselves as self obsessed with their millions of selfies, which have led their younger sisters, Kylie and Kendal to follow the same footpath.  Being self obsessed can actually cause health problems, just like His Holiness the Dalai Lama says: People who have the tendency to use more self-referential terms (I, me, myself) tend to have more health problems and earlier deaths. Being self-absorbed has an immediate effect of narrowing one‚Äôs focus and blurring one‚Äôs vision.‚Äù  4 Their Father is Known to Have Played Devil‚Äôs Advocate  Via: Mirror.co.uk  Everyone wants to admire their father for great qualities and for being a good person. Unfortunately for the Kardashians, their dad is known to have played devil‚Äôs advocate by famously defending O.J. Simpson in his murder trial after killing his wife Nicole Brown.  O.J. Simpson‚Äôs case became famous because the world was certain that he got away with murder, thanks to his magnificent attorney Robert Kardashian.  Yes, their father was a very successful lawyer, but one with values that leaves many wondering about his integrity.  3 Their Mother Has a Questionable History  via:www.dailymail.co.uk  advertising  Kris Jenner had an affair with Todd Waterman while still being married to Robert Kardashian. It has also been reported that she would leave her children at home while she enjoyed the good life.  It can't be pleasing to know that your mother cared more about her lover than her children. Rob Kardashian Jr. was just a baby when his mother would run off at night to have fun.  If this where not enough, in Robert Kardashian‚Äôs diary it was reported that Kris Jenner would beat up Kim Kardashian when she was a young teenager and she would also come home drunk.  2 They Fight A Lot  via:www.youtube.com  It‚Äôs normal to fight with your siblings. Nevertheless to anyone who has ever watched the show they‚Äôd be very accustomed to always seeing them fight. Even over the simplest and most foolish things of all, like when Kim fought with her mother over an apartment in New York.  Instead of feeling grateful and happy to have such a marvelous life style they focus on the little things to make a drama over anything. It kind of makes us wonder, are they even happy?  1 They Are Very Much Hated  via:www.youtube.com  advertising  The Kardashians are those people we all love to hate. They might have millions of followers and fans, but these people are probably smaller in quantity than the haters. It doesn‚Äôt take long to scroll down the comments section on stories about them and read many negative comments about them.  They‚Äôve had to grow a very thick skin to put up with a lot of the criticism that gets thrown their way. They are not like other celebrities who tend to have more fans than haters. Kim Kardashian in particular has appeared in several lists as one of the most hated people in the entertainment industry.  Ouch! No one would like to be on that list.

"The publication's explosive report claims Justin was spotted riding his motorbike around New York City without his wife.  An insider close to the couple told the publication, 'He's the happiest man in Manhattan, while Jen chooses to stay primarily in sunny LA.'  'It's a long distance marriage,' they add.  Getty  Life & Style reports that the days leading up to Jen's 49th birthday on February 11 was when the couple's relationship came crumbling down.  The publication claims to have exclusively learned that Jen feared Justin intended to break up with her on her big day, with a source revealing: 'He'd arranged to throw Jen a small, intimate party and hang around for a few days before heading right back to New York.  'And Jen thought he had plans to quietly file for divorce soon as he returned.'  The insider continues, 'As time drags on, Justin seems to view his visits with Jen as obligatory, and he's just been going through the motions.'  'The marriage is all but over.'  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux step out looking tense in New York City Getty  Life & Style's sensational report reveals that the whole situation is far too familiar for Jen.  After a New Year's getaway in 2005 to Anguilla with Brad Pitt and several friends, Jen and her then husband announced their separation.  In public Jen and Justin have always put on a solid front, but Life & Style's bombshell report reveals that Justin is 'tired' of the facade.  'He seems like he's tired of carrying on the facade of a happy marriage,' a friend close to the star told Life & Style. 'Knowing Justin, I think he feels it's best to make it an official split. He will always love Jen, but deep down he seems to believe they'd be better off as friends.'  The couple have yet to respond to Life & Style's allegations."
he says this theory of infection explains some things that doctors have been trying to puzzle out. for example certain conditions like high blood pressure diabetes and heart disease stress the endothelium. its no surprise then that people who have these conditions are also the ones who get the sickest when they catch covid-19. it also helps to explain why patients have such low oxygen in their blood but their lungs may not be as stiff as they typically are in patients who have respirato. 
"Justin Bieber became engaged to Hailey Baldwin over the weekend.  But the news doesn't seem to be upsetting his ex Selena Gomez, who he was dating on and off from 2011 until earlier this year.  On Sunday the 25-year-old Wolves singer was spotted with a handsome young man who looks a bit like a Beckham. He was by her side as they boarded a yacht named Justine to visit Coney Island in New York in style.  Back with this one: Selena Gomez was seen with a cute mystery man when she went to Coney Island in New York on Sunday  They were so close: The man followed the Love You Like A Love Sing songbird  He's got the look: The man looks a bit like a Beckham and was dressed down for the day at sea; she wore a pair of black leather sandals by Tod's  The mystery man had on a black shirt with blue shorts and worn-in sneakers with Puma socks.  And Gomez was chic in a white crop top, rust colored drawstring slacks and thick soled black leather sandals by Tod's for SS18. Black thin sunglasses looked on trend.  The Good For You singer also carried a notepad and a glass of red iced tea.  There they are two months ago: The siren was also seen with this same man in May when they were at a Taylor Swift concert at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California  It's interesting that she boarded a boat named Justine which is eerily close to the first name of her most famous ex.  But it is likely the boat was booked by her assistant and the pop star never even noticed the name.  She was joined by several pals as she embarked on the day cruise around New York.  Chic chick: Gomez was chic in a white crop top, rust colored drawstring slacks  Details: Black thin sunglasses looked on trend. The Good For You singer also carried a notepad and a glass of red iced tea  Coney Island is a peninsular residential neighborhood, beach, and leisure/entertainment destination of Long Island on the Coney Island Channel.  It is in the Lower Bay in the southwestern part of the borough of Brooklyn in New York City.  Selena often splits her time between New York City and Los Angeles.  Gomez has been in relationships with The Weeknd (2016 - 2017), Zedd (producer) (2015), Bieber (2010 - 2018), Taylor Lautner (2009) and Nick Jonas (2008 - 2010).  All aboard... the love boat? The fellow followed her up the stairs as they were greeted by a crew member  New do? Gomez appeared to have some shorter hair on the back of her neck. The rest of her locks were piled into a messy updo for a casual look  If Gomez is upset that Bieber may marry Baldwin - who he dated years ago after a split from the brunette Texas native - she was not showing it.  She was also seen on a boat in a bikini in an image shared by her assistant Theresa Marie Mingus.  In a snapshot Theresa posted to Instagram, bikini-clad Selena beamed and stuck her tongue out while lounging on a deck chair near the stern of the vessel.  She can't get away from Justin? It's interesting that she boarded a boat named Justine which is eerily close to the first name of her most famous ex. But it is likely the boat was booked by her assistant and the pop star never even noticed the name  Shipping off: The Back To You crooner quickly slipped into a two piece bathing suit  Not the Bahamas, but oh well: The location was New York City, but it still looked like the group had a fun time  Theresa, also wearing a bikini, captioned gleefully that her boss was her: 'bestfriendddddd'.  In video footage tweeted by one of Selena's fan accounts, a claque of both male and female friends could be seen accompanying her on her boat ride.  After she split from The Weeknd, former teenage sweethearts Justin and Selena reportedly went on again late last year - but by this March, they were on a break.  Selena's mother Mandy Teefey told Gossip Cop in January she was 'not happy' her daughter had taken up with her used-to-be.  What engagement? She was also seen in this blue bikini as she sat on deck of the yacht; the image was shared by her assistant Theresa Marie Mingus  Having a ball: In a snapshot Theresa posted to Instagram , bikini-clad 25-year-old Selena beamed and stuck her tongue out while lounging on a deck chair near the stern of the vessel  A place in the sun: In video footage tweeted by one of Selena's fan accounts, a claque of both male and female friends could be seen accompanying her on her boat ride  They purportedly first started dating in 2010 before going red carpet official at the following year's Vanity Fair Oscar Party.  'Jelena' are said to have split up late in 2012 - only for a rash of unconfirmed reconciliation rumors to flare up around them for a bit in 2013.  That July, however, Selena explained in an interview with the Associated Press: 'I've known him for a really long time and we enjoy each other's company every now and then. But I'm definitely single and enjoying being that.'  Justin is claimed to have proposed to Hailey in a restaurant at the Bahamian resort where he was staying this weekend, a brace of eyewitnesses gossiped to TMZ.  Out in the open: She and Justin Bieber purportedly first started dating in 2010 before going red carpet official at the following year's Vanity Fair Oscar Party (pictured)  Before he popped the question, his security detail allegedly instructed the other restaurant-goers to tuck away their cellphones.  That afternoon, Justin's mother Pattie Mallette had effervesced on her Twitter account: 'Love Love Love Love Love Love Love.'  Justin and Hailey had a brief dalliance in 2016, but Hailey spoke to E! News that February and qualified that 'We are not an exclusive couple.'  After his latest split from Selena, Justin and Hailey have been back on over the past few weeks and have been unafraid to publicly display their affection.  On Sunday, Justin's father Jeremy posted a sunset snapshot of his son and wrote: '@justinbieber Proud is an understatement! Excited for the next chapter!'  Meanwhile, Hailey's born-again Christian father Stephen Baldwin, one of the less famous actor brothers of Alec Baldwin, tweeted a Bible verse that same day.  Together again: Justin and Hailey Baldwin, with whom he had a brief non-exclusive dalliance in 2016, reportedly got engaged on Saturday at a Bahamian resort  Beginning with '#Blessed,' he went on to quote Gospel: 'John 1:14 14 The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth'.  Hailey held forth about her own religious convictions in Elle UK last year, saying: 'It's something I plan to stick to for the rest of my life ‚Äì raise my kids that way, marry someone who believes in the same things. It's important to me.'  Meanwhile, Justin, who in 2014 was arrested in Miami on charges including driving his Lamborghini under the influence, is a famous congregant of the Sydney-born megachurch Hillsong and something of a religious prot√©g√© to its pastor Carl Lentz."

"The producers of BBC drama Ordeal by Innocence have explained the decision to recast and reshoot the Agatha Christie adaptation following sexual assault allegations made against original actor Ed Westwick.  Advertisement  Ordeal by Innocence was dropped from the BBC Christmas schedules after allegations of sexual assault were made against actor Westwick in November last year. Westwick strenuously denies the allegations.  Producers Mammoth Screen decided to reshoot parts of the series with another actor, 30-year-old English star Christian Cooke. Now director Sandra Goldbacher and producer Damien Timmer have explained in a new interview with Radio Times why the decision was made.  ‚ÄúHundreds and hundreds of people‚Äôs work would have just gone,‚Äù director Goldbacher says in the new issue of Radio Times, ‚Äúor been indefinitely delayed. Which would have been devastating for everyone.‚Äù  Goldbacher adds that she was encouraged by the example of director Ridley Scott, who recast and reshot Hollywood movie All the Money in the World with Christopher Plummer following allegations made against original star Kevin Spacey.  ‚ÄúI felt encouraged by Ridley Scott having done it. It was like a sort of talisman for us all: he‚Äôs done it, so we can do it,‚Äù she said.  A trailer for the re-worked BBC series was recently released, including Cooke as character Mickey Argyll.  Goldbacher and producer Damian Timmer explain in the new issue how they were able to bring the original cast and locations back for the re-shoots, despite the late notice and time constraints.  While original filming took place in the summer, the re-shoots were conducted in winter. As a consequence, Timmer explains, ‚Äúthe technical challenges were reversed. This time, we had the snow, not the sun.‚Äù  Both Ordeal by Innocence and All the Money in the World were re-cast in order for the production to go ahead. However, other projects including Netflix biopic Gore starring Spacey were shelved.  Timmer says in the interview that the experience of Ordeal by Innocence shows that the television and film industry is able to adapt to meet specific challenges.  ‚ÄúEvery era throws up new challenges that impact on filming. You might always have shot a series in a location that suddenly becomes a terrorist zone. The industry adapts and finds ways of working around whatever the issues is at the time.‚Äù  Ordeal by Innocence will now be shown on BBC1 this Easter.

"CLOSE Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's tribe may be growing, according to reports on Wednesday that the celebrity couple have hired a surrogate to carry their third child. USA TODAY  Kim Kardashian at the 2017 Forbes Women's Summit on June 13, 2017, in New York. (Photo: Angela Weiss, AFP/Getty Images)  Soon, there could be another little Kardashian-West to coo over.  Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, already the parents of two (North, 4, and Saint, 18 months) and longing for a third, have hired a surrogate to help make it happen, because Kardashian's doctors strongly advised her not to go through a third pregnancy.  According to People and E! Online, unnamed sources in the know say the couple paid a surrogacy agency nearly $70,000 to find a surrogate, who will be paid about $45,000 for 10 months of carrying a pregnancy, with a bonus of $5,000 for each possible twin or triplet child.  This news broke Wednesday, the same day Kardashian's first makeup line, KKW Beauty, launched and then promptly sold out of her Cr√®me Contour & Highlight Kit.  All of the Contour & Highlight Kits have sold out!!! ‚Äî Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) June 21, 2017  If you've been keeping up with Keeping Up With the Kardashians, you already know Kim was considering surrogacy because she's talked about it on the show. She wanted a third baby anyway, and her yen grew only stronger in the wake of her traumatic experience as the victim of an armed robbery in Paris last October.  ""I've come to the conclusion that I can't carry another one,"" Kardashian told her mother, Kris Jenner, on the show. ""So now I want to explore surrogacy.""  A third pregnancy was not in the cards for Kardashian: She suffered from placenta accreta in her first pregnancy, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes giving birth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.  Kardashian detailed on her blog how her doctor had to insert his arm inside her to scrape the placenta from her womb after delivering her first baby.  ""How disgusting and painful!!! My mom was crying; she had never seen anything like this before,"" she wrote. ""It was the most painful experience of my life!""  Kardashian's recent discussions on the show about her desire for another baby have also involved her sister, Khlo√©, who offered to act as a surrogate until they went to a fertility specialist who found Khloe has fertility problems of her own.  Chrissy Teigen also offered to act as Kim's surrogate, telling Access Hollywood that she would do it in ""a heartbeat.""  ‚ÄúI really enjoyed the pregnancy process,"" said Teigen, 30, and a new mom herself.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel this spring, and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  Fans have eagerly been waiting to hear which celebrities scored an invite to what's sure to be the biggest event of the year, and this week, we learned that one of Meghan's closest pals, Priyanka Chopra, will for sure be in attendance. ""Yes I'm going,"" the Quantico star confirmed during her guest appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Thursday. ""But that's all.""  Chopra told People, however, that she is ""not a bridesmaid,"" despite all the speculation in recent months that she would be in the bridal party.  As for the groom, Prince Harry has finally picked his Best Man, and, unsurprisingly, it's Prince William! The Duke of Cambridge joked earlier this year that he was expecting to fulfill the role, but his brother had yet to ask him. We're happy to report that Harry made it official on Thursday.  ""The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St. George‚Äôs Chapel,"" Kensington Palace shared in a statement.  Meanwhile, Meghan has been busy wrapping up all the last minute details ahead of her and Harry's nuptials. A source told ET on Tuesday that Amal Clooney's go-to hairdresser in London, Miguel Perez, is expected to style Meghan's tresses on her big day. He's currently a stylist at Salon Sloane, whose world-leading hairstylists have worked on everyone from Lindsay Lohan to the Victoria's Secret Angels.  ""Yes, I do Meghan's hair,"" Miguel reportedly told The Mail this week. ""I do Amal's, and Meghan is friends with her. I also do George [Clooney]'s, I do the whole family. Amal put Meghan and me together when she moved here [to London]. I do her color, her cut and her styling.""  ""We have talked about it [the wedding] and we have a plan,"" he continued. ""I can't say any more, but we know what we're doing.""  Meghan and Harry also chose the music for their wedding service this week, and it will include a full orchestra. St. George's Chapel's Director of Music, James Vivian, will direct the music, which features a selection of choral groups, soloists and musicians, Kensington Palace revealed on Tuesday.  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be saying ""I do"" in:  Getty Images  OUT AND ABOUT  The lovebirds took a brief break from wedding planning early Wednesday morning to represent the royal family at the Anzac Day Service in London, England.  Anzac Day is a day of remembrance for soldiers from Australia and New Zealand who've served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. Both countries are a part of the Commonwealth, of which Queen Elizabeth II serves as leader.  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  As we anxiously wait to see what Meghan's wedding dresses will look like, there's also talks about what tiara she will be gifted with. There's a good chance that the bride-to-be will debut a brand-new tiara as she walks down the aisle, royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of the blog The Court Jeweler told Good Housekeeping earlier this week.  ""The younger son's wife getting a new tiara would be the precedent,"" she explained. ""Prince Charles might buy her a tiara.""  Previous royal brides like Sarah, Duchess of York, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, received major bling on their wedding day. But, the circumstances are different for Kate Middleton, who wore the Cartier Halo tiara for her wedding, since she will eventually become queen, and will ""borrow"" tiaras in the meantime.  ""Usually what happens is you get allotted your tiaras,"" Kay explained. ""Like Camilla [Duchess of Cornwall] has three, but they're all technically loaners that not anyone else wears.""  RATHER REGAL LOOKS  Getty Images  Meghan outdid herself with not one, but two regal looks in one day.  While stepping out to the Anzac Day service, the 36-year-old brunette beauty donned an elegant gray Smythe coat with a black dress underneath, Sarah Flint Jay heels, a Gucci Dionysus bag, a red poppy pin and a statement wide-brimmed, floppy hat. This type of hat is much simpler than the fancy fascinators and pillbox hats we typically see on royals like Queen Elizabeth II and the Duchess of Cambridge, but we love that Meghan put her own unique spin on the trend.  For her second look of the day, Meghan opted for a more formal ensemble. The bride-to-be arrived to Westminster Abbey in a black beret embellished with a dragonfly from milliner Philip Treacy, which she pulled off perfectly by pairing it with a midi-length Emilia Wickstead dress suit and a Jimmy Choo box clutch.  SERVIN' UP SUITS  USA Network  Sadly, this section of our weekly royals countdown ends this week, as Meghan appeared in her very last episode of Suits on Wednesday.  In case you missed it, we recapped the full finale (HERE).  You had a good run, Rachel Zane.  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Earlier this week, ET caught up with one of Meghan's former makeup artists, Spencer Barnes, who opened up about her evolving beauty looks and how when he was still doing her makeup, Meghan always requested a natural look.  ""She loves beautiful skin, to start with, and she has the most gorgeous complexion,"" Barnes mused. ""It's that soft, caramel. Her mixed heritage makes her an exotic beauty of beauties. Her chocolate eyes, the way her eyes light up when she smiles, I love her smile, her teeth and her lips. And then her perfect brows.""  ""Whenever I'd work with her, she'd like to highlight her fresh, radiant skin,"" he continued. ""We'd do a very glowing, fresh-faced skin. We'd use earthy tones, colors that enhanced her natural beauty, rather than a lot of obvious color choices, like purple, green or blue. We'd stick with earthy tones -- peaches, golds, browns -- a lot of rich, warm tones and that really flattered her. It helped her just look radiant and fresh.""

William joined Harry and Meghan at the Anzac Day Service on Wednesday, and also attended the opening of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in London one day later with his brother.

"They famously coined the phrase 'conscious uncoupling' when they announced the end of their 11-year marriage in 2014.  But even though they're no longer husband and wife, it seems friendly exes Gwyneth Paltrow, 44, and Chris Martin, 40, remain the best of friends.  Sharing a photo on her Instagram page, the actress and her former spouse joined forces for a day out with daughter Apple, 13, and son Moses, 11, at the Museum Of Ice Cream in Los Angeles on Sunday.  Scroll down for video  Family affair: Friendly exes Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin enjoyed a day out with daughter Apple, 13, and son Moses, 11, at the Museum Of Ice Cream in Los Angeles on Sunday  Celebrating both Apple's birthday and Mother's Day, the family looked as though they were having a blast on their day out at the museum, billed as a 'place where flavours are mysteries and toppings are toys'.  The Coldplay frontman looked to be enjoying the company of daughter Apple and son Moses along with beaming ex-wife Gwyneth.  The youngster was bearing a remarkable similarity to her actress mother, proving the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  Alongside the snap, Gwyneth wrote: 'Best Apple's birthday/Mother's Day EVER at the @museumoficecream @autumncomm SO FUN #goopgo #dtla.'  Mini me: The family were celebrating celebrating both Apple's birthday and Mother's Day as they enjoyed their day out at the museum  Apple was pictured in a pink hoodie with leopard print leggings and UGG boots.  Moses donned an equally sporty look with a darker pink hoodie with navy and black tracksuit bottoms and black Jeezy trainers.  Chris looked laid back in black skinny jeans and a vintage white t-shirt.  He rocked up the look with a blue G-Shock watch and blue and white Air Jordan trainers.  Fashionista Gwyneth looked chic in a floral maxi skirt and fitted black vest.  In 2014, Gwyneth told readers of her website of her impending divorce after 11 years of marriage.  Divorce: Gwyneth and Chris broke the news of their marital split in March 2014 writing 'it is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate'  Gwyneth and Chris broke the news of their marital split in March 2014, writing: 'It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate.'  They went on to explain that the split had been on the cards for 'well over a year' and that in many ways they were closer than ever.  She described the process as 'conscious uncoupling'.  'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner,' the statement continued.  But since the couple's heartbreaking split it appears the family unit is stronger than ever.  Happy together: Since the couple's heartbreaking split in March 2014 after 11 years of marriage it appears the family unit is stronger than ever  According to the teachings of conscious uncoupling, humans simply aren't meant to stay married for so long.  They point toward the exponential increase in lifespan that humans have experienced in the last century or so: 'We‚Äôre living three lifetimes compared to early humans, perhaps we need to redefine the construct.  'Social research suggests that because we‚Äôre living so long, most people will have two or three significant long-term relationships in their lifetime.  'Our biology and psychology aren‚Äôt set up to be with one person for four, five, or six decades.'  Gwyneth has since moved on with Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk, 46, who she's been dating since 2014.  Chris has been dating actress Annabelle Wallis, 32, for the past 18 months, and enjoyed a brief romance with Hollywood leading lady Jennifer Lawrence, 26, in the summer of 2015."
"Doin‚Äô what is best for her. Selena Gomez believes she has made the right decision when it comes to on-again, off-again boyfriend Justin Bieber ‚Äî by choosing not to be with him.  ‚ÄúSelena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship, like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship,‚Äù a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.  ‚ÄúShe obviously chose happiness and her friends and family and is so thrilled about her decision-making process,‚Äù the source continued before adding, ‚ÄúShe feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.‚Äù  Sharing the same sentiment, another insider tells Us that the ‚ÄúWolves‚Äù singer, who was the one who broke it off with Bieber, feels like ‚Äúshe got it out of her system.‚Äù Helping things is the fact that Gomez, 25, has other exciting things to focus on, like her new single ‚ÄúBack 2 You‚Äù which will be released on Thursday, May 10 ‚Äî a song that many are speculating to have been inspired by Bieber.  Us Weekly exclusively revealed that the former flames, who dated from 2011 to 2014, were officially back together after they were spotted reuniting in October 2017. Their rekindled romance saw the pair going to church, enjoying candle-lit dinners and embarking on romantic getaways together, including a trip to Jamaica in February, when the pair attended Bieber‚Äôs father‚Äôs wedding.  Despite trying to make their revamped relationship work, one person was not convinced that it was a good idea: Gomez‚Äôs mother, Mandy Teefey, who reportedly disagreed with her daughter over her decision to give Bieber another chance despite their past tumultuous relationship. In March, Us Weekly announced that the pair were ‚Äútaking a break‚Äù because of Teefy‚Äôs unwavering disapproval of the ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù crooner. Since putting their relationship on pause, Bieber, 24, has been spotted spending time with Baskin Champion.

"Ed Sheeran revealed why Beyonc√© has not been answering your emails: He says the ""Lemonade"" singer changes her email address every week.  On Friday, while at Jingle Ball in Inglewood, California, Sheeran told ET how he pulled off recording his new single, ""Perfect Duet,"" with Beyonc√©.  ""I have an email address I email [to get in touch with Beyonc√©],"" he said. Then he pointed out that Beyonc√©'s email address ""actually changes every week.""  Sheeran said he reached out to her via email and started working on the song in May, but it took a few months to finish the track, which finally dropped on Thursday.  ""Obviously she had twins [in June], and we finished [the song] in September, so I've been holding onto it since then,"" he said of the ""Perfect"" remix.  Speaking of ""Perfect,"" Sheeran added that Beyonc√© only needed one take to record the song. Sheeran also said Beyonc√© had some notes for him.  ""The original version of 'Perfect' was just an acoustic guitar,"" before more instruments were added, he explained. ""[Beyonc√©] rung me up and was like, 'I don't know how you feel about this but I've taken all the instruments off it and it's just gonna be acoustic guitar,' and I was like, 'Ah that's great, because it used to be that!'""  ""Then when we got in together, it wasn't so much notes, it was very much like a back-and-forth thing, like, 'What'd you think of this?' Or, 'What do you think of this?' And [we were] probably in the studio for four hours.""  Once Beyonc√© began recording, it was smooth sailing.  ""She was just like, 'Right!' Went in, one take, came out, like, 'Yeah, that sounds all right!'"" said Sheeran. See more of Sheeran's interview on ET."
"The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating.  The 28-year-old reality star began dating Devin in July of 2017, two months after ending her relationship with fiance Ben Higgins, whom she met on season 20 of The Bachelor.  Lauren and Devin met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show.  Splits: The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating; (pictured March)  'I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve shared before but I only met up with one person from the app and it was him,' the beauty wrote during an Instagram Q&A with fans in October 2017.  'We hung out for a while but more as friends but always got along really well.  'Fast forward two years later when I moved back to L.A. we hung out to catch up and things just kinda happened after that.' she explained.  The former flight attendant also said that her last relationship with Higgins made her more aware of walking down the aisle.  Beginnings: Lauren and Devin had met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show; (pictured August)  She told the fan: 'I‚Äôve learned a lot of things in the last couple years and this is a big one. Marriage is such a special and sacred thing that should never be rushed.'  When asked if she planned on marrying Antin, the star gushed.  'I do see a future with him,' she said.  'But I want to be 1000 percent sure before I get engaged and even more sure before I get married. And for me that takes time.'  Time was not on Antin's side as the two have now gone separate ways.  'I‚Äôve always been someone who maybe jumps into things a little too quickly and I fall really fast,' she told UsWeekly on August 6.  'And I always had this idea that I was going to be married by this age, kids, and this was going to be my plan ‚Ä¶ and now, I mean I‚Äôm almost 29 but I don‚Äôt really have a timestamp on anything anymore, which is nice.'"
"Less than one week after kicking out White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and continuing to harass her family, ‚ÄúRed Hen‚Äù owner Stephanie Wilkinson finally received a bitter taste of her own intolerant medicine.When conservatives encounter someone with whom they disagree, they try to engage in meaningful debate. With liberals, there is only resistance. Instead of inviting civil discourse, leftist ideologues are resorting to suppression, harassment, and even physical violence in response to ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù ideas. Of course, they‚Äôre quickly discovering that their juvenile and fascist actions have consequences.On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her extended family members, many of whom are liberals, were forced out of the Red Hen eatery in Lexington, Virginia, by co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson. Although the party politely obliged the indignant staffers, Wilkinson proceeded to gather her comrades and stalk Sanders‚Äô family at another restaurant, screaming insults and demanding they leave. Now that word of her behavior is national news, Wilkinson is being forced to live by her own principles.Red Hen co-owner Stephanie Wilkinson has not only been forced to step down as executive director of Main Street Lexington, according to Fox News, she‚Äôs also placed herself in the center of what could turn into a massive lawsuit for damages concerning the effect her discrimination against Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had on Red Hen establishments across the country. Along with her resignation from the organization, Wilkinson‚Äôs bigotry has caused unaffiliated Red Hen restaurants across the U.S. to suffer protests, negative reviews, and boycotts, CBS News reports.Main Street Lexington president Elizabeth Outland Branner offered a short response in reference to Wilkinson‚Äôs resignation, which is undoubtedly a move toward damage control for the group, which represents many local businesses.‚ÄúConsidering the events of the past weekend, Stephanie felt it best that for the continued success of Main Street Lexington, she should step aside,‚Äù Branner wrote in an email.Wilkinson has caused such severe damage to other like-named establishments that business owners are desperately addressing the public outrage by disavowing the disgraced liberal feminist and declaring that it is illegal to refuse service to customers based on their political leanings.More than 4,300 replied, including multiple tweets calling on the restaurant to condone Sanders and the Trump administration‚Äôs actions. The Red Hen answered the threats by defining ‚Äúunaffiliated‚Äù as well as an explanation that it is illegal for businesses in the District of Columbia to discriminate against people because of their political views.Another Red Hen restaurant, this one in Swedesboro, New Jersey, also faced a slew of angry calls and social media posts for refusing to serve a woman who‚Äôd never stepped through their door.‚ÄúKindly check your facts before you erroneously defame an innocent victim on Facebook,‚Äù said a post on the family-owned restaurant‚Äôs Facebook page.The manager of a New Jersey-based restaurant with the same name lamented that their location‚Äôs rating has plummetted from ‚Äú4.8 stars to three-point-something.‚Äù An owner in Saybrook, Connecticut, attempted to prevent this same damage by adding a pop-up box stating that their restaurant has ‚Äúabsolutely no affiliation with any other Red Hen restaurant anywhere else.‚ÄùWilkinson has defended her discriminatory actions, ironically claiming that she doesn‚Äôt enjoy ‚Äúconfrontation‚Äù but feels a moral duty to harass political figures and their innocent family members.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a huge fan of confrontation,‚Äù Wilkinson told The Post. ‚ÄúI have a business, and I want the business to thrive.‚Äù But, she went on to say, ‚ÄúThis feels like the moment in our democracy when people have to make uncomfortable actions and decisions to uphold their morals.‚ÄùWhen the mainstream media propagates that those with certain political views are ‚ÄúNazis,‚Äù they incite hatred and violence in those prone to carry out such extremist beliefs. If conservatives are indeed Nazis, progressives have a moral obligation to not only oppose them but physically stop them.However, conservatives are not Nazis. In fact, the right has consistently stood up for the liberties of all, including far-leftists, to express their beliefs in a peaceful and unhindered manner. Such is the opposite of Nazism. In fact, it is those screaming ‚ÄúNazi!‚Äù who are acting as the new Third Reich, shouting ideological chants, forcing out those with whom they disagree, discriminating against certain demographics, attempting to take away our Constitutional rights, and inciting physical violence.Stephanie Wilkinson is getting exactly what she has demanded ‚Äî a backlash from the political opposition. Turnabout is fair play. While conservatives aren‚Äôt going to wield the government as a weapon to force intolerant ideologues like her to serve those they don‚Äôt want to serve, as the left does, they‚Äôre learning that injecting their political views into their non-political professions might not be the best business decision."

"It‚Äôs been three years since Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick parted ways ‚Äî but no matter how much time passes, he will always be considered a part of her family.  After nine years together, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and Disick split in July 2015.

"Nicholas Brendon has been arrested once again.  The former Buffy the Vampire Slayer star was taken into custody in Palm Springs, California, on Oct. 11, as the result of an alleged domestic dispute between the actor and an unnamed woman, who is believed to be his girlfriend.  Brendon -- who played Xander Harris on the popular teen dramedy vampire series from 1997 to 2003 -- was arrested on charges of domestic violence and violating a protective order.  Sgt. William Hutchinson of the Palm Springs Police Department tells ET that the incident in question happened around 9 p.m. at the Saguaro Hotel.  Palm Springs Police Department via Getty Images  PHOTOS: Busted! Hollywood's Most Memorable Mugshots  The 46-year-old actor -- who has had numerous run-ins with the law in the past, including four arrests in 2015 -- allegedly pulled the woman's arm and then her hair after getting into an argument.  Police tell ET that the woman has two other protective orders against Brendon in both New York and Florida. The order allows Brendon to be near the woman, but prohibits him from threatening, harassing, injuring or assaulting her.  Brendon was released from custody on Oct. 12 on a $50,000 bail bond, according to booking records. He is scheduled to appear in court on Nov. 28.  ET reached out to Brendon's rep, who had no comment.  NEWS: Nicholas Brendon Pleads Guilty To Misdemeanor Criminal Mischief, Choking Charges Dropped  In December 2015, the actor plead guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief at the Saratoga Springs City Court in New York after allegedly choking his girlfriend in a hotel room three months earlier.  The judge reportedly ruled that Brendon, -- who has long struggled with substance abuse and depression -- would not serve jail time pending completion of drug and alcohol counseling and avoiding trouble with the law for a year.

"‚ÄúFACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.‚Äù‚Äî Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says ‚Äúevery voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump‚Äù is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump‚Äôs widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.That‚Äôs largely because Trump himself hasn‚Äôt talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn‚Äôt respond to our request for more information, and doesn‚Äôt seem to have answered other media outlets‚Äô requests, either.Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he‚Äôs described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.The FactsCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: ‚ÄúI will get rid of gun-free zones on schools ‚Äî you have to ‚Äî and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There‚Äôs no more gun-free zones.‚Äù His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal ‚Äúraises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?‚ÄùTrump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?Trump‚Äôs answer was still devoid of specifics:‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I‚Äôm also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it‚Äôs gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, ‚ÄòThis is incredible. This is perfect. There‚Äôs no guns in there. I‚Äôm the only one that‚Äôs going to have guns.‚Äô You can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm going to work with the states, and if I have to, I‚Äôm going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I‚Äôm allowed to do that. . . . But we can‚Äôt have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, ‚ÄòWe are a gun-free zone.‚Äô And then you have these crazy people out there saying, ‚ÄòBoy, this is the most incredible thing,‚Äô and that‚Äôs happening.‚ÄùThe Pinocchio TestTrump hasn‚Äôt offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren‚Äôt clear yet.Trump said he would ‚Äúwork with the states‚Äù but that he would ‚Äúoverride the states if I have to.‚Äù Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.The Geppetto Checkmark(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check pageSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter"
"The 2018 ESPYS celebrated not only the biggest achievements in sports on Wednesday night, but also the spirit and atmosphere of 2018 itself.  The sexual abuse survivors who spoke out against USA gymnastics and Michigan State coach Larry Nassar winning the Arthur Ashe Courage Awards created the most emotionally charged moment of the night. But there were many more tearjerkers throughout the three-hour show, including the heroes of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school shooting ‚Äî Aaron Feis, Scott Beigel and Chris Hixon ‚Äî being posthumously named Best Coach.  While millions of viewers watched the 2018 ESPYS live on ABC, TheWrap was inside the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles.  Also Read: Danica Patrick's ESPYs Monologue Called 'Awkward, 'Cringey' (Video)  Here‚Äôs what you didn‚Äôt see on TV.  Sexual abuse survivors make a lasting impact  The Arthur Ashe Courage Award is usually presented in the middle of the show but ESPN producers wisely moved it to the end of the night, knowing the importance of the 150 sexual abuse survivors taking to the stage together. The ‚Äúsister survivors‚Äù of Nassar‚Äôs abuse over the past 30 years got the entire auditorium on their feet cheering them on. ‚ÄúThe greatest tragedy of this is that it could have been avoided ‚Ä¶ all we needed was just one adult to stand between us and Larry Nassar,‚Äù Aly Raisman said in what would be the most impactful words of the night. All of the survivors stayed on the stage long after the end of the show, sharing their historic moment.  Cleveland fans aren‚Äôt laughing  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that the ESPYS have never had a host like me before,‚Äù Danica Patrick said to open the show as the first female host. Danica‚Äôs jab at Cleveland soon sparked a groan from much of the audience ‚Äî we guess there are some Browns and Cavaliers fans in the house after all. At least Odell Beckham Jr. found her joke about his hair being ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù funny.  Few Fergie fans either ‚Ä¶  The ‚Äúreal national anthem controversy‚Äù this year wasn‚Äôt about NFL players kneeling, Patrick said, as a picture of Fergie butchering the anthem at the NBA All-Star game appeared on the big screen. Oops.  Alex Ovechkin or Putin?  There weren‚Äôt many Trump supporters in the crowd, however. The night‚Äôs first political joke from Patrick ‚Äì ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen a Russian this pleased with Washington since ‚Ä¶ at least two days ago‚Äù ‚Äì was tied to the Stanley Cup Finals but we all know who it was really about. And it sparked the first big cheer of the evening.

When Patrick said James was the biggest off- season acquisition the crowd went wild ‚Ä¶ but there was deadly silence when she made fun of his thinning hair.  OBJ‚Äôs calf flash  OBJ was co-presenter for Biggest Breakout Athlete but it was his legs that had the real breakout moment in a very dashing pair of designer shorts. (The actual recipient was Donovan Mitchell, who joins the realm of past winners like Tom Brady, LeBron James and Dak Prescott.) Antonio Brown later showed off his legs in shorts too, these ESPYS veterans clearly know how hot it gets on the red carpet.  Quiz time  The game played in the first commercial break to entertain attendees picked on random members of the audience. First up was none other than ‚ÄúBlack Panther‚Äù star Chadwick Boseman, who thankfully knew the name of the biggest NBA scorer in league history. Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson got thrown some movie trivia next but luckily he knew that Boseman starred in ‚ÄúDraft Day.‚Äù  Hug it out  The 27-strong US Women‚Äôs Hockey team took some time to gather on stage after they won for Best Game because ‚Äúwe‚Äôre a hugging team,‚Äù admitted one of the Olympic gold medal-winning players.  National karaoke champions?  The Notre Dame women‚Äôs basketball champions proved that they‚Äôre not only good at scoring, they‚Äôre also pretty good at karaoke. It was a little of a bumpy start when two of the players took to the stage to show off their singing skills, but like all the best teams, they had a miraculous comeback. In the next ad break however, the warmup host mistakenly said they were from Villanova.  LeBron dominates the red carpet without even being there  In case you‚Äôve been living under a rock, LeBron James has signed with the LA Lakers. While the former NBA champion wasn‚Äôt actually at the ESPYS, that didn‚Äôt stop every athlete on the red carpet from being asked what they thought about him coming to Los Angeles.  King James was also on the mind of one audience member who called out his name when any category was announced. No. 23 for Best College Athlete? No, we don‚Äôt think so. Biggest Breakthrough? Not this year.  Also Read: Tom Brady, LeBron James Lead 2018 ESPYS Nominations  Top names miss TV spots  Though they‚Äôre arguably the best athletes in the world, Tom Brady, LeBron James and Roger Federer won categories that weren‚Äôt deemed important enough to be featured on TV ‚Äî possibly because they weren‚Äôt able to attend the show ‚Äî and their victories were announced during a TV time out.  Eagles fans at it again  Philadelphia Eagles fans are known for being crazy and outspoken (to politely put it), and one middle-aged fanatic in a tuxedo proved that by screaming ‚ÄúPHILADELPHIA‚Äù when QB Nick Foles won the Championship Award for his Super Bowl LII win ‚Ä¶ but it was his young son who looked really embarrassed by the outburst.  Jon Stewart fires up the audience  Jon Stewart complained about the audience‚Äôs lack of response when presenting the Pat Tillman Award for Service to Jake Wood. ‚ÄúOne cheer for the Marines? Really?‚Äù which woke the crowd up to the impact of what former college football player Wood has done in countries like Haiti and for the relief effort in the wake of Hurricane Harvey with Team Rubicon, a non-profit where military veterans lead humanitarian missions to disaster areas.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs also super tall and annoyingly handsome. Last night I saw him making his pregnant wife a hot coffee. I really don‚Äôt like this guy,‚Äù Stewart said bitterly.  The former ‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äù host‚Äôs kick up the ass of the crowd ‚Äî plus a very moving video of Team Rubicon‚Äôs work ‚Äî earned Wood the first standing ovation of the night. And yes, he really did make Stewart look short.

Many athletes including NFL defensive end Calais Campbell wore Jimmy V pins on the red carpet in their support of cancer research. Former Buffalo Bills QB Jim Kelly was later honored with the 2018 Jimmy V Award for Perseverance ‚Äì and his heartbreaking story of fighting adversity and ‚Äúnever giving up‚Äù brought many in the audience to tears. Kelly, whose cancer of the jaw returned this year, delivered another historical speech despite his struggling to speak and needing help to the stage from his two daughters. ESPN host Cari Champion went on to announce that $1.8 million has been raised in the past two days that will go directly to the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund."

"The feud continues between Miley and Selena! Despite the ‚ÄòSlow Down‚Äô singer‚Äôs attempt to play nice, the former Disney darlings are still at war, a new report claims. Find out how Miley reacted to Selena‚Äôs plea that they make up.  Selena Gomez, 22, hoped the 2015 Vanity Fair Oscar Party would be a chance for reconciliation with her old BFF Miley Cyrus, 22 ‚Äî but the ‚ÄúWrecking Ball‚Äù singer was far from willing to kiss and makeup. Get the scoop on Miley‚Äôs public rejection!  Selena Gomez, Miley Cyrus Fight: Miley Rejects Plea To End Feud  At the celeb-filled post-Academy Awards party, Selena hoped she would be able to smooth things over with Miley, who she had a falling out with after staring a relationship with Nick Jonas, 22, Miley‚Äôs ex, in 2008. The feud worsened when Miley pulled a similar stunt, hooking up with Selena‚Äôs ex, Justin Bieber (and getting pregnant!) while the then-couple was on a break, Life & Style reports.  But, while the 22-year-old was willing to leave the boy drama in the past, Miley wasn‚Äôt on-board.  ‚ÄúShe approached Miley at the party with a smile on her face to say hello,‚Äù a source tells the mag of the VF bash. ‚ÄúBut Miley kept the convo short, and then left right after.

"A Few Questions We‚Äôre Asking About Robert Pattinson‚Äôs New Wife by Jess Commons | 12 09 2014 Bad news Twihards ‚Äì Edward Cullen is off the market  Meet Laura Adkins, the 25-year-old who‚Äôs gone and done what every teenager on the face of this planet has wanted to do for ages ‚Äì marry Robert Pattinson.  Except she hasn‚Äôt.  See, what Laura‚Äôs REALLY gone and done is marry a cardboard cutout of Edward Cullen. But differentiating between the two things is just splitting hairs, right?  Laura told the Sunday People, ‚ÄòPeople think I‚Äôm crazy, but my flat-pack R-Patz is the closest I‚Äôll get to the real thing and he‚Äôs the one for me.‚Äô    Lauren paid $20 for her 2-D husband whom she married in a Las Vegas chapel back in January in front of 50 guests. ‚ÄòThe day cost ¬£2,000 but I didn‚Äôt care ‚Äì I wanted to do it properly.‚Äô  Just like any newlyweds, the two headed off on a honeymoon afterwards. The couple chose Los Angeles as a destination where Laura was keen to climb up to the Hollywood sign. ‚ÄòI had to carry him, and we had to do it at night because he can‚Äôt be in the sun, but everyone makes sacrifices for the man they love, right?‚Äô Right.  While we‚Äôre totally on board with doing whatever makes you happy ‚Äì even if that something is marrying a cardboard version of a fictional character ‚Äì there‚Äôs a few questions that this story‚Äôs left us asking.    For instance:  Going out  According to Laura, she regularly takes Edward out to bars where she orders him a beer, and her a gin and tonic. Which is cool and all, but what happens to the beer? Is Laura forced to drink it herself, therefore getting doubly drunk? Or does she pour it down a little hole she‚Äôs made in Edward‚Äôs mouth, drying his soggy lips off under the handdryer afterwards?  READ MORE: How True Blood Started A Sexual Revolution In Television  Sustainability  Being the proud owners of a Henry VIII cutout (not even joking), myself and my housemates are basically experts in the lifecycle of such a product, and let me tell you right now, cardboard is not the most substantial of materials. Damp, open flames and general roughhousing have not been kind to Henry and he‚Äôs not even a cutout that‚Äôs allowed outside. Laura takes Edward on real-life holidays ‚Äì how much more of a shelf-life can her husband have? Does Laura replace him every three months? Has she covered him in some form of protective laminate material?  Identity  While the cutout is of Robert Pattison playing Edward Cullen in one of the Twilight films (sorry I don‚Äôt know which one. I got halfway into the whole werewolf/vampire bro-off and couldn‚Äôt handle the angst), Laura refers to it (him?) as ‚ÄòR-Patz‚Äô therefore prompting the question; is she in love with Robert or Edward? Or an amalgamation of the two? Are they even different people? Or is Robert Pattinson actually a vampire? Might explain some things.  Er, bonking  Sorry to take this to the lowest common denominator but have the two ever consummated their marriage? Is this something that can happen with a cardboard cutout? And if so, how? Is it any good?  READ MORE: Meet The Girls Eating 4,000 Calories A Day Because It Turns Their Boyfriends On  Husbandly duties  While cardboard isn‚Äôt heavy, six feet of it is awkward to carry around. Will Laura ever get annoyed with her husband's lack of mobility? Is there some sort of system she can rig up with a skateboard ‚Äì like those dogs that lose their back legs ‚Äì that means she doesn‚Äôt have to carry him everywhere? More importantly, without the ability to speak, walk or think, he‚Äôs kind of useless as a husband. How‚Äôs he going to bring home the bacon? Provide kids? Fix the Netflix when the SCART lead comes unplugged?  Going forward  Perhaps our biggest question about this whole story is: doesn‚Äôt Laura deserve better? She seems like a nice girl. She‚Äôs certainly inventive, media savvy and has no qualms about going out and getting exactly what she wants. So what‚Äôs she doing with someone (thing?) that can‚Äôt tell her how great she is every day? Our advice to Laura?

"As this star's freedom was revoked, in the back of a packed courtroom sat four very happy people.  In contrast to Dance Mom's Abby Lee Millers tears over her jail sentence, four former reality television moms were laughing it up, the star told InTouch.  A group of the 50-year-old former students' mothers - Kelly Hyland, Christi Lukasiak, Dawn Check and Diane Pent - sat in the back of the Pittsburgh courtroom May 9 as the instructor was sentence to a year and a day in jail.  Laughing stock: Abby Lee Miller (pictured May 14) has revealed her former co-stars laughed at her sentencing  Celebrated: A group of the 50-year-old former students' mothers - L-R Diane Pent, Christi Lukasiak, Dawn Check and Kelly Hyland - sat in the back of the Pittsburgh courtroom May 9 as the instructor was sentence to a year and a day in jail  And Abby Lee was all too aware that the four women had come to watch the show that was her bankruptcy fraud case.

Not nice: The reality star told InTouch she was hurt, 'They were all laughing at me'  But they were not just laughing, post-court the four moms headed to a home and toasted Abby Lee's sentence with a bottle of pricey Dom Perignon champagne.  All four women shared the snap on their Instagrams which showed them all beaming from ear-to-ear.  Diane captioned the image: 'Great day with great friends! @kellylhyland @christilukasiak @dawncheck cheers!'  Dawn - a minister who Abby once called the police on - followed suit saying 'friends' on one picture and then 'silliness. Because' on a different angle.  But Kelly Hyland was not as subtle, captioning the photograph: 'Who is the happiest ???'  There is no love lost between Kelly and Abby with the pair once getting in a physical fight on-camera which Kelly was arrested for.  The Dance Mom and her daughter also went on to sue Abby and the show's production company but eventually settled.

"Last April, Selena Gomez was photographed while on vacation in Mexico. She was wearing a swimsuit, which is normal vacation behavior. But Selena isn't any ordinary human, and internet trolls pounced on the chance to tear Selena apart for looking ""fat"" in paparazzi photos.  She handled the body-shaming by posting a personal bathing suit shot to Instagram, which she captioned, ""I love being happy with me yall,"" along with the hashtag #TheresMoreToLove.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  But that was last year and this is now. And while she's always looked stunning, at the start of her worldwide solo tour, Selena has visibly less to love.  Getty  Getty  Her changed body is the result of over a year working with trainer Amy Rosoff Davis, who has not only been looking after the singer's fitness but also her diet and lifestyle.  Since starting last spring, Selena has worked out with Amy anywhere from three to five days a week, and in the last couple months before the start of the ""Revival"" tour, they were working out seven days a week for up to two hours at a time ‚Äî on top of which Selena was doing back-to-back run-throughs of her 90-minute show during rehearsal. While on tour with Selena in Sacramento, California, Amy spoke to Cosmopolitan.com about what Selena did to get the body she has now.  Getty  Getty | Krystalina Tom  1. No weighing. ""I've never weighed her,"" Amy said. ""I don't believe in scales ‚Äî I just don't think it's healthy."" But, because she and Selena work so closely together, she can tell when Selena's body changes or when her clothes fit differently, which they have been. ""I can definitely see the difference, and other people can too,"" she said. ""But ultimately, a body that eats well and works is going to look better because it's healthy.""  Getty  2. No dieting. There's nothing that's off-limits when it comes to food ‚Äî although that doesn't mean Amy won't encourage better choices ‚Äî there's just less of it. ""I want to live my life like a French person,"" Amy said. ""I don't believe in denying yourself, but I also believe in moderation. Life is too short not to enjoy food.""  These days are always the best days. A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Jun 29, 2015 at 10:36am PDT  3. Switch from fast food to whole food. About that: Selena speaks with pride about eating like she's from Texas. ""She loves Tex-Mex and fast food that I would normally not condone,"" Amy said. ""I will walk onto the tour bus and smell fast food, throw it in the trash, and hand her a carrot and hummus."" Changing Selena's eating habits has helped a lot in shaping her physique, Amy said. ""She responds really quickly. We'll do barely any ab exercises and two days later, I'm like, 'Whoa!'""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Amy has been incorporating more whole foods and healthy organic ingredients into Selena's meals. Here's a breakdown of what Selena might eat in a day:  Breakfast: Half of a healthy breakfast burrito of scrambled eggs, chorizo, avocado, rice, and beans; or, full-fat Greek yogurt and granola.  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Lunch: A ""power salad"" of turkey, avocado, beans, with a homemade dressing of red wine vinegar, olive oil, dijon mustard, and lemon juice.  Dinner: Teriyaki bowl with Asian-marinated cucumber, salmon or chicken, avocado, and teriyaki sauce over rice; or sushi.  Amy Rosoff Davis  Selena also has a juicer in her dressing room so she can have a juice before she goes on stage. Amy's been making her juices with cucumber, carrot, kale, and ginger. Not that Selena is necessarily into it, but it's what she's doing right now.  4. Never let your body get bored. Selena has been doing cardio, Pilates, and yoga of all kinds.  She and Amy go on long hikes with some of Selena's crew, where they'll break to do circuit training and ""arm dancing"" and ""side chass√©s up a hill."" Amy said, ""I've always believed the best way to keep your muscles active is to mix it up. We switch things up almost every day.""  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  5. Stretch. A lot. Amy stresses the importance of having a limber body and says that becoming more flexible has helped Selena ""let go."" Sometimes, Selena will even do a combined stretching and vocal warmup session.  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  Courtesy of Amy Rosoff Davis  6. Water, water, water. ""I'm a big water pusher,"" Amy said. ""All the time. I'm always putting a bottle of water in someone's hand."" It's clearly worked. Selena toldVogue that ""I always have water, tons of water. It's even in my bathroom because I used to be so bad at drinking water and I want to stay hydrated.""  Getty  7. Sweat it out. Amy introduced Selena to Shape House, an ""urban sweat lodge"" where clients lie for 55 minutes in an ""infrared burrito"" and leave with skin that is ""literally glowing,"" Amy said. According to Shape House's website, one ""typical sweat session burns between 800 to 1,600 calories."" Selena loves the process of infrared sweating so much that she has a sweat bag for the road.  8. Have a healthy body image. ""When you feel good, you exude confidence, and you feel strong and healthy,"" Amy said. ""You wear it well inside and outside of your skin.""  comin soon @stevenkleinstudio hehe A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Dec 16, 2015 at 8:43pm PST  9. Nourish the body and soul. While they were in Northern California, Amy researched good spots to hike, and it's a practice she hopes to continue throughout the whole tour. ""We want to find beautiful things in each town that makes it what it is,"" she said. ""You're in a hotel, or you're on a bus or in a show for so much of the time that it's nice to get out in nature where there's no technology and no people."" After the two-hour hike outside Sacramento, they stopped at a waterfall and stood there for a few minutes to breathe and watch the water. ""It was such a perfect combination of mind, body, and soul,"" Amy said. ""Health, fitness, food ‚Äî all of it is so important. What we put in our mouths and our souls affects everything.""

"CBS  Tom Cruise is no stranger to dangerous stunts, but the same can't be said for ""The Late Late Show"" host James Corden. For his latest stunt, Cruise brought Corden along with him: skydiving at 15,000 feet for a ""Late Late Show"" segment on Thursday.  It was almost an impossible mission, though. Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel.  Before they got in the air, Corden was his usual comedic self, asking Cruise if there was ""meal service"" on the plane and coming up with a hand signal for if he soiled himself. When Corden met the professional that he'd be diving with, Danny, who was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, he said, ""We're not skydiving into Margaritaville, I want someone who looks like they know what they're doing.""  But Danny had dived 7,000 times already, which promptly reassured Corden.  Cruise, meanwhile, took it all in stride. The actor skydived for a scene in ""Mission: Impossible ‚Äî Fallout,"" and he jumped out of a plane 106 times at 30,000 feet for the shot. He even slept on the plane as it ascended while Corden sat nervously waiting.  Before they dived, Corden called his wife, and Cruise said he would take care of her if Corden dies. She joked that it would be a ""better life.""  She's stuck with Corden, though, as they finally jumped and reached the ground.  ""Mission: Impossible ‚Äî Fallout"" is in theaters now.

It‚Äôs what makes Saturday Night Live‚Äôs recent exploration of harassment ‚Äî a visually soft, musical number from Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Leslie Jones, and Melissa Villase√±or, with guest Saoirse Ronan ‚Äî feel like a warm shower after a roll through the mud.  Over the weekend, SNL debuted a catchy pop culture parody tackling the unending wave of sexual harassment allegations. This movement seems to have started with Harvey Weinstein, but the ripple has traveled far beyond Hollywood, and into industries and locations across the world. As the song title aptly puts it, ‚ÄúWelcome to Hell.‚Äù  Musical comedy is nothing new for SNL, and the show has touched on feminist issues in group parodies before. But the biting juxtaposition of bubblegum pop and sexual harassment feels more like an outtake from the CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which regularly uses musical comedy to deconstruct thorny subjects like mental health and sexism. ‚ÄúWelcome to Hell‚Äù is a dead ringer for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äôs man-hating anthem ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Generalize About Men,‚Äù where series co-creator Rachel Bloom and company examine the pitfalls of the male population ‚Äî and mock the way women talk about them.  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend built its reputation on this sort of egalitarian satire, where its frustrated female characters declare that all men are emotionally stunted children while simultaneously acknowledging that this is absurd hyperbole. (‚ÄúThere are no exceptions / All 3 billion men are like this / All 3.6 billion men.‚Äù) It plays on stereotypes from both sides: the women engaging in their proclaimed ‚Äúprimal ritual‚Äù of drinking and complaining, the men putting up a tiresome cry of ‚Äúnot all men.‚Äù The SNL song, on the other hand, represents a more literal case of ideologies clashing. Its staff can write and perform songs about harassment, but the show has also invited notorious abusers like Casey Affleck to host. (Louis CK has hosted the show four times.)  ‚ÄúWelcome to Hell‚Äù is parody, but only in how it chooses to deliver its information. Dressed in pink or pastel and sporting sweetheart looks, these performers do their best bubblegum pop impression while addressing a harsh reality: harassment has always been part of women‚Äôs lives. ‚ÄúOh, this been the damn world,‚Äù Strong sings of the recent headlines. Jones pops in to say, ‚ÄúBut you do know that it‚Äôs like a million times worse for a woman of color, right?‚Äù The short even demonstrates some self-defense tactics women are taught: McKinnon holding her keys between her fingers to thwart would-be attackers, or Strong demonstrating acting so crazy, would-be molesters will decide she‚Äôs ‚Äúnot worth the trouble.‚Äù  The grief people may feel over House of Cards being ‚Äúruined‚Äù after Kevin Spacey was fired, or whatever surprise they may experience at learning how widespread harassment is, pales in comparison to the frustration that acts as the song‚Äôs throughline. Why didn‚Äôt women say something? ‚ÄúWell, we definitely did,‚Äù Ronan says. ‚ÄúFor hundreds of years.‚Äù It‚Äôs the understatement of the century."
"This time last week they were enjoying a romantic vacation in St Barts to celebrate Scott Disick's birthday, complete with 'love you' declarations on social media.  But just days after jetting home, Sofia Richie has dumped her older boyfriend.  And now the reason for the young model's change of heart has become clear - an ultimatum from her father, Lionel Richie.  Revealed: Sofia Richie's dad Lionel threatened to cut her off and remove her from will if she didn‚Äôt dump cheating Scott Disick; she is seen solo in Los Angeles on Sunday  Ultimatum: Telling Sofia he would cut her out of his will if she continued to date 'toxic' Scott, Lionel left the 19-year-old with no choice; the father and daughter are seen earlier this year  The veteran singer reportedly gave Sofia a simple choice, after she confided in him that father-of-three Scott had cheated on her.  Telling his daughter he would cut her out of his will if she continued to date 'toxic' Scott, Lionel left the 19-year-old in no doubt about his views.  A source told Us Weekly: '[Scott] cheated on her in Miami and she found out and told [Lionel]. He said he is going to cut her off and write her out of his will if she continues her relationship with Scott as he thinks he‚Äôs extremely toxic for her.'  While initially Sofia had considered trying to work things out, despite her boyfriend's alleged infidelity, things changed when he went to Wyoming for Kanye West's album listening party.  Birthday wishes: Last week the two were in St Barts, with Sofia posting this picture to celebrate Scott Disick's 35th birthday  Final straw: While initially Sofia had considered trying to work things out, despite her boyfriend's alleged infidelity, things changed when he went to Wyoming for Kanye West's album listening party on Thursday  He was pictured there with his arms around a blonde woman, and overheard telling people he was single'.  Within hours Sofia, 19, had moved out of 35-year-old Scott's Los Angeles home, and was back living with her dad.  On Instagram she kept busy posting pictures from her dad's house as she watched Jersey Shore on TV and snuggled her dog Hershela, the name chosen by Scott.  All Night Long singer Lionel had previously joked about his daughter's on/off relationship with the much older man, saying the pairing was 'just a phase'.  Scott is a father-of-three from his nine-year relationship with ex Kourtney Kardashian, named Mason, eight, Penelope, five, and Reign, three."

"Alanis Morrissette‚Äòs ex-manager was sentenced to six years in prisonon Wednesday for embezzling millions from the singer.  Johnathan Schwartz pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud and filing a false tax return in January, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  He admitted to stealing over $5 million from Morissette, as well as an additional $1.7 million from two other unnamed clients.  According to the Associated Press at the time, the incidents occurred between May 2010 and January 2014, with Schwartz falsely listing the criminal withdrawals as ‚Äúsundry/personal expenses.‚Äù When first questioned about the mismanagement by prosecutors, he initially claimed that he had invested in an illicit marijuana growing business.  Schwartz will serve six years in prison along with $8.65 million in restitution, Variety reports. He will report for his prison sentence on July 11.  The 47-year-old wept and apologized during the court hearing Wednesday, saying he took full responsibility for his behavior, according to The Chicago Tribune.  ‚ÄúI alone am responsible for the devastation,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúI will spend the rest of my life asking for forgiveness.‚Äù  FROM COINAGE: What Is the Grammy Bounce? (No, It‚Äôs Not a Dance Move)  The Tribune reports Schwartz could have faced more than 20 years in federal prison after pleading guilty, but Judge Dolly Gee suggested a sentencing guideline around five to six years.  Morissette urged a harsher sentence in a victim statement at the hearing, the newspaper reports, saying he had stolen her trust and money.  ‚ÄúHe did this in a long, systematic, drawn-out and sinister manner,‚Äù she said."
"It‚Äôs only week 3, but the drama has already begun on Dancing with the Stars.  After Tom Bergeron opened guilty pleasures night by dedicating the show to those affected by the Las Vegas shooting, cohost Erin Andrews informed the audience that pro dancer Maks Chmerkovskiy wouldn‚Äôt be taking the stage Monday.  ‚ÄúMaks is dealing with a personal issue so Alan is stepping in and dancing with Vanessa tonight,‚Äù she said, referring to pro Alan Bersten, who got eliminated last week with partner Debbie Gibson.  Craig Sjodin via Getty  However, sources confirm to PEOPLE that Chmerkovskiy did not perform by choice because of ongoing conflict with Lachey.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big chemistry issue,‚Äù the insider says. ‚ÄúThey both have big personalities and that‚Äôs not always the best recipe for a good partnership.‚Äù  PEOPLE‚Äôs special issue 25 Seasons of ‚ÄòDancing with the Stars‚Äô is on stands now.  While the former Total Request Live host, 36, has called the Ukrainian dancer the ‚Äúbest coach,‚Äù the source adds, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been fighting a lot.‚Äù (Reps for Chmerkovskiy and Lachey could not immediately be reached for comment.)  This isn‚Äôt the first time Chmerkovskiy, 37, has butted heads with his DWTS celebrity counterparts. In 2015, he told The Real of his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future.‚Äù  On the other hand, Chmerkovskiy and Olympic skater Meryl Davis, who won season 18, brought out the best in each other.  ‚ÄúI feel that I can really be myself with Maks,‚Äù she told PEOPLE in 2014. ‚ÄúHe pushes me to stand up for myself, whether it‚Äôs in real life or on the dance floor. It‚Äôs cool.‚Äù  He added at the time, ‚ÄúShe lets me be creative. I‚Äôve already done more on this season than I‚Äôve done on Dancing with the Stars in 13 seasons.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Peta Murgatroyd and Maksim Chmerkovskiy Welcome Son Shai Aleksander  Andrews, now 39, has also raved about her experience working with the new dad on season 10. ‚Äú‚ÄúThe reason why Maks and I worked out so well was because I come from a world where all I worked with was men, and pretty much I‚Äôm like a guy in a lot of ways,‚Äù the ESPN personality told PEOPLE in 2015.  When it comes to Lachey, though, the insider says last week could‚Äôve been her last performance with Chmerkovskiy: ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Maks doesn‚Äôt return as her partner for the rest of the season.‚Äù  However, a DWTS rep says Chmerkovskiy will compete next week.  Dancing with the Stars airs Mondays on ABC at 8 p.m. ET."
"Poor Katie Holmes! That is, if you believe a series of reports swirling around the former ‚ÄúDawson‚Äôs Creek‚Äù actress and her relationships with boyfriend Jamie Foxx, ex-husband Tom Cruise and daughter Suri.  According to a report in RadarOnline, Holmes and Foxx were on the verge of marrying in a lavish $300,000 ceremony, with 12-year-old Suri as her bridesmaid. This supposed wedding would finally make their relationship permanent and open after five years of mostly covert dating.  But then the 39-year-old actress and single mom realized her 50-year-old, Oscar-winning boyfriend wasn‚Äôt ready to give up his flirtatious bachelor ways, including his friendly relationship with Kristin Grannis, his ex-girlfriend and mother to his 8-year-old daughter, RadarOnline reported. Indeed, Foxx took Grannis, not Holmes, with him to Leonardo DiCaprio‚Äôs birthday party in November, the site alleges.  So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her ‚ÄúDjango Unchained‚Äù boyfriend they needed to break up.  ‚ÄúJamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,‚Äù a source told RadarOnline. ‚ÄúKatie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie‚Äôs behavior. She knew it wasn‚Äôt healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.‚Äù  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri‚Äôs life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn‚Äôt see her.  ‚ÄúTom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn‚Äôt see Suri, he didn‚Äôt question it,‚Äù an insider told the Star. ‚ÄúBut Tom‚Äôs tired of being bossed around by them. He‚Äôs had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he‚Äôs missed out on so much. He‚Äôs dying to be a part of her life!‚Äù  Holmes isn‚Äôt a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to ‚Äúbrainwash‚Äù her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what‚Äôs best for Suri.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,‚Äù an insider told the Star. ‚ÄúSuri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what‚Äôs best for her. Tom has assured her he won‚Äôt bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.‚Äù  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes‚Äô publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  ‚ÄúThe Radar story is 100 percent untrue,‚Äù Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes‚Äô publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis‚Äôs Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx‚Äôs 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes‚Äô romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes‚Äô life is that she‚Äôs been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter‚Äôs philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  ‚ÄúMy little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,‚Äù Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram."
"In Tbilisi, the two-room rented apartment Mr. Latsabidze shares with his younger brother is an unlikely offshore outpost of America‚Äôs fake news industry. The two brothers, both computer experts, get help from a third young Georgian, an architect.They say they have no keen interest in politics themselves and initially placed bets across the American political spectrum and experimented with show business news, too. They set up a pro-Clinton website, walkwithher.com, a Facebook page cheering Bernie Sanders and a web digest of straightforward political news plagiarized from The New York Times and other mainstream news media.But those sites, among the more than a dozen registered by Mr. Latsabidze, were busts. Then he shifted all his energy to Mr. Trump. His flagship pro-Trump website, departed.co, gained remarkable traction in a crowded field in the prelude to the Nov. 8 election thanks to steady menu of relentlessly pro-Trump and anti-Clinton stories. (On Wednesday, a few hours after The New York Times met with Mr. Latsabidze to ask him about his activities, the site vanished along with his Facebook page.)‚ÄúMy audience likes Trump,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to write bad things about Trump. If I write fake stories about Trump, I lose my audience.‚ÄùSome of his Trump stories are true, some are highly slanted and others are totally false, like one this summer reporting that ‚Äúthe Mexican government announced they will close their borders to Americans in the event that Donald Trump is elected President of the United States.‚Äù Data compiled by Buzzfeed showed that the story was the third most-trafficked fake story on Facebook from May to July.So successful was the formula that others in Georgia and other faraway lands joined in, too, including Nika Kurdadze, a college acquaintance of Mr. Latsabidze‚Äôs who set up his own pro-Trump site, newsbreakshere.com. Its recent offerings included a fake report headlined: ‚ÄúStop it Liberals‚Ä¶Hillary Lost the Popular Vote by Several Million. Here‚Äôs Why.‚Äù That story, like most of Mr. Latsabidze‚Äôs work, was pilfered from the web.Mr. Latsabidze initially ran into no problems from all his cutting and pasting of other people‚Äôs stories, and he even got ripped off himself when a rival in India hijacked a pro-Trump Facebook page he had set up to drive traffic to his websites. (He said that the Indian rival had offered $10,000 to buy the page, but that he had reneged on payment after being provided with access rights and commandeered it for himself.)"
"Eliza Dushku has accused stunt coordinator Joel Kramer of molesting her when she was 12 years old. Kramer has denied the allegations.  Her account, posted early Saturday morning, comes in the wake of the continuing #metoo movement and the launch of the Time‚Äôs Up campaign to combat sexual harassment and assault.  In a Facebook post, Dushku wrote that she was assaulted while working with Kramer on the 1994 James Cameron film ‚ÄúTrue Lies.‚Äù According to her post, Kramer molested her in a Miami hotel room, where he ‚Äúlaid me down on the bed, wrapped me with his gigantic writhing body, and rubbed all over me.‚Äù Kramer would have been 36 at the time.  Dushku alleges that he ‚Äúmethodically built my and my parents‚Äô trust, for months grooming me,‚Äù and told her parent that he would take her for a swim in the hotel‚Äôs pool. Instead, her took her to his hotel room, where he ‚Äúdisappeared in the bathroom and emerged, naked, bearing nothing but a small hand towel held flimsy at his mid-section.‚Äù  Kramer told Variety Saturday morning that Dushku‚Äôs allegations were ‚Äúabsolutely not true.‚Äù According to Kramer, Dushku swam in the hotel pool with him and other members of the stunt crew, including Dushku‚Äôs stunt double. Afterwards, he took her to her first ever sushi meal, and then took her home.  Related Eliza Dushku Slams CBS, Michael Weatherly for Alleged Harassment and Retaliation on 'Bull' 'OITNB' Actress Yael Stone Accuses Geoffrey Rush of Sexual Harassment  After the alleged assault, Dushku wrote, he suggested they should ‚Äúbe careful,‚Äù referring to talking about the incident.  Dushku also wrote that while in a taxi back to her hotel, Kramer held her on his lap in the backseat. According to Kramer, he drove the car to take her home.  She also implies that Kramer may have intentionally harmed her while on the set of ‚ÄúTrue Lies,‚Äù referring to it as ‚Äúno small coincidence‚Äù when she was injured on-set after a ‚Äútough adult female friend‚Äù faced him about the alleged assault.  ‚ÄúWith broken ribs, I spent the evening in the hospital,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúTo be clear, over the course of those months rehearsing and filming ‚ÄòTrue Lies,‚Äô it was Joel Kramer who was responsible for my safety on a film that at the time broke new ground for action films.‚Äù  She also wrote that Kramer would call her ‚ÄúJailbait,‚Äù and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why no adults on the set grew suspicious of the ‚Äúover-the-top special attention he gave me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúOver the years I‚Äôve really struggled as I‚Äôve wondered how my life might have been different if someone, any one grown-up who witnessed his sick ways, had spoken up before he lured me to that hotel room.‚Äù  Dushku explained that she had heard, years ago, that Kramer had been ‚Äúfound out‚Äù and forced to leave the business, but recently learned he was still working in the industry.  ‚ÄúAnd a few weeks ago, I found an internet photo of Joel Kramer hugging a young girl,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúThat image has haunted me near nonstop since. I can no longer hide what happened.‚Äù  She expressed gratitude for the support of her fans, and wrote that she hopes her speaking out will help other victims of sexual assault.  Kramer stated that he was ‚Äútaken aback‚Äù and ‚Äúfloored‚Äù by the allegations, and that he ‚Äúnever molested her‚Äù and was ‚Äúnever nude in front of her.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis whole talk of luring her to my room, on top of her, getting off, holding her in the car and calling her jailbait is just outright hyperbole and lies,‚Äù he said.  Kramer, who has worked on numerous high-profile films such as ‚ÄúBlade Runner 2049‚Äù and ‚ÄúFurious 7,‚Äù said he had no explanation for the allegations, but stated that he thought she may have had a crush on him at the time. According to Kramer, another person working on the set had told him that Dushku was ‚Äúalways asking questions‚Äù about him, which caused him to feel he had to ‚Äúhandle her with kid gloves.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI did kiss her on the cheek once to say goodnight to her, gave her a hug,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe treated her like family, she was part of our crew.‚Äù  He referred to the allegations as ‚Äúabsurd,‚Äù asserting that it would have made no sense for him to act in the manner he accused her of. ‚ÄúWho in their right mind would do something like that, when you‚Äôre a high-profile coordinator on a shoot like that with months left of shooting?‚Äù  Dushku‚Äôs legal guardian on the set of ‚ÄúTrue Lies,‚Äù Sue Booth-Forbes, issued a statement supporting Dushku‚Äôs account to Deadline Hollywood.  ‚ÄúEliza Dushku is telling the truth,‚Äù she told the outlet. ‚ÄúI was on the ‚ÄòTrue Lies‚Äô set for three weeks and reported Joel Kramer‚Äôs inappropriate sexual behavior towards 12-year-old Eliza to a person in authority. I was met with blank stares and had the sense that I wasn‚Äôt telling that person anything they didn‚Äôt already know.‚Äù"

"Wow, it seems like no Hollywood relationship is safe from divorce, even after 21 years of marriage.  Actress and singer Tisha Campbell-Martin, 49, has filed for divorce from husband, actor Duane Martin, 52 confirmed by PEOPLE. The couple shares a total of 27 years together, and 21 years of marriage.  ‚ÄúAfter 27 years of being together and two amazing children, it pains me to announce that I‚Äôve filed for divorce,‚Äù Tisha, 49, said in the statement.

While there have been many rumors of husband Duane Martin‚Äôs sexuality and possible infidelity, the couple has never responded and seem to have always pushed forward.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an emotional time and I graciously ask for privacy for me, our children and the rest of our family,‚Äù she shared.  Over the course of their marriage, the pair, who wed in 1996, had two children: sons Ezekiel, 8, and Xen, 16.

"Simila¬≠r to any other woman, she has been throug¬≠h a fair share of good and bad days  Hollywood starlet Angelina Jolie can easily be counted as one of the most beautiful women in the world. Similar to any other woman, she has been through a fair share of good and bad days too. However, nothing has ever shown on her face. And boy, we are impressed! Compiled from InStyle, we dig out her changing looks through the years.  1986  With her full lips and bright blue eyes, the 11-year-old daughter of Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand was clearly destined to be a spectacular beauty.  1991  As a student at Beverly Hills High School, Jolie was an unknown quantity. ‚ÄúI wore black boots with big silver bat [charms] that dragged when I walked,‚Äù Jolie said earlier. ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt aware of how I looked, but apparently I looked really creepy.‚Äù  1998  The pixie-cropped actor won her first Golden Globe for TV biopic George Wallace. The following year she would receive a second statuette for her role in Gia.  1999  She went platinum for Girl, Interrupted, but limited her beauty routine to Carmex and lotion.  2003  The Beyond Borders star, and new mother to adopted son Maddox, lightened up both her locks and makeup for a fresh look.  2007  ‚ÄúHer mouth is so large and beautiful,‚Äù makeup artist Janeen Schreyer has said of the born beauty. ‚ÄúI usually don‚Äôt colour it.‚Äù Hairstylist Ted Gibson shows similar restraint. ‚ÄúShe loves to keep a natural wave in her hair. It‚Äôs more sensual,‚Äù he said.  Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt might be getting back together  2008  Pregnant with twins Knox and Vivienne, the actress glowed in a high-volume style at the Kung Fu Panda premiere.  2013  Jolie attended the world premiere of then fianc√© Brad Pitt‚Äôs movie World War Z just weeks after she revealed she underwent a preventative double mastectomy. She wowed the crowd in a black, floor-length Saint Laurent gown with her caramel locks in a casual curl.  2016  Jolie wore her hair smooth and straight and opted for a pared down beauty look for the Kung Fu Panda 3 Hollywood premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre.  2017  She was back to retro curls and her classic red lip in 2017.  2018    Only blossoming with age, the red pout seems to have become a regular in Jolie‚Äôs makeup routine. The 42-year-old is definitely both beauty and brains.  Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.  Read full story"

"Every breakup has its stages, but, for Chlo√´ Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham ‚Äîthe now former celebrity couple whose on-again, off-again love saga is a film waiting to be written‚Äîit's easy to get stuck in the subtweet phase. Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that's the case. Let's take a look at the facts.  A few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she's listening to Cardi B 's ""Be Careful,"" perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper's recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy . In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fianc√© Offset's infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. ""Poured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,"" she raps, ""Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson..../ Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo/ And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives..../ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'."" Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: ""The queen.""  What's more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption ""Greetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,"" as Perez Hilton later pointed out.  Meanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption ""Chloe's fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.""  Loading View on Instagram  But how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn't officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup , saying that she just wanted to hide. ‚ÄúThey were like, 'That‚Äôs all great that you want to go away‚Äîbut you can‚Äôt. You are your own person,'"" she said. ""'You‚Äôre going to have to deal with this sort of thing.‚Äô I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren‚Äôt in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.‚Äù With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple."
"Jamie Foxx did not ‚Äúbetray‚Äù Katie Holmes by supposedly ‚Äúgetting flirty‚Äù with a mystery blonde at a New York City hotspot, despite a bogus report. Gossip Cop can debunk this narrative. It‚Äôs simply a non-issue.  According to In Touch, just a few days after the actor had dinner with Holmes at Tao in NYC, he got cozy with another woman while having lunch at the trendy seafood restaurant Catch. An alleged insider tells the magazine, ‚ÄúWhen Jamie arrived to the rooftop area with friends, an attractive young blonde went and sat with them. She hugged Jamie and sat next to him.‚Äù  The outlet‚Äôs questionable source further contends that Foxx ‚Äúwould reach over and touch the woman‚Äôs leg or hold her hand‚Äù throughout the lunch. The magazine then baselessly theorizes that Holmes is ‚Äúheaded for heartbreak,‚Äù quoting its supposed insider as saying, ‚ÄúShe needs to watch out. Jamie loves her, but he also loves to flirt.‚Äù  ¬© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  It should be noted, the tabloid doesn‚Äôt have any real proof that Foxx got ‚Äúflirty‚Äù with a mystery blonde at Catch. The outlet provides two photos, one of the actor giving a friendly hug to an unidentified woman, and another of him touching the woman‚Äôs arm during a conversation. That‚Äôs as intimate as the two get in the images and there‚Äôs no evidence to suggest they‚Äôre anything more than friends.  Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúbetrayed‚Äù when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx‚Äôs secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two ‚Äúdon‚Äôt see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don‚Äôt want to be labeled as a couple.‚Äù It was further stressed that neither ‚Äúwant to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.‚Äù  Meanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us ‚Äúhe knows he‚Äôs in a public forum‚Äù when he chats with other women. As we‚Äôve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.  Additionally, this isn‚Äôt the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx ‚Äúbetrayed‚Äù Holmes by ‚Äúgetting cozy‚Äù with a mystery woman at an Oscar party. However, the actor and actress have been spotted together several times since March, so she obviously didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúbetrayed.‚Äù That remains the case."
"A day before Demi Lovato's apparent drug overdose, the star and her ""new"" group of friends were reportedly on a ""binger"" and were prepared for extreme measures by having Narcan, an emergency medication that is used to revive people in instances of narcotic overdoses, on hand.  TMZ reported that Lovato, 25, refused to tell paramedics what drugs may have caused the overdose and was not cooperative with EMTs when they arrived at her home on Tuesday. A source told Fox News that ""it's not heroin."" According to the outlet, no drugs were found at the scene and no charges pressed.  People magazine reported that Lovato and her group of friends were prepared for their night of partying.  ‚ÄúShe and her ‚Äòfriends‚Äô were on a binger the entire night,‚Äù an insider told the outlet. ‚ÄúThey keep Narcan on hand for such situations ‚Äì they were prepared for this. The people she has been hanging around lately aren‚Äôt her real friends ‚Äì they don‚Äôt have her best interests at heart. She‚Äôs pushed her true friends away.‚Äù  The source added, ‚ÄúShe had to find creative and sneaky ways to get drugs because her team and those that really care about her really try to keep a close watch on her.‚Äù  Lovato's long-time band guitarist, Mike Manning, spoke out about the singer's new group of friends saying that he planned to expose all of those who were involved in Monday night's ""binger"" and added, ""I almost lost my sister today.""  ""Anybody who was with Demi last night and actually calls themselves a friend should actually be disgusted with themselves. SICK,"" Manning said according to the Daily Mail.  He added, ""You can never trust anyone. Never can know if your ""friends"" are truly on your side or not.""  According to TMZ, Lovato's longtime team attempted to stage an intervention to get help for the troubled singer but she ""blew them off."" The news follows the departure of Lovato's long-serving manager, Phil McIntyre, who was reportedly a part of the intervention.  Lovato had been preparing for a months-long string of performances set to start Thursday night in Atlantic City, N.J., and take her to venues as far as Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. The singer's Atlantic City concert has since been canceled.  Signs of trouble began in the days leading up to the overdose when a video of the singer forgetting the lyrics to her song ""Sober,"" surfaced online. Lovato wrote the single, released in late June, about relapsing after celebrating six years of sobriety.  Lovato's profound ""Sober"" lyrics read, ‚ÄúMama, I‚Äôm so sorry I‚Äôm not sober anymore/And Daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor. To the ones who never left me/We‚Äôve been down this road before/I‚Äôm so sorry, I‚Äôm not sober anymore.‚Äù  Though Lovato has been vocal about her struggles throughout the years, another insider revealed to People that Lovato‚Äôs period of sobriety was full of ups and downs.  ‚ÄúDemi was never really clean and sober from all of her demons. She has been fighting depression and anxiety for quite some time ‚Äî and is still in such a dark place. She was sober for a while, but not completely sober for six years.‚Äù  The star, who is ""in stable condition"" and with her family at the hospital according to a statement from her rep, has also found support from her ex-boyfriend, former ""That 70's Show"" star Wilmer Valderrama.  Valderrama, who dated Lovato for six years before their break up in June 2016, was reportedly ‚Äúshocked‚Äù after hearing the news that Lovato was hospitalized on Tuesday.  ‚ÄúHe knew she was going through a tough time but he wasn‚Äôt prepared for this,‚Äù a source told People. ‚ÄúHe saw her through so many ups and downs and was her rock through some of her darkest moments. To see her back in such a sad and vulnerable place is heartbreaking for him.‚Äù  The source added that Valderrama, ‚Äúalways cared deeply‚Äù for Lovato and even after they split the two have remained friends.  So much so that Valderrama paid his ex a visit on Wednesday, according to People. The 38-year-old star visited Lovato in the hospital following her apparent overdose yesterday afternoon.  ‚ÄúDemi always hoped they would end up back together in the future,‚Äù a source revealed to the magazine. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the love of her life and vice versa.‚Äù  Lovato remains in the hospital."

"President Donald Trump says he thinks CNN‚Äôs Chris Cuomo looks like a ‚Äúchained lunatic‚Äù on television. CNN‚Äôs Don Lemon is ‚Äúperhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting‚Äù and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a ‚Äúno-talent guy‚Äù who talks ‚Äúfilthy.‚Äù  Those were just some of the comments Trump offered over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I‚Äôve been able not to watch or read things that aren‚Äôt pleasant,‚Äù he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. ‚ÄúAnd it keeps you young.‚Äù  There was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.  ‚ÄúWashington Post, New York Times, they‚Äôre really, really dishonest,‚Äù he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. ‚ÄúYou people are quite dishonest in all fairness.‚Äù He said he used to watch MSNBC‚Äôs Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.  The one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.  Spokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president‚Äôs criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, ‚ÄúHis comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs claims about CNN‚Äôs Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.

But because I don‚Äôt do interviews and stuff and want to ‚Ä¶ He went the other way. Which is fine. He‚Äôs got some problems. But I don‚Äôt watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don‚Äôt watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I‚Äôm watching Fox. But they‚Äôre pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don‚Äôt mean they ‚Äì if I do something wrong. But it‚Äôs really, honestly it‚Äôs the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he‚Äôs sitting there like a chained lunatic. He‚Äôs like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who‚Äôs perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it‚Äôs like ‚Äì sometimes they‚Äôll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they‚Äôll start screaming, we‚Äôre going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I‚Äôve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he‚Äôs sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They‚Äôre all doing well because of me. But it‚Äôs not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It‚Äôs just bad. It‚Äôs an ability I never thought I‚Äôd have. I never thought I‚Äôd have the ability to say, they‚Äôre doing a big story on me on CNN and I won‚Äôt watch it. And it‚Äôs amazing, it doesn‚Äôt matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They‚Äôre really dishonest. I mean they‚Äôre really dishonest.  Trump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert‚Äôs blistering and crude May 1 monologue, in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:  You see a no-talent guy like Colbert. There‚Äôs nothing funny about what he says. And what he says is filthy. And you have kids watching. And it only builds up my base. It only helps me, people like him. The guy was dying. By the way they were going to take him off television, then he started attacking me and he started doing better. But his show was dying.

"[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the Big Brother season finale.]  Big Brother season 19 brought a slew of blindsides, backstabbing and betrayal, and now it's time to see who won it all.  All season Paul Abrahamian was the frontrunner as he ruled the game and played puppet master to a house full of followers. So, did the season 18 runner-up pull out a win his second time around?  The answer is: no.  The finale saw Paul sit in the final three with Christmas Abbott and Josh Martinez. And Josh came out victorious in one of the most ""volatile"" seasons of the show, as host Julie Chen described it.  It was a shock to some that the Miami native walked away this season with a lot more than just meatballs, but one thing that wasn't a shock was how angry the jury felt towards Paul.  In the jury segment that was full of bitter members it was one of the most entertaining moments of the summer with a face-off between fan-favorite Mark and the one deemed as a piece of furniture by fans, Matt.  ""Very poor jury management,"" Mark said about Paul. ""I'm a bitter juror,"" admitted Elena. ""I don't respect how this season played out and I don't respect his strategies,"" said Mark. And when Alex went to cast her vote for who she wanted to win she made it clear that she was voting for who stabbed her in the front rather than the back.  Ultimately the final vote came down to both Paul and Josh's rival Cody, who ultimately voted for Josh to win the game.  As for the winner of ""America's Favorite Houseguest""? Cody just walked away $25,000 richer.  What did you think of the season 19 finale? Sound off in the comments section below."

As part of a special takeover, the 24-year-old singer sang, appeared in skits, and took part in a sit-down interview with Fallon. One of the highlights of the night was a pre-taped segment where fans of the pop diva were treated to a sing-along with Grande herself to her 2014 hit ‚ÄúOne Last Time.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here with the one and only Ariana Grande, and we‚Äôre gonna do something really fun here in the next room,‚Äù Fallon said while standing next to a smiling Grande. ‚ÄúWe have some of Ariana‚Äôs biggest fans, and they‚Äôre gonna do a cover thinking it‚Äôs a fan video.

"Good news, ladies: If you break up with Chris Evans and randomly run into him in public, he won‚Äôt make it awkward.  In the May issue of Elle magazine, the ‚ÄúCaptain America‚Äù actor says he makes it a point to stay on good terms with his exes, and even goes in for a ‚Äúbig hug‚Äù when he runs into them. (We‚Äôve never wanted to be someone‚Äôs ex more in our lives.)  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had no bad breakups in my life,‚Äù said Evans, who‚Äôs dated Kate Bosworth, Jessica Biel, and, most recently, his ‚ÄúGifted‚Äù co-star Jenny Slate.  ‚ÄúTypically, if I see an ex, I give a big hug, and it‚Äôs wonderful to catch up,‚Äù the 35-year-old told the magazine. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre ever fortunate enough to love someone and have them love you back, it‚Äôs worth protecting that. It‚Äôs rare that someone can truly know you. And if you‚Äôve broken through that kind of wall, I think it‚Äôs important to value that.‚Äù  It sure seems like he does. The actor has spoken of Slate in only glowing terms while promoting ‚ÄúGifted‚Äù the last few months. In a March interview with People, Evans called the 35-year-old actress and comedian his ‚Äúfavorite human.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs the best,‚Äù he said, before gushing even more. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never, ever, ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does. She‚Äôll give you one sentence and there‚Äôs no fat to it. You‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòYou just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.‚Äô‚Äù  The pair, who dated for nine months before breaking up in February, shared a laugh earlier this month at the Los Angeles premiere of ‚ÄúGifted:‚Äù  Todd Williamson via Getty Images Such friendly exes.  They looked super cute, too:  Emma McIntyre via Getty Images  Luckily, the ‚Äúno ill feelings here‚Äù approach to the breakup seems to be mutual. In a deeply revealing interview with ‚ÄúVulture‚Äù last month, Slate, who‚Äôs best known for her roles in ‚ÄúParks and Recreation‚Äù and the indie film ‚ÄúObvious Child,‚Äù opened up about what initially drew her to Evans.  ‚ÄúChris is truly one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met, to the point where sometimes I would look at him and it would kind of break my heart,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs really vulnerable, and he‚Äôs really straightforward. He‚Äôs like primary colors. He has beautiful, big, strong emotions, and he‚Äôs really sure of them. It‚Äôs just wonderful to be around. His heart is probably golden-colored, if you could paint it.‚Äù"
"Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney revealed that she told a USA Gymnastics coach and several fellow gymnasts in 2011 that she had been sexually abused by team doctor Larry Nassar. Nothing happened, she said, and the abuse carried on for another five years.  Maroney, who won gold and silver at the 2012 Olympic Games in London as part of the ‚ÄúFierce Five,‚Äù said in an interview with NBC‚Äôs Dateline that she was in a car with coach John Geddert and other gymnasts when she told them, ‚ÄúLast night, it was like Larry was fingering me.‚Äù  Maroney, now 22, said Geddert did not react, while the other gymnasts appeared surprised. One of the gymnasts criticized Maroney for making the statement at the time and later told NBC that the incident did not happen. Dateline reported that three other witnesses corroborated Maroney‚Äôs story.  Geddert was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January after numerous gymnasts accused him of verbal and physical abuse. Geddert has not commented on the allegations.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  Maroney said Nassar abused her the first time she met him, at the Karolyi ranch in Houston, Texas, which was the U.S. national training center. She said the abuse happened every time she saw him after that ‚Äî ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of times. At the world championships in Tokyo in 2011, she said Nassar ‚Äúwent overboard.‚Äù She told NBC that she was naked with Nassar on top of her, and ‚ÄúI thought I was going to die.‚Äù  Four of Maroney‚Äôs ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù teammates have reported that they were abused by Nassar. Maroney was the first to publicly reveal the abuse, in a tweet in October 2017. She said Nassar started to abuse her when she was 13 and continued, even during the 2012 Olympic Games until she left gymnastics in 2016.  Her teammates Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, and Jordyn Wieber have also accused Nassar of sexual abuse. Raisman and Wieber are suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Michigan State University, where Nassar was on the faculty, for failing to protect them from Nassar‚Äôs behavior.  Nassar abused the gymnasts under the pretext of medical care. An osteopath, he told the girls that the procedures would ease whatever pain they were sent to him to relieve, and would help them to continue training.  ‚ÄúHe told me he was going to do a checkup on me and that was the first day I was abused,‚Äù Maroney said during the interview. ‚ÄúHe said that nobody would understand this and the sacrifice that it takes to get to the Olympics, so you can‚Äôt tell people this.‚Äù  Maroney said that Nassar won the favor of the gymnasts by being friendly, bringing them food when they were afraid to eat while under the watchful eye of coaches and national team coordinator Martha Karolyi. ‚ÄúYour coaches are just always watching you. And wanting to keep you skinny,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve starved at the Olympics if I didn‚Äôt have him bring me food.‚Äù  Martha and Bela Karolyi respond to allegations  Martha and Bela Karolyi, the famed Romanian coaches credited with bringing U.S. women‚Äôs gymnastics to world championship and Olympic glory, spoke publicly for the first time since the accusations against Nassar were revealed last fall. They said they were not aware of Nassar‚Äôs abuse, and were saddened to learn of his behavior.  Several gymnasts have said the abuse occurred on the Karolyi ranch, which doubled as the national training center, where elite gymnasts came once a month to live and train. USA Gymnastics cut ties with the Karolyi ranch in January amid the Nassar scandal.  ‚ÄúAny child who is violated by Nassar, it‚Äôs a crime and it‚Äôs so sad,‚Äù Martha said. ‚ÄúIt is very much hurtful,‚Äù Martha said of the abuse allegations. But she said she was not aware of Nassar‚Äôs sexual abuse of the gymnasts. ‚ÄúI heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this,‚Äù said Martha. ‚ÄúAnd the parent couldn‚Äôt see. How I could see?‚Äù  The Karolyis have been named in several lawsuits related to Nassar‚Äôs abuse. Nassar is currently serving 175 years in prison on state charges of criminal sexual activity and federal charges of child pornography.  Contact us at editors@time.com."
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Gina Vivinetto  When ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Ellen Pompeo signed a $20 million deal in late 2017, she became the highest paid actress on a primetime TV drama.  But now 48-year-old Pompeo is quashing rumors that her landmark paycheck caused two of her former co-stars, Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew, to exit the series.  ""It's absolutely not true,"" Pompeo said of the chatter during her Thursday appearance on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""  Both actresses left the long-running ABC medical drama earlier this month, with rumors swirling that Pompeo's salary made ""Grey's"" unable to keep them on.  While Pompeo wasn't certain why Capshaw and Drew are no longer cast members, she guessed it was a creative decision on the show's part.  ""I mean, I‚Äôm not involved in these kind of decisions; however, there‚Äôs a few problems that you encounter doing a show for 14 seasons,"" she explained. ""One of them is the writers have a really hard time creatively thinking up new stories for all these characters. I think we have 16 regular cast members, and I think it‚Äôs always sad when we lose people for whatever reason.""  ""Whether they want to go or don‚Äôt want to go, it doesn‚Äôt make it any easier,"" she added.  ""Grey's Anatomy"" star Ellen Pompeo opened up about rumors that her salary caused other actresses to be fired from the series. Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.  Pompeo, an outspoken advocate for equal pay for women in Hollywood, revealed she was upset by the rumors because they create a catfight-like story where there isn't one.  ""I think that it‚Äôs important for us to not pit women against each other and to really dispel the notion that women are always victims,"" said the star. ""You don‚Äôt have to pit us against each other. We‚Äôre not enemies. We do lift each other up and support each other, and we‚Äôre not victims. We‚Äôre very strong and we‚Äôre capable of many, many things.""  Watch the discussion in the video above."

"Ever since men and women flooded the Golden Globes red carpet two weeks ago with signs of all-black sartorial solidarity and ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs Up‚Äù pins, there has been questions swirling around some of the men claiming to be allies of the movement against sexual misconduct. Actress Scarlett Johansson, giving her second barn-burning speech at a Women‚Äôs March in as many years, called out Globe winner James Franco on Saturday saying: ‚ÄúI want my pin back, by the way.‚Äù  In addition to winning a Golden Globe two weeks ago, Franco, who wore a Time‚Äôs Up pin while claiming his prize, also garnered a lot of attention thanks to some comments on social media during the ceremony including some pointed, since-deleted tweets from actress Ally Sheedy. A few days later, the L.A. Times printed a report of five women accusing Franco of sexual misconduct. Franco denied the allegations. The actor has now been publicly addressed by Johansson, one of the original signers of the Time‚Äôs Up announcement letter and a major donor to the cause.  Though she didn‚Äôt name him directly during her speech in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, a rep for Johansson later confirmed to the L.A. Times that the actress was indeed referring directly to Franco when she said: ‚ÄúHow could a person publicly stand by an organization that helps to provide support for victims of sexual assault while privately preying on people who have no power?‚Äù Pausing for effect, she then asked Franco for her pin back. Her comments start at the 1:25 mark.  Johansson posed further questions on much-debated topics such as abuses of power and what some deem grey areas of consent before saying she felt a ‚Äúrage‚Äù bubbling up inside her on behalf of women who have been abused and also, she admitted, on behalf of herself.  Johansson then related her own personal experience: ‚ÄúSuddenly I was 19 again and I began to remember all the men who had taken advantage of the fact that I was a young woman who didn‚Äôt yet have the tools to say no, or understand the value of my own self-worth,‚Äù said Johansson who appeared in her first film at the age of 10. ‚ÄúI had many relationships both personal and professional where the power dynamic was so off that I had to create a narrative that I was the cool girl who could hang in and hang out, and that sometimes meant compromising what felt right for me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo more pandering,‚Äù Johansson concluded. ‚ÄúNo more feeling guilty about hurting someone‚Äôs feelings when something doesn‚Äôt feel right for me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have made a promise to myself to be responsible to my self, that in order to trust my instincts I must first respect them.‚Äù"

"This Is Us kicked off its second season last year with a bit of a stumble, courtesy of NBC: the network announced at its 2017 upfront that the show would move to Thursdays, only to backtrack two weeks later. But then the drama went on to do something that few recent breakout freshman series have accomplished: it became an even bigger hit in Season 2, where it was the highest-rated entertainment broadcast series in the adults 18-49 demographic last season, with a 5.4 rating.  After avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump, This Is Us returns tonight for Season 3, and NBC‚Äîwhich won‚Äôt have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics or Thursday Night Football to help inflate it this season‚Äîwill be counting on the show to help keep it on top in the 18-49 demo for what would be the third straight season.  Robert Greenblatt, in an interview before he announced yesterday that he was stepping down as NBC Entertainment chairman after seven years, said that This Is Us shows the power of broadcast TV, which is ‚Äúthe only place where you can gather a huge group of people together for a shared experience,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen 12 to 14 million people watch America‚Äôs Got Talent in the summer, or more than that watch This Is Us in the fall or spring, that‚Äôs an extraordinary cultural achievement.‚Äù  While Greenblatt scuttled the show‚Äôs Thursday move last year after realizing the extent to which Thursday Night Football would disrupt the show‚Äôs narrative arc, he didn‚Äôt consider relocating the show to Thursday this season, after the network lost Thursday Night Football to Fox.  ‚ÄúWe felt, by this point, that it‚Äôs a Tuesday staple, for I‚Äôm happy to say a large part of the country. We also got some nice traction on Thursday with Will & Grace, and The Good Place is really coming into its own,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúSo we thought, rather than jumble the cards again, let‚Äôs keep a good thing going on Tuesday and let‚Äôs build more of a good thing on Thursday. We‚Äôre really excited about putting [Law & Order:] SVU on Thursday at 10, which is a great thing for that night also. There‚Äôs a lot to be said for stability on your schedule.‚Äù  As for how the show was able to avoid stumbling in Season 2, ‚Äúwe have extraordinary writers and [creator] Dan Fogelman is just the greatest sort of visionary,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen a creator who‚Äôs as far advanced in plotting a series than he is. He‚Äôs weaving in elements from seasons four, five and six, which haven‚Äôt even been completely conceived yet. But he knows where all these stories are going.‚Äù  Fogelman ‚Äúknew from the beginning of the first season what the second season was meant to be: the year of what happened to [Milo Ventimiglia‚Äôs character] Jack, and his death. We had the Super Bowl [last season] and we knew early on we were going to make that the ultimate episode in the middle of the season,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúSo there were a couple of things that came together that made Season 2 as anticipated as that first season was.‚Äù  NBC thinks the show‚Äôs momentum will continue this season. ‚ÄúI feel very bullish about Season 3 for a lot of reasons, which will remain sort of mysterious because I don‚Äôt want to give anything away,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs some extraordinary things he‚Äôs going to do this year.‚Äù"
"What do you buy the Sexiest Man Alive? Gwen Stefani opened up about her Christmas present plans for her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, with Jimmy Fallon on Tuesday night.  The 48-year-old musician had a tough time coming up with a gift for her country beau.  ‚ÄúHe's so hard to buy for! He already has the wildebeests [on his ranch], I was gonna get him that,‚Äù Stefani said of the Oklahoma native. ‚ÄúBut I think that, because he doesn't fit in any of my furniture at my house -- because he's too big -- I'm like, OK, I'm gonna get you a couch and that's gonna be your Christmas present.

As for Shelton‚Äôs beloved La-Z-Boy that was featured in his ‚ÄúSexiest Man Alive‚Äù spread, Stefani quipped, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs going to keep that one in Oklahoma.‚Äù  The No Doubt frontwoman admitted she‚Äôs mostly responsible for this year‚Äôs cover star.  ""That is not his thing at all,‚Äù she told Fallon of the People magazine honor. ‚ÄúI feel responsible a little bit, because he called me, and he's like, 'I gotta talk to you about something. They want me to do this, and I hate doing photo shoots. I'm not gonna do it.' I was like, 'Why would you not do it? Your record just came out. You're gonna look back, and you're gonna regret it. Come on, just live in the moment. Everybody wants to see you do a photo shoot. I wanna see you do a photo shoot!‚Äô And I kind of convinced him.""  It‚Äôs a busy season for Stefani, who is currently promoting her new Christmas album, You Make It Feel Like Christmas.  Opening up about her song ‚ÄúChristmas Eve,‚Äù Stefani revealed, ‚ÄúWhat's crazy is that Blake heard it, and he loved it so much that he decided to put it on his Christmas record and record it, which, nobody's ever recorded any of my songs, and especially not like, the hottest cowboy ever, Sexiest Man Alive.""

"Kourtney Kardashian may be 14 years older than her boyfriend.  But the reality star still believes that the 15 year age difference between her ex Scott Disick and his current girlfriend Sofia Richie is way too much.  The 39-year-old eldest Kardashian sister sill thinks the 19-year-old model is still 'too young' for her 34-year-old ex according to a source for People on Monday.  Not over it: Kourtney Kardashian thinks ex Scott Disick's new girlfriend is still 'too young' for him according to a Monday report from People  Mind the gap: The 39-year-old eldest Kardashian sister sill thinks the age gap between 34-year-old Scott and 19-year-old model Sofia Richie is still too much according to an insider, as they are pictured together in Miami back in December  Things seem to be getting serious between Scott and Sofia as they have been spotted together with his three children with Kourtney recently.  Despite the age gap, the insider insists that Sofia has had a good influence on Scott and his children: sons Mason, eight, and Reign, three, and five-year-old daughter Penelope.  'Sofia is helping Scott be a better, healthier person,' the source said. 'Kourtney feels confident that Scott and Sofia takes good care of the kids. Scott is a great dad when he has his life together.'  Family fun: Things seem to be getting serious between Scott and Sofia as they have been spotted together with his three children with Kourtney recently, as they are pictured together in Malibu last month  Just us: Scott and Sofia have been dating officially since September, as they are pictured together in Miami back in December  This is a drastic change to earlier this year when a source said of Kourtney: 'Like most people, she thinks Sofia is way too young for him and doesn‚Äôt get it.'  Meanwhile Kourtney is dating model Younes Bendjima who at 25-years-old is 14 years her junior.  This comes just weeks after Disick found public interest in his love life to be 'flattering' and that he takes the attention people pay to his personal life as a compliment.  He explained: 'I guess it's kind of flattering that people care. 'It's not like I'm mad about it. Everybody's worried about something. Everybody is worried about other people's things, so it's fine.'

But the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star insisted he doesn't harbor any fears about his kids.  Speaking to People, Scott shared: 'I don't worry about them, they're unbelievable. Best kids in the world.'  Despite this, an insider recently claimed that Sofia is fed up with Scott obsessing about his ex.  The celebrity duo have been dating since May last year, but it was suggested that Sofia is frustrated that the reality TV star appears to be so concerned with Kourtney.  The source explained: 'Sofia is annoyed with Scott's obsession with his ex Kourtney.'  In particular, the teenage star - who is the daughter of music icon Lionel Richie - has grown bored of having to listen to Scott complain about Kourtney's romance with Younes Bendjima.  The insider said: 'She's tired of listening to Scott complain about Kourtney and Sofia really doesn't like to hear Scott whine about Younes taking his place.'  It was suggested that Sofia is close to ending their relationship over the issue. The source added: 'For Sofia, it's a real turn-off when Scott stalks Kourtney online and obsesses about her, there is only so much more Sofia can take.'"
"A little more than a month after the second season of Netflix‚Äôs Ozark was released, the drama series starring, directed and executive produced by Jason Bateman has been renewed for a 10-episode third season. Chris Mundy is set to return as executive producer and showrunner.  Ozark, created by Bill Dubuque and Mark Williams, was one of the big breakouts of 2017, with its freshman season believed to be one of the most streamed shows of that summer. While the second season did not seem to match the buzz and outsized popularity of the first, Ozark remains a hit Netflix series that also gets steady awards recognition, making the Season 3 renewal a no-brainer.  In the current second season, Ozark, headlined by Bateman and Laura Linney, continues to follow Marty Byrde (Bateman) and his family as they navigate the murky waters of life within a dangerous drug cartel. With Del out, the crime syndicate sends their ruthless attorney Helen Pierce to town to shake things up just as the Byrdes are finally settling in. Marty and Wendy (Linney) struggle to balance their family interests amid the escalating dangers presented by their partnerships with the power-hungry Snells, the cartel and their new deputy, Ruth Langmore (Julia Garner), whose father Cade has been released from prison. The stakes are even higher than before and the Byrdes soon realize they have to go all in before they can get out.  Bateman directed multiple episodes from the first and second season and serves as an executive producer along with Mundy, Dubuque and Williams. Ozark is produced by Bateman‚Äôs Aggregate Films in association with Media Rights Capital."
"Mel B‚Äôs sister, Danielle Brown has decided to speak against the alleged abuse Stephen Belafonte has put his wife through after Mel got a restraining order against the man. Danielle started and entire social media war against the abuser and slammed him with her sharp words.  At first, Danielle posted on Instagram a snap meant for the media in which she assured them she never has and never will sell a story on her sister.  In order to be left alone, however, she did address the situation, later on, slamming Belafonte in another tweet: ‚Äù @stephenthinks11 8 years of abusive calls me and my mum have had stating we would never see Melanie again.I am laughing and celebrating as you were wrong. you are a sorry excuse of a man !!‚Äù  ‚ÄúTo the left to the left everything you own in the box to the left hope you ‚Ä¶ go to jail and rot in hell!!‚Äù she added.  Her series of tweets came shortly after Belafonte also decided to open up about the situation and tell his side of the story.  Stephen denied all of Mel B‚Äôs allegations, including the ones about him beating her up and forcing her into threesomes, claiming that it is all ‚Äúa smear campaign‚Äù against him.  Belafonte‚Äôs rep claimed that after legal action will be taking by the man it will be proven that Mel B lied in order to cover up her own marital misconducts. Furthermore, she tried to gain leverage with the kids‚Äô custody by lying.  They also alleged that when the truth about the extent to which Mel B lied in the depiction of her marriage will be revealed real victims of domestic violence will be very offended by her outrageous accusations.

"Updated: ASPEN ‚Äî Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day ‚Äî one of three ‚Äìhe told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I relish and that‚Äôs what I like,‚Äô‚Äô he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is ‚Äúabout the size of Senator Obama‚Äôs foreign-policy team.‚Äô‚ÄôMany on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia‚Äôs president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, ‚Äúthe first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.‚Äù‚ÄúMy friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,‚Äù Mr. McCain said. ‚ÄúThis is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.‚ÄùMr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, ‚ÄúI have to be against the tax increases, as you know,‚Äù and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it‚Äôs closer to $5 a gallon.At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his ‚Äúmaverick‚Äù stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the ‚ÄúChristian right.‚ÄùMr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush‚Äôs tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a ‚Äútraitor,‚Äù Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.He said he himself had been called ‚Äúdisloyal‚Äù by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn‚Äôt work. He said he had been ‚Äúdeclared dead,‚Äù but he was reminded of Chairman Mao‚Äôs saying that ‚Äúit‚Äôs always darkest before it‚Äôs totally black.‚Äù But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, ‚Äúhe voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,‚Äù he said, to sustained applause.He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, ‚Äúwe passed up an opportunity‚Äù to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn‚Äôt work. ‚ÄúThe kind of war they‚Äôre fighting requires long-term commitment,‚Äù he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA‚Äôs ‚ÄúDancing Queen‚Äù was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôve Got You Under My Skin.‚ÄùHe said that if he‚Äôs ‚Äúlacking in anything,‚Äù it is an appreciation for music and art and ‚Äúthe other great things in life,‚Äù partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.‚ÄúEverybody says, ‚ÄòI hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.‚ÄôHow come everybody goes to ‚ÄòMamma Mia!?‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEverybody goes! They‚Äôve been selling out for years.‚ÄùAfter another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.‚ÄúI appreciate art,‚Äù he declared. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm going to do and I have the opportunity, it‚Äôs to take a class in art.‚Äù He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, ‚Äúbut some of the things weren‚Äôt there that I would like to see.‚ÄùHe then added, ‚ÄúBut I make no excuses for my taste in music.‚Äù"

"Before Prince Harry proposed to Meghan Markle last year, he first asked for permission to do so from his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, who was also required to give her formal consent before Meghan and Harry could get married this past May. But, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, there's another very important royal in Harry's life to whom he turned for advice before popping the question: his sister-in-law, Kate Middleton . ""Harry and Kate are very close, she's been like a mentor to him and he wanted her seal of approval,"" a source told Nicholl in Grazia U.K. this week.  Beyond merely giving her approval to Harry's marriage, the Duchess of Cambridge has reportedly also made an effort to take Meghan under her wing since her and Harry's relationship turned serious. ""Kate is different to Meghan in many ways, but she has made great strides to help Meghan settle in,"" the source told Nicholl. ""It's a friendship that is still slowly blossoming. Kate has gone out of her way to be friendly to Meghan, and Meghan has been very grateful for that.""  Nicholl reports that Kate has shown Meghan ""the royal ropes ,"" introduced her to several of her favorite designers , and told the newly titled Duchess of Sussex that she's ""always welcome"" in Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, where Kate and Prince William live with their children . ""Kate has her hands full with the children and baby, but ensures she makes time to touch base with Meghan,"" the source said.  See more: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle May Be Moving Into This Insta-Worthy Windsor Cottage  Prince Harry and Kate Middleton have long shared a special bond. Last year, in a profile of Harry, Newsweek 's Angela Levin noted that his sister-in-law had helped to ""fill some of that gap"" left by his mother Princess Diana's death. ""When she and William got engaged, Harry called her the big sister he never had. He often pops into their apartment at Kensington Palace, where she cooks him a meal‚Äîroast chicken is reportedly a particular favorite,"" Levin wrote."
"Last year, there were some awful rumors about Cate Blanchett and her husband of nearly seventeen years, Andrew Upton. Upton and Blanchett met in the 1990s, fell in love immediately and have been together ever since. They have four kids together, three sons and a baby girl, Edith, whom they adopted in 2015. They live together, they raise their children together and they work together consistently on theater projects. They were co-directors of the Sydney Theatre Company for years, and he‚Äôs written and directed theater projects for Cate many times over the years. They seemed totally solid, right?  Well, last fall, there were some photos of Upton looking and seeming especially friendly and handsy with a 27-year-old actress, a friend who has worked with him and with Cate. The photos were damning, but they weren‚Äôt definitive proof of shenanigans. Still, there seemed to be a few tense months, and Cate was even seen without her wedding ring a few times. So what‚Äôs new?  Well, Cate and Andrew are working together again. These photos are from the opening night party for The Present, Upton‚Äôs adaptation of Chekhov‚Äôs Platonov. Upton adapted the play and he‚Äôs directing it. Cate stars. They posed together happily at the Ethel Barrymore theater in New York for their opening night. Cate also made a point of posing with her costar Richard Roxburgh. Cate and Andrew‚Äôs body language says to me ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fine.‚Äù Or possibly ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fine‚Ä¶ NOW.‚Äù As in, they had some issues but they worked their sh-t out. Possibly they worked their sh-t out when Upton got the hell out of Australia and joined Cate in America, where she‚Äôs been living and working for months now.  As for The Present, it‚Äôs getting rave reviews and Cate‚Äôs performance is being singled out, because of course it is. Theater people love her so hard. If she and Andrew ever split, so many people are going to side with her."
"On the outs with daughter Meghan Markle, Thomas Markle had hoped her mother Doria Ragland could shed some light on the situation, he said in a new interview with The Mail on Sunday.  ‚ÄúI even hand-delivered a letter to Doria asking her why our daughter won‚Äôt speak to me,‚Äù Thomas, 74, told the publication.  Writing to Doria, 62, is one of several ways that Thomas has tried to connect with Meghan, 37.  ‚ÄúI have sent several texts. Her number hasn‚Äôt changed and they haven‚Äôt bounced back,‚Äù he said of Meghan, who is expecting a baby with husband Prince Harry in the spring. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve pleaded with her to pick up the phone. I wrote her a two-page letter and sent it by certified mail via her representative in Los Angeles. I asked her why she was believing the lies.‚Äù  RELATED: Christmas at Kensington Palace!

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  ‚ÄúI have been frozen out and I can‚Äôt stay silent,‚Äù he added.  Meanwhile, his ex-wife has remained close with Meghan as their daughter settles into royal life six months after her wedding to Harry. In September, Doria tagged along when Meghan hosted a palace lunch for the first time, and she may also celebrate Christmas with the royal family after reportedly being invited by the Queen.  After publicly wavering on the decision, Thomas did not attend Meghan‚Äôs wedding in May, citing heart problems. In his absence, Prince Charles stepped in and walked Meghan down the aisle after she ‚Äúsadly‚Äù confirmed days before the nuptials that Thomas would not be attending the wedding as originally planned.  Thomas has since made controversial statements about his daughter, such as declaring that Meghan seemed ‚Äúterrified‚Äù of her new duties in July and comparing the royal family to a ‚Äúcult‚Äù in August. Also that month, Thomas admitted that he lied to Harry about staged paparazzi photos as the couple was preparing for their special day.  ‚ÄúIt was very wearing on her,‚Äù a source told PEOPLE in September of the family drama that preceded the nuptials. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her private life.‚Äù  Meghan Markle and father Thomas Markle Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images; Good Morning Britain/ITV  Thomas suggested that the conflict has been wearing on him, too. ‚ÄúMy life has been turned upside down since my daughter met Harry,‚Äù he told The Mail on Sunday. ‚ÄúTheir treatment of me is harsh, hurtful and unforgiving. I‚Äôm being punished for things I didn‚Äôt say.‚Äù"

"Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in an interview with FOX News Channel's 'Sunday Morning Futures' hosted by Maria Bartiromo, said that the Justice Department is ""aggressively"" investigating the leak of a phone call between former national security advisor Gen. Mike Flynn and the Russian Ambassador.    Background: Washington Post: How Mike Flynn Was Undone By A Phone Call    ""We‚Äôre going after this aggressively,"" Sessions said about the leak of the transcript of Flynn's call. ""I am directing it personally... and we‚Äôre pursuing it aggressively.""            Sessions also said that there are currently 27 open investigations regarding leaks of classified information. ""In the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27,"" he noted.      MARIA BARTIROMO: There are felonies apparently that have already taken place. I mean we had on this program just last week, the chairman of the Intel committee Devin Nunez and he said there are felonies that are going, not looked at all they‚Äôre going by over and over listen to what he told me just last Sunday.    REP. DEVIN NUNES: The big felony in all of this that nobody talks about from the very beginning was the leak of highly classified information when they leaked the phone call of the Russian ambassador talking to General Mike Flynn right before the inauguration. That was a felony, nothing‚Äôs ever been done about it.    BARTIROMO: Is your office investigating this sir?    SESSIONS: That is a violation of the law, to leak classified documents and it is being investigated. I will say this, the last two years before I became Attorney General there were each year there were three open investigations of classified leaks now we have 27 we‚Äôre going after this aggressively. I am directing it personally, some of the matters involve this matter and some of it is a matter I am not recused on and we‚Äôre pursuing it aggressively."

"Is there a chance that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner will get back together? He has reportedly been ‚Äòbegging‚Äô her to take him back, but we‚Äôve got an EXCLUSIVE scoop on if he‚Äôs really looking to reunite!  Ben Affleck, 45, and Jennifer Garner, 45, broke the hearts of fans everywhere when they split in 2015. Despite some hoping they‚Äôd work it out, the two filed for divorce in April 2017. Supposedly, Ben wasn‚Äôt ready to let go, as Us Weekly reports that since they filed the papers, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs begged her to come back several times, but she has no interest.‚Äù Though Ben has moved on to date Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, he was reportedly, at one point, telling friends he wanted his ex back.  Despite two years of trying to fix things ‚Äì Jennifer ‚Äúput her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and so desperately wanted to turn things around for the children‚Äôs sake, as well as theirs,‚Äù a fiend told Us ‚Äì it was all in vain. Supposedly, there was a hopeful moment in 2017. After Jennifer reportedly helped Ben during his stint in rehab for alcohol abuse, a source claims he said, ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt want to live without her. Things looked positive‚Ä¶they both wanted it to work. Though some observers thought ‚Äúit was like they were together again,‚Äù it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be, and the couple went ahead with the divorce filing.  Despite this report, people shouldn‚Äôt get too excited for a happy reunion. ‚ÄúThere is no truth here,‚Äù a source close to the exes EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com about this report. Though the source denied Ben‚Äôs ‚Äúbegging,‚Äù the insiders said that Ben and Jennifer ‚Äúhave much love and admiration for each other.‚Äù  Even Us Weekly‚Äôs report claims that Ben‚Äôs cries were falling on deaf ears. ‚ÄúShe forgave him for such much and still he couldn‚Äôt change,‚Äù a source tells Us. ‚ÄúShe feels it‚Äôs important to keep the peace and be a family unit,‚Äù but when it comes to romance, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not going there at all.‚Äù She and Ben will still spend time together, but it will be only for the benefit of their children. ‚ÄúShe just wants her kids to heave a healthy, happy and engaged father ‚Äì and she‚Äôll do whatever it takes to make that happen.‚Äù  [  While Ben has moved on to Lindsey, what about Jen? She‚Äôs reportedly been on a few dates ‚Äì one with an ‚ÄúAffleck look-alike.‚Äù Jennifer is ‚Äúready to go with her feelings and give love another try. It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say that Ben broke her heart and left her in a terrible place emotionally, [but] it‚Äôs been almost three years since they called it quits. It‚Äôs time for her to move on.‚Äù"

"That's a wrap for ""Southern Charm New Orleans."" Sunday night's episode of the unscripted Bravo series marked the finale of its first season -- and, one has to believe, probably the finale of the series as a whole.  Of course, the Bravo suits could always surprise us and renew it for a sophomore season. But the fact of the matter is that the show had trouble building a steady audience from the beginning. In fact, after debuting April 25 to more than 1 million viewers, it didn't build at all, posting a viewership decline with nearly every episode, according to figures from ShowBuzz Daily.  Last week's penultimate episode marked the low-water mark, drawing fewer viewers -- 640,000 -- than any other episode so far this season. Nothing charming about that. (Viewership figures on Sunday's eighth and final episode were not available.)  By comparison, the ""Southern Charm"" mother ship, from which ""SoCharm NOLA"" was spun off, has yet to register fewer than 1 million voters in any of the nine episodes that have aired so far as part of its fifth season.  So, while there will certainly be some people who will mourn the end of ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" should Bravo decide to pass on a second season, I've got a feeling most people won't miss it -- because they apparently stopped watching pretty early on.  The reason behind the erosion of interest in the show is pretty simple to nail down: It was boring, built around limp writing and clumsily staged attempts at drama.  Granted, no reality show is actually ""real."" But if a producer wants his or her show to draw a reliable base of return viewers, they've got to help those viewers buy into the illusion. That was seldom the case with ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's an upside to it all, it's that the show was not the pox on local culture that many feared. In fact, its New Orleansness seemed to get more and more watered-down with nearly every episode, eventually reduced to little more than Chamber of Commerce images flashed between scenes, with an occasional bowl of gumbo thrown in. That's just as well, given that the show's efforts at including local culture in early episodes was ham-handed at best.  Even then, though, with so few people watching, it's hard to get too terribly worked up about it. As they say: No harm, no foul.  For those few who did watch regularly, producers were kind enough to wrap up most of the show's loose narrative threads in Sunday's finale. Below find a recap of the high points (and low points) of the Season 1 finale of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  The title: ""Better Late Than Pregnant.""  The centerpiece drama of the week: In what was perhaps the show's cheapest stunt yet -- and its most manufactured -- producers pulled a full-on okey-doke on viewers, in the form of a pregnancy scare for cast member Reagan Charleston.  That particular plot point was teased during the closing moments of the previous episode, but before getting to it in Episode 8, producers had hubby Jeff Charleston express his eagerness to become a father -- followed by Raegan informing him that she's not quite ready yet to be a mom. The next thing we know, her period is conveniently late.  So, she does what anybody would do: She takes a pregnancy test. At a huge season-ending party thrown by fellow cast member Jon Moody. And using a pregnancy test that was a gag gift at an adult Easter egg hunt from Episode 7.  And after all that? Spoiler alert: She ain't preggers.  That's right, ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" fans. You just got punk'd.  In all honestly, it's probably for the best, as on Monday (June 4) -- the day after the finale aired -- Reagan and Jeff announced they are separating.  The libation of the week: A French 75, ordered at breakfast by Tamica Lee.  The New Orleans cliche of the week: From a practical standpoint, the idea of throwing a party to end the season was a pretty good one, giving producers the opportunity to get everybody together one last time -- and decked out in their Sunday best -- to wrap up the season's myriad dramas.  That being said, it's nothing short of shameless that they framed it as a ""Jazz Fest launch party."" The show, and the episode has nothing to do with Jazz Fest. The cast never went to Jazz Fest. In fact, music has played a minor role in the series at best.  The honest question of the week: Speaking of the show's lack of focus on music, why didn't producers pick a local musician or two when they were casting the show? Not only would they have gotten some great music out of it, but the real behind-the-scenes dramas that play out on the local music scene have got to be better than the fake ones that played out on Season 1 of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's one thing that could get me interested in a second season, that would probably be it.  The real moment of the week: Of all the lose threads tied up in the season finale, easily the most touching was the reconciliation between cast member Tamica Lee and her daughter, third-grader Rani, with whom she butted heads in a previous episode -- and who has struggled with the fact that she's the only black kid at her school.  After sitting down for a heart-to-heart with the help of supporting cast member Susan Henry, Tamica and Rani hugged it out -- and cried it out -- in what was probably the sweetest moment of the season.  Granted, it all happened during a staged radio interview at local station WBOK, but this is one case where the end justifies the means. On a related note: If there's an MVP of the season, it's Rani, as far as I'm concerned.  The manufactured moment of the week: Raegan's pregnancy scare. (See ""The centerpiece drama,"" above.)  The quote of the week: ""We're just having some conversations."" -- Justin, to mother Dottie Reese, after she walked in on a heated conversation between Justin and girlfriend Kelsey.  I don't know why, but that line cracked me up. In fact, it's not just the quote of the week. It might be the quote of the whole season. I'm think I'm going to start using it whenever anybody butts into a conversation I'm having with somebody else.  Them: ""What are you guys talking about?""  Me: ""We're just having some conversations."" (Exits.)  The winner: The King Firm, where cast member Justin Reese's day job is. Every episode this season, they've bought airtime during the show for a commercial that prominently features Justin -- and which never fails to fool me into thinking the show is back on, thus prompting me to stop fast-forwarding through the commercials.  Granted, I start fast-forwarding again immediately upon realizing it's a commercial, but I know the firm's name now, whereas I didn't' before.  Nicely played, King Firm. Nicely played.  The loser: Me, for actually sitting through all eight episodes.  On the plus side, it's all been documented through the following stories, so future generations can remember the season that was.  As for me, I'm going to start trying to forget it, starting now.

"Showtime‚Äôs Homeland will wrap after its upcoming eighth season, according to the show‚Äôs star Claire Danes. As The Hollywood Reporter reports, the actress confirmed the news during an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM on Wednesday.  ‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs it,‚Äù Danes said when Stern addressed the rumors that next season would bring the CIA drama to a close. A representative for Showtime told Rolling Stone that the network has not made a decision beyond Season 8.  Danes said she felt ‚Äúreally conflicted‚Äù about the series ending. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be ready,‚Äù Danes said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a lot, this Carrie fricking Mathison. I mean, she‚Äôs under constant duress. I mean, it‚Äôs a workout.  ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôll be ready for a reprieve from that,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúBut, you know, I‚Äôve never done anything this long.‚Äù  Showtime renewed Homeland for an additional two seasons ahead of its Season 6 premiere.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs definitely going to be my last year,‚Äù executive producer and writer Alex Gansa told THR in February, before the show‚Äôs seventh season debut. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak for Claire or Mandy [Patinkin], but it will be my final year and it will be designed to be the end of an eight-season story. If Showtime, Fox, Claire and Mandy want to take the show further, that‚Äôs their decision. And we would leave some room for that to happen, if there‚Äôs an appetite.‚Äù  The Season 7 finale airs on April 29th. Homeland has garnered 10 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Danes winning two for best actress in a drama series."
"Actor Robert Pattinson recently sat down with The Telegraph to discuss his new film Good Time. Besides that, he also talked about his mental health, fame and ongoing therapy as well.  Also read: Did Robert Pattinson breakup with FKA Twigs because of Katy Perry?  Asked if fame and mental health issues are connected, the 31-year-old English actor responded, ""Yes. Definitely. Pretty much every person I know who's got famous is completely nuts. It's just isolation and also the repetitiveness of your interactions with people... It's just weird.""  But he also explained how he maintained his own sanity. ""I had good agents and stuff and I've had really good friends since the beginning.""  ""So I think when it gets dangerous for people is when you have no friends and you think, 'Oh, if I get strangers to love me then it will fill that hole.' And then when it doesn't fill the hole, then you go 10 times crazier,'"" he said.  Adding, ""I try to not be seen whatsoever between movies. So hopefully the only thing that exists of you in the public realm is what you agree to put out there.""  Talking about his mental condition, he admitted that he was really crazy earlier. ""It's always just a control thing. If the control of your life has been taken away from you, that's when you go a little crazy.""  ""I get so much anxiety in performance and everyone's reaction is to say, 'Just be yourself!' And myself, in general, is the last person I want to be."" Pattinson told The Telegraph.  During the interview, the Twilight actor also revealed that his parents became ""literally horrified"" when they learned about him being under therapy.  Talking about therapy, the actor also mentioned how therapy still remains as a 'weird stigma'. However, he also confessed how he has got a lot out of the counselling.  ""You're just trying to figure out how you feel about something. I've got a lot out of it... I mean [without therapy], I don't know how you're supposed to do [life]."""
"Meghan Markle‚Äôs nephew has announced details of the special strain of cannabis he has created to celebrate the upcoming royal wedding.  Tyler Dooley grows cannabis in Oregon, US ‚Äì which has been legal in the American state since 2015 ‚Äì and previously announced that he would be developing a new potent hybrid named Markle‚Äôs Sparkle.  Now, days before Markle is due to marry Prince Harry, details of the drug‚Äôs price, flavour and effects have been released on Leaf Buyer ‚Äì an online cannabis dispensary database.  In an online description of Markle Sparkle, the website says: ‚ÄúNoble families often inspire their country persons to craft and dedicate products to them.  ‚ÄúFor a Royal baby, a royal cheddar. For a Royal wedding, a royal weed.  ‚ÄúMarkle Sparkle is a cannabis strain dedicated to the soon-to-be British Royal Meghan Markle.‚Äù  The $150-an-ounce (¬£111) strain is tipped to be good for helping alleviate insomnia, pain and anxiety, and it has been specially engineered so that it doesn‚Äôt make users feel too hungry.  The website also says that Markle Sparkle has a ‚Äúvery sweet, silky taste‚Äù with ‚Äúnotes of fresh blueberry and a unique, fruity and smooth flavour.‚Äù  As for its effect, the drug is supposed to provide users with an ‚Äúuplifting‚Äù experience and a ‚Äútingling body sensation.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere is a sense of relief and euphoria that comes with the high as well,‚Äù it says.  ‚ÄúThese benefits make for a great all-around versatile strain for any medical patient or recreational consumer.‚Äù  The Markle Sparkle tests at 23 per cent THC - the active ingredient in marijuana ‚Äì and is made by crossbreeding three varieties including NYC Diesel, Northern Lights with Blueberry and a secret strain which Dooley is not revealing.

"Selena Gomez refuses to talk to her mother about her on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber.  The 'Come And Get It' singer's rollercoaster romance with the 'Sorry' hitmaker is said to have ended recently, but her mother Mandy Teefey has suggested she would be the last one to know what the situation is right now.  Tense: Selena Gomez refuses to talk to her mother about her on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber  Asked by E! News for an update on her 25-year-old daughter's relationship with the 24-year-old pop star, she simply replied: 'You would know before I did. We don't talk about it.'  It comes after reports claiming despite the apparent split, Justin still has his former flame on his mind.  An insider told People: 'He isn't dating. He thinks and talks about Selena all the time. The chapter with her is definitely not finished.'  On-again, off-again: Selena's mother doesn't approve of Justin Bieber  Although he has made an effort to develop a better relationship with Selena's friends and family - but they're not convinced he's a suitable boyfriend.  The insider added: 'Justin does care what her friends and family think and has tried to win them over, but some of them are just over it. They're there for Selena and support her no matter what, but don't feel like they need to welcome back Justin.  'If you notice, Selena keeps her friends and Justin separate - when she's with Justin, it's just Justin, and when she's with her old friends, it's just them. They don't really overlap anymore.'  Selena's mother has previously questioned whether Justin, 24, is a suitable boyfriend for her daughter.  And the 'Wolves' hitmaker is said to be focused on rebuilding her relationship with Mandy.  The source told Entertainment Tonight: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too.'"

"Those impatient with high-end Britfilm period product might worry that this movie takes a rather picturesque view of disability issues, and for the first 20 minutes I came pretty close to this standpoint myself. But you have to give Breathe time to let its charm and its heartfelt decency grow on you. The film is about an important figure in the history of how we think about and respect disabled people ‚Äì the wheelchair-use pioneer and polio survivor Robin Cavendish (whose son Jonathan is the movie‚Äôs producer).  Andy Serkis makes his debut as director, working from a robust screenplay by William Nicholson. Andrew Garfield plays Cavendish, a rather dashing fellow in the 1950s who zooms around the place in his sports car and plays a splendid game of cricket, hitting a six that breaks the teacups set out by the clubhouse and roguishly calling out: ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù He spots a beautiful young woman among the spectators: Diana Blacker, played by Claire Foy. It‚Äôs love at first sight, and marriage soon afterwards, and then a rather memsahib-like existence for her in Kenya (pronounced Keen-ya) because Cavendish is a ‚Äútea broker‚Äù there.  But then one day Cavendish feels faint and collapses: he has polio, is paralysed from the neck down, and after he is brought back to England, the medical establishment curtly tells Diana not to expect her husband to live any more than a few months, and only as a prostrate patient who must be passive and obedient. But armed with love and courage, the Cavendishes demand more of existence than this, and Robin defies the grumpy doctors by using a new respirator-wheelchair invented especially for him. It is possible that for this role, Garfield studied Kenneth More playing the disabled Air Force pilot Douglas Bader in the biopic Reach for the Sky.  It‚Äôs a valuable and touching story, and it is extraordinary to think that so recently, disabled people in this position were treated like living corpses, there to be clinically warehoused and studied, and told to be grateful and mute. There is a chilling scene in which Cavendish and his friends are taken to see a facility in Germany that turns out to be some Kubrickian living morgue: white, brightly lit, with patients entombed in state-of-the-art medical sarcophagi.  As for the central relationship, it is a matter of getting on with it, keeping love alive in the little things and staying cheerful in a very British way ‚Äì which I‚Äôm sure is a fair depiction of exactly how the Cavendishes coped. There is a delicate allusion to what might be called their conjugal intimacy ‚Äì Robin says it is a matter of Diana ‚Äúdoing all the work‚Äù ‚Äì although the business of other bodily functions is not shown. The lump-in-the-throat seriousness is offset with fun small roles, principally for Tom Hollander, who plays both Diana‚Äôs twin brothers and provides some much-needed irony and cynicism. Hugh Bonneville has some fun with the role of scientist Teddy Hall, who invents Robin‚Äôs wheelchair.  The problem is that there is not much light and shade in the Cavendishes themselves ‚Äì and certainly not with Diana, at times a rather thankless role for Foy (given far less to chew on here than as the Queen in the Netflix series The Crown). She is loyal, loving, often exasperated and sometimes angry ‚Äì but it is still a pretty narrow emotional bandwidth. Robin has his own dark night of the soul, just after he is told that he will not walk again, but it is always clear that this bitterness is only temporary.  And those who wonder if the British film industry will tackle the issue of Kenya and the Mau Mau uprising may not be entirely happy with the way that is invoked: a rather saucer-eyed anecdote around the Kenyan camp-fire about Mau Mau prisoners choosing a Zen-willed suicide for themselves in detention camps. Most accounts suggest Mau Mau prisoners died rather more brutally than that, yet this quaint image is later revived to evoke Robin‚Äôs own stoicism when his own condition becomes too much to bear.  At all events, Breathe is an affecting account of the quiet courage needed to battle the deadly spores of discrimination and condescension that came with polio."
"Ivanka Trump is becoming one of the most powerful first children in American History ‚Äì despite not having an official job in the Trump administration. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)  Ivanka Trump‚Äôs products weren‚Äôt always the hottest items online.  In January, for instance, the first daughter‚Äôs fashion line ranked No. 550 based on the number of orders from Lyst, the biggest fashion e-commerce website in the world, according to Forbes.  That changed dramatically the following month.  Sales of Trump‚Äôs products skyrocketed in early February, making her Lyst‚Äôs 11th most popular brand. The biggest spike, according to Lyst, came on Feb. 9, when sales jumped by 219 percent from the day before.  Yes, Feb. 9 ‚Äî the same day that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted Trump‚Äôs clothing and jewelry line on ‚ÄúFox & Friends.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGo buy Ivanka‚Äôs stuff is what I would tell you,‚Äù Conway said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody.‚Äù  And viewers did, apparently.    Sales of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs branded products skyrocketed on Feb. 9, the same day White House counselor Kellyanne Conway promoted the line on Fox News. (Lyst)  Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, said in a statement that ‚Äúthe beginning of February‚Äù shows ‚Äúthe best performing weeks in the history of the brand.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFor several different retailers, Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the best performance ever,‚Äù Klem said.  Sarah Tanner, Lyst‚Äôs spokeswoman, said increases in sales are usually tied to current events. For instance, interest in pantsuits went up by 460 percent last year because of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs affinity for the style, she said. Sales of the first daughter‚Äôs products went up by 86 percent in November when her father won the presidential election, according to the company.  Conway has come under fire for touting Ivanka Trump's clothing line during a televised interview. (Daron Taylor/The Washington Post)  [A Trump wine boycott backfires spectacularly]  But the brand was ‚Äúlargely featured‚Äù in the news in February, Tanner said. Conway gave her on-air endorsement of Ivanka Trump‚Äôs brand after President Trump had complained on Twitter that his daughter had ‚Äúbeen treated so unfairly‚Äù by the department store Nordstrom, which dropped her clothing line over slow sales.  ‚ÄúIt would not be a surprise to us if it resulted in the increase in sales,‚Äù Tanner said of Conway‚Äôs Fox interview. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs one of the reasons the brand was largely in the news and could have attributed to this increase.‚Äù  Conway did not respond to an email requesting comment. Her promotion of the fashion line appeared to violate an ethics rule barring federal employees from using their public office to endorse products and immediately drew criticism from both Democrats and Republicans.  [Where does the Ivanka Trump brand go from here?]  Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Conway‚Äôs comments were ‚Äúabsolutely wrong, wrong, wrong‚Äù and ‚Äúclearly over the line,‚Äù The Washington Post reported.  The White House later said that Conway had been ‚Äúcounseled.‚Äù But concerns about her comments remain.  On Thursday, the government‚Äôs top ethics official criticized the White House for not disciplining Conway, The Post‚Äôs Drew Harwell reported. Walter M. Shaub Jr., director of the Office of Government Ethics, had urged officials last month to reprimand the White House counsel but was rebuffed. On Thursday he wrote to Stefan C. Passantino, who handles White House ethics issues as the president‚Äôs deputy counsel.  ‚ÄúWhen an employee‚Äôs conduct violates, disciplinary action serves to deter future misconduct,‚Äù Shaub wrote. ‚ÄúNot taking disciplinary action against a senior official under such circumstances risks undermining the ethics program.‚Äù  [A Trump voter‚Äôs message to retailers: ‚ÄòKeep your mouths shut about our president‚Äô]  Last month, a group of law professors filed a professional misconduct complaint against Conway ‚Äî a law school graduate and member of the D.C. Bar ‚Äî partly because of her on-air endorsement of Trump‚Äôs products.  According to Lyst, February drew unusually large numbers of orders across many Ivanka Trump-branded products, including dresses, shoes, pants, coats, knitwear and tops. Heels were the bestsellers, followed by dresses.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never seen such a large uptick,‚Äù Tanner said. ‚ÄúTypically, she‚Äôs not in our top 100 sellers.‚Äù  Comparing February‚Äôs numbers with last year‚Äôs average number of orders of Ivanka Trump products shows a difference of 557 percent. (Tanner said company policy prohibits her from sharing the actual numbers of online sales.)  The excitement of the brand, however, may be slumping. The company‚Äôs numbers show sales were gradually tapering off toward the end of February. March does not appear to be as remarkable, but sales are still on track to be about 8 percent better than they were in January, according to Lyst.  [Watchdogs ask U.S. attorney to investigate Trump over foreign business deals]  The Ivanka Trump brand also appears to have weathered an aggressive boycott campaign called Grab Your Wallet, which began in October and encouraged shoppers to avoid retailers that stock Trump-branded products.  1 of 68 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad √ó Ivanka Trump: A life in the spotlight View Photos Here‚Äôs a look at Ivanka Trump‚Äôs early life of privilege and transformation into a business executive, first daughter and adviser to the U.S. president.

Some retailers have partially or completely distanced themselves from the Trump brand. Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and Belk have stopped selling Trump‚Äôs branded line of clothing, shoes and jewelry. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls have instructed employees to stop promoting Trump products in stores and to move Trump clothing into general merchandise racks. Sears Holdings and subsidiary Kmart discontinued online sales of 31 items from the Trump Home collection last month, though their websites still contain items sold by third-party sellers. The collection includes living room and bedroom furniture, lamps and chandeliers.  The companies attributed their decisions to product performance. Nordstrom, for instance, said sales of the brand have steadily declined, particularly in the last half of 2016.  Still, despite the boycott, Trump‚Äôs line of fragrances enjoyed top spots in Amazon‚Äôs best-selling list last month, The Post‚Äôs Amy B Wang reported.

"Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum are separating after nearly nine years of marriage.  The former couple announced the split in a joint statement exclusive to PEOPLE:  ‚ÄúHey world!  So‚Ä¶We have something we would like to share.  First off, it feels odd that we have to share this kind of thing with everyone, but it‚Äôs a consequence of the lives we‚Äôve chosen to lead, which we also happen to be deeply grateful for. We‚Äôre living in an incredible moment in time, but it‚Äôs also a time where truth can easily get distorted into ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù üòâ So we want to share the truth so you know that if you didn‚Äôt read it here then it‚Äôs most certainly fiction.  We have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple. We fell deeply in love so many years ago and have had a magical journey together. Absolutely nothing has changed about how much we love one another, but love is a beautiful adventure that is taking us on different paths for now. There are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision ‚Äî just two best-friends realizing it‚Äôs time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible. We are still a family and will always be loving dedicated parents to Everly. We won‚Äôt be commenting beyond this, and we thank you all in advance for respecting our family‚Äôs privacy. Sending lots of love to everyone, Chan&Jenna.‚Äù  The actors, both 37, have one child together ‚Äî daughter Everly ‚Äî who will turn 5 in May.  The couple most recently attended the Kids‚Äô Choice Awards together where Tatum hit the stage to promote his new animated movie Smallfoot.

Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.‚Äù  Dave Benett/WireImage  Dewan Tatum said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn‚Äôt get along.  ‚ÄúBut I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always had the same values. But we‚Äôre not perfect! Are you kidding?

"‚ÄúI love romantic comedies. I feel almost sheepish writing that, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years or so that admitting that you like these movies is a form of mild stupidity‚Ä¶ I enjoy watching people fall in love on-screen so much that I can suspend my disbelief for the contrived situations that only happen in the heightened world of romantic comedies.‚Äù ‚ÄîMindy Kaling, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?  At the end of its second season, The Mindy Project has become one of those shows that inspires strong reactions on either side, and very few in the middle. If you scout out Mindy Project reviews (wait, I‚Äôve done it for you!), you‚Äôll find both total pans (‚ÄúThe Mindy Project fails at everything it attempts‚Äù) and complete raves (‚ÄúWhy only an idiot would miss out on TV‚Äôs funniest comedy‚Äù). I fall closer to the latter on the scale, but I understand the former. I don‚Äôt really care if Mindy‚Äôs likable or not, as long as she‚Äôs entertaining, but some of her actions are insane (tracing her one-night stand to his workplace, a first-grade classroom) or ignorant (a medical doctor who doesn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúcondo‚Äù stands for?) enough to take the viewer out of the actual show to ponder, ‚ÄúWhy am I watching this person?‚Äù When the show does stumble (‚ÄúL.A.,‚Äù or the recent ill-scheduling of ‚ÄúGirl Crush‚Äù), it takes at least a week or so to right itself.  Advertisement  But when it realigns, The Mindy Project becomes one of the most enjoyable comedies on TV. Todd VanDerWerff points out that although the show seems to be in a constant state of transition, at least its trajectory is skewing upward, with a big leap forward between this season and last. I would probably watch it for the one-liners and absurdist asides (like the stalker raccoon) alone, but I also appreciate Mindy Kaling‚Äôs overall mission: To draft her own brand of romantic comedy. From the show‚Äôs first episodes, it established that Dr. Mindy Lahiri only wants to be Meg Ryan in a movie with Tom Hanks, as idealistic and unrealistic as that sounds. Her real-life counterpart has studied these rom-com tropes as well, so nods to the Nora Ephron canon (like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve Got Sext‚Äù) abound in her scripts. She‚Äôs writing within the mold while redefining it: The saga of Mindy and Danny has contained some of the show‚Äôs finest work, as a hot in-air kiss led to a short yet delightful relationship, a too-quick and devastating breakup, and a hesitant walk toward each other again.  Heading into the finale, I fully expected Mindy and Danny to end up together (the episode title is a dead giveaway), but wondered how Kaling would make it memorable, meaningful, and most of all, funny. Fortunately, she pulled off this particular hat-trick. The episode features an absolute treasure trove of hilarious lines (I could list them all in stray observations, but that would be this entire review) strewn throughout the plot that finally brings Mindy and Danny together. This storyline not only utilizes the entire supporting cast for once (Zoe Jarman, we hardly knew ye), but it also uses Kaling‚Äôs rom-com curation as an actual plotting device. Pile on devastating performances by Kaling and Chris Messina, especially, and you have one of my favorite episodes of the year.  Danny pretending to be Mindy‚Äôs mysterious train admirer honors You‚Äôve Got Mail, but also The Shop Around The Corner, the movie on which it was based. He knows her well enough to know that the promise of perfect romance will be enough to make her dump her real relationship with Detective Charlie. Danny suggests they meet on the top of the Empire State Building‚Äîadd An Affair To Remember by way of Sleepless In Seattle‚Äîwhere he will reveal that he has loved her all along. After a slight derail, he visits her when she‚Äôs sick (You‚Äôve Got Mail again), while offering to watch the ultimate film study in friendship-leading-to-romance: When Harry Met Sally (He: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll order whatever gave her an orgasm!‚Äù She: ‚ÄúYou paraphrased one of the most famous lines pretty well!‚Äù). Then, in a Danny voiceover, he takes her all over New York, ‚Äúvisiting any place that Meg Ryan ever laugh-cried.‚Äù  Advertisement  I cite Messina‚Äôs performance because although he tells Morgan and Tamra and Mindy his true feelings this episode, he has not voiced them since the breakup. But for the last four or five episodes, we still have known‚Äîby his frequent smoldering looks, attempts to work his way back into Mindy‚Äôs life, and just his ready acceptance to go get breakfast with her and be late for work.  When the entire office staff gets pulled in to lead Mindy and Danny back to each other, it works so well I wish they‚Äôd been used more throughout the entire season. Morgan has always been the office‚Äôs unsung MVP, as he figures out Danny‚Äôs secret plan (Danny asks, ‚ÄúHow did you figure it out?‚Äù, then realizes he‚Äôs talking to Morgan: ‚ÄúHow did you figure it out?‚Äù). Jeremy was awesome with his waivers, as was Peter with his final pep talk this season as he proves to Mindy that Danny still loves her.  So Mindy and Danny both race to the Empire State, and in one of my favorite bits of the episode, Danny gets hit by a car, yet still hobbles off. This is a hilarious nod to An Affair To Remember (which I will not spoil in case you haven‚Äôt seen it, but really, you should see it). Danny and Mindy reunite, and all is right with the sitcom world.  Advertisement  It‚Äôs such a perfect finale, I almost wish the show hadn‚Äôt been renewed. But then there would be no more Mindy Project, which would be a real disappointment. That‚Äôs the thing about rom-coms: The ending is always the same. But Mindy and Danny‚Äôs journey to get there was such an enjoyable trip. The challenge for season three will be to keep the momentum going into Danny and Mindy‚Äôs actual relationship, without contrived breakups or third-party romantic obstacles. This finale points to the possibility that The Mindy Project could pull it off.  Finale grade: A  Season grade: B  Stray observations:  On the train, Mindy‚Äôs coworkers are having a boring conversation about street mimes: ‚ÄúMimes don‚Äôt even talk!‚Äù  For the record, Katie Holmes is six months older than Mindy Kaling.  I fervently hope Tim Daly is on the list for Emmy-nominated guest stars this year. Even his final scene is killer: He chastises Mindy for describing herself as a prostitute again (she shakes her head and agrees, ‚ÄúI know, I know‚Äù), then walks out of their breakup like a boss without ever acknowledging that he may have any flaws. I miss him already.  Loved Morgan‚Äôs dawning look of realization about Mindy‚Äôs ‚ÄúMindy2ndaccount@hotmail‚Äù email address. And his sarcastic nods to Danny about honesty.  Also, Beverly covering her ears so she won‚Äôt have to hear Jeremy‚Äôs catfish story about the man with no torso again.  The title of Danny‚Äôs fake emails to Mindy: ‚Äúwhat if‚Ä¶ ,‚Äù ‚Äúhello,‚Äù ‚Äútoday,‚Äù ‚Äúcoffee,‚Äù ‚Äúgood times.‚Äù  Morgan explains why Mindy should know Danny loves her: ‚ÄúHe laughs at all of your jokes, and let‚Äôs face it, comedy is not your strong suit.‚Äù  The elevator guy sends Mindy up 104 floors seconds before the elevators start working again.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre killing me, Bradley Cooper! What is this, a 20-piece suit?‚Äù  ‚ÄúDanny, who did I mail my underwear to?‚Äù  I starting reviewing The Mindy Project about midway through this season; I was not a huge fan of the show‚Äôs early episodes, but by the time Adam Pally showed up, it began to win me over. It was a lot of fun to write about; thanks for reading!"

"Original Charmed stars Holly Marie Combs and Shannen Doherty have already addressed The CW‚Äôs upcoming reboot.

I‚Äôm simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life. ‚Äî Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  The new stars and producers have responded to the pushback, also coming from certain pockets of the original fans, multiple times. During the Television Critics Association tour, Mantock said, ‚ÄúOf course, you can‚Äôt help but feel disappointed because I think the script is fantastic. I really hope maybe [Combs will] see it and like it.‚Äù  Executive producers Jennie Snyder Urman and Jessica O‚ÄôToole also noted how the original show ‚Äúwrapped up everything up so wonderfully‚Äù and they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to mess with that mythology, obviously, because it was eight years.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNone of us from the original cast to the original creators, producers, or writers have anything to do with it,‚Äù Milano said in a recent interview with Parade. ‚ÄúThe way I feel about it is this, and I‚Äôll just be super, super-honest: If the reboot can give the joy that it gave to our generation to a new generation, then I think that‚Äôs really beautiful. Time after time, I‚Äôve heard story after story about how that show meant so much to people, because it was a show that they found while they were battling cancer, or it was a show that they watched with their father, and that was the only thing they could connect with. It really resonated with people in a profound way, and if a new generation can find that, then I think that‚Äôs really beautiful.‚Äù  She suggests the new showrunners ‚Äúshouldn‚Äôt try to reinvent the wheel, but really take what was so great about the original and find a way to make it their own.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad that it‚Äôs here finally, because we‚Äôve been hearing about this reboot for however many years, what has it been, maybe four years now?‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAnd I feel like it‚Äôs either going to succeed or not, and if it succeeds again, a whole new generation will be exposed to the beauty of what Charmed was able to be for people, and if it doesn‚Äôt succeed, then we don‚Äôt have to hear about it anymore.‚Äù"
"Justin Bieber has had his fair share of accidents in public ‚Äî most of them involving high-profile falls while on tour.  So when the 22-year-old pop star was seen walking down the streets of West Hollywood, Los Angeles on Thursday with a giant wet stain on the crotch of his designer sweatpants, the Internet obviously just assumed Bieber had peed himself. (Yes, #JustinPeeber was a thing.)  But the ‚ÄúLove Yourself‚Äù singer has a totally reasonable explanation.  Late in the evening on Thursday, Biebs set the record straight about the source of the stain. ‚ÄúSomeone got me flowers and I was driving, made a turn, and the water spilled on my d‚Äî area,‚Äù he tweeted.  While most celebrities might have been peed-off about the embarrassing photos, Bieber has a good sense of humor about it.  ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt bother me if it made ya laugh nice!‚Äù he added.  Source: Justin Bieber Twitter  He also took to his newly reinstated Instagram to joke about the photos, posting a meme comparing his soaked sweatpants to the wet pants Adam Sandler rocked in Billy Madison.  ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt cool unless you pee your pants,‚Äù Bieber wrote ‚Äî quoting the scene from the 1995, in which Sandler pretends to pee his pants to so that school bullies will stop teasing another kid who actually did pee his pants.

"Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a 'Moron': 'I've Never Met Her'  ""She's young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental,"" said the Aussie rapper.  After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.  Speaking with Australian radio show Smallzy's Surgery, Azalea called Halsey's comments to The Guardian last week ""strange"" since they were seemingly totally unprovoked.  ""It's a bit weird to bring someone up in an interview that you weren't asked about,"" said Azalea, likening it to if she suddenly decided to diss Janet Jackson during that conversation without reason.  ""To me, because I'm a famous person and I know a lot of the time people have opinions and they're not always accurate, I really try very hard not to give my personal opinions about people that I don't know,"" Azalea continued. ""And I don't know her, I've never met her.""  In an interview published last week, Halsey targeted Azalea as someone she would never put on one of her records. Of Azalea, the singer said, ""She had a complete disregard for black culture. F---king moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.""  In response, Azalea told Smallzy, ""I thought it was a bit of a strange thing to throw that out there, but she's young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental when she's kind of in the same shoes. I'm sure she's getting judged all the time as well by people who don't really know her. So I think maybe it'd be good for her to try to be a little more empathetic to other people that are in the same situation.""  Listen to the full interview here."
"It‚Äôs official: Last Man Standing will be back. A year after it was canceled by ABC, Fox has closed deals to bring back the multi-cam comedy starring Tim Allen for premiere during the 2018-2019 season.  The bulk of the show‚Äôs core cast is back, including Allen, Nancy Travis, Jonathan Adams, Amanda Fuller, Christoph Sanders and Jordan Masterson. I hear co-star Hector Elizondo also has a deal in place to come back. His casting is currently in second position to his NBC comedy pilot Guess Who Died which is not expected to go forward at the network.  As Deadline previously reported, LMS producer 20th Century Fox TV had been in talks with sibling Fox Broadcasting Co. for a new season of the series, which will be its seventh, with Allen locked in to return. The series is eyed for a new multi-camera comedy block on Friday.  Created by Jack Burditt, Last Man Standing stars Allen as Mike Baxter, a married father of three girls, who tries to maintain his manliness in a world increasingly dominated by women.  Allen has been vocal about his disappointment over the cancellation of Last Man Standing by ABC and his hope to see it come back.  ‚ÄúExcited?,‚Äù he said today. ‚ÄúTeam LMS was in the sixth inning, ahead by four runs, stands were packed and then for no reason, they call off the game. It leaves you sitting in the dugout, holding a bat and puzzled. Now we get the news from Fox that it‚Äôs time to get back out on that diamond ‚Äì hell yes, I‚Äôm excited!  When I heard the offer to create more episodes of Last Man Standing, I did a fist pump so hard I threw my back out. It‚Äôs the fans! I could not be more grateful for the fans who wrote petitions and kept up the passion and incredible support for the show,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúAnd a fist pump, ouch, for Dana Walden and Gary Newman at Fox for not only listening to the fans, but for making the bold move to bring Last Man Standing back. I‚Äôm sure audiences will be curious to see what we look like after all these years. Oh, has it only been one year? Well, just goes to show you ‚Äì a lot can happen in a year.‚Äù  Last Man Standing was ABC‚Äôs second most-watched comedy, after Modern Family, averaging 8.3 million viewers in Live + 7 for the 2016-2017 season. Among the key Adults 18-49 demographic, the series averaged a 1.7/7. The series ranked as the No. 1 new program across all syndication when it debuted off-net during the 2016-2017 season.  ‚ÄúLast Man Standing ended too soon and the outcry from the fans has been deafening,‚Äù said Gary Newman and Dana Walden, Chairmen and CEOs, Fox Television Group. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve wanted to put the show back together since its final taping a year ago, and Tim never gave up hope either. Thanks to its millions of devoted viewers and the irrepressible Tim Allen, we haven‚Äôt seen the last of Last Man Standing.‚Äù  Fox actually seriously considered rescuing Last Man Standing last May, following its surprise cancellation by ABC after six seasons. Fox brass tried to fit Last Man Standing into the schedule but couldn‚Äôt find a way to do it. Fox had been out of the multi-camera business for a while and didn‚Äôt have a multi-camera comedy to pair the now-canceled Last Man with. This development season, Fox put an emphasis on multi-camera comedies with several pilots, Rel, The Cool Kids, both of which were ordered to series, and the recently ordered untitled Rob McElhenney & Rob Rosell project, which also is set in middle America.  Last summer, there was one more attempt to find a home for Last Man Standing at CMT, which had had success with the sitcom‚Äôs reruns, though talks did not result in a deal.  Related2018 Fox Pilots  Efforts to resurrect Last Man Standing were reignited by the success of ABC‚Äôs Roseanne revival this spring. Besides a star of a popular 1990s ABC sitcom (Roseanne‚Äòs Roseanne Barr and Home Improvement‚Äòs Allen), the two shows also share leads who both are supporters of President Donald Trump and reflect views rarely seen in scripted TV series.  The cancellation of Last Man Standing was met with very strong reaction from fans last May. It became a rallying cry for conservatives, with a petition launched that called for ABC to bring back ‚Äúa show that appeals to a broad swath of Americans who find very few shows that extol the virtues with which they can identify; namely conservative values.‚Äù A year later, the petition has amassed 438,000 signatures and there is still enthusiasm among LMS fans about the show coming back, especially following Roseanne‚Äòs return."
"Jennifer Lawrence was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 15, 1990. She got her big break at 14, when she was discovered while vacationing in New York City with her family. She quickly landed a part in the TV series The Bill Engvall Show, followed by roles in films that included The Burning Plain, Winter‚Äôs Bone, X-Men: First Class and The Hunger Games. She later reprised her role playing Katniss Everdeen in Catching Fire and the two-part Mockingjay. Lawrence won an Academy Award for her work in David O. Russell 's Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and continued to work with the director on American Hustle and Joy, winning Golden Globes for all three projects as well.  Lawrence was an athletic child, involved in cheerleading, field hockey and softball, and thought she might be a doctor when she grew up. She did some modeling and community theater, but never dreamed that she‚Äôd become an actress.  Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky. She has two older brothers, Blaine and Ben, and her parents, Karen and Gary, owned a farm just outside the city.  Start of Acting Career  Lawrence‚Äôs big break came when she was discovered at 14 while on spring break in New York with her family. A stranger asked to take her picture and took her mother‚Äôs phone number, then called the next day to ask her to do a screen test. Things happened quickly after that: Lawrence stayed in New York City for the summer, acting in commercials for MTV and filming the 2007 thriller Devil You Know with Lena Olin. (The film was shelved due to lack of distribution and was eventually released in 2013.) Soon after, Lawrence and her family moved to Los Angeles, where she had small roles on the series Medium, Monk and Cold Case, before landing a part on the TBS series The Bill Engvall Show. While working on the series, she also appeared in feature films including The Poker House and The Burning Plain alongside Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger.  After The Bill Engvall Show was canceled, Lawrence went on to appear in the critically acclaimed Winter‚Äôs Bone in 2010, which earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Opportunities continued to pour in, and in 2011 Lawrence appeared in The Beaver with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and Anton Yelchin. She also took on the role of Mystique in X-Men: First Class.  In 2012, Lawrence became a box-office sensation as Katniss Everdeen, the lead in The Hunger Games, the film adaptation of the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic state, Lawrence's character must participate in an event in which 24 teens fight to the death as televised entertainment. The film broke box-office records on opening weekend, and Lawrence reprised her role in 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as well as the two-part Mockingjay (2014 and 2015). As of late 2015, the franchise has earned more than $2.8 billion dollars at the global box office.  'Silver Linings' Oscar  Other 2012 releases for Lawrence included the thriller House at the End of the Street, co-starring Elisabeth Shue, and two dramas with Bradley Cooper: The Falling and Silver Linings Playbook, which earned an array of award nominations and a Golden Globe win (best actress in a comedy or musical) for Lawrence. She took home the Oscar for best actress at the Academy Awards in February 2013. Lawrence seemed overcome with emotion as she accepted the honor.  Lawrence continued to work with Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell on 2013's American Hustle, playing the emotionally complex wife of a con artist (Christian Bale). The film co-starred Amy Adams and Cooper. Lawrence received her third Oscar nod for the part, and won her second Globe. In 2014 she co-starred again with Cooper in the little seen drama Serena before once again captivating moviegoers as the mutant Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  'Joy' and 'Mother'  Lawrence, Cooper and Russell later signed on to bring the story of Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano to the big screen, with Lawrence taking on the title role. Joy had a Christmas Day 2015 U.S. release, and Lawrence soon won her third Golden Globe for her performance. Days later she received another Oscar nod. At 25, she became the youngest performer in history to have earned four Academy Award nominations.  Continuing with her high-profile work, in 2016 Lawrence co-starred in X-Men: Apocalypse and the science-fiction film Passengers. The following year she made an impressive leap into the horror genre with the critically acclaimed Mother.  Jennifer Lawrence attends the 'Passengers' Paris Photocall at Hotel George V on November 29, 2016 in Paris, France. (Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)  The Wage Gap Essay  In October 2015 Lawrence wrote an essay, which was featured in Lena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny, entitled ""Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co‚ÄëStars?""  Discovering she was paid less than her American Hustle male co-stars via the Sony hacking scandal, Lawrence ultimately blamed herself for not negotiating for more pay.  ""When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d*cks, I didn‚Äôt get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn‚Äôt want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don‚Äôt need,"" she explains.  However, Lawrence admitted she didn't fight for a better salary because she was afraid of how she'd be perceived. ""I would be lying if I didn‚Äôt say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn‚Äôt want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,' "" she confessed. ""This is an element of my personality that I‚Äôve been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the only woman with this issue. Are we socially conditioned to behave this way? ... Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn‚Äôt 'offend' or 'scare' men?""  In her own fiery way, Lawrence concluded she would no longer tolerate inequitable pay for fear of being less liked. Her essay caused a great deal of buzz in the media about ongoing gender wage gap issues."

"It was a perfect summer date night for Ben Affleck.  At Malibu‚Äôs upscale Nobu restaurant August 16, the Justice League actor was rapt in conversation with his table mate: a bombshell blonde clad in a nude bodycon dress. Three days later, the lovebirds emerged once again at Santa Monica‚Äôs decidedly more-low key Jack in the Box drive-thru. With fries and a cheeseburger in hand, the all-smiles duo sped off in his Range Rover. According to a witness, ‚ÄúThey looked so happy together.‚Äù  Something was off, however. The passenger was not his love of more than a year, Lindsay Shookus ‚Äî but 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton.

She Claims, But He Calls BS  EXCLUSIVE  A woman who was hanging out with Drake after his split with Jennifer Lopez claims she's pregnant with his baby and she says she has text messages to prove it. Drake however, is calling BS.  Sophie Brussaux has already hired a big NYC lawyer, Raoul Felder, to get the paternity/child support ball rolling. She claims she's 3 1/2 months pregnant and pins down conception to either January 20 or 21. The pic was taken January 24 at a Japanese restaurant in Amsterdam.  The woman, a retired porn star, has what she says are text messages between her and Drake, which purport to say the following:  Drake: I want you to have an abortion.  Brussaux: I can't kill my baby simply to indulge you sorry.  Drake: Indulge me? F*** you.  Brussaux: What?  Drake: You do know what you're doing you think you're going to get money.  She says she's having a girl.  We reached out to Drake's people, who say, ""This woman has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships. We understand she may have problems getting into the United States. She's one of many women claiming he got them pregnant.""  The rep goes on, ""If it is in fact Drake's child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child.""  The rep says he has no idea whether the purported text message is even real or out of context because they haven't seen the actual text.  The rep says Brussaux had sex with another big rapper at the same time as Drake, adding the other rapper has all but acknowledged it's his kid.

"Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)  Rumors of a feud between Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey have existed in Internet lore for years. And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it‚Äôs the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.  So here‚Äôs how the whole thing went down.  The Beginnings  In the early ‚Äò00s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyonc√© ‚Äúnice‚Äù and ‚Äúa good writer‚Äù and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her,‚Äù Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.  If you‚Äôve not seen the GIF, you‚Äôve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.  The Aftermath  It is years later; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her‚Äù has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey‚Äôs mouth since ‚Äúall I want for Christmas is you.‚Äù It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.    ‚ÄúI know from back in the day, I‚Äôve read things that she‚Äôs said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,‚Äù Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. ‚ÄúLike, we don‚Äôt know each other. I think it‚Äôs kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I‚Äôm not really aware of.‚Äù    Then, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the ‚ÄúLambs.‚Äù  Recently? I don‚Äôt know. [yawns] I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm having a ‚Äúsleep‚Äù moment‚Ä¶    Well, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn‚Äôt trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody‚Äôs kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it ‚Äî and I‚Äôm going to leave you hanging as to what it was.  To recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was ‚Äújust being honest.‚Äù The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn‚Äôt really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.  Round Two  Talk of the feud picked up after last year‚Äôs Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey‚Äôs performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez‚Äôs visual response to Carey‚Äôs ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her‚Äù GIF.  Which Brings Us to This Week‚Ä¶  Jennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects ‚Äî Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. ‚Äî she‚Äôs currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.  ‚ÄúFirst of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it ‚Äî it was a long performance,‚Äú Lopez said, in what is not not shade. ‚ÄúI watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, ‚ÄòLook at her! Look at her!‚Äô‚Äù  Lopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey‚Äôs show didn‚Äôt start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.  ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù the talk show host joked of Carey. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm playing because that‚Äôs what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.‚Äù    ‚ÄúShe does say that,‚Äù Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs forgetful I guess.‚Äù"

"CLOSE Emma Stone stars as Billie Jean King and Steve Carell is Bobby Riggs in the 1970s-set sports film 'Battle of the Sexes.' Fox Searchlight  It took more than Hollywood magic to turn Emma Stone, the svelte actress from La La Land, into Billie Jean King in her new movie Battle of the Sexes.  For starters, the physical transformation required three months, 15 pounds and a meal and fitness plan.  Trainer Jason Walsh, founder of climbing gym Rise Nation, who got Stone in shape for La La Land, knew the actress would need to up her calorie intake and strength training regimen to embody the powerful tennis legend.  Here's what Stone went through to reshape her body.  For her role in 'Battle of the Sexes,' Emma Stone gained 15 pounds. (Photo: Melinda Sue Gordon, 20th Century Fox Film)  She wasn‚Äôt afraid of packing on pounds.  Stone is ‚Äúvery petite and has a dancer's body,‚Äù but she was willing to bulk up to look more like King. ‚ÄúShe took it seriously,"" Walsh says. ""She wanted to do the story justice.‚Äù  Gaining a dozen-plus pounds of muscle made Stone look more like a tennis pro, and also feel more like her character. ‚ÄúWe wanted to give Emma the psychological backing‚Äù to be able to compete in professional tennis matches, Walsh says. ‚ÄúShe needed to be resilient and to have the psyche of being really strong.‚Äù  Emma Stone, here with co-star Ryan Gosling, had a lithe look for 'La La Land.' (Photo: Dale Robinette)  She drank two high-cal protein shakes a day.  ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like we were taking someone off the Taco Bell diet,‚Äù Walsh says of his clean-eating client, ‚Äúbut we added shakes into her diet."" The shakes had ‚Äúhundreds of calories‚Äù each, he says, and usually contained a handful of spinach, a supplement known as ashwagandha and a ‚Äúgood tasting"" protein powder. Fortunately, since Stone was working out so much (twice a day), she was hungry enough to down the filling beverages.  Emma Stone getting her deadlift on. Ladies, DEADLIFT!!!! This lift will change your life. #Strongisthenewsexy #strong #motivated A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 21, 2015 at 7:54am PDT  She lifted an impressive amount of weight.  Some of Walsh‚Äôs daily go-to strength training exercises for Stone? Pushing and pulling sleds twice her size, heavy farmer‚Äôs walks (aka walking while holding dumbbells) and up to 300-pound hip thrusts. At one point, Stone was deadlifting 185 pounds and doing push-ups with 50 pounds of chains on her back.  ‚ÄúI was pretty proud,‚Äù Walsh says.  The ""Battle of the Sexes"" Working with Emma is pure hell...we loathe each other #battleofthesexes #emmastone A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 22, 2017 at 6:34pm PDT  Then she backed off.  While Stone was gaining weight, she stayed away from fat-burning cardio. But once she achieved the right look for the film, ‚Äúwe started adding conditioning aspects,‚Äù Walsh says. That meant Stone was lifting fewer weights and doing cardio at Rise Nation once or twice a week.  She's two years beyond her most intensive Battle of the Sexes training, but Walsh encourages the actress, and anyone else trying to stay in shape, to mix activities like yoga and hiking with strength training.  Yes, for women. And, yes, that means lifting weights.  ‚ÄúI train (GLOW star) Alison Brie and (future Captain Marvel) Brie Larson, and all of these girls are strong as hell and not big,‚Äù he says. In fact, after incorporating weight-lifting into their workout routine, ‚ÄúThey fit into their clothes better (and) are three, four, five times stronger than before.‚Äù  Want to see the results of Stone's hard work? Battle of the Sexes is in theaters now in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, San Francisco and Washington. It expands nationwide Friday.  Emma Stone, with co-star Steve Carrell, looked and felt very strong playing real-life tennis legend Billie Jean King.

"The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People's new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him‚Äîat church, the ice rink, and beyond. ‚ÄúHe loves her. He wants her back,‚Äù the source said, adding that Bieber ‚Äúmisses‚Äù Gomez.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Bieber and Gomez's last big public date was his father's wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.  But Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. ‚Äú[He] doesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself,"" the source told Us on March 12. ""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn‚Äôt need him.‚Äù  The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: ""Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,"" a source told E! on March 21. ""It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.""  Meanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. ""Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,"" a source told the outlet.  But Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.  Gomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus:  Instagram  Bieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies."

"The guest list hasn‚Äôt been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge.Asked about the potential guest list, Kensington Palace spokeswoman Julie Barley told Newsweek, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre focusing on the happy announcement of their engagement,‚Äù adding that invitations ‚Äúwill be announced in due course.‚ÄùMark Blinch/ReutersWhen the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were married, in 2011, the Obamas were left off the guest list because of the added security costs of protecting the president. The day of the wedding, thousands of Britons took the day off, and about 1,900 guests attended the ceremony in Westminster Abbey in central London. The Obamas traveled to the U.K. less than a month later for an official state visit. Since Obama is no longer president, he doesn‚Äôt require as extensive a security detail as he once did.If Trump were to appear at Prince Harry‚Äôs wedding in spring 2018, it would likely spark protests. When Prime Minister Theresa May offered Trump a state visit early this year, polls showed that 2 million people intended to take part in a protest against him. The risk of embarrassment, were such a protest to occur at a royal wedding, might put the couple off inviting such a controversial figure.Instead of a state visit, Trump‚Äôs trip to the U.K., scheduled for early 2018, has been cast as a ‚Äúworking trip‚Äù where he will not meet the queen.

"She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Actress and former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash will withdraw from her congressional race just one month after filing the necessary paperwork to run as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that her decision was partially based on fear she had for the safety of her family.  ""There were too many threats against her and her family. It was overwhelming,"" said one person close to her campaign.  Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.  In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to ""be masculine"" and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a ""tyranny by the minority.""  Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the ""new director"" of the Academy's ""minority outreach program.""  In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her ""goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.""  Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state's 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California's 43rd District.  ""After much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" Dash said in her statement. ""I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.""  She added that she knows her ""political positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable."""
"  Actor Terry Crews, right, with co-host Michael Strahan on ‚ÄúGood Morning America,‚Äù on Wednesday, Nov. 15, 2017. Crews told Strahan that he never felt ‚Äúmore objectified‚Äù than when a powerful Hollywood agent, Adam Venit, groped him at a party last year. (Paula Lobo/ABC via AP)  Actor Terry Crews has identified the Hollywood executive who allegedly groped him at an industry party in February 2016 as Adam Venit, the head of the motion picture department at a major talent agency in Beverly Hills.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs connected to probably everyone I know in the business,‚Äù Crews, 49, told ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù on Wednesday. ‚ÄúI did not know this man. I never had a conversation with him, ever.‚Äù  Crews, a former NFL player who currently stars as a police sergeant on the television show ‚ÄúBrooklyn Nine-Nine,‚Äù first spoke out about the alleged sexual assault on Twitter in mid-October, shortly after the New York Times published an explosive story about decades of sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein.  At least 20 high-profile men in Hollywood, the media and the political sphere have since faced allegations of sexually harassing or assaulting women and men.  On Wednesday, Crews told Good Morning America that the executive was Venit, an executive at William Morris Endeavor, which Crews said is ‚Äúone of the biggest agencies in the world ‚Äî period.‚Äù Venit has represented actors such as Emma Stone, Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler. Two of his clients, actors Dustin Hoffman and Brett Ratner, were also accused of sexual misconduct earlier this month.  Venit has been suspended from William Morris Endeavor, according to ABC News. The agency could not be immediately reached for comment.  On Oct. 10, Crews wrote a long thread on Twitter and said that the Weinstein news had given him PTSD, as he was groped by a ‚Äúhigh level Hollywood executive‚Äù during an event last year he attended with his wife.  This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME. (1/Cont.) ‚Äî terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017  My wife n I were at a Hollywood function last year n a high level Hollywood executive came over 2 me and groped my privates.

(16/end) ‚Äî terrycrews (@terrycrews) October 10, 2017  Crews was at the packed party last year with his wife, Rebecca King-Crews, when Venit began staring at him, making ‚Äúovertly sexual‚Äù moves with his tongue, he told ‚ÄúGood Morning America.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking like, ‚ÄòIs this a joke?‚Äô I mean I don‚Äôt understand, it was actually so bizarre,‚Äù Crews said. ‚ÄúHe comes over to me. I stick my hand out and he literally takes his hand and puts it and squeezes my genitals. And I jump back like, ‚ÄòHey! Hey!‚Äô‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs still licking his tongue out and all this stuff, and I go, ‚ÄòDude, what are you doing? What are you doing?‚Äô And then he comes back again! And he just won‚Äôt stop,‚Äù Crews said.  [After Weinstein, Hollywood launches anti-sexual-harassment hotline]  Crews said he then pushed Venit away from him, and Venit bumped into other partygoers. Venit then began laughing and giggling, Crews said.  ‚ÄúI have never felt more emasculated, more objectified,‚Äù Crews said. ‚ÄúI wake up every morning wondering, ‚ÄòDid this really happen?‚Äô ‚Äù  Crews said he was concerned about his wife during the incident, and positioned himself between her and Venit so that Venit wouldn‚Äôt approach her. Afterward, Crews said he was filled with rage, and felt like he ‚Äúcould punch a hole in his head.‚Äù When he and his wife got in the car to drive home, Crews said he ‚Äúalmost ripped the steering wheel off.‚Äù  Crews said his wife calmed him down, and was proud of him for not resorting to violence. As an African American man, Crews said, he is aware that, had he physically confronted Venit, he would ‚Äúimmediately be seen as a thug.‚Äù  Crews said he understands why many victims don‚Äôt come forward. They‚Äôre up against powerful people in Hollywood and fear people won‚Äôt believe their stories, and that their careers will suffer as a result, he said.  In the fallout of claims, which range from sexual misconduct to rape, some have resigned and others have been fired. Kevin Spacey in late October was accused of making sexual advances on a minor, and he has since been banished from the last season of the Netflix original series ‚ÄúHouse of Cards.‚Äù He has also been cut from the finished production of director Ridley Scott‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll the Money in the World,‚Äù replaced by actor Christopher Plummer. Such a last-minute recasting in a finished movie is unprecedented.  Earlier this month, the New York Times published five women‚Äôs allegations of sexual misconduct against comedian Louis C.K. Less than 24 hours later, the release of his new movie, ‚ÄúI Love You, Daddy,‚Äù was canceled. Netflix announced it would not produce the comedian‚Äôs planned comedy special. FX announced it would end its relationship with him, cutting its deal with him and removing him as the executive producer of four shows.  Crews himself said he put the incident in the back of his mind until the Weinstein allegations, which encouraged him to tweet in October about what happened. He filed a police report earlier this month.  ‚ÄúI will not be shamed. I will not be shamed. I did nothing wrong,‚Äù he told ‚ÄúGood Morning America.‚Äù  Read more:  George Takei, Richard Dreyfuss and Gary Goddard accused of sexual misconduct  ‚ÄòAll that anger‚Äôs unleashed‚Äô: How sexual misconduct stories persuade other victims to come forward"

"Luann de Lesseps has been sued by her ex-husband and two children.  The Real Housewives of New York City star‚Äôs first husband, Alexandre de Lesseps, her daughter, Victoria de Lesseps, and son, Noel de Lesseps, have filed a lawsuit against Luann, 53, over a judgement in her divorce that they allege she didn‚Äôt follow through on.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Luann breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust ‚Äúfor the benefit of her two children.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis action arises from Defendant‚Äôs breach of a Stipulation of Settlement and related Judgment of Divorce by her failure to create a trust for the benefit of her children, her conversion of the trust‚Äôs corpus and her present threat to abscond with money derived from the potential sale of the trust corpus and use it to purchase, for herself alone, a luxury home in upstate New York,‚Äù the documents read.  The judgment in her divorce required Alexandre to give the deed of the former couple‚Äôs marital residence in Bridgehampton, New York, to Luann, who agreed to create a trust for her two children. Luann was also required to ‚Äúfund the trust with an undivided one-half interest in and to the Marital Residence,‚Äù according to the documents.  Now, Alexandre, Victoria and Noel are claiming Luann ‚Äúnever created‚Äù the trust and instead sold the residence in November 2014 for $8 million and used the earnings to purchase a home in Southampton, New York for $3.1 million.  According to the settlement, if the marital home was sold, ‚Äúthe entire net proceeds of the sale may at any time prior to the termination of the Trust, be reinvested by [Luann] to purchase another residence, provided that the children shall continue to be the owners, in Trust, of an undivided one-half interest in said property.‚Äù  But the documents allege that Luann ‚Äúhas never, since her purchase of the Premises, created the Trust or conveyed to her children, in Trust, an undivided one-half interest in the Premises.‚Äù  According to the documents, Luann has threatened to sell her home ‚Äúfor more than fifty percent its present value and leave Suffolk County with the proceeds ‚Ä¶ so that she may purchase, for herself alone, a luxury home in upstate New York.‚Äù  Alexandre, Victoria and Noel are seeking for Luann to abide by the judgment and to prevent her from listing or selling the home.

"Updated | A new book by Donna Brazile, the former interim chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), has been making headlines for its controversial claims about the 2016 presidential election and the Hillary Clinton campaign. But the provocative points start even before the first chapter, as Brazile reportedly dedicated the book in part to Seth Rich, the DNC staffer whose murder launched a conspiracy theory.Axios reported on Sunday that the book's dedication reads, ‚ÄúIn loving memory of my father, Lionel Brazile Sr.; my beloved sister, Sheila Brazile; my fearless uncles Nat, Floyd, and Douglas; Harlem‚Äôs finest, my aunt Lucille; my friend and mentor, David Kaufmann; my DNC colleague and patriot, Seth Rich; and my beloved Pomeranian, Chip Joshua Marvin Brazile (Booty Wipes). I miss y‚Äôall.‚ÄùRelated: TV Ad With Russian Subtitles Questions Seth Rich‚Äôs MurderRich, 27, was fatally shot in July 2016 while walking home late at night in Washington, D.C. The police believe the shooting was a robbery gone wrong. But Rich worked for the DNC, and WikiLeaks published thousands of emails from the committee two weeks after his death. That timeline provoked theories that Rich had given the materials to WikiLeaks and that his death was an attempt to stop him from doing so, or to punish him for it.Media reports had characterized Rich as a low-level staffer, and his parents wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post in May, ‚ÄúThose who have suggested that Seth‚Äôs role as a data analyst at the DNC gave him access to a wide trove of emails are simply incorrect.‚ÄùSAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyRich appears elsewhere in Brazile‚Äôs book, as the Post reported earlier in the weekend. She wrote that Rich‚Äôs murder haunted her and that she'd installed surveillance cameras at her home and would keep the blinds in her office window closed so she could not be seen by snipers, according to the Post.Keep up with this story and more by subscribing nowBrazile talked about Rich on ABC News‚Äôs This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. She told the host about her critics: ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know what it was like to be over the DNC during this hacking. They don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like to bury a child. I did: Seth Rich.‚ÄùBrazile had spoken publicly about Rich‚Äôs death before. In March, she said she was going to an Omaha, Nebraska, synagogue to speak about him. In May, she tweeted, ‚ÄúSeth Rich was a hard worker and proud to be an American. This desire to scar Seth‚Äôs legacy to his country and party is shameful.‚Äù About two months later, after Fox News published a since debunked story about the case, she tweeted, ‚ÄúSeth was a good soul and look at this shameful act.‚ÄùThrough spokesman Brad Bauman, the Rich family said in a statement, ‚ÄúSince Seth was murdered, Donna Brazile has been a great friend to the Rich family and has been extremely supportive of the family‚Äôs efforts to find Seth‚Äôs killers.‚ÄùIn the book, out Tuesday, Brazile also writes that she weighed the possibility of replacing Clinton as the Democratic presidential nominee with former Vice President Joe Biden, according to the Post. She also reportedly wrote that Clinton‚Äôs campaign headquarters seemed ‚Äúantiseptic, like a hospital,‚Äù and that she felt as though the Clinton campaign was treating her like a ‚Äúslave.‚Äù In an excerpt that Politico published on November 2, she wrote about how the Clinton campaign worked out a fundraising agreement with the DNC and exercised control over the party long before Clinton became the nominee.Former aides to the Clinton campaign have challenged Brazile‚Äôs claims. In a November 4 open letter, more than 100 former top aides wrote, ‚ÄúIt is particularly troubling and puzzling that she would seemingly buy into false Russian-fueled propaganda, spread by both the Russians and our opponent, about our candidate‚Äôs health.‚ÄùBrazile was not available for comment through her publisher, Hachette Book Group, or through Georgetown University, where she is a faculty member. The publisher was unavailable to verify the reported wording of the book dedication.This article has been updated to alter the spelling of the last name of Sheila Brazile, which was misspelled as Brazioutlanle by another media outlet."
"Worse for wear. Brad Pitt is reeling over the end of his two-year marriage (and 14-year relationship) with Angelina Jolie, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly. According to the insider, the Fight Club hunk‚Äôs impending divorce from the Oscar-winning actress, 41, has been a tough pill to swallow.  ‚ÄúHe is beside himself and has been crying. He was completely caught off guard and blindsided and had no idea she would do this,‚Äù the source tells Us of Pitt‚Äôs fragile emotional state after Jolie filed divorce documents on Monday, September 19.  ‚ÄúAngelina filed the court papers a minute before the courts closed on Monday night,‚Äù the insider explains of the Maleficent star‚Äôs tactful filing. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt have a lawyer or anything. She had threatened divorce in the past but he did not think she would file this time.‚Äù  The source adds: ‚ÄúHe is completely devastated and beside himself. He is a shattered man.""  ""He‚Äôs extremely upset,"" another source tells Us. ""But he is totally focused on just being helpful and making sure his kids are doing as well as possible.""  As previously reported, Jolie cited irreconcilable differences in her divorce docs. The humanitarian and actress is requesting sole physical custody of their six kids, Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8. The divorce filings indicate that she requested Pitt receive joint legal custody. She is not asking for spousal support.  A third insider previously told Us that Jolie‚Äôs decision to part ways with the World War Z actor ‚Äúwas only made one week ago.‚Äù  Days after the shocking news of Brangelina‚Äôs demise broke, it was reported that Pitt, 52, was being investigated for child abuse by the FBI following an incident (caught on tape, an insider told Us) that occurred on the former couple‚Äôs private plane.  According to multiple insiders, the dad of six can be seen on video ‚Äúlooking drunk‚Äù and ‚Äúyelling.‚Äù The footage is reportedly from Wednesday, September 14, after the family‚Äôs jet stopped for fuel at Minnesota‚Äôs International Falls Airport during their flight from Nice, France, to Burbank, California.  ‚ÄúIn response to your inquiry regarding allegations within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; specifically, an aircraft carrying Mr. Brad Pitt and his children, the FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,"" the FBI told Us in a statement on Thursday. (The FBI has jurisdiction over the situation because the alleged incident happened in the air.)  Earlier this week, a source told Us that some of Jolie and Pitt‚Äôs most contentious fights leading up to their breakup stemmed from their disagreement over opposing parenting styles, among other factors. ‚Äú[Jolie] did try to make it work, but her kids come first, and she couldn't let them see Mommy and Daddy like this,‚Äù the source explained.

"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate‚Äôs turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate‚Äôs parents‚Äô hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate‚Äôs mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family‚Äôs home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons‚Äô traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the ‚ÄúFab Four,‚Äù will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a ‚Äúmole hunt‚Äù to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don‚Äôt get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry‚Äôs relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

"Baby on the way! Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm.

The 52-year-old singer/actress graces the cover of the magazine's July/August issue which is devoted to happiness. In addition to talking about the joy that her 1-year-old son Eissa Al Mana brings, Jackson writes of the darker times as well.  ‚ÄúWhen it comes to happiness, I‚Äôm no expert,‚Äù she writes in the letter. ‚ÄúI have only my life experience as a guide. I‚Äôve known great happiness and great sadness.""  Jackson's 30s were far from perfect, plagued with mental health issues.  ‚ÄúI struggled with depression. The struggle was intense,"" she writes. ""Low self-esteem might be rooted in childhood feelings of inferiority. It could relate to failing to meet impossibly high standards.

Even amid a contentious split from Eissa's father, Wissam Al Mana. Early this month, law enforcement performed a welfare check on the child in Al Mana's custody, at Jackson's request. Public Information Officer Deputy Tracy Koerner told USA TODAY no arrests were made.  Jackson's brother Randy previously alleged his sister was verbally abused by Al Mana, a charge lawyers for Al Mana called ""deeply hurtful"" in a statement to People magazine.  But on balance, it seems Jackson has found contentment.  ""The height of happiness is holding my baby son in my arms and hearing him coo, or when I look into his smiling eyes and watch him respond to my tenderness,"" she says in her letter.

"Ever since Donald Trump, a former reality television star, was elected the President of the United States, we‚Äôve regularly wondered if other celebrities are going to run for the same position in the 2020 election. In the last few months, we‚Äôve heard rumors that Oprah Winfrey, Kanye West, Duane ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson, and Katy Perry are going to run ‚Äî and that‚Äôs just naming a few. There‚Äôs also George Clooney, whose recent donation has some people wondering: George Clooney for president?  The topic was first broached back in the beginning of September 2017, when Clooney was doing press for his movie Suburbicon. A reporter asked if he‚Äôd like to run for president one day, and Clooney said,  ""Would I like to be the next president? Oh, that sounds like fun. Can I just say that I'd like anybody to be the next president of the United States. Right away, please.""  Nothing but respect for my President and George Clooney. https://t.co/x0aCjAI2RW ‚Äî J. (@JojoCule) February 20, 2018  Now, Clooney‚Äôs latest actions have fans wondering if he might actually run for office. Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, pledged $500,000 to help fund the U.S. student-run march on Washington. Called the ‚ÄúMarch for Our Lives,‚Äù it‚Äôs taking place on March 24th, along with sister rallies across the country. The march is a response to the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that took the lives of 17 people, and it‚Äôs a way for the students who survived to take some serious action to demand gun control reform.  George Clooney will March For Our Lives ... pic.twitter.com/HlA8U2K4xW ‚Äî Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) February 20, 2018  Shortly after the Clooneys made their donation, rumors hit the news circuit.  Fox News host and Donald Trump supporter Sean Hannity expressed his support, saying, ‚ÄúMy attitude is, ‚ÄòRun, George, run.‚Äô If George Clooney wants to run, I‚Äôm all for it. I think Oprah Winfrey would be infinitely better as a candidate than George Clooney.‚Äù  Hannity‚Äôs comments are sarcastic. What he‚Äôs trying to say is that he doesn‚Äôt think Clooney has a chance at winning, which is why he would want him to run ‚Äî so that Trump could win again.  George Clooney for President.

Most likely not. His original comment about running was a joke, and when fans ran with it, Clooney cleared up any confusion in an interview with Variety, during which he said he doesn‚Äôt think celebrities should hold the position. He stated,  "" I think that having a celebrity as president who has a star on Hollywood Boulevard will exorcise our need to have someone famous in office. And maybe we‚Äôll find someone who knows how to make policy.""  So, we probably won‚Äôt be calling him President George Clooney any time soon. But hey, one can dream, right?"
"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine‚Äôs Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We‚Äôre in Stanley‚Äôs on St Andrew‚Äôs Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It‚Äôs an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go out, but not to our usual place‚Äù. I‚Äôve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don‚Äôt come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley‚Äôs. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn‚Äôt earn a second chance, nothing will. So we‚Äôre tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There‚Äôs a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we‚Äôre not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we‚Äôll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley‚Äôs is Morgan Vanderkamer. She‚Äôs the sommelier here. But don‚Äôt let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We‚Äôre going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a ‚Ç¨16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at ‚Ç¨13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There‚Äôs a small farmyard on that ‚Ç¨16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the ‚Äúbacon and cabbage‚Äù, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn‚Äôt enough on the plate (there is), we‚Äôve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas ‚Äì but that‚Äôs even better in my book ‚Äì and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It‚Äôs the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There‚Äôs a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that‚Äôs served deliciously chilly. It‚Äôs a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we‚Äôll leave space for some cheese to go with it.  Romantic is a bleached-out word, but that‚Äôs what Stanley‚Äôs wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.  Dinner for two, with sherries and wine, came to ‚Ç¨84.75."

"Gabrielle Union is the newest victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time ‚Äî still, she's not taking any blame for somehow getting sucked into Hollywood's latest scandal.  Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then-pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) ‚Äî first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter.  In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room 's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it.  ""Don't know her. Didn't see her,"" Union wrote. ""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""  Though it was reported that Kardashian was devastated upon hearing the news that Thompson may have been unfaithful, she has since been consumed by happiness upon the birth of her daughter , and People reports she is in the process of mending fences with her child's father.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs basically already forgiven him,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúShe is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about ‚Äòcheating‚Äô and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn‚Äôt lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.‚Äù"

"It was just announced that Ben Stiller has split from his wife of 17 years, Christine Taylor.  And new pictures show the 51-year-old enjoying a pizza in Italy this week.  The actor posed for pictures at Gino Sorbillo's popular pizzeria in Naples.  Split slice: Ben Stiller got to enjoy pizza on a trip to Italy shortly before announcing his split from wife of 17 years Christine Taylor  He also stopped by a local art gallery, buying a terracotta statue of a clown, E! News reported..  Stiller had arrived there from Cannes, France, where he had attended the premiere of his latest movie, The Meyerowitz Stories: New and Selected.  On Friday the couple announced the shock news of their split in a joint statement.  'With tremendous love and respect for each other, and the 18 years we spent together as a couple, we have made the decision to separate,' Stiller and Taylor told ET.  The actor also enjoyed a visit to the Galleria Borbonica in Naples  It's over: On Friday the couple announced the shock news of their split in a joint statement (pictured at the Met Gala in May 2016)  'Our priority will continue to be raising our children as devoted parents and the closest of friends. We kindly ask that the media respect our privacy at this time.'  Ben, 51 and Christine, 45, first met on the set of Fox TV pilot Heat Vision and Jack in 1999.  They married in 2000 at an oceanfront ceremony in Kauai, Hawaii and share two children, daughter Ella Olivia, 15 and son Quinlin Dempsey, 12.  'When I met her, I pretty much thought, ""That's the person,""' Ben told ET in a 2007 interview. 'It was like, ""Wow, this is a great person. I love her.""'  Over the years the couple starred in several comedies together, including Zoolander, Zoolander 2, Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, Tropic Thunder and Arrested Development.  On the promo trail: The 51-year-old actor was pictured in Cannes last week with Adam Sandler for the premiere of The Meyerowitz Stories  Family affair: The last time the duo posed on the red carpet together was April 17 with daughter Ella at the Broadway opening night of Groundhog Day  In October last year, Ben revealed he had privately endured a secret health battle after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2014.  The Zoolander actor admitted he was taken aback when doctors detected the life-threatening disease because it came 'out of the blue'.  Speaking on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show in October, he said: 'It came out of the blue for me. I had no idea.  'At first, I didn't know what was going to happen. I was scared. It just stopped everything in your life because you can't plan for a movie because you don't know what's going to happen.  'As I learned more about my disease (one of the key learnings is not to Google 'people who died of prostate cancer' immediately after being diagnosed with prostate cancer), I was able to wrap my head around the fact that I was incredibly fortunate,' he wrote in a blog post.  They married in 2000 and share two children, daughter Ella Olivia, 15 and son Quinlin Dempsey, 12  Comedy duo: Over the years the couple starred in several comedies together, including 2004's Dodgeball (pictured)  'Fortunate because my cancer was detected early enough to treat. And also because my internist gave me a test he didn't have to.'  In February 2016 the couple opened up about how working together affected their marriage while promoting Zoolander 2, which Christine also stars in.  'It's the best. I mean, I think that, you know, the reality is there's such an unspoken connection,' Christine explained.  'I feel like for us, when we first met, it was on set... He's amazing.'  Working together: The duo are seen on the set of Zoolander in 2000  '[Having a] sense of humor [is the secret to our marriage],' she added, 'I have to say, sense of humor is the greatest thing.'  Ben agreed, adding 'I say that's the secret to a happy marriage anywhere in any city, not just Hollywood,  'I think you got to laugh, because after a while, you know, life is life. We all have to deal with what life throws at us, so you got to have a sense of humor about it. If you can share that, at the end, it makes a huge difference.'"

Many women swear by spritzing their face with these types of products for a variety of reasons. Depending on which one you use, a facial mist, setting spray, or primer spray can help to perk up tired-looking skin, set your makeup, prep your skin for face makeup, or provide an additional boost of hydration‚Äîwhich can be particularly helpful if you have dry skin. But generally, all skin types can reap the benefits of a facial mist or setting spray. Ready to add one to your beauty routine? Keep reading to find out more about what they can do!  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACE SPRAYS AND MISTS?  Wondering what exactly the difference is between all of the types of face sprays we‚Äôve mentioned already? Facial mists are generally designed to help provide skin with a little boost of hydration, giving you an instantly refreshed feeling. Toss one in your purse or leave one at your desk‚Äîrefreshing facial mists are about to become your skin‚Äôs new BFF! Setting sprays are typically used to help makeup last longer and pull your look together. Sick of your makeup always sliding off halfway through the day? It‚Äôs time to invest in a setting spray! Primer sprays are similar in that they can extend the life of your makeup, but they‚Äôre meant to be used in place of a regular old makeup primer. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to speed up your routine, a primer spray could be the way to go!  Now you have an idea of what each type of spray does, but if you aren‚Äôt sure which deserves a spot in your routine, keep reading! We‚Äôre breaking down when to reach for each one, plus, how to use them.  ADD A FACIAL MIST TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF‚Ä¶  A facial mist is the perfect addition to your daily routine when you need a midday pick-me-up! In movies, you often see people splashing water on their faces to help jolt them awake. But that doesn‚Äôt sound too enjoyable, now does it? Instead, reach for a mist with a refreshing formula and spritz it on anytime you need a wakeup call throughout the day.  Even if you‚Äôre feeling totally fresh-faced and well-rested, a facial mist can also come in handy when your skin is feeling a little dry. A quick misting can give dry skin the extra boost it needs. This is particularly helpful during those cold, winter months when skin tends to get dull.  HOW TO USE A FACIAL MIST  We promise: It‚Äôs so easy! Just spray your facial mist onto clean skin morning and night before applying moisturizer and as needed during the day (typically, facial mists shouldn‚Äôt interfere with your makeup). That‚Äôs it!  ADD A SETTING SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF‚Ä¶  When you want to rock a ‚Äújust applied‚Äù makeup look all day and night, a setting spray is the way to go! When your contour and your smoky eye are on point, we understand that you‚Äôll try just about anything to maintain your look from desk to drinks. Instead of constantly reapplying or worrying about any makeup faux pas, make locking in your look with a setting spray as the last step in your makeup routine. A setting spray will increase your makeup‚Äôs lifespan‚Äîwhich means you can dance the night away without the fear of sweating your foundation off.  A setting spray can also come through in the clutch if you have oily skin. If you do have oily skin, chances are you‚Äôre layering on powder makeup to help your makeup stay put throughout the day. A setting spray can help soften the look of all the products you‚Äôve previously applied‚Äîgiving you the seamless look you‚Äôre after! Trust us, if you love powder makeup and layering your look, be sure to complete your beauty routine with a spritz of setting spray.  HOW TO USE A SETTING SPRAY  Once you‚Äôre done applying all of your makeup‚Äîfoundation, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, you name it‚Äîlightly mist your face with a setting spray to help lock everything in place. You can also use one midday to help refresh your makeup and keep your look lasting even longer.  ADD A PRIMER SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF‚Ä¶  Primer sprays are another type of facial spray worthy of adding to your beauty regimen‚Äîand they‚Äôve been getting more attention as of late. A primer spray is ideal for those with oily skin. It preps your skin for your makeup application, allowing it to last longer and go on smoother! It‚Äôs also a must if you have a big occasion coming up (cough, cough‚Äîthe holidays) where your makeup fading throughout the night is simply not an option.  HOW TO USE A PRIMER SPRAY  Using a primer spray is as easy as saying your ABC‚Äôs and counting to 1, 2, 3! Simply spritz it onto bare skin before applying your makeup‚Äîafter going through your full skin care routine‚Äîand you‚Äôre good to go!

"CLOSE Bill O‚ÄôReilly is mad at a lot of people, including God. Nathan Rousseau Smith (@FantasticMrNate) reports. Buzz60  Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. (Photo: Andy Kropa, AP)  Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly is angrily denying a report that he paid one woman $32 million to settle sexual harassment allegations, blaming a conspiracy to drive him from ""the marketplace"" and even raging against the Almighty.  ""You know, am I mad at God? Yeah, I'm mad at him,"" O'Reilly said Monday in a post on his website. ""I wish I had more protection. I wish this stuff didn't happen. I can't explain it to you. If I die tomorrow and I get an opportunity, I'll say 'why'd you guys work me over like that? Didn't know my children were going to be punished? And they're innocent.'""  The New York Times reported Saturday that O'Reilly paid $32 million to Lis Wiehl, a Fox News legal analyst who made regular appearances on O'Reilly's show for 15 years, in a settlement related to sexual harassment allegations. Wiehl accused O'Reilly of ""repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to her,"" the Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter.  On his website, O'Reilly denounced the report as a ""smear piece"" and said ""these people at the New York Times are out to hurt people with whom they disagree. They don't want me in the marketplace. That's what this is all about.""  More: Bill O'Reilly dismisses NYT report as 'lies and smears'  More: Megyn Kelly complained to Fox execs about Bill O'Reilly's sexual harassment stand  In April, the Times reported on five other settlements involving O'Reilly and women accusing him of sexual harassment. The revelation led to Fox News' decision to part ways with its star commentator.  On Monday, O'Reilly said that in more than 20 years he only ""resolved three situations"" and that he did it ""to protect my children from harm.""  O'Reilly has repeatedly said the potential impact on his children is a major reason for his outrage over the Times report.  ""The pain it brings to my children is indescribable,"" O'Reilly told the Times when it interviewed him about the reported $32 million settlement. ""I would give up my life to protect my children, but I find myself unable to protect them because of things that are being said about me, their father.""  ""This is horrible what I went through, horrible what my family went through,"" he continued. O'Reilly said the report was ""politically and financially motivated"" and that he could ""prove it with shocking information but I'm not going to sit here in a courtroom for a year and a half and let my kids get beaten up every single day of their lives by a tabloid press.""  O'Reilly invoked the memory of his former Fox News colleague Eric Bolling's son, 19-year-old Eric Chase Bolling, who was found dead in an apartment while away at college. Fox News had just parted ways with Bolling amid sexual harassment allegations when his son died and O'Reilly seemed to say that was behind the teen's death.  ""I urge you to think about what you put in your newspaper,"" O'Reilly told the Times reporters. ""Eric Bolling's son is dead. Is dead, because of allegations made, in my opinion ‚Äî and I know this to be true ‚Äî against Mr. Bolling.""  Separately, Bolling said in a statement that O'Reilly's comment was ""beyond inappropriate"" and that his ""parting from Fox News was in no way connected to the tragic news of my son's passing.""  O'Reilly apologized to Bolling in a tweet. ""The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more,"" O'Reilly tweeted.  Apologies to Eric Bolling and prayers for him and his family. The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more. ‚Äî Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017  ""Thank Bill, apology accepted,"" Bolling tweeted back.  O'Reilly, on his website, said the Times doesn't care about children and is willing to run a story based on anonymous sources even though ""families are devastated.""  ""So and so said, so and so told me,"" O'Reilly said of the use of unnamed sources. ""That's what they do to Trump every day and that's why Trump is furious. That's why the President of the United States calls out The New York Times by name. But the culture war is that intense.""  ""Bottom line on this is that my enemies who want to silence me have made my life extremely difficult,"" he said.

"Younes Bendjima raised eyebrows after he posted and quickly deleted a snarky comment on a racy Instagram from his girlfriend.  And it seems like Kourtney Kardashian is none too pleased with her younger beau's jealousy.  The 39-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is said to be 'frustrated' with her 25-year-old boyfriend airing out his grievances in a public forum it was reported by E! News on Wednesday.

She isn't going to stop doing what she's doing and feels like he needs to understand and deal with it.'  As the former amateur boxer makes his living scantily-clad in front of the camera it is interesting to note that he would feel this way.

'He wants her for himself and doesn't want to share her with the world.'

The source explained: 'Kourtney has explained its part of her job and it's not going to change. But it still makes him uncomfortable and upset.

"ABC will tie Michael Strahan even more closely to its ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù franchise when it pairs the popular host with Sara Haines in a third hour of the program slated to air in early afternoon on the network starting September 10.  A person familiar with the program confirmed details about its hosts and disclosed the show‚Äôs start date. ABC News, which produces the program, declined to make executives available for comment.  Launch of the show will extend the presence of ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù to the network‚Äôs daytme schedule from its early-morning grid, and allow ABC to create bigger packages for advertisers, as NBC does with four hours of ‚ÄúToday.‚Äù The idea should also boost affiliates, as ABC can promote the extension during the main ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù broadcast that airs between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m.  The new hour is expected to be taped, not presented live, and run at 1 p.m. on weekdays. One scenario that has been discussed for the new hour would involve making use of the live, in-studio audience assembled each morning for the 8 a.m. hour of the flagship show. ABC said earlier this year it would replace ‚ÄúThe Chew‚Äù with the new ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù hour.  Related 'The Chew' Canceled on ABC Abby Huntsman Joins 'The View' as Co-Host  ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù enjoyed an afternoon presence in the not-too-distant past. Josh Elliott and Lara Spencer co-anchored a short run of ‚ÄúGood Afternoon America‚Äù between July and September of 2012 in a separate bid to test expansion of the franchise.  ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù makes its leap as its battle for viewers with main rival‚ÄúToday‚Äù remains intense. ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù remains TV‚Äôs most-watched morning program, but ‚ÄúToday, co-anchored by Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie, typically wins more viewers between 25 and 54, the demographic most favored by advertisers. Season to date as of July 13, ‚ÄúToday‚Äù has lured 151,000 more viewers between 25 and 54 than its primary competitor, while ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù has notched 63,000 more viewers than ‚ÄúToday‚Äù overall.  The expansion to afternoons comes as ABC is also working to expand the digital presence for the show. In April, ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù launched a morning newsletter and unveiled a revamped ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù website that was not tied to ABC News‚Äô content deal with Yahoo. At the time, Michael Corn, ‚ÄúGMA‚Äô senior executive producer, noted that producers often gathered together more information and material than the 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. program could handle. ‚ÄúWe have so much content and a two-hour program isn‚Äôt even enough for the amount of stories we have to tell, and the amount of information we have,‚Äù he toldVariety.  Haines will leave ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù to participate in the new program, marking the second departure of an ABC News correspondent from the program in recent days. ABC News announced earlier this week that Faris would leave her position at the show to do focus on reporting bigger stories. That narrows ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù table down to four hosts: Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin and Meghan McCain. Details about the hosts for the third ‚ÄúGMA‚Äù hour were reported previously by Page Six."

"THE joke was a quick one. It showed Family Guy‚Äôs infant Stewie running naked screaming, ‚ÄúHelp! I‚Äôve escaped from Kevin Spacey‚Äôs basement!‚Äù  But that 2005 animated clip went viral when Spacey was accused of assaulting several young men in a November 2017 bombshell that lost the 58-year-old actor his House Of Cards gig and led him to ‚Äúseek evaluation and treatment‚Äù.  Family Guy creator, and star, Seth MacFarlane said on Thursday at the Television Critics Association‚Äôs Winter Press Tour he wasn‚Äôt the one who pitched the controversial joke that made its way into the years-old episode and left many fans wondering what MacFarlane knew about Spacey ahead of the public revelations.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember who pitched the joke,‚Äù he told reporters on Thursday. ‚ÄúI remember when it was pitched that was a rumour that I had actually not heard, and other writers in the writers‚Äô room had. It had to be explained to me.‚Äù  Showrunner Alec Sulkin said he too wasn‚Äôt the one who came up with it, but he remembered a bit more about its genesis. He said the timing of the quip came because Spacey initially said he had been attacked by a young person in London one night in 2004. Later, he changed his story and said he tripped over his dog after the young person mugged him.  ‚ÄúI think he had sort of been beaten up in a London park and he claimed he was walking his dog and fell and I think that sort of raised a lot of eyebrows,‚Äù Sulkin recalled.  MacFarlane insisted the show doesn‚Äôt have a sixth sense running the writers‚Äô room.  ‚ÄúThe idea that Family Guy is this cartoon Ouija board that predicts things ‚Ä¶ I was just watching things happen from afar,‚Äù he told the room full of journalists on Thursday. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs sort of modern media. The idea that it‚Äôs more important to be first than to be right. It‚Äôs a strange thing to observe. We write our show the same way as everyone else. We make the same kind of topical jokes that The Simpsons does, [that] South Park does. And you work with what you have whether that be swirling rumours or political [material].‚Äù  The show previously made headlines for a 2009 quip in which Stewie called then Bruce Jenner ‚Äúan elegant, beautiful Dutch woman‚Äù. In 2015, the former Olympian opened up about being transgender and began using the name Caitlyn Jenner.  ‚ÄúThe myth that Family Guy is this Kreskin-like prognosticator of this kind of stuff is a little bit sensationalised,‚Äù MacFarlane insisted.  The show is currently celebrating its upcoming 300th episode.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that anyone ever really expected this show to go this long,‚Äù he added.  He said the show has evolved ‚Äúwith the times‚Äù which has enabled it to succeed.  This story originally appeared on Fox News and is republished here with permission."
"The wait for Swifties is finally over.  After much, much speculation, Taylor Swift finally announced her sixth studio album, ‚ÄúReputation,‚Äù on Wednesday. The album will be released on Nov. 10, with its first single dropping on Thursday night.  Swift posted the cover art for ‚ÄúReputation‚Äù on her social media accounts.  Multiple sources told Variety that new music was coming this week, although Swift was expected to make the announcement on Friday.  The popstar had kept fans on their toes since last week. Last Friday, the third anniversary of the day she announced her first pop album ‚Äî ‚Äú1989‚Äù ‚Äî and unveiled its debut single ‚Äî ‚ÄúShake It Off‚Äù ‚Äî she deleted every post on her Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram accounts. This past Monday, she shared a cryptic 10-second video of a reptilian tail on social media.  Also significant: the MTV Video Music Awards are this Sunday. It‚Äôs been rumored that Swift will also release a video for the new song at the ceremony.  It‚Äôs been three years since Swift debuted the mega-selling ‚Äú1989,‚Äù marking the longest break between albums since she debuted her first in 2006. She typically releases a new album every two years. Swift most recently collaborated with Zayn Malik on ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Wanna Live Forever‚Äù for the ‚ÄúFifty Shades Darker‚Äù soundtrack this year. She‚Äôs kept an unusually low profile over the past few months, posting sporadically on social media and making few public appearances."
"Karrueche Tran Judge Grants 5 Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  Karrueche Tran Granted Five Year Restraining Order Against Chris Brown  EXCLUSIVE  12:01 PM PT -- The judge just sided with Tran ... ordering the restraining order stay in place for the next 5 years. Chris Brown threatened violence against his ex-GF after they broke up, demanding she give back money and gifts he had given her during their relationship ... this according to Karrueche Tran's in-person testimony in court.  Karrueche took the stand Thursday in her restraining order case against Chris, telling a judge after she broke up with the singer ... he demanded diamond rings he bought for her to be returned. When she refused ... Karrueche says Chris became aggressive.  Karrueche explained that in text messages between herself and Chris post-breakup, he would say things like ""I'm not being nice to you no more, if I see you out in public again and I'm there I will make you hate me even more, don't be anywhere I'm out in public, I'm going to ban you from all events.""  She claims he also texted her more violent threats like ... ""I can get my money back and I'm tired of playing games"" as well as ""Bitch I will beat the s**t out of you"" and ""I promise you I will make your life hell."" She says he also once wrote ""Imma kill blood"" under a photo of her and actor Michael B. Jordan.  Karrueche also testified that Chris had beaten her before.  Chris Brown's attorney, David Gammill, grilled Karrueche on cross-examination, and pressed her on allegedly taunting Chris about the rings by saying she had sold them. Karrueche told Gammill she never planned to return the rings because they were hers. Gammill also brought up the point of Karrueche never reporting any of the alleged behavior to authorities.  Karrueche insists she fears for her safety and needs permanent protection. Chris wasn't in court today and the judge refused to let him join the hearing via phone."

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation ‚Äî sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) ‚Äî to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.""When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said. ""It's time for it to be increased again."""

"  Oprah Winfrey takes part in a town hall meeting with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams in Marietta, Georgia, Nov. 1. (Chris Aluka Berry/Reuters)  Contributing opinion writer  A political mentor had a saying when he looked at a good political commercial: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs votes in that spot.‚Äù That phrase came back to me yesterday when I saw Oprah Winfrey say, ‚ÄúThis land was made for you and me.‚Äù The phrase makes a powerful rallying cry for a lot of Democrats in 2018 and beyond, and the reigning queen of all media rolled out this line while stumping for Stacey Abrams in the race for governor in Georgia.  While Winfrey has denied interest in running for office herself, the rumor that she will lingers. The rumor itself isn‚Äôt all that interesting. But listening to her yesterday, I thought her candidacy for president would be fascinating.  The Democrats have a number of high-profile candidates who have been mentioned to take on the Republicans‚Äô reality-show star in 2020, many of whom rose outside of politics. In addition to Winfrey, there is Howard Schultz of Starbucks, actor Tom Hanks, former New York City mayor and multibillionaire Michael Bloomberg and Disney‚Äôs Bob Iger.  Trump, of course, knows Winfrey well, having appeared on her show. And he‚Äôs had nice things to say about her in the past. He undoubtedly still envies her mastery of branding and media as she built an empire after starting as a local newscaster in Nashville. Lately, he hasn‚Äôt been as kind, calling her ‚Äúinsecure‚Äù and saying he would love to run against her because (cue innuendo) he knows her ‚Äúweakness.‚Äù  But Trump presumably knows her strengths, too. She has spent a lifetime interviewing people and understands how to give meaning to the struggles and aspirations of a wide cross section of Americans. If Trump is our national storyteller for fear and loathing, Winfrey is ours for hope and striving. Trump screams about an America under siege and beset by internal and external enemies; Winfrey has spent a lifetime in conversation with us about how we are all redeemable and that we can all have our piece of the pie.  It may be unlikely, but a presidential race which pits the slogan, ‚ÄúMake America Great Again: The Sequel‚Äù against ‚ÄúThis land was made for you and me‚Äù would get huge ratings and present our country with a very clear choice. Time will tell how the show plays out.  Read more:  Carter Eskew: Are there any thoroughbreds in the Democratic presidential field?  Carter Eskew: A better closing argument for Democrats"

"Mariah Carey may now be wishing things would have worked out with her billionaire ex-fianc√© James Packer! The singer‚Äôs high-end SoCal shopping spree turned ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù when her credit cards were declined, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.  ‚ÄúShe was shopping on Rodeo Drive and her credit cards were declined,‚Äù an eyewitness told Radar. ‚ÄúWhen it happened at Louis Vuitton she thought it was a fluke. But when it happened three more times she was embarrassed and humiliated.‚Äù  Carey, 47, played it off like it was a mistake, as she left and came back to purchase the high-end items.

More than 10 years after she first guest-starred on the original run of the hit NBC comedy, the multitalented star will appear on Thursday's episode in two separate roles: She'll play both herself and NYPD detective Harlee Santos, her character on NBC's ""Shades of Blue.""  Back in 2004, Lopez, 48, appeared as herself on several episodes of the show, even singing at Karen and Lyle‚Äôs Vegas wedding in the season 6 finale.  On Thursday's episode, Jack (Sean Hayes) nabs a small acting job ‚Äî playing a corpse in a morgue! ‚Äî on an episode of ""Shades of Blue.""  In the first preview clip, Jack tells Karen (Megan Mullally) how he plans to use his experience on set to reunite with his BFFF.  ""Your Best Famous Friend Forever who hasn't spoken to you in 10 years, changed her email, phone number and address and returned the creepy fan art you painted?"" Karen asks.  ""Yes, that's the one! Jenny from the Block Me on All Social Media!"" Jack says happily.  Jack (Sean Hayes) tried to get in on the act when Jennifer Lopez performed in a 2004 episode of ""Will & Grace.""

"Jax and Brittany are taking Versailles. Vanderpump Rules stars Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor have booked their wedding venue, and the location is one fans should‚Äôve seen coming 2,000 miles away. Brittany has said time and time again that she has always wanted to get married at the Kentucky Castle in Versailles, Kentucky, and what do you know? That is precisely where she and Jax will tie the knot. As Jax shared on Instagram on Thursday, Brittany‚Äôs dreams of getting married at the Sexy Unique Spot are officially coming true. And whew, the IG video of Jax and Brittany's wedding venue sure is something to behold.  ‚ÄúWell venue set, deposit paid,‚Äù Jax wrote on IG. ‚ÄúNow I need a drink....bad.‚Äù He also posted a video to Instagram Stories he took while he and Brittany celebrated the financial commitment they just made. ""Just got the total of the wedding!!!"" he wrote on the Story. ""Gonna need more tequila!!""  Once the sticker shock wore off, Jax let his excitement take the reins. He tweeted on Friday,  ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt believe I am getting married in a castle that is all ours for three nights.. you can‚Äôt see the amazing pool in the back but it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous.

What at thrilling SUR-lwind the last few months have been. Jax and Brittany got engaged on June 7, and the couple immediately began plotting their wedding. Just a few weeks after the proposal happened, Jax and Brittany revealed they'd begun drafting their guest list, hired two wedding planners, started working with a wedding publicist, and attempted to figure out who would be in their wedding party.  When speaking with People back in July, Brittany revealed that the process of picking her bridesmaids was really putting her through it. She said,  ‚ÄúI have so many really close friends, from home in Kentucky and here in L.A., so making my bridesmaid choices down to like eight [people] is going to be really hard for me because my list is at like 15 right now. So, that‚Äôs going to be the hardest thing.‚Äù  While tasks like finalizing the guest list and the wedding party have been tough, choosing the wedding location was a breeze. As Brittany explained in the aforementioned People interview,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known where I wanted to get married since I was a little kid. I‚Äôve talked about it on the show. Even in other seasons, I wanted to get married at the Kentucky Castle so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a surprise.""  She always knew it was going to be the Kentucky Castle. We fans knew it was going to be the Kentucky Castle. And now, Jax and Brittany's wallets know it's going to be the Kentucky Castle.  Speaking of dreams, if the Bravo cameras are not part of Jax and Brittany's castle wedding day, it will be a true nightmare. Come on, the Jason ""Jax Taylor"" Cauchi is getting married. In a castle.

"They both recently endured very public break-ups.  And now things between Selena Gomez and Justin Theroux have 'turned into something more than a friendship,' according to a Life & Style story Wednesday.  Not everyone is thrilled about the union, however, as The Leftover star's ex Jennifer Aniston is reportedly 'not happy about' his romance with the singer/actress, who has long considered the Friends star 'a mentor.'  Blossoming romance? Selena Gomez and Justin Theroux are reportedly 'more than friends,' according to Life & Style, and are 'totally falling for each other'  The insider explained that the Fetish singer and Mulholland Drive actor have 'known each other for years through their manager,' but now they are totally 'are falling for each other.'  While the couple share a nearly 20-years age difference, they were able to connect over their recent break-ups and the source said 'sparks fly' when they're together.  Selena split from on-off ex Justin Bieber after a brief reunion last Fall, which happened right on the heels of her split from rapper The Weeknd, who now appears to have reunited with his former flame Bella Hadid.  Theroux and Aniston announced their divorce in February after two years of marriage.  Unhappy: The Leftover star's ex Jennifer Aniston is reportedly'not happy about' his romance with the singer/actress, who has long considered the Friends star 'a mentor,' seen together in 2015 above  They've got chemistry! While the couple share a nearly 20-years age difference, they were able to connect over their recent break-ups and the source said 'sparks fly' when they're together. The duo is seen with actor Paul Rudd in 2015 above  'Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups,' explained the source but now the duo are smitten.  'They FaceTime and text late at night and have intimate conversation about where they're going in life and their career goals,' the insider revealed, 'They're extremely honest and open with each other.'  But apparently friends of the Kill 'Em With Kindness singer are not keen on the relationship, thinking it can only end badly.  Meanwhile, Aniston is reportedly livid about the romance, with the source saying: 'Jen is not happy about it.'  Beside herself: The source said Aniston, above with Theroux in 2017, would 'be horrified,' if she knew the extent of his relationship with Gomez  The source said 'she'd be horrified,' if she knew the extent of the relationship because 'She'd think of it as a complete betrayal on both their parts.'  Selena was first friends with Aniston, who she met in 2009 and quickly connected with, even going as far as calling herself 'obsessed' with the star.  And insiders say that's one of the reasons she's so taken with the much-older actor.  'Part of her attraction to Justin is knowing how much Jen loved him. The fact that the woman she idolized so much prized him only makes Justin all that more appealing."

"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor‚Äôs shocking dismissal.  ‚ÄúThe whole thing has been very painful for me,‚Äù Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúThe accounts I‚Äôve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  ‚ÄúI had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It‚Äôs still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.‚Äù  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer ‚Äúpinches me on the ass a lot.‚Äù A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer‚Äôs firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC‚Äôs Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a ‚Äúdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,‚Äù with reason to believe ‚Äúthis may not have been an isolated incident.‚Äù Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  ‚ÄúThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,‚Äù he said, in part. ‚ÄúTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.‚Äù  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer‚Äôs exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I‚Äôm ready to. Thanks for your interest.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time‚Äôs Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men ‚Äî including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp ‚Äî have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time‚Äôs Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time‚Äôs Up was a major focus at this year‚Äôs Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  ‚ÄúI think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,‚Äù Couric tells PEOPLE about Time‚Äôs Up. ‚ÄúClearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.‚Äù  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  ‚ÄúOne of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today‚Äôs New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast ‚Äî and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we‚Äôre ‚Äòdropping‚Äô episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.  ‚ÄúMeanwhile, I‚Äôm still happily married (after three years!) and I‚Äôm teaching John how to do Instagram stories,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúHis are pretty lame so far. I‚Äôm also getting ready for my younger daughter Carrie‚Äôs college graduation. (GULP!) And there are some other cool projects I‚Äôll be able to announce soon. I‚Äôm addicted to work!"
"Miranda Lambert is currently dating Evan Felker ‚Äì a married man ‚Äì and her ex Blake Shelton is apparently thrilled that everyone finally knows she is a homewrecker. Even though rumors are swirling he is ready to wed Gwen Stefani, Shelton has been throwing shade at Lambert online. And, according to industry insiders, the feud between the country superstars is escalating. But, Lambert isn‚Äôt going to quietly put up with Shelton‚Äôs attacks anymore.  After the news of Lambert‚Äôs new relationship broke, Shelton posted a cryptic tweet about karma, and sources say it was exactly what everyone thought it was ‚Äì a direct shot at Lambert. And, it appears that The Voice coach is getting a lot of joy out of Lambert‚Äôs embarrassment because for him this is personal.  @blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT  ‚ÄúBlake is reveling in Miranda‚Äôs humiliation now that she‚Äôs been accused of having an affair with a married man because he believes she cheated on him,‚Äù claims the insider.  Even though they have been apart for three years, sources say the feud continues between Shelton and Lambert, and he believes that she will never change. The 41-year-old believes in the ‚Äúonce a cheater always a cheater‚Äù theory.  The Hollywood Gossip is reporting that Shelton thinks that his ex is the same person she has always been and that includes her ‚Äútwisted relationship antics.‚Äù  The country community basically sided with Shelton after the split, but he apparently feels like he came off as the villain. Reports claimed that he filed for divorce back in 2015 and she came home to find all of her things outside of their Oklahoma house. Because of that, many made him out to be the bad guy. But, even though he feels Lambert ‚Äúplayed the victim,‚Äù he thought he had a good reason to send Lambert packing.  Now, Shelton thinks the Tin Man singer is getting exactly what she deserves, and if she is embarrassed about the allegations that she ran off with another woman‚Äôs husband, then it is ‚Äúsweet justice.‚Äù  Miranda Lambert's Ex Says She Cheated With Blake Shelton (via @Fox411) https://t.co/Xy5a8tjtkJ ‚Äî TMZ (@TMZ) May 1, 2018  However, calling it justice may be a bit much, considering the fact that Shelton admitted to falling in love with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife. One source even calls him a ‚Äúhypocrite.‚Äù  Lambert still denies that she ever cheated on Shelton, and she also doesn‚Äôt believe she had anything to do with the breakup of Felker‚Äôs marriage. So, she won‚Äôt be sitting around and taking Shelton‚Äôs jabs much longer. Insiders say it is only a matter of time before she retaliates and return fire.  Advertisement  Sources say that the divorce deeply shook both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton and it doesn‚Äôt appear either one will ever get over it. They will apparently be ‚Äútrading insults, put-downs, and breakup songs for a long time to come.‚Äù"
"Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government. In the past two weeks, after receiving a...‚ÄúNOS‚Äù stands for ‚ÄúNovus Ordo Seclorum,‚Äù or New World Order. The O has been replaced with a transformed version of Obama‚Äôs campaign slogan, with the American flag replaced by flames. There is also an all-seeing eye in the center. It‚Äôs pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along:Along with two small islands due east of Virginia just in international waters, Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúteam‚Äù has now set up massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles. Chicago would have been a better choice for population than Washington but if your end game is to launch a military coup in the nation‚Äôs capital, those pieces must be deeply embedded in place.How embedded? Obama himself lives within the city limits. He conducts secret meetings with top-ranking officials from both parties and diplomats from around the world in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system, built after the British trashed the city and burned down the White House in 1812.The extent of the tunnels is unknown since they remain the property of the US Government and require codeword clearance. There is no map available. Historians have pieced together several of the stops, however, and Tracey Place ‚Äî along with just about every other building that houses a public official in DC ‚Äî is on the list.This is no joke, patriots. If Obama‚Äôs military comes to your door in yellow Humvees with that emblem on them, they aren‚Äôt your friends. Get out of the house and don‚Äôt look back. At some point, their population reduction plan will go into effect and older Trump supporters will be the first ones buried in mass graves."

Morrison is signed with Adam Levine's 222 Records. Morrison received a Tony Award nomination for his featured role as Fabrizio Nacarelli in the musical The Light in the Piazza.

He attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts for two years before dropping out and joining the Broadway adaptation of Footloose.[5]  By freshman year of college, Morrison already was a regular performer on Broadway. He said in Details, ""There were all these beautiful, beautiful dancers. As a straight guy I had some room. There were the shared interests in singing and dancing, and I always find dancing with someone very erotic and sexual. I definitely hooked up with a lot of girls when I was a young guy on Broadway.""[6]  Career [ edit ]  Morrison's career began when he made his musical theatre debut on Broadway in the musical version of Footloose, followed by a revival of The Rocky Horror Show in 2002.

"I want to have it all,‚Äù Jennifer Aniston declared in 2006 about juggling a career and a family. ‚ÄúThe women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? I‚Äôve never in my life said I didn‚Äôt want to have children. I did and I do and I will!‚Äù Well, here we are over a decade later, and Jen is ready to make that happen... with Brad Pitt!  ‚ÄúThe two have grown closer over the last couple of years,‚Äù a friend told In Touch exclusively. ‚ÄúHis marriage [to Angelina Jolie] fell apart, then her marriage to Justin [Theroux] ended. During that difficult time, Brad and Jen reconnected. It‚Äôs like destiny brought them together, and I can definitely see them having a child together.‚Äù  Of course, Brad is already a father of six, and admitted that ‚ÄúBeing a father has changed me on so many levels and made me more generous and alive.‚Äù Jen is 49 and has never had children, so Brad could surely help her through it. ‚ÄúHe and Jen have talked about moving in together and giving this another try,‚Äù said the insider. ‚ÄúThis could all lead to her finally having his baby.‚Äù Brad ‚Äúhas babies on the brain. He loves being a dad. It‚Äôs a huge part of who he is.‚Äù  Because of Jen‚Äôs age, the chances of conceiving naturally are extremely slim, ‚ÄúBut they would try,‚Äù said her pal. If that doesn‚Äôt work, they would move on to IVF. ‚ÄúEven if it meant months of trying IVF. When Jen sets her mind to something, she doesn‚Äôt stop until she succeeds.‚Äù After their long and heartbreaking journey away from and now back to each other, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the blockbuster news that friends, family and fans have been hoping for.‚Äù  Of course, the idea infuriates Angie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the ultimate slap in the face,‚Äù said an insider.

"Bono has said that US presidential nominee Donald Trump could potentially ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù America.  In an interview with Charlie Rose on US network CBS, the U2 front man said Trump is ‚Äúpotentially the worst idea that ever happened to America‚Äù.  Bono said America is different from other countries because it is ‚Äúan idea‚Äù, one which Trump is ‚Äútrying to hijack‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThat idea is bound up in justice and equality for all. I think he‚Äôs hijacked the party.  ‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it‚Äôs bigger than all of us. I think this is really dangerous.‚Äù  In a separate interview with ATTN, an online media company aimed at younger people, Bono has recalled the historic struggle of Irish immigrants to the United States in calling on the country‚Äôs political leaders to open its doors to Syrian refugees.  He said that to turn people away just because they are refugees was ‚Äúa betrayal of the whole idea of America‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe promised land belongs to those who need it most. The Irish needed it. The Jews needed it. The Syrians now need it,‚Äù he said in an interview.  Asked about US political opposition to accepting refugees into the country, Bono said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Irish. It‚Äôs deeply offensive. We were economic refugees. This thing of a continent behaving like an island, this shrivel and pretend the world doesn‚Äôt exist, it‚Äôs not possible any more in a globalized world. It‚Äôs just not possible.‚Äù"
"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  We're all still grieving the loss of Milo Ventimiglia's Jack Pearson on ""This Is Us,"" even though we're excited to see him return next season.  But as Ventimiglia recently told The Los Angeles Times, his death scene wasn't just hard on him ‚Äî his co-star, Mandy Moore, was ""crying every day"" for ""four weeks.""  Jack's (Milo Ventimiglia) death scenes were particularly hard on Mandy Moore, who plays his wife, Rebecca, on ""This Is Us."" NBC  ""What I understood in my scene is it's very much not about me,"" he explained. ""It's about what Mandy (who plays Jack's wife Rebecca) has to experience in finding that ultimate low ... Hearing my friend completely break, it almost felt like an out-of-body experience. It hurt; it was painful.""  Jack was a true hero for rescuing his family from a house fire, but ultimately succumbed once he was at the hospital, which meant Moore had a lot of emotional scenes and a lot of tears to shed.  ""Poor Mandy had about four weeks where she was crying every day,"" he recalled.  We're going to miss seeing Jack and Rebecca snuggling! Ron Batzdorff/NBC  And it's not as if Ventimiglia was taking a nap, lying on the hospital bed while she wept over him. ""It's about remaining still,"" he said about playing dead. ""I just focus on a spot on the ceiling and relax the muscles in my face.""  Afterward, the ""This Is Us"" actor says he gave Moore some room to recover from all that crying.  ""I just waited until she came and knocked on my trailer door (once filming was done),"" he said. ""We had a big hug and there was laughter and even a, 'Thank God that's over.'""  At least, until season three, when apparently we'll see him again!  Follow Randee Dawn on Twitter."
"Princess Kate knew what was coming.  Having battled severe pregnancy sickness, or Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), while expecting her first two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, the royal mom would have been told by her medical team that the odds meant she would likely have the debilitating condition again.  Caitlin Dean, who is chairperson of the U.K.‚Äôs Pregnancy Sickness Support, is also a mother of three who suffered from HG in each of her pregnancies.  ‚ÄúA lot of people go into the second [pregnancy] hoping that it will not happen again, thinking [HG] will be one pregnancy and that every pregnancy is different,‚Äù says Dean. ‚ÄúBut once you have it twice, that delusion is pretty much blown out of the water. So you have to prepare and be ready for this.  ‚ÄúFor myself, I found it mentally and physically easier [during subsequent pregnancies] because I knew that I was going to have this and I knew what to expect from the treatment and what to expect generally.‚Äù  Lia Toby/WENN  On the flip side, she notes, for some women the symptoms ‚Äúget worse each time.‚Äù  Dean says that for women who have previously battled HG, there‚Äôs a trepidation mixed in with the joy of anticipating a new baby.  ‚ÄúYou know it‚Äôs coming, and it‚Äôs quite a scary prospect knowing you‚Äôre going to put yourself through that again. Certainly for me and my husband that was a huge decision. Not so much, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs have a third kid,‚Äô but, ‚ÄòCan we go through HG again?‚Äô It‚Äôs certainly something that limits a lot of people who cannot go beyond two because of the condition.  ‚ÄúPreparing makes a huge amount of difference,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúWhat we suspect from experience is that if you prepare, you can start pre-emptive treatment and can prepare your household and your finances. The average woman doesn‚Äôt have the life that Kate has with people to cook meals and people to do their cleaning for them and look  after their children. For regular women that preparation is absolutely key.‚Äù  Such advance preparation, she adds, ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt necessarily improve the sickness, although there is evidence that earlier treatment can reduce the overall impact of the symptoms. It isn‚Äôt a cure, but it makes it easier to have done that preparation. Then, if you don‚Äôt have HG on the third time, you haven‚Äôt lost anything. [That scenario] would be brilliant. Very occasionally women don‚Äôt get it again, but most of the time they do.‚Äù  Preparing also means keeping your younger children informed, says Dean, who wrote How To Be an HG Hero aimed at children of expectant moms.  Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage  ‚ÄúThe idea with that is to help children understand why Mummy‚Äôs not in the picture and why she‚Äôs potentially in and out of hospital and how they can help,‚Äù says Dean. ‚ÄúMy key thing is honesty. A lot of people try to hide the fact they‚Äôre pregnant in the first 12 weeks, because they‚Äôre worried about having to explain a miscarriage if it happens. If you are going in and out of hospital and lying in bed day after day and not telling your kids the reason why, they‚Äôre just going to worry about it and make up in their own heads why that is. Kids are resilient and they get on with that as long as you tell them the truth.  ‚ÄúIt is debilitating and miserable and hopefully [Kate‚Äôs] children will not be worrying about it and understand that Mummy‚Äôs poorly.‚Äù  Samir Hussein/WireImage  Of course, it‚Äôs also tough on moms. ‚ÄúYou have the fact that your other children are going to lose out on Mummy, and you have that guilt at not being able to spend so much time with them.‚Äù  As for treatment, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include a first line of medication like Cyclizine, which is an anti-histamine and works to combat vomiting, and Ondansetron to prevent nausea and vomiting.  ‚ÄúOn top of that, it is IV fluids ¬≠if she‚Äôs not keeping food or fluids down,‚Äù says Dean, who is not involved in Kate‚Äôs treatment. ‚ÄúThe main things is to keep her hydrated and able to eat. We know that malnutrition and dehydration can have a negative effect on the fetus. The idea that baby‚Äôs fine with a starving mum just isn‚Äôt true. It is important to keep mums hydrated so that they can eat as much as they need to or are able to.‚Äù"
"The battle between Farrah Abraham and Teen Mom isn‚Äôt over yet.  After announcing she was ‚Äúmoving on‚Äù from the MTV series last month, blasting the show as ‚Äúhateful‚Äù and ‚Äúhorrible,‚Äù the reality star is taking legal action, suing parent company Viacom for $5 million.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Abraham claims she was fired because of her decision to work in the adult entertainment industry. The 26-year-old previously released sex tapes with Vivid Entertainment in 2013 and 2014 with porn star James Deen, and since then, she has done adult webcam shows and appearances at strip clubs. She has also endorsed sex toys.  ‚ÄúWe respect Farrah‚Äôs decision to pursue other endeavors and we wish her the best,‚Äù a Viacom spokesperson tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúRegarding her suit, the claims are without merit.‚Äù  In the complaint, Abraham, who is mom to 8-year-old daughter Sophia, alleges Viacom ‚Äúwrongfully terminated her employment because she did not conform to gender stereotypes.‚Äù  Farrah Abraham Rodrigo Varela/Getty  According to Abraham, in October 2017 she was confronted by 16 & Pregnant and Teen Mom executive producer Morgan J. Freeman at her Texas home, where she alleges she was ‚Äúharassed, humiliated, discriminated against, disrespected, ridiculed, degraded and sex shamed‚Äù for her ‚Äúrecent decision to pursue opportunities in the adult entertainment industry.‚Äù  Abraham alleges Freeman and his production crew made threats about ‚Äúending her career with MTV, sabotaging future deals [she] had in place with MTV, and defaming her.‚Äù She claims she ‚Äúfeared for her life‚Äù during the confrontation due to Freeman‚Äôs ‚Äúhostile tone, mannerisms, and body language.‚Äù  Abraham alleges that shortly after the confrontation, production informed her she was no longer needed for the show.  She claims the harassment from the producers based on their ‚Äúgender stereotypes of how women should act and appear, unreasonably interfered‚Äù with her work performance and psychological well-being.  The reality star is suing for emotional pain, emotional suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and other damages. She also alleges gender discrimination and a hostile work environment and says she‚Äôs still owed money that was guaranteed in her contract.  Last month, the MTV personality made multiple accusations against the network in a scathing Instagram post alongside a Teen Mom OG clip of her speaking with Morgan, who said she was a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù to work with.  ‚ÄúNever apologize for being an ambitious, confident, and strong minded women,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúAs I become the best Farrah I can be, I won‚Äôt let a man or network be little me, try to break me, lie about who I am to my core, I‚Äôm bullied, surrounded & hurt by all the manipulation, I no longer will allow as a protective mother this vulgar behavior, these crews aren‚Äôt trust worthy this ‚ÄòMTV family‚Äô is a disgusting gang of power tripping failed producers & executives who have failed.‚Äù  In early November, Abraham claimed she had been fired by Viacom for working as an adult entertainer. She later backtracked, clarifying that Viacom‚Äôs legal team had not terminated her contract."

"As Kylie Jenner‚Äôs feud with Wendy Williams rages on, Travis Scott is helping Kylie in the best way! Here‚Äôs how he‚Äôs supporting her amidst Wendy‚Äôs continuous disses!  Kylie Jenner, 20, is basking in the joy of being a new mother, but when she hears about Wendy Williams, 53, and her constant verbal attacks on her relationship with Travis Scott, 25, it‚Äôs hard not to get a bit frustrated. Wendy has stood by her prediction that Travis will eventually leave Kylie and the baby to live the partying lifestyle of a successful rapper. Before baby Stormi Webster was born on February 1, Wendy predicted that Travis would leave Kylie to raise the baby on her own. However, Travis hasn‚Äôt done that, and he doesn‚Äôt plan to, a source tells HollywoodLife.com. He‚Äôs sticking by Kylie‚Äôs side, and proving Wendy wrong.  ‚ÄúKylie is getting the last laugh in her feud with Wendy Williams thanks to Travis,‚Äù the insider says. ‚ÄúKylie‚Äôs not being petty and dwelling on it but yes, she‚Äôs pretty thrilled that Travis is proving Wendy and all the haters wrong. Don‚Äôt forget, Wendy said some pretty nasty things about how Travis was going to abandon Kylie and Stormi and that has not been the case at all.‚Äù Instead, it‚Äôs been the compete opposite. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been so solid,‚Äù the source continues, adding that Travis is ‚Äúthe best dad and Kylie could not be happier. ‚Äî She‚Äôs falling more in love with him every day.‚Äù  Throughout Kylie‚Äôs pregnancy, Wendy taunted the young star on her show. She remained adamant about her opinion that Kylie would be a single mother, even before giving birth. ‚ÄúAt 20-years-old being pregnant, and I don‚Äôt care how much money you have, it‚Äôs got to be hard,‚Äù the talk show host said on her January 24 show. ‚ÄúThe next reality show in the works right now might be, I got a name for you, ‚ÄòKylie Goes It Alone‚Äô because Travis Scott is not sticking around,‚Äù she proclaimed while laughing at a photo of the rapper. ‚ÄúAnyway, he‚Äôs not sticking around,‚Äù she said, once again.  Nonetheless, the couple is still going strong. In fact, Kylie and Travis celebrated Stormi‚Äôs one-month birthday on March 1, with both parents gushing over their bundle of joy on social media. First, Kylie took to Snapchat to show off the massive bouquets of pink flowers Travis had sent her in honor of Stormi‚Äôs one month in their lives. Then, both parents showed off photos of Stormi ‚Äî the most we‚Äôve seen of the little one ‚Äî despite hiding her face in the snaps. Kylie also showed off her 4-week post-baby boy, aka her flat abs, on Snapchat.  Kylie and Travis welcomed a healthy baby girl, Stormi ‚Äî who was 8 pounds, 9 ounces ‚Äî at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on February 1. Kylie didn‚Äôt reveal she was pregnant or that she gave birth until February 4 when she released an 11-minute video with never-before-seen footage from her entire pregnancy. Since then, she‚Äôs returned to her normal social media use after taking a 9-month hiatus from the spotlight to enjoy her pregnancy in private. The news of Kylie‚Äôs pregnancy broke in September 2017."

"(JTA) ‚Äî Most artists would see playing one concert at New York‚Äôs Madison Square Garden as a crowning achievement. Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.  Before and after his landmark show last week at the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Most Famous Arena,‚Äù the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible ‚Äî and likely all-time record-breaking ‚Äî MSG run.  After mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.  ‚ÄúThis past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,‚Äù he said.  Although Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.  On the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù were to blame for the violence that occurred ‚Äî and that were some ‚Äúvery fine people‚Äù among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.  ‚ÄúI had to do something that night,‚Äù Joel responded. ‚ÄúThe president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs some good people on that side ‚Ä¶‚Äô No, Nazis aren‚Äôt good people.  ‚ÄúIt really enraged me, actually,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúMy old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. ‚Ä¶ My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.‚Äù  While many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.  But the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards ‚Äî Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form. Lena Dunham, Antonoff‚Äôs girlfriend at the time, said he ordered the necklace after feeling like Nazis had become a ‚Äúmainstream thing again.‚Äù  RELATED:  Billy Joel wore a yellow Jewish star. Thanks, but the trend should stop there."

"Brown, however, tried and failed to get Tran‚Äôs case against him dismissed, and his attorney was admonished for not addressing LaCour‚Äôs petition. Here‚Äôs what went down: Tran‚Äôs lawyers notified the court seven days in advance that she would be unable to attend the hearing in person due to work obligations, and instead planned to participate via phone. Gossip Cop has learned that at the hearing, Brown‚Äôs camp tried arguing for a dismissal, on the grounds that Tran should have given 12 days‚Äô notice, not seven.  As Gossip Cop reported, Tran obtained a temporary restraining order against Brown in late February, accusing him of harassing her, assaulting her, and threatening to kill her. The model-actress‚Äô best friend LaCour was also awarded a temporary restraining order after making similar allegations. Both are now seeking to get permanent stay-away orders against the singer.  Initially, the judge the was inclined to agree. But Brown‚Äôs legal team apparently failed to recognize this was a joint hearing with LaCour, who was in the court room ready to testify. ‚ÄúWhat they didn‚Äôt take into consideration was the other case,‚Äù one person who was at the hearing tells Gossip Cop exclusively. We‚Äôre told Brown‚Äôs attorneys ‚Äúcame swooping into court‚Äù expecting to get off easy on the technicality with Trans‚Äô absence, but the judge pointed out that Brown ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt show up either,‚Äù despite another petitioner ‚Äúready to go.‚Äù  Gossip Cop hears Brown‚Äôs attorney tried to argue he had not been served in the cases, but evidence was presented to show he was properly served the restraining orders for both Tran and LaCour. Upon seeing that, ‚Äúhis lawyers began to struggle because they had no clue‚Äù about the second case, we‚Äôre told, and were not prepared to argue it. Furthermore, the judge accused his side of making a ‚Äúmockery‚Äù of the court. He granted their request for a continuance but demanded Brown appear at the next hearing, which is slated for June 15.  And in an indication of how seriously the judge is taking these matters, the next hearing will be an evidentiary one, in which both sides must present evidence regarding the allegations. It‚Äôs also worth noting that Brown‚Äôs lead attorney, Mark Geragos, wasn‚Äôt even the one who represented him on Tuesday. Rather, a female lawyer was sent in his place.

"Gal Gadot joined Jimmy Fallon on ‚ÄúThe Tonight Show‚Äù Tuesday night and showed off her lying prowess.  Insert lasso of truth joke here (we know you were thinking it). Even Gadot made it.  The ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù star played ‚ÄúBox of Lies‚Äù ‚Äî a ‚ÄúTonight Show‚Äù game where Fallon and a guest attempted to stump each other on the contents of a mystery box. Most of the items, however, are hard to describe even truthfully.  Also Read: 'Wonder Woman' First Reactions: 'the Best DCEU Film to Date'  Gadot won the game, but granted, some of the items made trying to confuse Fallon really easy. One item was a fake foot dressed up like a skiing mountain, complete with little skiiers. It‚Äôs an item so bizarre that not even Gadot had any idea what to do.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know how to describe this,‚Äù she laughed.

"Applicants during ABC's ""The Bachelor"" casting call at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  For a show that feeds on exposing private affairs and personal heartbreak, the application process for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" doesn't begin to scratch the surface.  Phoenix, along with 15 other cities, was chosen as a casting call site for season 23 of the hit reality-TV dating show. I volunteered to brave the high heels and nervous laughs to see what deep, personal secrets the show would be fishing for.  As a full disclaimer: I‚Äôm a fan of the show. I closely watched the last season, which featured Scottsdale ""Bachelor"" Arie Luyendyk Jr.  Not only is he probably the most-hated man in franchise history, but he gave a dismal showing of his hometown on America‚Äôs TV screens every Monday night. Scottsdale turned into a place to go bowling and reminisce on the old days.  Nevermind that Luyendyk actually grew up in Paradise Valley.  While that season was a bit of a letdown, I didn‚Äôt let it shift my belief in the process. The show, now with more spinoffs to keep track of, has captivated audiences season after season, following young hopefuls searching for love.  Was I looking for love? Absolutely not. Not quite like this, at least. But I had to believe there were some women auditioning in the hopes of finding their forever life partner on a reality show.  What's in an application  Arizona Republic reporter Rebecca Smouse poses for a photograph prior to auditioning for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Elizabeth Montgomery/The Republic)  I quickly befriended a young woman in the parking lot of The Scottsdale Resort at McCormick Ranch. We both had recently graduated from Arizona State University and decided to stick together through this journey.  Following the trail of nicely dressed women, we wandered into a large ballroom to find what seemed like organized chaos. We were handed an application, a clipboard and a number.  I was No. 72.  A woman at the applications table said she expected about 200 people to filter through the resort by the end of the day. Phoenix has been a frequent destination for the show's casting calls, though few women from the Valley have been in recent seasons.  Everything felt like a test. Candy placed on the application table? Avoid that.  The ballroom, equipped with a DJ and an open bar, was decorated with women of all ages. Many were dressed to the nines, wearing beautiful dresses, tight fabrics and high heels. My parking-lot friend fit that description, dressed in a tube top and matching skirt with heels much taller than I could ever walk in.  I was wearing a matching top-and-bottom set with bright boots and some accent jewelry. I wore an outfit that I felt matched my personality without trying too hard.  Others arrived more simply in jeans and T-shirts. A young woman was dressed in a cow costume, clad with sparkly silver shoes, a bold move the producers would either applaud or completely dismiss.  Angelie Meehan, of Phoenix, wears a cow costume to her audition for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. She said she was looking for ""that special bull for her life."" (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  I was half expecting someone to start handing out champagne and offer lines of encouragement, something like, ""Are you ready for your journey to begin?""  We took our seats and began filling out a six-page-long application that delved into my dating history, employment and why I was looking for love on a reality TV show.  The application offered some interesting questions, such as:  What accomplishments are you most proud of?  Are you genuinely looking to get married and why?  What have you not found yet but would like in a relationship?  There were also several questions on prior relationships and marriages. The application explicitly asked if we drank alcohol, only to follow up with the next logical question: What's your favorite drink?  My newfound friend had issues with some of the questions, like what our salary was and what was on our bucket list. We both skipped the question asking if we had any interesting talents.  The application was coupled with an intense release to agree to everything the producers may do if you get picked for the show. It felt like we were signing our life away, a thought that resonated with many of the applicants sitting around us.  All in the name of love, though.  Interestingly enough, most people I spoke with who were auditioning had not watched the show before. It seemed strange to me to audition for a process they had never seen on TV before. This would be like someone trying out for ""Survivor"" not knowing you will be trapped on a deserted island.  To make it on the show, you must be 21 or older, be single and can't have been convicted of a felony. You also can't be running for any type of political office.  A quiet room, a video recording  Women line up to fill out their audition sheets during a casting call for ABC's ""The Bachelor"" at McCormick Ranch in Scottsdale on June 16, 2018. (Photo: Patrick Breen/The Republic)  After quite a bit of sitting and waiting, we stood in another line, had a few photos snapped and then were shuffled from the grand ballroom into smaller conference rooms, greeted by a small camcorder and an interviewer.  We sat as a small group outside, waiting for our names to be called. I made a new friend, who told me she reluctantly agreed to audition after a friend worried about her love life drove her to the resort. She said her friend even tweeted photos to the producers of the show to get their attention.  The empty room was daunting, but the woman behind the camera was kind. She'd been through her fair share of casting calls before and seemed to know all the right questions to ask to make me feel comfortable about divulging my personal life to a lens.  ""You were great!"" she said. Click.  I wondered if she said that to everyone or if she really meant it.  The questions were as basic as the rest of the process: talk about your family, where you grew up and your dating history. The video was the most personal part of the process, though it only lasted for about five minutes. The tapes get whisked off to Los Angeles to be viewed by show producers for the next month and a half.  I'm not holding my breath.  While I truly had no intentions of getting picked for the show, I did complete the application process honestly.  Most interestingly, almost none of the crew worked for ABC or ""The Bachelor"" directly. A few producers were roaming around, someone told me, but most were kept hidden behind closed doors. There was some secrecy to the whole process, as some girls were taken aside for private interviews and on special photo shoots.  Will any of them make it on the next season?  Stay tuned.

For her next show later this week, there are still 1,200 seats (26 percent) available.  ‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt sell tickets,‚Äù says an insider. ‚ÄúThere are literally thousands of seats still available this month!‚Äù  Radar Online is reporting that the remaining four July dates all have at least 1100 empty seats, and this failure has ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù Stefani.

According to Ticketmaster, there are over 1,300 seats available for the December 30th concert, which is her worst night of sales.  Since there are still so many seats available for multiple shows, discount sites like GoodSeatTickets.com have slashed prices up to 75 percent.  The show runs through Mid-March of next year, but if it turns out to be a bust, sources say she can always go back to The Voice.  ‚ÄúShe always has The Voice.

A-list romance? Back in April Sienna Miller hit out at speculation she was enjoying a secret romance with Brad Pitt. But two months later the rumour mill is churning again amid reports the two stars got cosy during a VIP party at the Glastonbury music festival over the weekend  According to the paper the stars were seen holding hands and stroking each other as they partied with mutual pals including Bradley Cooper and Noel Gallagher in the early hours of Saturday.  The report claims Sienna and Brad met up at 3am in the festival's Rabbit Hole area where onlookers spied them looking very cosy.  A source claims: 'Brad and Sienna couldn't keep their hands off each other, touching and stroking each other at every opportunity. They seemed really intimate.'  'Intimate': Both Sienna and Brad were among the A-list contingent who descended on the UK's Somerset event for a weekend of music  The insider added that Brad, who up until then was keeping a low profile at the world famous festival, looked delighted to meet up with Sienna, explaining:  'They seemed keen to get away from prying eyes and made a dash for the Rabbit Hole, the festival's underground and exclusive venue, with a group of friends and were inseparable as they waited to go inside.  'The party was cut short and they had to leave after five minutes because the venue was closing. Bradley Cooper left and Brad and Sienna headed back arm in arm to their private Winnebego.'  Party girl: Sienna headed to Glasto with her pals including Poppy Delevingne but according to a new report she met up with Brad in the early hours of Saturday  Another onlooker told Daily Star Online: 'Brad and Sienna were looking very cosy. I couldn't believe it - they were kissing in the VIP section of the Rabbit Hole.'  A representative for Brad declined to comment when approached by MailOnline. Sienna's representatives have also been contacted.  Back in April Sienna lashed out at 'silly' reports claiming she was spotted flirting with Brad, who is in the midst of divorcing Angelina Jolie.  The 35-year-old Brit insisted she would not 'dignify it with a response', in an interview with the New York Post just days after Page Six claimed the duo enjoyed a dinner date in Los Angeles.  Bachelor life: Brad has been enjoying single life as he attended Glastonbury with pals including Bradley Cooper  Music fan: Brad was seen checking out the weekend's acts side of stage on Friday  Having previously dated her Alfie co-star Jude Law and and enjoyed a 'brief' encounter with Layer Cake's Daniel Craig, she conceded that the Brad reports were 'predictable', as his production company is behind her new movie The Lost City of Z.  Page Six reported that Sienna and Brad were reportedly seen getting flirty in LA, after which they attended the premiere of The Lost City Z separately but insiders claim at a dinner after the screening the pair got close.  Brad, whose company Plan B is behind the film, was said to be doing some 'serious flirting' while surrounded by about 25 people. A source told Page Six: 'They were heavily enjoying each other's company and 'they were talking to each other all night.'  Rendezvous: The report claims Sienna met up with Brad at 3am in the festival's Rabbit Hole area where onlookers spied them looking very cosy  It was claimed that soon to be divorced Brad seemed to perk up after the interaction with Sienna as he was 'in very high spirits, which he hasn't been for a long time. He seems to be over a hump'.  Shortly after the reports emerged, Sienna spoke to The New York Post, where she vehemently denied the reports - insisting she would not entertain the prospect. She said: 'I'm not going to even dignify it with a response. It's predictable and silly'.  Prior to her denial, another source close to Sienna downplayed the possible flirtation and said the pair were part of a larger group so there were a lot of conversations going on throughout the night.  Party people; Sienna, a new recruit to Instagram, shared a snap of her swish ride to the festival on Friday with her pals  Back when the movie was filming, Sienna was forced to deny that there was another going on with a then-very married Brad.  She called a suggestion they were flirting 'insane' on Sway In The Morning on SiriusXM's Shade 45. The star said: 'The brilliant thing about that rumor is that yeah I haven't really read too much about it.  'So this is the truth about that, Brad Pitt is producing the movie that I just wrapped but I didn't see him, he's not been to the set. You know he's the producer of the film and I've met him twice - it's insane.'  Meanwhile according to New Idea, Elle Macpherson has also been spotted cosying up to actor Brad during a recent rendezvous in Hollywood.  Another rumour: Meanwhile according to New Idea, Elle Macpherson has also been spotted cosying up to actor Brad during a recent rendezvous in Hollywood  'They definitely seemed cosy together, like a couple on an intimate date,' the publication's source claimed on Monday.  'She was touching his arm a lot and flicking her hair over her shoulder,' the onlooker said of the 53-year-old supermodel, adding: 'There was a lot of flirting going on.'  It appears Brad, 53, also enjoyed the Australian bombshell's company during their meeting at the LA nightclub.  'He was laughing at everything she said and leaning in really close,' the source claimed.  The pair first met on the set of Friends in 1999, while Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, who also starred on the sitcom.  Reports of the genetically-blessed pair's meet-up comes just weeks after Elle supposedly split from billionaire property developer Jeffrey Soffer.  The mother-of-two and her sons Flynn, 19, and Aurelius, 14, are said to have moved out of the Miami mansion they previously shared with the 44-year-old billionaire."

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first royal tour together is significant for so many reasons. Having announced that they're expecting their first child together, due in the Spring of 2019, the newlyweds have been greeted by royal fans in Australia this week. And the warm welcome is sure to continue as they travel to New Zealand, Fiji, and the Kingdom of Tonga in the coming days.  As they're now expecting a baby, it's exciting to see the Duke and Duchess of Sussex attending so many events together, and displaying such an impressive royal tour wardrobe along the way.  But what makes Meghan and Harry's appearance at the Invictus Games 2018 so significant is the fact that they first made their public debut as a couple at last year's event. And it's hard to believe just how much has happened in the last year.  On September 23, 2017, Meghan was spotted in the crowd at the Invictus Games in Toronto, the city in which she lived while filming Suits. She was there to support Prince Harry, who is heavily involved in the sporting event, which aims to support veterans and service people who have sustained injuries and disabilities while serving their countries:  Getty Images AFP Contributor  The separation didn't last long, though, as on September 25, 2017, Meghan and Harry attended a wheelchair tennis match in Toronto as part of the Invictus Games. Not only did they sit next to one another, but they also held hands, and looked very much in love throughout the event:  Getty Images Danny Lawson - PA Images  After that first public appearance, their relationship progressed fairly quickly, with the pair announcing their engagement on November 27, 2017:  Now, attending the Invictus Games 2018, Harry and Meghan look more unified than ever. Traveling to Sydney for the event, rather than Meghan's former home of Toronto, the Duke and Duchess have truly become a unit. Not only are they married, and starting a family, but they're jointly supporting the causes and organizations that are important to them both.  Having gotten married in May 2018, and announced Meghan's pregnancy at the start of the royal tour, it's clear that the Duke and Duchess aren't wasting time when it comes to their love story."

"Newlyweds Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have had quite the day. May 19's royal wedding has easily been one of the year's biggest events, not to mention a huge moment in the history of bridal fashion and beauty. Now, nearly 12 hours into the day, the couple can finally put their feet up. Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated. Markle's reception dress, a long white gown made of silk crepe by British designer Stella McCartney, featured a halter-style neckline and the same type of effortless elegance as every other element of the bride's wedding-day look.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Harry, on the other hand, changed out of his official frockcoat uniform and into a classic black tuxedo, complete with a black bowtie around his neck and an adorable just-married grin across his face.  Steve Parsons/WPA Pool/Getty Images  In case you need a reminder of the striking Givenchy design Markle wore earlier in the day, here it is in all its royal-wedding glory:  Getty Images  Anyway, here's hoping the newlywed couple has a happy reception party at Frogmore House, the name of which I cannot stop saying in my head.

But a new report from Us Weekly has it that the timeline for baby #1 has become accelerated after the royal wedding. Multiple sources have told the outlet that after the ceremony, the two's desire for having kids grew. ‚ÄúHaving children is definitely a priority,‚Äù a source close to Markle told Us. ‚ÄúShe and Harry want to start a family right away‚Äîand she‚Äôll start trying as soon as she can.‚Äù  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  A second source that the outlet describes as a royal insider echoed this, though was a little less ""this'll happen ASAP."" ‚ÄúThey both can‚Äôt wait to start a family. [Still,] Harry and Meghan won‚Äôt rush into anything. They have a lot on their plate right now. But they both think that when the moment feels right, that will be the time to go for it. They‚Äôll make fantastic parents.‚Äù  A third source chimed in that even Markle's mom Doria Ragland believes that baby will come soon. ‚ÄúDoria is expecting to be a grandmother by this time next year. She‚Äôs very excited for Meghan to become a mother.‚Äù  Harry and Markle are currently believed to be on their honeymoon, though they are expected to attend the Queen's Trooping of the Colour official birthday parade this Saturday.

Whether a pregnancy announcement will come before or after all that, we'll see.  In their first interview together after announcing their engagement, Markle and Harry made it clear they hope to have children someday. When asked about their plans to start a family, Harry said, ""No [not now], of course, you know, one step at a time. Hopefully we‚Äôll start a family in the near future.""  At an event in March, Markle hinted that future is nearer rather than farther. The two met a wife-husband entrepreneur duo Sinead and Adam Murphy, who showed the couple products from their Shnuggle line, which include a baby bath and Moses basket. Markle quipped to them, ""I‚Äôm sure at some point we‚Äôll need the whole thing.‚Äù"
"The only budget Ted Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‚Äòcarpet bomb‚Äô ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.We decided to fact-check Rubio‚Äôs claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.Cruz‚Äôs vote on Rand Paul‚Äôs budget proposalRubio‚Äôs campaign pointed to Cruz‚Äôs 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul‚Äôs amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.Paul‚Äôs 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.Rubio‚Äôs campaign pointed to Paul‚Äôs statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""Under Paul‚Äôs proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul‚Äôs proposal a ‚Äòcut‚Äô for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul‚Äôs budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul‚Äôs proposal a ""cut.""""Paul‚Äôs defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president‚Äôs budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul‚Äôs defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""Paul‚Äôs 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama‚Äôs request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul‚Äôs budget a ""cut.""""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‚Äòcut‚Äô when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz‚Äôs vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul‚Äôs amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.""This was a budget, so it doesn‚Äôt make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.Our rulingRubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio was referring to Cruz‚Äôs vote in favor of Paul‚Äôs budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul‚Äôs plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul‚Äôs proposal for defense was below Obama‚Äôs request.We rate this statement Mostly False."

Also, Chelsea Houska faced Adam Lind in court and can finally sleep soundly again. Find out what you might have missed during this week‚Äôs episode of Teen Mom 2.  Chelsea Finally Feels Her Daughter is Safe  It was finally time for Chelsea to face her ex in court to try to hyphenate her daughter‚Äôs last name to match her and her husband Cole Deboer‚Äôs name. She also wanted to get her visitation agreement changed so that Adam could only see Aubree in a visitation center. She couldn‚Äôt be more nervous to faceher ex, who she hadn‚Äôt seen in about a year.  ‚ÄúI hate that I doubt myself,‚Äù Chelsea said and continued to worry about her intentions. ‚ÄúAm I being ridiculous? Can you be too ridiculous when it comes to your child?‚Äù  In the end, everything went Chelsea‚Äôs way, and she cried on the car ride home because she finally felt like Aubree was in a safe situation.  ‚ÄúI just feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders,‚Äù Chelsea said. They celebrated by telling Aubree about the name change by writing it on a cake, and Aubree was over-the-moon.

She even made Javi and their children matching shirts for the party.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to today,‚Äù Javi said, and the two were acting like they were married already even though they just made it official. Javi was stressed about the Kailyn situation, but was mushy about having Briana to help him through it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice having you by my side,‚Äù he told her.  Even though last week‚Äôs episode made it seem like Kailyn was in a relationship with her friend Dom, she shut rumors down this week by declaring she was too busy dealing with other people to be in a relationship. Although she was mostly referring to her children, the Briana/Javi drama might also have had something to do with it.  When Javi decided Briana was going to go to Lincoln‚Äôs party that he was supposed to cohost with Kailyn, Kailyn dropped out and had her own party. Briana exchanged some vicious texts with Javi‚Äôs ex, and it caught Kailyn off guard.  ‚ÄúShut the f‚Äîk up cause now I‚Äôm mad. S‚Äîk my d‚Äîk, you dumb bitch,‚Äù Briana texted Kailyn when Kailyn said she didn‚Äôt want to meet up with her to talk thing about.  After that explosion, Kailyn prohibited the crew from filming any part of the party because Briana was there. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that she‚Äôs a good person,‚Äù Kailyn said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anything to do with him.‚Äù  Nathan Might Still Be In Love With Jenelle  Jenelle Evans embarked on a new business venture and transformed her personal Facebook into a more professional page. However, the change made rumors swirl that she and David Eason were breaking up because her page no longer mentioned they were together. Her ex Nathan Griffith didn‚Äôt waste any time to text Jenelle to find out what was going on and tell her he wants the best for her.  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know s‚Äît about Kaiser. You don‚Äôt ask about Kaiser. But you ask if I‚Äôm broken up with David,‚Äù Jenelle told her friend about the text, who proclaimed that Nathan was just trying to weasel his way back into her life. To no one‚Äôs surprise, David lost it when he found out about the text. He got into a fight with Nathan over it and called him some extremely derogatory words. When Jenelle was suppose to drop off Kaiser to Nathan after, she sent David‚Äôs mother to avoid drama.  However, Nathan was so made about the texts, he went after David‚Äôs mom. He also seemed a little upset that the two were still together. ‚ÄúThey need to get off the drugs,‚Äù Nathan said. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do this no more.‚Äù  Leah Opens Up To Her Daughter  Leah Messer took her daughter Aleeah Grace to a therapist this episode to work out some behavioral issues she was dealing with. Aleeah was acting out, and Leah and her ex Corey Simms thought it had something to do with her twin getting more attention than her. The appointment went well, but Leah had to talk about her daughter‚Äôs problems in front of her, which made it awkward.  ‚ÄúIt was hard to talk about why you‚Äôre not always the nicest to Ali,‚Äù Leah told Aleeah afterward. ‚ÄúEven when you have a bad day, I still love you.‚Äù  Teen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

Getty Images  The publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.  Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts. Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.  Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.  What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.  A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Now, before everyone stars yelling 'incest' at Harry and Meghan's shared lineage, we'd like to point out that if you go far back enough to the Middle Ages, you're probably related to the man sitting next to you on the bus or your colleague sat opposite to you.  A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?  The news comes days after Channel 4's aired a documentary looking into the Californian star's life, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance."
"During Kanye West‚Äôs 11-month absence from the site, Twitter could hardly have been described as boring. Even without the 40-year-old rapper‚Äôs daily musings, the Twitterverse remained as addictive and corrosive as ever, thanks in large part to it having become, under the 45th president, a flashpoint for international diplomacy, partisan combat and ruthless trollery. But this past weekend, seemingly out of nowhere, Yeezy returned to the site where he once admitted to getting ‚Äúemotional over fonts‚Äù, declared The Life of Pablo ‚Äúthe album of the life‚Äù and wondered about the providence of a water bottle he discovered while on an airplane.  The rise and rise of Kanye West‚Äôs influence on fashion Read more  Having deleted all those old tweets, West started anew on Sunday with a remarkably on-brand, and predictably existentialist, message. ‚ÄúSome people have to work within the existing consciousness while some people can shift the consciousness,‚Äù he wrote, following it up with photos of forthcoming Yeezy footwear and the word ‚ÄúSaint‚Äù, West‚Äôs son‚Äôs name, in various typefaces.  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) often people working with the existing consciousness are jealous of those who are more in touch and they become hard-core capitalist in hopes of creating the illusion that the value of money is worth more than the value of time and friends  Following a 24-hour break, he returned again on Tuesday with a string of aphorisms: ‚ÄúAs a creative your ideas are your strongest form of currency,‚Äù read one tweet. ‚ÄúTry to avoid any contractual situation where you are held back from your ideas,‚Äù he wrote in another, which the MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes called ‚Äúextremely good advice‚Äù. West went on to call distraction ‚Äúthe enemy of vision‚Äù and instructed his 7.6 million followers to ‚Äúmake decisions based on love not fear‚Äù.  All these tweets made more sense once West, in a Hollywood Reporter interview with his interior designer Axel Vervoordt, revealed plans to release a philosophy book called Break the Simulation.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got this new concept that I‚Äôve been diggin‚Äô into,‚Äù he said, describing his Barthesian thesis about photography. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a concept about photographs, and I‚Äôm on the fence about photographs ‚Äì about human beings being obsessed with photographs ‚Äì because it takes you out of the now and transports you into the past or transports you into the future.‚Äù Time, West added, ‚Äúis our most valuable resource‚Äù.  To his longtime fans, the preoccupation with lofty ideas like time, capitalism and consciousness are just about the least surprising thing about the 21-time Grammy winner‚Äôs return to Twitter. He‚Äôs always been hip-hop‚Äôs pre-eminent and most brazen sage. What may come as a surprise, though, is the fact that West‚Äôs latest tweets are the book, as he revealed on Wednesday morning. ‚ÄúOh by the way this is my book that I‚Äôm writing in real time,‚Äù West wrote. ‚ÄúNo publisher or publicist will tell me what to put where or how many pages to write.‚Äù  KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) let's be less concerned with ownership of ideas. It is important that ideas see the light of day even if you don't get the credit for them. Let's be less concerned with credit awards and external validation.  Of course, a tweet-stream-of-consciousness book is not the only thing on West‚Äôs plate. The rapper-cum-designer is also reportedly working on his eighth studio album, his first since 2016‚Äôs The Life of Pablo, which was dropped during an elaborate listening session at New York‚Äôs Madison Square Garden. In a since-deleted tweet from 2016, West said his next album would be called ‚ÄúTurbo Grafx 16‚Äù, a title that‚Äôs presumably gone through a few iterations since, as West changed the name of his seventh album several times before settling on Pablo.  In March, E! News reported that West, along with several of his collaborators, was recording at a studio in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where ‚Äúhe is in the zone to get things done‚Äù. Rumored visitors of West‚Äôs, gleaned from Instagram posts and sightings in the Jackson area, reportedly included the Dream, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi and the Chicago rapper King Louie.  Nevertheless, exactly when West plans to release new music is unclear. He and his wife, Kim Kardashian, welcomed a third child, Chicago, in January, and he‚Äôs also hard at work on the latest collection for his clothing line, Yeezy. But if West‚Äôs insightful and reliably zany return to Twitter is any indication, he is not wanting for consciousness-shifting ideas."

"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption McGraw's second album, Not a Moment Too Soon, sold more than six million copies in the US alone  Country star Tim McGraw collapsed on stage during a performance in Dublin on Sunday night.  The singer had just performed his hit single Humble and Kind when he sat down near his keyboard player, then slumped to his knees as he walked off stage.  McGraw's wife, singer Faith Hill, later came out to tell the audience he could not continue with the performance.  ""He's been super dehydrated,"" she said. ""I apologise, but I made the decision that he cannot come back out on stage.""  After the audience chanted ""We love Tim"", Hill sang an a capella rendition of What A Friend We Have in Jesus, before the lights came up and the audience was ushered out.  McGraw, 50, was approaching the end of his set when he was taken ill at around 22:45 on Sunday night.  Audience member Del Crookes told the BBC the star's collapse ""was a bit of a shock"".  ""I thought he was taking in the applause while sitting down after singing Humble and Kind,"" he said.  ""But when a spotlight was switched on him, he was slumped on his knees on the left hand side of the stage. The light was quickly turned off and you could see his crew helping him off - and the band ran over as well.  ""It was about another 20 minutes before Faith Hill came out to say the show was ending early.""  The gig, at Dublin's 3 Arena was the final date of a three-day, three-city tour of the UK and Ireland, as part of the Country to Country festival.  McGraw and Hill were co-headliners, and had played in London on Friday night, then in Glasgow on Saturday.  Hill said the whole crew had been left ""a little bit dehydrated"" from ""travelling so much"".  A spokesman for McGraw said the star ""was attended to by local medical staff on-site and will be fine"".  ""He and Faith thank everyone for their love and support and look forward to seeing their Irish fans again soon.""  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tim McGraw and Faith Hill married in 1996  Recently, McGraw made headlines as being one of the few mainstream country artists to voice support for gun control.  On 3 March, he praised the US sporting goods store Dick's, after it raised the minimum age for anyone buying guns or ammunition to 21 years.  ""Thank you @Dicks for taking a stand to promote a meaningful discussion for the safety of our kids!"" McGraw wrote on Twitter, tagging other major retailers including Walmart, Kroger and LL Bean.  Those outlets later followed Dick's lead.  Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."
"CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photos or video on a mobile device  With Angelina Jolie finally moving on from her nasty, splashy split from Brad Pitt, you would expect her to shy away from dating someone else super-famous.  But you would think her next romantic interest would still be someone whose profession matched her preferences for prestige artistry or international do-gooding: a documentary filmmaker, a human rights crusader, an Ebola doctor.  But no, Jolie‚Äôs choice reportedly is far more home-grown and, well, mundane in a L.A. way.  Jolie, the Oscar winning actress, UNHCR special envoy and occasional New York Times op-ed columnist, is dating a real estate agent. That‚Äôs according to a new report in ‚ÄúEntertainment Tonight.‚Äù  Of course, at this stage, things are still pretty new, which means ‚Äúit‚Äôs not serious,‚Äù a source told ET.  But the so-called real estate agent, who has not been identified, reportedly has a few things going for him that would make him appealing to the glamorous 42-year-old actress and mother of six, ET said.  He‚Äôs handsome, a source close to the actress told ET. He‚Äôs also ‚Äúolder-looking‚Äù and isn‚Äôt ‚Äúa celebrity or high-profile‚Äù in any way, the source added. These are qualities that would probably make him relatively down-to-earth ‚Äî by Jolie standards ‚Äî and confer on him a maturity and stability that could be comforting to her.  After all, she was ‚Äúin a very bad place‚Äù after her acrimonious split from Pitt in September 2016, ‚ÄúET‚Äù reported. Their breakup included allegations of drinking and anger management problems ‚Äî on his part ‚Äî and led to investigations by child welfare authorities until the couple quietly worked out visitation and other issues. The estranged couple share children Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  ‚ÄúJust having another adult to spend time with has been helpful,‚Äù the source added to ET.  But not so fast, sources have told both Us Weekly and People. Both outlets reported Tuesday, citing their own Jolie sources, that Jolie isn‚Äôt dating a real estate agent ‚Äî or anyone for that matter at the moment.  ‚ÄúYes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it‚Äôs extremely low-key,‚Äù a source told Us.  Unfortunately, things are still difficult between her and Pitt, added The Daily Mail. ‚ÄúThings between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they‚Äôve attempted therapy with the children, they can barely be in the same room together,‚Äù a source said.

Because the breakup has forced Jolie to curtail her globe-trotting ways and base herself in Los Angeles ‚Äî close to Pitt for the sake of the children ‚Äî there is speculation that if Jolie were seeing a real estate agent ‚Äî or anyone else ‚Äî the man would be based in Los Angeles, the Daily Mail said.  And if there is a real estate agent with whom she has become friendly, he could be someone with celebrity clientele.  Perhaps he could have been someone involved in settling Jolie into her new house ‚Äî the $25 million estate in Los Feliz she bought last year, which once belonged to legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Incidentally, Jolie‚Äôs mansion is ‚Äújust down the street‚Äù from Pitt‚Äôs estate in Los Feliz ‚Äî for the sake of the kids, of course.  Whether or not there is a real estate agent boyfriend in Jolie‚Äôs life, or she‚Äôs just single and focusing on her kids, her friends are relieved to see her happy for a change, ET reported.  She also seems to have settled into enjoying her day-to-day life. She is often spotted out and about in Los Angeles, usually with one of her six kids in tow, doing ordinary-people things like shopping at a neighborhood Whole Foods or going to the movies ‚Äî including, reportedly, the new ‚ÄúTomb Raider‚Äù reboot, starring Alicia Vikander in the iconic role that Jolie made famous in 2001‚Äôs ‚ÄúLara Croft: Tomb Raider‚Äù and the 2003 sequel.  But fans should get over the idea that Jolie and Pitt will reunite. ‚ÄúIt will never happen,‚Äù a source told ET. The 54-year-old Pitt is quietly and casually going out on dates, but mostly getting out to spend time with friends, ‚ÄúET‚Äù added.  This story has been updated."

In October 2017, actor Anthony Rapp claimed Spacey had previously made inappropriate sexual advances toward him when he was just 14 years old.  In response, Spacey, now 58, issued a statement on Twitter addressing the allegations and coming out as gay.  ‚ÄúI have a lot of respect and admiration for Anthony Rapp as an actor. I‚Äôm beyond horrified to hear his story,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.‚Äù  Several more people accused the actor of sexual harassment or assault since, and in April, one sexual assault case against the star reported to have taken place in October of 1992 in West Hollywood involving a male adult was turned over to the Los Angeles County District Attorney‚Äôs Office for further review.  In November, the actor entered a treatment facility. He has not been out in public since and has been written off the finale season of House of Cards.  On Tuesday, actor Guy Pearce hinted at an unpleasant experience while working with Spacey.  ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ Tough one to talk about at the moment,‚Äù he said on Australian talk show host Andrew Denton‚Äôs Interview, according to Independent. ‚ÄúAmazing actor; incredible actor. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah. He‚Äôs a handsy guy.‚Äù"

"For the fictional character on the soap opera The Young and the Restless, see Nikki Newman  Nicole Houston Reed (born May 17, 1988)[1] is an American actress, screenwriter, singer-songwriter, and model known for her portrayal of vampire Rosalie Hale in The Twilight Saga (2008‚Äì2012). She became known in 2003, after the release of the film Thirteen, directed by Catherine Hardwicke, for which she was credited with Hardwicke as a co-writer of the screenplay, and in which she played a lead role. The film earned Reed an Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance, as well as several nominations.  Early life [ edit ]  Reed was born in West Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Cheryl Houston, a beautician, and Seth Reed, a production designer. She has an older brother, Nathan August Reed, and a younger half-brother Joey Reed.  Reed has said in numerous interviews that her early home life was ""complicated"". Her parents divorced when Reed was two, and she was raised by her mother.[2] Her mother is a Christian of Cherokee and Italian descent; her father is Jewish.[3] Reed was raised without religion[4] and has identified as Jewish.[5][6] She grew up around some Jewish practices, as her brother had a Bar Mitzvah.[7]  In 2002, when Reed was 14 years old, she moved out of her mother's house and began living on her own, mainly in apartments in the Los Angeles area.[8] After Thirteen's success, Reed returned to Alexander Hamilton High School in Los Angeles, but dropped out again after a year. She said that ""mothers who were sneaking into the school at lunchtime to confront and harass her about the film"" were the reason for her departure.[2] She earned a high school diploma through homeschooling.[2] She is a vegetarian.  Career [ edit ]  Catherine Hardwicke, a friend of her mother's,[9] invited her to work on a script with her, when Reed said she was interested in acting. They finished the script for the semi-autobiographical film Thirteen in six days. Producers asked Reed to play a role in the film because they had trouble casting it, as it was an ""uncomfortable"" role for most young actresses.[2]  Ondine at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival. Reed at the premiere ofat the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival.  The film, starring Evan Rachel Wood, was released in 2003 to positive reviews, gaining Reed some recognition in Hollywood as both a screenwriter and an actress. Following this, Reed was invited to appear on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and serve as host on a number of award shows, including the Young Hollywood Awards (2003) and the Independent Spirit Awards Nomination Show, followed by the West Independent Spirits Awards, both in 2004. Reed has repeatedly been cast as sexually advanced, precocious teenagers, including her character in Lords of Dogtown (2007), also directed by Hardwicke. In early 2006, she appeared on the series The O.C., playing Sadie, a new love interest for the character Ryan Atwood. Reed later appeared on The O.C. at the same time as future Twilight co-stars Cam Gigandet and Jackson Rathbone.[10]  Reed said that her early decision to avoid acting in television series or in mainstream cinema was na√Øve. She had thought at the time they were not right for her, but had since gained valuable experience in them.[11] She had a lead role in Mini's First Time, which received a limited release in the United States on July 14, 2006. Reed played a teenager who, through seduction, involves her stepfather in a plot to murder her mother. Reed has noted that her character does not ""understand the weight of consequence"". She said she had enjoyed playing someone who she describes as ""crass"" and having a ""trucker's mouth"".[12] Reed's character has sex scenes. As Reed was 16 at the time and legally unable to film such scenes in an explicit way, she was filmed from the back to hide her face.[2] On February 12, 2008, it was announced that Reed would portray Rosalie Hale in the film adaption of Twilight, the first book of a popular four-novel series. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke, it became an international success.  In 2010, Jason Mewes said that he was doing a movie called K-11 with Reed and Kristen Stewart, also of Twilight.[13] The film, directed by Stewart's mother, takes place in a dorm of the Los Angeles County Jail. It was to feature both Stewart and Reed as female characters.[14][15] Later that year, Reed said that she was no longer part of the project.[16]  In July 2010, Reed joined the cast of the lady assassin action-drama Catch .44, alongside Bruce Willis, Forest Whitaker and Malin Akerman.[17] In November 2010, it was announced that Reed would star with Hayden Panettiere in the film Downers Grove, a movie adaptation of Michael Hornburg's novel.[18] The screenplay was written by Bret Easton Ellis, the novelist who wrote The Rules of Attraction and American Psycho.[19]  In December 2011, it was announced that Reed joined the cast of Pawn, an indie crime thriller directed by David A. Armstrong. The film also stars Forest Whitaker, Ray Liotta, Common, Michael Chiklis, Sean Faris, Stephen Lang, Marton Csokas and Jessica Szohr.[20] In July 2013, Reed joined the cast of the independent sports comedy Balls Out, alongside Jake Lacy, Kate McKinnon, Beck Bennett and Jay Pharoah. The film is about a group of college friends who get together in their final year to play a game of intramural football.[21]  Music [ edit ]  Reed recorded a song, ""Now That I've Found You"", with her then-husband Paul McDonald, which debuted on Ryan Seacrest's radio show on November 15, 2011.[22] The couple released their first EP, The Best Part, on October 29, 2012.[23] Their song ""All I've Ever Needed"" is on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn ‚Äì Part 2 soundtrack.[24]  In January 2013, Reed filmed Hanson's 2013 music video for their single, ""Get the Girl Back"",[25] also with McDonald. The video was released in April 2013. Other well-known figures in the video include Kat Dennings, Drake Bell, Drew Seeley, Amy Paffrath, and Alex Beh.  Writing and directing [ edit ]  Reed wrote a script set in New Zealand between the 1960s and the 1980s. She has said she feels more versatile than her typecasting in roles of ""sexy bad girls."" She has sometimes been told by producers that she is too ""sexy"" for a particular part.[2] In November 2009, Reed directed a music video for her friend Sage while in London. Reed stated that they didn't have much time, or money, but she takes great pride in it.[26][27] Reed also intends to direct a music video for the independent rock band 100 Monkeys,[28] which is fronted by her Twilight co-star, Jackson Rathbone.  Personal life [ edit ]  Reed met Paul McDonald, a singer-songwriter and former American Idol contestant, on the red carpet at the premiere of Red Riding Hood in March 2011. This moment was broadcast on an American Idol episode as part of a segment that showed the contestants attending the premiere.[29] The couple began dating,[30] and moved in together not long after.[31] They confirmed their engagement in June 2011,[32] and married on October 16, 2011, in Malibu, California.[33] In March 2014, Reed and McDonald announced that they had separated after living apart for the previous six months due to ""work obligations"".[34] Reed filed for divorce in May 2014, citing ""irreconcilable differences"",[35] and the divorce was finalized on January 2, 2015.[36]  Reed began dating actor Ian Somerhalder in mid-2014.[37] They confirmed their engagement in February 2015,[38] and married on April 26, 2015, in Malibu, California.[39] On May 4, 2017, the couple announced via Instagram that Reed was pregnant with their first child.[40] They welcomed their child, a daughter, Bodhi Soleil, on July 25, 2017.[41]  Reed is close friends with her Twilight co-star Jackson Rathbone[42][43] and Spy Kids actress Alexa Vega, who was her matron of honor at her first wedding.[44]  Activism [ edit ]  Reed teamed up with Staples and Do Something for their third Annual School Supply Drive in the summer of 2011. She is also an animal rights advocate. She volunteers at animal shelters in her free time and she designed a limited edition collar and leash for Gilt to benefit Aspca. On October 22, 2014, she was honored with the ASPCA Compassion Award for her contributions to animal welfare.[45]  Reed endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[46]  Filmography [ edit ]  Television Year Title Role Notes 2006 Sadie Campbell 6 episodes 2006 Justice Molly Larusa 1 episode 2015‚Äì2016 Sleepy Hollow Betsy Ross 15 episodes  Awards and nominations [ edit ]"

Of course, it's the same designer who created Kate's wedding dress for her big day in April 2011.  Kate arrived at the service hand-in-hand with the bridesmaids, including daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, who were dressed in white with rose-adorned headbands.  She teamed her ensemble with a matching Philip Treacy hat and shoes by Jimmy Choo.  Though undeniably stunning, the Duchess' choice created a stir as wedding protocol dictates that only the bride wears white when tying the knot.

Kate wore a red bespoke Jenny Packham dress with a white lace collar to introduce her baby boy to the world, as she and William left the Lindo Wing at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital.

"Damn, mama! Kelly Rowland didn‚Äôt hold back with vivid descriptions of her post-baby body in her new book, Whoa, Baby! ‚Äî and she made sure to cover some very sensitive topics.  ‚ÄúAll that gnawing at your nipples will take its toll! In those early days, I was fascinated (my polite way of saying ‚Äòhorrified‚Äô) by the transformation of my boobs,‚Äù the 36-year-old singer wrote. ‚ÄúMy nipples were HUGE ‚Äî we are talking the size of Frisbees ‚Äî and sometimes I could see these veins bulging out while I was nursing.‚Äù  In her book, Rowland details many of her own experiences to help new parents navigate the tricky territory of parenthood. (She and her husband, Tim Weatherspoon, welcomed their son Titan Jewell back in 2014.)  ‚ÄúMy boobs themselves were so long and stretchy that I sometimes felt like I could‚Äôve swung them over my shoulders,‚Äù the former Destiny‚Äôs Child singer continued. Rowland added that despite her previous breast augmentation, the size and shape of her breasts still changed drastically from breastfeeding.  ‚ÄúEven with the silicon action, it was like some of the air had been sucked out and they just sort of hung there like flapjacks,‚Äù she said, noting, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but I know I‚Äôm going to see someone (wink, wink) after I have my second kid. In the meantime, I just tried to enjoy my ability to feed my baby!‚Äù  In a recent interview with USA Today, Rowland also tackled another body part that changed dramatically following Titan‚Äôs birth: her vagina.  ‚ÄúYour vajayjay does not look the same for a very long time,‚Äù she told the publication, adding that a friend told her not to worry about how her nether regions looked. ‚ÄúBut, I care about it.

"Legal battle with ex husband leave's the star's family 'desperately worried about her.'  Despite a tumultuous custody battle with ex Kevin Federline, Radar Online reports that Britney Spears may have other things on her plate that would explain her erratic behavior.  The publication broke the news that Spears is ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù for Sam Asghari, her current love interest, to propose, ‚Äúbut he‚Äôs dragging his feet and stalling.‚Äù  After completing a successful run of shows in Las Vegas, Spears allegedly immediately turned her attention to tying the knot with her 23-year-old boyfriend.  The same source claims that the real reasoning behind Spears being impatient is because of her immediate urge to have children with Asghari.  ‚ÄúAll she can talk about right now is having a baby. She wants a girl so bad and she‚Äôs madly in love with Sam.‚Äù  Asghari however, apparently is hesitant to act on Spear‚Äôs marriage advances, citing that he may not be mentally ready to completely settle down with the famous performer.  While this all occurs, Spears also is caught up in a heated legal battle with ex, Federline.  He is reportedly asking the star for more money in spousal and child support to help take care of himself along with their young children, Sean and Jayden.  Matthew Simmons / Getty Images  The same source mentioned that ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs freaking out over this court deposition and doesn‚Äôt see an end in sight to all the ugliness with Kevin.‚Äù  Spears met Federline, a professional dancer, in April 2004 and, aside from the fact that he already had a child on the way with ex-fianc√©e Shar Jackson, whom, at the time, he had only been split from for a very short period. Federline and Spears were engaged by July of that year.  Their marriage ceremony took place on September 18, 2004, with son Sean Preston being born barely a year later. Jayden James, their second son, was born a year after that. However, by November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline and began pursuing other romantic interests.  All of the drama surrounding Spears is prompting those closest to her to state that they are worried she may spiral off into something akin to her most famous public meltdown over a decade ago when she had shaved her head amongst other media-covered reckless acts.  However, the source still described the situation best by saying that ‚ÄúThere are still some major demons that Britney has to fight on a daily basis, and her workload never lets up. She feels the weight of the world on her shoulders right now, and her family‚Äôs desperately worried about her.‚Äù"
"Sandra Oh made history on Thursday, becoming the first Asian actor ever to receive an Emmy nomination in the best actress category.  The 46-year-old star, who leads BBC America‚Äôs Killing Eve, had previously been nominated for five supporting actress Emmys for her breakout role as Dr. Cristina Yang in ABC‚Äôs Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, which she starred on from 2005-14.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  She previously opened up about how she was shocked to have gotten the titular role in Killing Eve, explaining that she was used to being offered only supporting characters.  ‚ÄúWhen I got the script for Killing Eve, I remember I was walking around in Brooklyn and I was on my phone with my agent, Nancy. I was quickly scrolling down the script, and I can‚Äôt really tell you what I was looking for. So I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòSo Nancy, I don‚Äôt understand, what‚Äôs the part?‚Äô ‚Äù Oh recalled to Vulture in April. ‚ÄúAnd Nancy goes ‚ÄòSweetheart, it‚Äôs Eve, it‚Äôs Eve.‚Äô ‚Äú  Sandra Oh Dominik Magdziak Photography/Getty  Her surprise was the result of a bigger problem: racism she claimed to have experienced for so long in Hollywood that left her ‚Äúbrainwashed.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIn that moment, I did not assume the offer was for Eve,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think about that moment a lot. Of just going, how deep have I internalized this? [So] many years of being seen [a certain way], it deeply, deeply, deeply affects us. It‚Äôs like, how does racism define your work? Oh my goodness, I didn‚Äôt even assume when being offered something that I would be one of the central storytellers. Why? And this is me talking, right?‚Äù  ‚ÄúRacism exists. Let‚Äôs start there. I felt it, and I have felt it deeply. And I‚Äôm extremely fortunate. So I‚Äôm not going to not say that it‚Äôs not there, because it is,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAfter being told to see things a certain way for decades, you realize, ‚ÄòOh my god! They brainwashed me!‚Äô I was brainwashed! So that was a revelation to me.‚Äù  Ssandra Oh in Grey's Anatomy Randy Holmes/ABC via Getty  Although she has experienced the effects of racism throughout her acting journey, Oh said she believes in the power of positive perspective for minority performers.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs changing the mindset that being an actor of color, person of color, that you‚Äôre at a disadvantage in the creative life. That you don‚Äôt have opportunity. It‚Äôs all how you see the opportunity. And the clearer and deeper you get into what you really want, you just become a better artist. If that‚Äôs what you really want ‚Äî becoming a better artist ‚Äî does that include access? Does that include having 5 billion Instagram followers? I don‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs for you to decide,‚Äù she told Vulture.  She continued: ‚ÄúBut if what you want is to connect, if what you want is to be a great artist, I think you can find your way. Even within this giant paradigm that a lot of times doesn‚Äôt include people who look like us.‚Äù  Oh will face off against Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale), Claire Foy (The Crown), Keri Russell (The Americans), Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld) and Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) come Emmy night.  The 70th annual Emmys will air live from Hollywood on Sept. 17 (at 8 p.m. ET) on NBC."
"After being in limbo for three years after announcing their split in June 2015, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck‚Äòs marriage has officially come to an end.  PEOPLE confirmed the two finalized their divorce on Thursday after they met at Garner‚Äôs house with lawyers and a private judge.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The finalization came one day after news broke the actress, 46, had requested a private judge to handle the final details of their divorce, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.  The estranged couple announced their separation after 10 years of marriage and three children together: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6. Affleck, 46, and Garner began dating in 2004 and married in June 2005 before simultaneously filing for divorce in April 2017.  In the time between their split announcement and the divorce filing, the former couple presented a largely united front as they went through challenges together ‚Äî namely, Affleck‚Äôs recent rehab stay. Garner showed her support by driving him to the treatment facility.  Here‚Äôs an inside look into the former couple‚Äôs ups and downs.  ‚ÄúThe Love of My Life‚Äù  Six months after the former couple announced their split, Affleck was living in the guesthouse of their family home ‚Äî something that seemed to begin taking a toll.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs obvious many times that they both find it annoying to deal with each other,‚Äù an insider told PEOPLE at the time. ‚ÄúUnderstandably so. It‚Äôs a strange situation to live together and yet be separated.‚Äù  Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck at the 2013 Academy Awards Jason Merritt/Getty  ‚ÄúThey are doing what is working for the kids,‚Äù a Garner source noted of the living set-up.  For Affleck, keeping his mind on work apparently helped ease the pain of the separation. In September 2015, he was focusing on his directorial effort Live By Night and promoting Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. ‚ÄúHe is happier and a more fulfilled person when he‚Äôs busy all day and night working,‚Äù a film source told PEOPLE. A source close to the actor added, ‚ÄúHe is as happy as he can be in this position. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that easy, and definitely not that easy to do it in the public eye.‚Äù  In February 2016, Garner opened up about the ongoing divorce in an interview with Vanity Fair. While the actress called Affleck ‚Äúthe love of my life,‚Äù she also opened up about their marital struggles, telling the magazine, ‚ÄúI always say, ‚ÄòWhen his sun shines on you, you feel it. But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it‚Äôs cold.‚Äô He can cast quite a shadow.‚Äù  Affleck later told The New York Times, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs allowed to talk about it,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúShe felt like she wanted to discuss it and get it out there and get it over with so she could say, ‚ÄòLook, I already talked about it ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to do it again.‚Äô ‚Äù  After celebrating Easter as a family in Los Angeles that year, Affleck and Garner spent a month in Europe with their kids while he filmed Justice League, including time in London and a family getaway to Paris. ‚ÄúShe did have the best time in Europe with Ben and the kids,‚Äù a friend of Garner‚Äôs told PEOPLE. ‚ÄúShe seemed to enjoy spending time with Ben again.‚Äù  Co-Parenting After Their Split  Garner and Affleck stayed close as they continued to live and vacation together as well as co-parent their kids ‚Äî while also stepping out for solo outings. Shortly after announcing the separation, the entire family jetted off to the Bahamas to spend time together.  Jennifer Garner with her three children, Seraphina, Violet and Samuel at her Walk of Fame Ceremony in August Vince Flores/Startraksphoto.com  The family reunited again the following month in Atlanta, Georgia, where Garner was filming Miracles from Heaven. Affleck traveled to the Southern state to celebrate his 43rd birthday with his ex and the kids. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs happiest when he‚Äôs with his family,‚Äù a close friend told PEOPLE at the time.  In September 2015, the pair were spotted leaving a family counseling center in L.A. This marked their first visit to the center since announcing their divorce. Before their decision to separate, they attended weekly counseling sessions at the center but stopped going in the months leading to their split.  A source said they chose to remain friendly for reasons beyond parenting. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just for the kids ‚Äì it‚Äôs also for them,‚Äù said the source. ‚ÄúThey care about each other.‚Äù As the family continued to step out as a unit, observers noticed that Affleck and Garner seem to be looking happier after a tumultuous summer. ‚ÄúHis family is all [Ben] cares about. This is what makes him happy and it makes sense that he looks happier,‚Äù another source told PEOPLE. ‚ÄúHe enjoys the time with his family and that includes Jen.‚Äù  Since then, the two have worked hard at maintaining a harmonious relationship for the sake of their children. They recently took the kids to see Hello, Dolly! on Broadway in mid-July, starring family friend Victor Garber, and spent Easter together in Hawaii where Affleck was filming.  On Sunday, the two stepped out at church together with their children after Affleck completed 30 days in rehab. Three days later, Affleck and Garner stepped out with the kids again for a school event on Wednesday.  ‚ÄúHe went to church on Sunday with his family,‚Äù a source told PEOPLE. The source added Affleck was smiling during the outing because the 30-day milestone means ‚Äúhe has reason to celebrate.‚Äù  From Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous  Moving On  Affleck began dating Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus in 2017. The two made their relationship public when they were spotted grabbing dinner in July 2017.  The couple dated for more than a year, often taking trips together to Hawaii and Puerto Rico, where the actor was working. Affleck was even in attendance at the 2017 Emmy Awards in which Shookus, 38, took to the stage when SNL won for outstanding variety sketch series.  The two spent time together at Affleck‚Äôs home in Los Angeles and were often spotted grabbing dinner around the city.  In August 2018, a source told PEOPLE the two split because of the long distance between Affleck living in Los Angeles and Shookus being in New York. The two stopped being photographed together in July.  Upon his return to rehab, a source close to Shookus and Affleck told PEOPLE the producer ‚Äúhad been supporting Ben‚Äôs sobriety and going to meetings with him.‚Äù  ‚ÄúShe had him in meditation and they were doing it together,‚Äù the source said. ‚ÄúHis recovery was something that was very important to both of them.‚Äù  Ben Affleck and Shauna Sexton Lastarpix/BACKGRID  ‚ÄúIt was very hard for her to break up with Ben, but she knew he wasn‚Äôt getting better and that it was time for her to step aside,‚Äù the source continued. ‚ÄúShe was trying to stay as close to him as possible so that he would stay on the right path, but ultimately it just wasn‚Äôt possible. She knew she had to let him hit bottom.‚Äù  Not long after their split, the actor was spotted with 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton having dinner at Nobu in Malibu. Shortly after that, the two were seen visiting a Jack in the Box drive-thru together over the weekend.  In September, a source close to Affleck said he and Sexton were ‚Äújust getting to know each other.‚Äú  The model has been photographed leaving the actor‚Äôs home, driving his SUV and visiting him in rehab. They were photographed together this week leaving his home as he continued rehab treatment.  Entering Rehab  Multiple sources told PEOPLE in August the two were close to finalizing their divorce in the weeks leading up to Affleck‚Äôs return to rehab.

"How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?If they don‚Äôt want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from.

Perhaps we could figure out why they‚Äôre risking their lives entering both America and European countries if ‚Äúwestern culture‚Äù offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a ‚Äúdisputed view‚Äù of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, ‚ÄúRequiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‚Äòforced assimilation‚Äô of the Muslim community.‚ÄùHere‚Äôs the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right?

(Johnny Eggitt/AFP/Getty Images)  When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were married Saturday, there was one royal missing but not forgotten: Harry‚Äôs mother, Princess Diana.  Harry and his older brother, Prince William, have made sure to include their beloved late mother in their weddings.  [Listen on Retropod: Princess Diana‚Äôs final hours]  When William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, the engagement ring he gave her once belonged to Diana. And Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring containing diamonds from Diana‚Äôs jewelry collection. Markle is the same age as Diana when she died: 36.  Harry, Kensington Palace said in a statement this month, was ‚Äúkeen to involve his mother‚Äôs family in his wedding.‚Äù  Diana‚Äôs sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, gave a reading during the service at St. George‚Äôs Chapel inside Windsor Castle, which was decorated with white roses, Diana‚Äôs favorite flower. Diana‚Äôs two other siblings, Earl Spencer and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, also attended, with the Spencer family ‚Äúhelping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day.‚Äù  [Royal wedding 2018 live coverage]  Diana was devoted to her sons, and they were devoted to her. William was 15, and Harry was 12 when she was killed in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997. The boys were on vacation with their father, Prince Charles, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and he delivered the news to them.  ‚ÄúOne of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died,‚Äù Harry said last year in a BBC documentary that marked the 20th anniversary of her death. ‚ÄúHow you deal with that, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  Diana was renowned for her grace, beauty, philanthropic work ‚Äî and for her struggles with life in the royal family. She had divorced Charles and was estranged from him, but before her death, things were looking up.  She had a new beau, Dodi Al Fayed, and a whirlwind romance ‚Äî passionate, thrilling, scandalous.  The last day of Diana‚Äôs life began on the top deck of yacht, with croissants and fresh jams. She and Fayed sipped their coffee, marveling at the breathtaking Emerald Coast in Sardinia.  ‚ÄúThey were in a good mood,‚Äù his butler remembered later. ‚ÄúThey were always laughing, holding hands.‚Äù  Fayed, the son of Harrod‚Äôs department store owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, was a rich playboy. Diana was the mother of the future King of England and the most photographed woman in the world.  [Queen Charlotte and the wedding of Britain‚Äôs first mixed-race royal]    Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed in St. Tropez on Aug. 22, 1997. (Patrick Bar/AP)  The tabloid attention on them was intense.  That Saturday ‚Äî Aug. 30, 1997 ‚Äî promised to be a moment of change. The princess knew it. She sneaked a call to Richard Kay, a friend who covered the Royals for the Daily Mail, and told him, as he later wrote, ‚Äúshe had decided to radically change her life.‚Äù  Diana had decided that starting that weekend she would withdraw from public life and wrap up her obligations with charities.  Diana had not told Kay why, but he had a hunch: ‚ÄúThey were, to use an old but priceless cliche, blissfully happy. I cannot say for certain that they would have married, but in my view it was likely.‚Äù  In the 20 years since she‚Äôs been gone, there have been countless revisions to this love story. Her friends and relatives: They were not in love! His friends and relatives: They were in love!  Fayed wanted to propose that night, even though they had been dating less than a month. He had a diamond ring waiting in Paris, where he planned to pop the question over dinner.  [Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle: When royal wedding traditions fall]  As soon as they landed in Paris, Fayed saw the paparazzi out his window.  The couple headed for Fayed‚Äôs apartment ‚Äî trailed, of course, by photographers. More were waiting at the building‚Äôs front door when they arrived. Fayed was irate. There was an ugly shoving match.    Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed in the elevator at the Ritz Hotel the afternoon before they both died. (AP Photo/H.M. Coroner)  They tried to go to a restaurant ‚Äî Chez Benoit, a cozy, casual bistro not far from the city center ‚Äî but it was quickly overrun by photographers. They split and headed for The Ritz, ducking into the dining room hoping to be left alone. But other diners were staring.  The couple left and had their food delivered to the Imperial Suite. Fayed‚Äôs proposal plan was in shambles. The only option left was to head back to his apartment.  The hotel was swarming with photographers, so Fayed devised a plan: The couple‚Äôs driver and bodyguards would make a big show out front, appearing to get their caravan of Mercedes sedans ready to leave. Meanwhile, the princess and Fayed would slip out the back door and take a borrowed car driven by a hotel security officer.  The couple did get away, but what happened next was the subject of lengthy investigations and conspiracy theories that live on today. As the couple sped off, the photographers out front got tipped off about the escape, quickly catching up on their motorcycles. Their driver darted in and out of traffic, finally crashing inside a tunnel near the Eiffel Tower. It turned out he had been drunk behind the wheel.  Fayed died instantly. Diana died at the hospital. Her death startled the world.    Prince William (left) and Prince Harry, bow their heads as their mother‚Äôs coffin is taken out of Westminster Abbey after her funeral.

And you keep asking yourself, ‚ÄòWhy me?‚Äô the whole time. Why? What have I done, why has this happened to us?‚Äù  Harry remembers his initial reaction as ‚Äúdisbelief, refused to accept it. There was no sudden outpour of grief.

"Angelina Jolie is allegedly surviving on little to no food, with sources questioning whether the stress of her divorce with Brad Pitt is to blame for her weight loss.  According to OK! Magazine, as cited by Gossip Cop, the actress has developed a smoking habit that‚Äôs so bad, she finds herself smoking an entire pack every single day, and to make matters worse, Angelina Jolie isn‚Äôt eating much on top of that.  Sources tell the publication that the A-list actress wakes up in the morning and finds herself smoking with a cup of coffee before the kids wake up, and she reportedly breaks the habit until her children are fast asleep before she carries on again.  Supposedly, Angelina Jolie smokes heavily throughout the morning and evening, and in the afternoon, there‚Äôs nothing that she consumes other than French cheese and expensive wine, which has greatly affected her weight, an insider stresses.  She‚Äôs nowhere near as healthy as she used to be, but the outlet fails to mention what her actual reasons are for this drastic diet she‚Äôs adapted to, though fans would want to believe that it‚Äôs presumably due to the supposed stress dealing with her divorce from Brad Pitt.  Whatever the case may be, it‚Äôs evidently clear that Angelina Jolie has been losing weight, which sources tell OK! Magazine is simply through the way that the mother of six has been treating herself as of late.  ‚ÄúAnytime I feel lost, I pull out a map and stare. I stare until I have reminded myself that life is a giant adventure, so much to do, to see.‚Äù ‚Äì Angelina Jolie A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angelinajolieofficial) on Nov 20, 2017 at 3:49pm PST  Angelina Jolie has never shied away from her dark past, which consisted of multiple health issues, but she has never commented on people‚Äôs recent concerns regarding her weight loss.  A statement regarding new claims about her unhealthy food intake will most likely not be addressed by the actress, for she has stayed away from even commenting on anything that concerns her weight.  Angelina Jolie has yet to finalize her divorce from Brad Pitt, as the couple continues to work out a custody plan with visitation rights that they are both in agreement with.  Despite OK! Magazine‚Äòs claims, Gossip Cop‚Äòs sources question the credibility of the outlet‚Äôs insiders, insisting that the story regarding Angelina Jolie‚Äôs weight loss is far from true.  Jolie famously filed for divorce last September, with reports at the time claiming that Pitt‚Äôs alcohol addiction had gotten so out of hand, it was beginning to affect everyone‚Äôs life around him, including his own family.  Angelina Jolie has remained single ever since."

"We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico‚Äôs border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration‚Äôs National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA‚Äôs term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman.

"Image zoom Photo Illustration. Photos: Shutterstock, Getty Images  If you've spent even .01% of your time watching the Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's love story unfold, you are well aware that comparisons Princess Diana has been invoked pretty often.  The late Princess of Wales has been mentioned constantly since the couple's engagement announcement back in November, and hey, we're just as guilty of waxing poetic about it too. But there's some truth to the comparison, even if you're a skeptic.  The Duchess of Sussex truthfully does have a good amount in common with her mother-in-law, to the point where the first ones to draw the parallel were actually Meghan and Harry themselves. They brought Di up in their engagement interview, where Harry made it clear how close he imagined they would be if his mother was still alive.  ""Oh they'd be thick as thieves, without question,"" Prince Harry said. ""I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me, but then, as I said, would have probably been best friends‚Äîbest friends with Meghan. It's days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's ... ""  "" ... she's with us,"" Markle finished.  RELATED: Singer Bryan Adams Was Asked Point-Blank About His Relationship with Princess Diana  Who are we to argue with that? Luckily we don't have to, since there's plenty of evidence to back it up, even without Harry's perspective in the mix. Allow us to break it down.  They are humanitarians.  This is probably the most striking comparison drawn between the two royals. Princess Diana was famously activism-focused. Her legacy is one of humanitarian work and beloved reverence now, but during her time as a princess while she was still alive, she was met with heated criticism for doing things like fighting the AIDS stigma in a time when even the U.S. president Ronald Reagan wouldn't acknowledge the disease existed. Not everyone understood what she was doing and why, but in hindsight, it all makes complete sense.  Markle has also shown herself to be an advocate, and she's spoken about gender equality, social justice, and feminism openly. Now that she has a larger global platform, it will be exciting to see what she chooses to do with it.  They're rule breakers.  As Markle gets the hang of this whole royals thing, she's made a few stumbles here and there. She's got good company, though. As some remember, Diana didn't always hesitate to break or bend the rules herself.  After choosing her own engagement ring and writing her own vows, she had Prince William and Prince Harry and insisted they went to school normally. That might seem like a ""no duh"" move now, but according to Good Housekeeping, William was actually the first heir to the throne to attend a public school. Ever.  Image zoom Tim Graham/Getty Images  That makes Markle walking herself partway down the aisle during the royal wedding seem like nothing.  Their parents are divorced.  Diana's father John Spencer and her mother Frances Spencer split when Di was seven years old. Markle went through something similar when her parents, Doria Ragland and the now-infamous Thomas Markle, separated when she was two years old, as she told Vanity Fair.  RELATED: Why Meghan Markle‚Äôs Wearing So Much Pink, According to Royal Experts  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs so incredible, you know, is that my parents split up when I was two, [but] I never saw them fight. We would still take vacations together. My dad would come on Sundays to drop me off, and we‚Äôd watch Jeopardy! eating dinner on TV trays, the three of us,"" she said. ""We were still so close-knit.‚Äù  They didn't date their future husbands long before getting engaged.  Harry and Meghan's seemingly whirlwind relationship drew ire from skeptics, since they only met in summer 2016, and were engaged November 2017. Turns out, Diana and her ex Prince Charles were the same before they wed. Princess Diana started dating Charles in summer 1980, and they were engaged by February 1981.  Their engagement rings coordinated.  The likeness of the two royals is physically manifested in the engagement ring Prince Harry gave Markle. Her ring includes two diamonds from Diana's collection, with the center stone being from Botswana.  Image zoom Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images  They weren't born royal.  They share this commonality with Kate Middleton as well. None of them were born into royalty, yet they all learned (and are learning) the ropes in their own ways.  RELATED: Meghan Markle Just Broke Her Silence on Her Marriage to Prince Harry and It‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ Something  All that said, they do have unique differences.  Of course, it's evident that they aren't twins, and it isn't fair to pass them off that way for the rest of Meghan and Harry's lives. The differences are also there. Diana grew up in a well-known British family that had ties to Queen Elizabeth from the get-go. Markle, on the other hand, was born in Los Angeles to a yoga instructor and lighting director.  Unlike Diana, Meghan wore two dresses at her wedding. Markle's family didn't meet the royals until days before the wedding, and her dad still hasn't met Harry, unlike Diana, who had closer ties to the royals long before she started dating Charles. Markle had been married and divorced before marrying Harry. There doesn't seem to be a Camilla Parker-Bowles-like figure in the dynamic between Harry and Meghan like there was for Charles and Diana.  But still, it's nice to peer closely at what they do have in common."

"Former aide to President Trump Omarosa Manigault Newman was asked by her ‚ÄúCelebrity Big Brother‚Äù co-star if she ever had a sexual relationship with the commander-in-chief.  The former ‚ÄúApprentice‚Äù star, who worked for the Trump administration as the director of communications for the White House, was asked during Friday night‚Äôs episode of the reality show if she slept with Trump, Entertainment Weekly reported.  OMAROSA USED ‚ÄòSTRICTLY FORBIDDEN‚Äô WHITE HOUSE CAR SERVICE FOR HER COMMUTE: REPORT  ‚ÄúDid you ever sleep with him?‚Äù asked Brandi Glanville, star of ‚ÄúThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù Manigault Newman responded.  ‚ÄúTrump,‚Äù Glanville said.  ‚ÄúHell no! Oh, my God. Brandi, that‚Äôs horrible,‚Äù Manigault Newman said.  However, the former White House aide appeared to hint that another person was having sexual relations with people in the White House.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone in the White House that‚Äôs sleeping with everybody, but she is not me‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had to do that,‚Äù she replied.  OMAROSA ON ‚ÄòCELEBRITY BIG BROTHER‚Äô: TRUMP TWEETS HAUNTED ME, HAD TO ‚ÄòSERVE‚Äô MY COUNTRY  Glanville said she asked her the question because she heard rumors some ‚ÄúCelebrity Apprentice‚Äù contestants had sexual relationships with Trump when he was the show‚Äôs host.  Manigault Newman asked Glanville if she ever heard her name in the rumors.  ‚ÄúNo. He seemed to like you so much, I was just wondering,‚Äù Glanville replied.  Manigault Newman snapped back, ‚ÄúGod no, I‚Äôm just ratings gold.‚Äù  Since the ‚ÄúCelebrity Big Brother‚Äù premiere, Manigault Newman has continued to dominate the headlines with her remarks about her time in the Trump White House. Earlier this month, she tearfully confessed to being ‚Äúhaunted‚Äù by Trump‚Äôs tweets.  ‚ÄúI was haunted by tweets every single day,‚Äù she told contestant Ross Matthews. ‚ÄúWhat is he going to tweet next?‚Äù  In a Feb.12 episode, she trashed Vice President Mike Pence, calling him ‚Äúscary.‚Äù  ‚ÄúCan I just say this, as bad as you all think Trump is, you‚Äôd be worried about Pence. Everybody that‚Äôs wishing for impeachment might want to reconsider their lives,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou would be begging for days of Trump back if Pence became president. He‚Äôs extreme. I‚Äôm Christian, I love Jesus. But he thinks Jesus tells him to say things, and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòJesus didn‚Äôt say that.‚Äô Scary.‚Äù  On Dec. 13, the White House announced Manigault Newman‚Äôs last day with the administration would be on Jan. 20, 2018 after she reportedly drew scrutiny from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.  ‚ÄúCelebrity Big Brother‚Äù airs on CBS."
"Caitlyn Jenner told Diane Sawyer that she had undergone ""the final surgery"" in her gender reassignment procedures on Friday night's ""20/20"" special.  The former Olympian previously known as Bruce confirmed in her book ""The Secrets of My Life,"" coming out on Tuesday, that the 2017 ""surgery was a success.""  And Jenner said on the ABC interview, she had ""no regrets, none whatsoever.""  Beyond that, Jenner didn't want to talk about the details, telling Sawyer, ""I‚Äôm not going to dwell on that subject. It's not an appropriate question to ask a trans person.""  But nothing else was off-limits, as Sawyer caught up with Jenner nearly two years after the TV journalist had done their last emotional interview. Then, the ex-athlete stunned the world by revealing how he had lived a lie. Inside, ex-decathlon champ Jenner had always identified as a woman.  Since then, Jenner said she has been ""happy, peaceful‚Ä¶all of that confusion has left me‚Ä¶.I did the right thing"" -- and doesn't miss ""Bruce"" a bit.  Sporting red nails and stylishly feminine clothing, Jenner recalled how‚Äîwhen he was still known as Bruce--he had put an instruction in his will: ""When I'm buried, I want to be dressed as her 'cause that's the way I'm going to heaven.""  As many know from her former reality show, ""I Am Cait,"" Jenner is a Republican and she confided to Sawyer, ""Yes, I did vote for Trump.""  Jenner was initially impressed with Trump for reaching out to transgender people at the Republican National Convention and noted, ""He wanted me to come play golf with him.""  But Jenner got upset when President Trump's administration revoked the federal guidelines that allowed public school students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity--believing it's an issue best left to state and local authorities to decide.  ""It was extremely disappointing‚Ä¶you mess with my community, you don't give us equality and a fair shot, I'm coming after you,"" Jenner sighed about President Trump's decision.  Although Jenner has had her jawline, forehead, and breasts worked on, she insists she's always been a woman because what's important is ""what's between your ears.""  Jenner said she's fine with her ex-wife, Kris Jenner, and stays in touch with all her kids while they pursue their own lives.  ""Nobody calls that much. I reach out to them,"" commented the former ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" star.  Jenner told Sawyer that she has ""never been on a date"" in the two years since she came out as transgender, and doesn't really see dating in her future.  Instead, Jenner is most focused on helping the transgender community through charities and building awareness about discrimination and other issues.  ""I want to fight this fight,"" she vowed.  For more on Caitlyn Jenner, tune in to Tucker Carlson on Monday night for his exclusive interview with the star. It will be Carlson's first time in his new 8 p.m. EST slot."

"A lawsuit Kendall and Kylie Jenner were facing for a line of ‚Äúvintage‚Äù tees featuring rapper Tupac Shakur‚Äôs image released by their eponymous clothing line, Kendall + Kylie, was dropped by the photographer who was suing the stars.  According to a document filed in federal court Wednesday, both parties are requesting to dismiss the suit brought forward by photographer Michael Miller last summer.

"Christina Aguilera is one of the best vocalists in the pop music industry, but her record breaking success has been tainted by her tumultuous personal life. Her two and a half year relationship with Matthew Rutler appears to be solid and happy, but Star magazine claims that this is only smoke and mirrors. A source reveals, ‚ÄúTheir relationship is convenient. It was always casual, very on and off, and not something Christina saw a future in.‚Äù The magazine further alleges that Aguilera is ‚Äúready for a new man‚Äù and that she‚Äôs ‚Äúalready on the prowl for a replacement.‚Äù  Aguilera‚Äôs temporary departure from The Voice signaled a massive change in her career. Not only did she regain the humungous success she once had, but she also built a completely new fan base from scratch. Aguilera has also been steadfast in her romantic affairs, but there‚Äôs still an opportunity for artistic ambition to give her relationship with Rutler a death blow.  This is, however, highly unlikely.  The source continues, ‚ÄúChristina plans on being ‚Äòofficially‚Äô single by the time she begins promoting her new album and tour. She‚Äôs wasting no time setting her sights on a number of eligible bachelors. [She] wants an A-list boyfriend to complement her newfound confidence.

The low-key couple stepped out at Hawksmoor, a steak restaurant in the Covent Garden district of the U.K. capital. They held hands as they walked down the street to the award-winning eatery.

According to HollywoodLife, Zayn is growing increasingly fearful that Harry‚Äôs new solo material will outshine his own.

"Whitney, a new documentary about Whitney Houston that debuted at the Cannes Film Festival on Wednesday, revealed new details about the late iconic singer.  The documentary, directed by Kevin Macdonald, suggests that Houston was allegedly sexually abused as a child by Dee Dee Warwick, Houston‚Äôs cousin and the sister of soul singer Dionne Warwick.  The news comes near the end of the film, when Houston‚Äôs former longtime assistant, Mary Jones, alleges that Houston told her that she was molested as a young child by her cousin Dee Dee, the niece of Houston‚Äôs mother Cissy Houston.  READ MORE: Lorde apologizes for posting ‚Äòpoorly chosen‚Äô Whitney Houston quote on Instagram  Jones mentions that Houston‚Äôs alleged molestation had a lasting effect on her life and contributed to her late-life drug problems.  ‚ÄúIt made her question her sexual preference,‚Äù she says in Whitney. Jones also says that Houston never told her mother because ‚ÄúI think she was ashamed.‚Äù  Jones continues: ‚ÄúIf Cissy had known, she would have done something about it, because Cissy loves her children.‚Äù  READ MORE: Lars von Trier serial killer movie causes mass walkout at Cannes  Houston‚Äôs half-brother Gary Garland-Houston also says he was molested between the ages of seven and nine by a female family member, and says his sister was abused too.  Dee Dee Warwick, who was 18 years older than Houston, died in 2008. She was twice nominated for a Grammy Award and sang backup for Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin and others.  The allegations made in the documentary Whitney, which was made with the cooperation of Houston‚Äôs family, immediately cast a new light on Houston‚Äôs troubled life.  The singer died at the age of 48 in 2012 from what was ruled an accidental drowning in a bathtub. A coroner‚Äôs report into her death cited heart disease and drug use as contributing factors. Houston never spoke publicly about her own alleged abuse.  READ MORE: Whitney Houston death: Bobby Brown says she didn‚Äôt die from drugs  ‚ÄúWe always wanted our film to be a corrective to that tabloid story,‚Äù said producer Simon Chinn. ‚ÄúThese are specific revelations that I think will get people to a deeper understanding of who Whitney was and in many ways redeem her as a person.‚Äù  Whitney, which is to be released in theatres July 7, suggests that the alleged incidents of abuse took place while Cissy Houston was touring. Houston, who had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, with Bobby Brown, is said to have insisted on taking Bobbi on tour with her.  Bobbi Kristina died in 2015. She was found unresponsive in a bathtub and died after being in a coma for six months.  Representatives for Dionne Warwick have not commented on the allegations.  ‚ÄîWith files from the Associated Press"
"Producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, who also oversaw the last show, will be reteaming with him for the 90th Academy Awards.  Jimmy Kimmel will be back as host of the Oscars when the 90th edition of the annual Academy Awards ceremony is held March 4.  The Academy and ABC announced Tuesday that the late night host will reunite with producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd for the 2018 show.  The trio teamed up for the first time for the most recent Oscar show Feb. 26, and while all three generally got good reviews, their contributions were overshadowed by the last-minute envelope gaffe that resulted in La La Land, and not the actual winner Moonlight, being announced as the best picture victor. As part of the official announcement, Kimmel joked, ""If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show.""  As for ratings, their maiden effort resulted in a 4 percent drop in viewership from the prior year as the show attracted 32.9 million viewers.  Still, ABC, which was granted a larger advisory capacity about key elements of the show when the Academy renewed its contract with the network through 2028 last summer, was eager to see the host of its Jimmy Kimmel Live! invited back.  ‚ÄúJimmy, Mike and Jennifer are truly an Oscar Dream Team,‚Äù Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in announcing their selection. ‚ÄúMike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one our finest hosts in Oscar history.‚Äù  Added Kimmel, ‚ÄúHosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [Academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd.""  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not often you get two chances to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience and even more rare to be handed the keys to a party 90 years in the making,‚Äù De Luca and Todd offered in a joint statement. ‚ÄúWe always thought the idea that anything can happen on the Oscars was a cliche until we lived it.‚Äù  ""Our Oscars team this year delivered a show that hit every high note,"" Hudson said. ""Jimmy brought back the essence and light touch of the greatest hosts of Oscars past. Mike and Jennifer's love of movies is infectious and touched every aspect of the show. This is the perfect team to lead us into the ninth decade.""  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey observed, ‚ÄúAfter just one year, we can‚Äôt imagine anyone else hosting The Oscars. Jimmy‚Äôs skillful command of the stage is invaluable on a night when anything can happen ‚Äî and does. With Mike and Jennifer at the helm, we‚Äôre ready for another unforgettable show that will dazzle, delight and, most importantly, honor 90 years of Hollywood‚Äôs most prestigious award.‚Äù  The early announcement represents something of a break with Academy tradition, which in the past has first seen the Academy president select the show's producers and the producers then pick a host ‚Äî a process that has sometimes resulted in a protracted search. Boone Isaacs, having completed four successive, one-year terms as president, will be stepping down in July, as the Academy's board of governors elects a new president. But rather than wait for a new president to take over, the Academy is moving forward with plans for next year's show.  The early announcement is not unprecedented, though. In both 2013 and 2014, the Academy announced in mid-April that producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who first produced the 2013 show, would be returning to produce both the 2014 and 2015 shows. Both the Academy and ABC prefer to have producers who've already cut their teeth on one broadcast returning to handle the next year's show, because it eliminates the learning curve facing new producers and provides for continuity of staffing.  Extending an early callback to Kimmel, De Luca and Todd, ensures that all three will have plenty of time to prepare for next year's show, which doesn't take place until the first Sunday in March so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics, which will be taking place the last weekend of February. Last year, Todd and De Luca were not named to produce the 89th Oscars until early November, and Kimmel wasn't given the hosting assignment until early December. ""I had to be at least eighth [choice],"" Kimmel joked to THR. ""It took so long for them to ask."""

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.  MTV said on Monday that ‚ÄúLohan Beach Club‚Äù will follow the actress as she works to expand a recently launched nightclub and restaurant business in Greece.  The TV network said the show, expected to air in 2019, will see Lohan, 32, lead a team of ‚Äúbrand ambassadors‚Äù who will help promote her business ‚Äúwhile striving to rise above the temptations the Mykonos night life scene has to offer.‚Äù  Lohan, once one of Hollywood‚Äôs most-sought after young actresses after starring roles in ‚ÄúThe Parent Trap‚Äù and ‚ÄúMean Girls,‚Äù went to rehab six times between 2007 and 2013, and was in and out of jail and court repeatedly for offenses ranging from theft to drunken driving and drug possession.  Her last feature movie was the 2013 low-budget thriller ‚ÄúThe Canyons‚Äù after which she moved to London, and later Dubai. Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy ‚ÄúSick Note,‚Äù in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.  The Mykonos beach club is Lohan‚Äôs third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.

"Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux Latest Rumors: ‚ÄòFriends‚Äô Alum to Pay ‚ÄòThe Leftovers‚Äô Actor Millions for His Silence?  Monday, July 23, 2018 5:09 AM UTC  Following the split of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, a lot of rumors have been speculating on what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes. The most recent of these is the regurgitated claim that the ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù actress is willing to shell out $6.7 million to buy the silence of her ex-husband, as OK! Australia reported (via Gossip Cop).  Allegations are making the rounds that Justin Theroux is projected to make a lot of money if he writes a book regarding his relationship with Jennifer Aniston. The former celebrity couple had been together for seven years and were married for three, so it goes without saying that Justin knows about Jen‚Äôs personal life quite a bit.  However, there is no certainty of any payout whatsoever that has been confirmed by Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux. Friends and close acquaintances of the two also didn‚Äôt mention such an agreement, which would make these stories a complete fabrication.  Tabloids have been quick to spew these stories after Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux‚Äôs breakup, creating claims that would make catchy headlines. What‚Äôs more, the origins of these outright lies are mostly written by magazines that are managed by the same company.  For instance, OK! Australia and Radar Online are overseen by American Media Incorporated. Both these magazines have published stories in the past that were questionable at best and obviously deceptively at worst. Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are but the latest subjects that these tabloids are covering since their breakup is relatively new.  The ex-couple previously said that while they decided to end their relationship, they‚Äôre doing so with no resentment towards each other. In fact, the two even released a statement that even though they‚Äôre separated, they still want to maintain their relationship as friends. So the rumors that Justin Theroux is writing a book about his time with Jennifer Aniston to simply make a quick profit are simply unfounded."

"After being courted for several months, Leonardo DiCaprio will star in Quentin Tarantino‚Äôs untitled Charles Manson movie, sources confirmed to Variety.  DiCaprio will play an aging, out-of-work actor in the film. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, is being eyed for the role of Sharon Tate.  This will mark DiCaprio‚Äôs first film since winning the Oscar in 2016 for his performance in Alejandro G. I√±√°rritu‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Revenant.‚Äù DiCaprio and Tarantino last collaborated on 2012‚Äôs ‚ÄúDjango Unchained.‚Äù  He is repped by LBI Entertainment.  As previously reported, Tom Cruise is also being pursued to star in the director‚Äôs ninth feature. Sources now tell Variety that Tarantino is interested in casting Al Pacino in the film as well. Sony is handling distribution.  The movie will hit theaters on Aug. 9, 2019, Variety has learned. Opening on the 50th anniversary of the day that the Manson family committed the LaBianca murders and the day after Tate was killed, the film will head off against ‚ÄúArtemis Fowl,‚Äù Disney‚Äôs adaptation of the popular sci-fi and fantasy series.  Sony beat out several bidders, including Warner Bros. and Paramount, for rights to the film. The movie ‚Äî shrouded in secrecy ‚Äî is set in 1969 and is believed to involve Charles Manson and the Manson family murders. The director has told media outlets that it‚Äôs not a biopic, but is an ensemble film set during the tumultuous time period. It‚Äôs the first pic that Tarantino is releasing without the Weinstein Company. A group of investors led by Maria Contreras-Sweet is in a strong position to buy the Weinstein Company following sexual misconduct allegations against its disgraced founder Harvey Weinstein.  Deadline Hollywood first reported the news."
"Kourtney Kardashian may be at it again. In recent weeks, both Kim Kardashian and her younger sister, Kylie Jenner have welcomed new baby girls after super secret pregnancies. Add in the fact that middle-sister Khloe is also pregnant and expecting her first child in early April, according to her Twitter, and the Kardashian clan couldn‚Äôt be happier. Still, you‚Äôve heard the saying ‚Äòwhen it rains it pours.‚Äô Sure enough, ENews‚Äô sneak peeks of the newest episode airing this Sunday, February 25 show Kourtney dishing to her sisters about a potential little cousin for brand new babies, Chicago and Stormi. So, straight up: Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant? Is she really going to freeze her eggs?  While there are no confirmations at this point that Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant, Kourtney‚Äôs own words suggest she‚Äôs got baby number four on her mind. And we know KUWTK crews film episodes several weeks to months before they air. Spoiler videos for this Sunday‚Äôs episode, ‚ÄúTrimester Trouble,‚Äù reveal Kourtney‚Äôs plan to freeze her eggs as ‚Äúinsurance,‚Äù that she can have a fourth child in the future. So will we know at the end of this episode if Kourtney‚Äôs going to freeze her eggs?  Kourtney also revealed that she uses an IUD as birth control with her current boyfriend, model, Younes Bendjima, 24. Adding, however, that she wouldn‚Äôt mind taking it out if her partner wanted children in the near term. It seems that the Kardashian women are on a pregnancy roll. But what about the boys, or should we say, Kardashian Kastoffs?  Kardashian Exes Talk Babies and New Boyfriends  Khloe‚Äôs ex-husband, Lamar Odom discloses in a not-yet-aired interview with Access Hollywood, that he‚Äôs happy for Khloe about her pregnancy with new boyfriend, Cavaliers player, Tristan Thompson. Lamar can be heard saying that, ‚Äúit couldn‚Äôt happen to a better person,‚Äù US Magazine reports. Still, he admits hearing the bombshell Khloe divulged in the season 13 finale, that she was only ‚Äúfake trying‚Äù to get pregnant while she was married to him, was ‚Äúhurtful.‚Äù  Similarly, Kylie‚Äôs famous on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend, Tyga had good things to say about Kylie and her new baby. He told radio interviewer, DJ Akademiks that, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no bad blood, no problems.‚Äù And while the 28-year-old rapper didn‚Äôt comment on Stormi specifically during this interview, he did admit that he and Kylie still ‚Äúcommunicate.‚Äù And that did nothing to squash internet rumors that Tyga may be the biological father of the 20-year-old cosmetics mogul‚Äôs new daughter.  And what about Kourtney‚Äôs ex and baby-daddy, Scott Disick? The man who got Kourtney Kardashian pregnant three times in the past is plenty busy hitting the town with new girlfriend, 19-year-old Sophia Richie, younger daughter of Lionel Richie. And on the Rob Kardashian front, there‚Äôs not much news yet. Momager Kris‚Äôs only son, Rob, has not found love again. At least not after his much-publicized breakup with Blac Chyna, the mother of one-year-old Dream Kardashian. But with all these new babies on the scene, who has time to date?"

"At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites ‚Äî including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. ‚ÄúGwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,‚Äù a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. ‚ÄúBlake sang a lot in her direction.‚Äù At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: ‚ÄúTheir dog was having puppies and they couldn‚Äôt wait to get home!‚Äù  For now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. ‚ÄúBlake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,‚Äù an insider shares in the new issue. ‚ÄúTheir feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they‚Äôve decided to not focus on it for the time being.‚Äù  Stefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals.

With no baby, they‚Äôve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, ‚ÄúGwen is very traditional and wouldn‚Äôt want to be pregnant without being married.‚Äù  Still, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. ‚ÄúTheir relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,‚Äù explains the source. ‚ÄúThe need to get married and have kids isn‚Äôt the priority it once was.‚Äù  When the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.  Now, the pair have settled in to an ‚Äúeasy, effortless love‚Äù together, says the source.

""There was something really exciting about the idea of not knowing someone, just letting a relationship exist exclusively on the screen,"" the 36-year-old actor noted.

Other than her July court hearing to testify against the DJ who was convicted of groping her, she hasn‚Äôt made any public appearances in nearly nine months. Paparazzi have only gotten glimpses of her, bundled in hoodies and dashing into cars with her new boyfriend, British actor Joe Alwyn, 26. She deleted her entire Instagram history in August, before dropping her provocative comeback single ‚ÄúLook What You Made Me Do,‚Äù but she still hasn‚Äôt come out from underground.  Part of the reason, insiders tell OK!, is that Taylor‚Äôs well-documented drama ‚Äî public spats with Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and Calvin Harris, to name a few ‚Äî got to be too much last year, so she made a dramatic decision to go into hiding and focus solely on her music. But a source says her self-inflicted sequestration is only spurring more curiosity: ‚ÄúTaylor grew tired of people over analyzing her life and passing judgment on her, but being so conspicuously absent from the Hollywood scene just has everyone wondering what‚Äôs going on with her.‚Äù  WHERE THE GIRLS AT?  Even members of Taylor‚Äôs famed ‚Äúsquad‚Äù have indicated that she‚Äôs not as prese"
"Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single ‚ÄúUnforgettable,‚Äù and now Life & Style is claiming the two were all over each other during the process. A so-called ‚Äúsource‚Äù tells the magazine, ‚ÄúMariah was hanging all over French. She sat on his lap, and at one point they even kissed! They weren‚Äôt trying to hide their PDA.‚Äù  A new tabloid report says there was heavy flirting going on between Mariah Carey and French Montana when the two recently collaborated in the recording studio. Gossip Cop looked into this claim about a possible hookup between the music artists, and we‚Äôve exclusively learned the truth.  {""position1"": {""artist"": {""bio"": """", ""id"": 31885, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey""}, ""catalog_type"": ""artist"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 31885, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey"", ""related"": [{""bio"": """", ""id"": 966208, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 89006, ""name"": ""TLC""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 120430, ""name"": ""Aaliyah""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 40100, ""name"": ""Boyz II Men""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 56563, ""name"": ""Alicia Keys""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 39258, ""name"": ""Mary J.

Our doubts were confirmed after checking in with a rep for Carey, who exclusively tells us the outlet‚Äôs report is entirely ‚Äúfalse.‚Äù We‚Äôre assured the singer wasn‚Äôt flirting with her colleague, nor did the two go home together.  Naturally, Life & Style isn‚Äôt the best source when it comes to finding accurate news about the singer. Gossip Cop previously busted the tabloid for making up a story about Carey hiring a speech therapist to teach her to speak with a British accent. GC also corrected the magazine after it falsely claimed Carey gives money to boyfriend Bryan Tanaka so he can buy her gifts. The publication‚Äôs latest article suggesting Carey and Montana are more than just collaborators is equally bogus.  Photo: AOL"
"At this point, it's not a question of if Kim Kardashian (or any of her famous family members, for that matter) will be criticized for each of her parenting decisions, but rather, when the comments from Internet trolls will start rolling in. The latest instance of mommy-shaming plaguing Kardashian was sparked by a throwback photo of her husband and daughter that she posted on Instagram on Tuesday. In the pic, North West cuddles up to Kanye West and gives her smiling dad a kiss on the cheek. ""I can still feel the love üíï,"" Kim K captioned the adorable snapshot, quoting Kanye's recently released song "" Feel the Love .""  Almost immediately, critics began pouncing on Kardashian over the fact that, in the picture, North is wearing her naturally curly hair straight. ""I can feel the heat damage from here! Leave your [kid's] hair alone let her have the choice to damage it when she's older,"" one person commented. ""Stop straightening her hair,"" someone else wrote, while another added, ""That poor baby's curl pattern is gonna be all jacked up from the heat damage she's putting on her hair at a young age.""  Others, however, defended Kardashian, citing both her right to parent her children however she wants and the well-documented fact that North is already a burgeoning style star at just five years old. ""Y'all are so annoying. Maybe NORTH wanted her hair that way!!!!!! She's very opinionated as we can all see. AND it's VERY easy to straighten hair without heat damage seeing as [how] her mom has a TEAM of PROFESSIONAL hairstylists,"" one of her defenders wrote.  Loading View on Instagram  Last month, after catching similar flack for letting North wear her hair straight on her birthday, Kardashian West explained the decision to The Hollywood Reporter . ""She wanted straight hair and I straightened her hair one time. It's funny, because online everyone thought that we pressed it and did this whole thing. It was just a flat iron. I even read that she had extensions on! She has curly hair, so when you straighten her hair, it's gonna look really long. I can't believe people didn't get that. Sometimes you just have to tune it out! It was her birthday and all she wanted was to try to have her hair straightened,"" she said.  The KKW Beauty founder noted that her own professional hairstylist, Chris Appleton , helped out with North's special style, and added, ""She liked it, so we did it when we went to New York too, and that's it. You know, I'm not gonna let her straighten her hair all the time, but if she wants it that way two or three days a year, then that's fine with me. She loved it, but she loves her curly hair, too.""

"Kristen Stewart is spotted kissing her girlfriend Stella at Coachella (Picture: MEGA, Rex/Shutterstock)  Kristen Stewart and her Victoria Secret‚Äôs Angel girlfriend, Stella Maxwell, are known for keeping their relationship on the down low.  They have been dating ever since 2015, but only revealed they were an item a whole year after rumours started to circulate that they were seeing each other.  However, despite the hush around their romance, all of this seems to have gone out of the window at Coachella, as the pair are spotted putting on a passionate display of PDA.  What happens at Coachella stays at Coachella, right?  The couple had been hanging out with friends all day, but it looks like they‚Äôd been able to sneak away from the crowds and grab a moment alone as they were pictured together perched under a tree.  The pair have been dating since 2015 and generally keep their relationship under wraps (Picture: MEGA)  While enjoying each other‚Äôs company, the pair shared a kiss before heading back off to the festival to enjoy the rest of Saturday‚Äôs evening.

"Game of Thrones stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie's highly-anticipated wedding finally has an official date‚Äîand it's coming up very soon.  The couple will wed in less than a month, on June 23, according to a BBC report.  Per BBC: ""A 23 June date has been posted at the Huntly registration office in Aberdeenshire. The actress's father, councillor Seb Leslie, owns a castle in his West Garioch constituency.""

The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughters of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire,"" the announcement read.    As famous couples go, Harington and Leslie are relatively low-key, but they have spoken publicly about their romance on a few occasions.  Notably, Harington described falling in love with Leslie on set during a 2016 interview with L'Uomo Vogue. ""Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,"" he said. ""If you‚Äôre already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.""    Harington also opened up about his less-than-perfect proposal during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show in October 2017.  ""I did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff, but we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine and I blew my load early,"" he said, laughing. ""Sorry, that‚Äôs a really bad expression!"""

"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  For those reeling from a rocky relationship, here‚Äôs some advice you can take at face value: get a nose job.  That‚Äôs exactly what 28-year-old reality TV personality, Naomie Olindo, decided to do less than half a year after breaking up with heartthrob, Craig Conover. On Thursday, the star of Southern Charm revealed the results of her makeover on Instagram, complete with a nose emoji to further press the point.  Admitting that a bit of swelling was still present in the wake of the procedure less than two weeks earlier, Olindo claimed during an interview on Bravo TV that she decided to take advantage of the show‚Äôs post-season hiatus to undergo the procedure. It stated it was something she had wanted to do since she was eight years old. She also said she suffered no pain at all while on the operating table.  Even before she shared the news, fans on social media pointed out that she didn‚Äôt quite look the same. However, after commenting on the change, Olindo got a few negative responses and quickly defended her decision. She noted she was happy about the effect of the results on her self-esteem and would do it again.  inquisitr.com  Her rhinoplasty venture might help her move on after splitting from Conover, a relationship that dominated story arcs during seasons three and four of Southern Charm. Olindo originally met Conover in South Carolina at the College of Charleston, but they actually started dating after they graduated.  The most recent season saw the two try to navigate stormy waters as audiences watched their relationship start to unravel, especially when Olindo and Conover underwent therapy to keep their connection from further fraying. Unfortunately, the twosome called it quits in September.  Even after the breakup, Olindo claims she's still the best of friends with Conover, adding that he provided a lot of support for her in a text regarding her nose job.  The two will also remain in the cast of the forthcoming fifth season of Southern Charm, which recently promoted recurring personality Chelsea Meissner to become part of the core ensemble. That decision seems to be a no-brainer, considering Meissner was at the center of a three-way relationship that sparked plenty of interest among viewers.

"They may keep a low profile, but rumored couple Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes definitely looked cozy at the actor's 50th birthday party!  Foxx celebrated his big day at Los Angeles' Paramount Studios on Wednesday, where he was not only joined by Holmes, but also A-list friends like Leonardo DiCaprio, Snoop Dogg, Tobey Maguire and Foxx's The Jamie Foxx Show co-star Garcelle Beauvais, as well as his daughters, 23-year-old Corinne and 8-year-old Annalise.

At one point, the birthday boy could be seen touching the actress' left arm as they leaned in close to talk. Holmes had a huge grin on her face and was laughing at something he said during their chat.  An eyewitness tells ET that, inside the soiree, Foxx and Holmes ""seemed besotted"" with each other. ""Jamie kept beckoning for Katie to come up to the stage but she didn‚Äôt want to,‚Äù the eyewitness said. ‚ÄúThey were so cute!‚Äù  Splash News  Foxx performed for the crowd, as did Snoop, Ice Cube and Ludacris. Our eyewitness noted that Holmes ""seemed happy"" and ""very entertained by his performances.""  Splash News  Another performer at the event? Foxx's gardener.

According to the earlier eyewitness, the Oscar-winning actor sang along to a song with ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù lyrics and looked directly into Holmes' eyes.  ""Jamie definitely was looking and smiling at [Holmes] the majority of the night,"" another eyewitness tells ET of the rumored couple's interaction at the party, though noted that they didn't show any PDA. ""Even when on stage he would look over and point at her and then smile. She would smile back. They sat together at the table for about 30 minutes together until she left with Leo.""  Foxx and Holmes have been a rumored couple for years, but the two have remained incredibly private about their relationship -- until pictures of them holding hands on the beach in Malibu, California, surfaced in September, which ET talked to him about later that month.

"From Alexa Chung to January Jones and Chrissy Teigen, the sheet mask continues to adorn the faces of our favourite celebrities all over Instagram, and for good reason too. The biggest trend to come out of Korea, these skincare saviours give an instant hit of hydration, with specially formulated serums that quickly penetrate skin for maximum effect. Korean beauty boutiques are lined with hundreds of packets of different masks and women pick and mix to create a library of sheet masks to match every skin type and concern.  Happily, the Award Winning* Charcoal & Willow Bark Tissue Face Mask from Boots Ingredients is somewhat closer to home ‚Äì it‚Äôs in November‚Äôs GLOSSYBOX in fact! A no mess sheet mask that helps purify, cleanse and revitalise skin with seriously soothing ingredients ‚Äì and works in just 15 minutes! If you aren‚Äôt already a subscriber order your box here and get your hands on this (as well as four more full-size goodies).  Taking our cue from our Korean counterparts, here‚Äôs how to use your masks like a pro‚Ä¶  1. Take the mask out of the packet, unfold it and place it over your face, positioning it so you can see through the holes for your eyes. You can apply it directly to cleansed skin or you can apply a moisturising serum first to boost hydration. Extra points if you dunk the packet into warm water for one minute to allow it to heat up beforehand.  2. Firmly press the mask over the skin to encourage the product to penetrate effectively and ensure that it sits against skin especially around that awkward nose area.  3. After 15 minutes remove the mask, taking time to massage any residue that remains into the skin. You can also sweep the sheet over your throat and decollate (much like you would a serum-saturated cotton wool ball) to get the most of any serum that remains."

"Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth have been romantically linked since the year 2009 when they met while filming 'The Last Song.' The couple only confirmed their relationship in the year 2010 when they made their red carpet debut at an Oscar event. However, according to reports, the couple has split up for the second time, and we are really hoping that the reports are not true. The couple has been through so much together, and it would be unfortunate if these reports end up being true.  As reported by RadarOnline, an insider shared, ""They‚Äôve been hanging by a thread for months. Now they‚Äôre as good as broken up and there will be no wedding."" It is also believed that the 'Hannah Montana' star left the couple's Malibu house without her engagement ring. ""Miley‚Äôs been spending a lot more time at her parents‚Äô house. She needs time to herself,"" the source continued.  The 'Wrecking Ball' singer had been under a lot of pressure lately because of the wedding planning work and is now beginning to rethink her commitment to the 'Hunger Games' actor. ""She‚Äôs accomplished a lot in her life, but there‚Äôs still a lot she wants to do ‚Äî and Miley doesn‚Äôt want to have to answer to anybody, least of all a husband,"" the insider went on to add.  On the 17th of June, Miley and Liam were photographed looking extremely miserable during a family gathering with Miley's parents for Father's Day. Recently, the couple was seen in the parking lot of the 'Nobu' restaurant, and it was evident that she was not wearing her ring. An onlooker shared, ""Things were really tense between Miley and Liam. They looked like they wanted to be anywhere but with each other.""  According to reports, Cyrus seems to have gotten cold feet and is dragging them for quit some time time, and Liam is supposedly very fed up with her endless days. ""Liam‚Äôs over it. He wants kids and doesn‚Äôt want to keep putting it off. It‚Äôs ultimatum time for Liam and pals aren‚Äôt betting on Miley making the commitment he wants!"" the source added.  The pair initially decided to get engaged in the year 2012 but chose to call it off in the year 2013. In September 2013, Miley's representative confirmed that the engagement had been called off. Liam was seen making out with Mexican actress and singer Eiza Gonzalez.  A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Mar 4, 2018 at 8:36pm PST  In the month of December that same year, Miley revealed what life after her relationship with Liam Hemsworth looked like and said, ""This is the best time of my life. I'm not going to look back on it and be like, 'I wish I hadn't been dwelling over a breakup,' you know? Because that's not what God wants my life to be about right now."" Around three years later, the pair chose to get back and Miley was seen sporting her engagement ring.  On an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Miley revealed, ""It's very weird because this is, like, real jewelry, and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy. They don't look that good together because they kind of mix up."" Miley also went on to add, ""Sometimes I replace it with an actual unicorn or a Looney Tune, and he's kind of like, ""What's going on?"" And I'm like, ""This isn't really my aesthetic, but I'll wear it because you love me."" Miley said that her wedding ""has to be perfect"" and ""has to be like a soundtrack in a movie.""  Around the time when the couple announced their engagement, Miley spoke to People and shared, ""I'm so happy to be engaged and look forward to a life of happiness with Liam."" During the year 2017, Miley told the Sun that she does not have plans to get married any time soon and shared, ""I don't envision marriage. I'm 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do [before I get married].""  ""Three years ago, if you‚Äôd asked me if I‚Äôd be here, this happy with this man, I‚Äôd have been stunned. I‚Äôm just riding this out. In some relationships, you lose yourself by being with someone else. Actually, it made me find myself more. I have no idea what the next three years will bring, but if it‚Äôs possible to get even happier, I‚Äôll take it,"" Miley added.  During the same interview, she also spoke about her relationship with Liam after they decided to split up.  A post shared by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on May 7, 2018 at 5:05pm PDT  ""I didn‚Äôt know [we‚Äôd get back together]. I‚Äôm so crazy I have no idea. But I had something in my heart, it never felt like it was really over. We kept a great friendship really private. It‚Äôs good for people to have that space to grow individually. Otherwise, when you‚Äôre with someone from 16 until 24, you grow into the same person,"" she revealed.  The couple attended the 'Thor: Ragnarok' premiere together to support Hemsworth's brother, Chris Hemsworth and the couple seemed like they were going strong and were in it for the long run. There were many rumors which stated that the couple had secretly decided to get married in April 2017 but Chris Hemsworth flatly denied the rumors during an interview with SiriusXM's Sway in the Morning in January of 2018."

"Maks Chmerkovskiy and Vanessa Lachey were seen hugging it out while leaving a Dancing With the Stars rehearsal on Saturday, October 7, seemingly putting any drama behind them.  As Us Weekly previously reported, the dance partners have not been seeing eye to eye, which was rumored to be the real reason behind Chmerkovskiy missing his Monday, October 2, performance.

"Three women filed a new class action lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein on Friday, including one who alleged that Weinstein raped her after she came to his office to pitch her internet startup.  The woman, Melissa Thompson, accuses Weinstein of luring her to his hotel room for a meeting in 2011 and then forcibly raping her.  ‚ÄúThompson was fighting back, but could not out-muscle him,‚Äù the lawsuit states. ‚ÄúThompson closed her eyes, traumatized, praying for the assault to end.‚Äù  Earlier that day, Thompson said that she went to Weinstein‚Äôs Tribeca office to pitch him on a marketing startup called Intercast Networks. According to the suit, she made a video recording of the encounter on her laptop. As she explained the company‚Äôs services, she alleges that Weinstein began to caress her legs. He promised to make a deal that afternoon if she would meet him for a drink at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, the suit alleges. Once there, he brought her to his hotel room, where the alleged rape occurred.  The complaint also alleges that Thompson sought help from the law firm of Benjamin Brafman last fall, and turned over her video evidence to the firm not realizing that Brafman was representing Weinstein.  Related Judge Refuses to Dismiss Harvey Weinstein Sexual Assault Case New York Attorneys Doubt That Weinstein Case Will Be Dismissed  A second woman, actress Caitlin Dulany, also alleged that Weinstein sexually assaulted her at the Hotel du Cap in Cannes in 1996. Dulany earlier told a version of her encounter in a first-person account for the Wrap, though she did not mention the alleged assault. In the suit, Dulany alleges that Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent and then masturbated.  The third plaintiff, actress Larissa Gomes, alleges that Weinstein cornered her in a hotel room in Toronto in 2000, tried to get her to give him a massage and asked to see her breast. She recoiled, and Weinstein became angry.  ‚ÄúYou know Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd were exactly where you are at one point,‚Äù Gomes quotes him as saying. ‚ÄúLook at them now. Ashley Judd had no problem f‚Äîing me.‚Äù (Judd and Paltrow have both alleged that Weinstein made unwanted advances toward them.)  According to Gomes, she tried to get away, saying ‚ÄúI think I should go now, my boyfriend is waiting for me, and he will be worried.‚Äù  Gomes alleges that Weinstein forcibly tried to kiss her, before she fled.  The women are represented by Hagens Berman and the Armenta Law Firm, which also filed an earlier class action suit against Weinstein on behalf of six other women. The suit names Miramax, the Walt Disney Co., and Weinstein as defendants, along with individual board members of the Weinstein Co.  Weinstein has consistently denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sexual acts in New York, and faces up to 25 years in prison on those charges.  His representative has yet to respond to the new allegations.

"Ivanka Trump is getting some extra notice lately.  Well, more accurately, Trump's eyes are getting some extra notice lately.  As she makes more and more public appearances in her new official role in the White House, people are looking closely and realizing Trump's eyes may not be what they appear.  REUTERS  As it turns out, if you stare deeply into Trump's eyes, you'll notice they change repeatedly over time.  At various different public appearances, Trump's eyes are different colors. Naturally, her eyes -- like her hair -- are brown.  REUTERS  But sometimes, she changes it up. Her eyes have appeared a lighter hazel, green and even blue at various points over time, including during the 2016 presidential election.  Check out the changes for yourself:  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  REUTERS  As you can see, Trump's eyes are a revolution over time.  There doesn't appear to be an exact method to the eye-color-changing madness.  Her eyes were brown when she stared at Justin Trudeau.  REUTERS  But they were green when she had a controversial interview with Gayle King on CBS.  This eye color phenomenon has been noticed at least as far back as early November, when Esquire questioned Trump's eye color.  Then, press representatives did not respond to Esquire's request for comment on if she wears color-changing contacts, so we just have to go off common sense and say that's what's happening (it's more likely than her eyes spontaneously changing color on opposite sides of the genetic spectrum).  Although some women have said their eyes changed colors over the course of pregnancy -- and Trump was pregnant last year -- that doesn't explain why the color hopped around so much.  Maybe she likes the way it looks and it gives her confidence. Maybe she wants to give off a lighter tone to be more likable (see: all the Disney characters with blue eyes), which, yeah, is a racial thing.  And if you really want to go down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole (and I know you do), you could consider the implications of making oneself blonde and blue-eyed. Like what Nazis like.  As this news continues to be reported, many people are wondering why.  Twitter  Twitter  There is certainly a lot going on in the Trump world. But you clicked here, didn't you?

"In January, I taped a three-by-five card next to my workstation at home and wrote ‚ÄúBest Shows‚Äù at the top of it, like I do every January. Whenever I saw a show that I really liked, I‚Äôd add the title to the card. In 1997, the first year in which I wrote about TV full time, I had ten titles on the card by Thanksgiving. A decade later, I‚Äôd routinely find myself culling a list of 15 titles when list-making time arrived. By the end of 2016, there were 20 titles on the card. This year, there were 23 strong contenders with another dozen possibles. That‚Äôs a reflection not just of how many shows are in production, but also how diverse they are in terms of style, structure, subject matter, and worldview.  number 10  The Carmichael Show (NBC)  Jerrod Carmichael‚Äôs old-school, social-issues-driven, three-camera-plus-a-live-audience sitcom is one of many quirky outliers to get canceled this year just when it was really getting warmed up. Too bad: This latest batch of episodes could‚Äôve gone toe-to-toe with the best installments of Norman Lear‚Äôs Good Times. Many of the episodes, including the one built around David Alan Grier‚Äôs character‚Äôs confrontation with his mother‚Äôs mortality, were ripped directly from the actors‚Äô own lives.  number 9  Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (The CW)  Rachel Bloom and Aline Brosh-McKenna‚Äôs musical-psychological comedy-drama continues to take risks. The back half of season two and the first half of season three were stunning.  number 8  Samurai Jack (Adult Swim)  Genndy Tartakovsky caps his series about a stoic samurai‚Äôs pursuit of a demon with his career-best work as an animator.  number 7  The Young Pope (HBO)  Of all the current TV series that owe an obvious debt to David Lynch, this quirky yet often visionary religious drama from Paolo Sorrentino is the most original. The deadpan humor sometimes obscured the fact that, when the show talked about spirituality, it wasn‚Äôt kidding. The season finale has a cosmic sense of wonder.  number 6  The Deuce (HBO)  From The Wire collaborators George Pelecanos and David Simon comes a worthy successor, a period piece about the sex trade in 1970s Times Square that doubles as a corrosive satire on capitalism.  number 5  BoJack Horseman (Netflix)  The fourth season of Raphael Bob-Waksberg‚Äôs animated comedy-drama was a series of perfectly executed tales of confrontation, denial, selfishness, and healing.  number 4  The Get Down (Netflix)  Baz Luhrmann and Stephen Adly Guirgis‚Äôs musical drama about the birth of hip-hop starts in 1977, set just a few years after another great New York drama, Mad Men, ended. Demographically, narratively, and stylistically, it‚Äôs a worthy companion piece, one of a handful of series that can be said to have devised its own language.  number 3  Better Things (FX)  Pamela Adlon‚Äôs series about single motherhood took more stylistic and tonal risks than last year, and they all paid off. Anyone who‚Äôs been a parent or a child will appreciate the truths this show contains.  number 2  The Leftovers (HBO)  Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta‚Äôs post-Rapture drama finished its three-year run with eight episodes of alternately wrenching, surreal, and bleakly funny storytelling about the psychological aftermath of loss and the quest to superimpose narrative on a seemingly chaotic world. I should admit this pick comes with an asterisk: Lindelof told me that certain themes and images, and the totality of episode five, were inspired by my personal writing about the death of my first wife. I loved the season before I knew that, so I‚Äôm leaving The Leftovers where I think it would‚Äôve gone otherwise; however, if you consider the personal aspect disqualifying, go ahead and bump The Leftovers off the list and move everything up a notch. (In that case, AMC‚Äôs Better Call Saul would land at No. 10.)  number 1  Twin Peaks: The Return (Showtime)  A weekly mind-effing event the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since the first year of Lost. This 18-hour series from Twin Peaks co-creators David Lynch and Mark Frost wasn‚Äôt a straightforward continuation of the story, but something more like a series of variations or improvisations on familiar characters and situations. It took a while to grasp that it was a largely non-narrative experience, conceived in terms of light and shadow, rhythm and visual rhyme, color and music (most hours ended with a full-length musical performance). Episode eight, which reconceived the postwar history of the United States in mythological terms starting with the first atom bomb test, is a masterpiece; at least five other episodes are nearly as good.  *A version of this article appears in the December 11, 2017, issue of New York Magazine."
"According to Star, when Angelina Jolie left Brad‚Äôs life, party-loving George was excited to return, having allegedly been shunted out of the actor‚Äôs life by a disapproving Ange. And he reportedly relished the opportunity to facilitate a thawing between Brad and his ex-wife Jen.  ‚ÄòThey‚Äôve been secretly getting together for late night hook ups, and it‚Äôs all because of George,‚Äô a source told Star.  ‚ÄòGeorge was the first person to call him when his marriage to Angie imploded. After Jen and Justin Theroux announced their split, he encouraged Brad to reach out and give their relationship another chance.‚Äô  The magazine cover that all of America is talking about today Star magazine  According to the magazine, the duo had their first post-slip meet up an March 3 at a private pre-Oscars party in Beverly Hills.  ‚ÄòThe plan was to head over to Jen‚Äôs place afterward for a nightcap, but, of course, George would just drop Brad off.‚Äô  The magazine claims that Jen was so excited by the idea, that she even went to the extreme of lending George her bodyguard so he could drive the pair to her home.  ‚ÄòTheir evening together was very relaxed and low-key,‚Äô the source told Star. ‚ÄòThey reminisced about the past and had a lot of laughs. It seems just like old times, only better.‚Äô  While Star notes that George Clooney‚Äôs rep had denied their story, the magazine goes on to note that Jennifer ‚Äòwants to keep the reunion under the radar‚Äô, given that she only announced her marriage split weeks ago.  Neither Brad nor Jen‚Äôs reps have yet commented on Star‚Äôs story."
"She just gave birth 3 months ago.  Is Khloe Kardashian pregnant again? We all know that she has always wanted to be a mother. She‚Äôs talked about it candidly on Keeping up with the Kardashians, and has frequently expressed her desire to have a family of her own. After many years of trying, Khloe finally gave birth to her daughter, True, in April.  Around the time of True‚Äôs birth, Khloe‚Äôs boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, found himself at the center of a cheating scandal in which a video was released with him kissing and groping another woman. There were also salacious text messages he sent to his mistress. Would you really expect anything different from someone who cheated on his then-pregnant girlfriend to be with a Kardashian? Once a cheater, always a cheater?  A post shared by @krazyinlovewithkardashians on Aug 8, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT  It‚Äôs safe to assume Khloe wants more children in the future, but does that mean she‚Äôs been trying again with Tristan?  A source has said, ‚ÄúKhloe loved being pregnant, but she‚Äôs the first to say how great she feels now that she‚Äôs lost the baby weight. That being said, she could find herself pregnant again soon.‚Äù  Even so, the two recently took a trip to Mexico together, and according to the source, ‚Äúthey‚Äôve been having tons of wild sex, especially on their trip to Mexico. It‚Äôs basically been like a mini honeymoon for them.‚Äù  The source also claims that Tristan wants more children as well and can be very persuasive. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been saying that since they first fell in love he can see them having five or even six kids. That hasn‚Äôt changed; he loves being a dad and is even more in love with Khloe now that they have True. Khloe says she‚Äôs not ready to be pregnant again yet, but Tristan‚Äòs a convincing guy,‚Äù the source revealed.  Is that enough to convince Khloe to try to get pregnant again? After giving birth, women have to wait six weeks before they can have sex again and the couple is well past that date.  But don‚Äôt get too excite because Khloe herself revealed that she‚Äôs not quite ready. A fan recently asked if she was having another baby:  Not right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol https://t.co/TthrxOQdHr ‚Äî Khlo√© (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018  Keep in mind that she just went back to work, and is in the process of fixing her relationship with Tristan. Would she really be in the right state of mind to welcome another child into the world?  While she may wait a while, there‚Äôs no doubt that she loves being a mom. We just hope she gets her house in order before expanding her family any further.  A post shared by Top Media New Zealand.

"If Bachelor Nation couples take nothing else away from going through the experience of being on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette, then maybe they can just appreciate the gift of amazing engagement rings that are of no cost to them or their partners. For years, Neil Lane has been the prime source for the franchise‚Äôs engagement rings and that doesn‚Äôt seem to be changing anytime soon. So, how much was Rachel‚Äôs engagement ring on The Bachelorette?  ABC spared no expense for true love and for Season 13, it was the same deal, even though it‚Äôs not confirmed if Neil Lane gifts the show with his rings for the publicity or if ABC busts out some hefty petty cash for them each season. Despite Rachel preferring a plain wedding band over a big old rock, she described another version of her dream ring and Bryan was able to pick one out from Lane‚Äôs selection, as per usual. And, like always, it didn‚Äôt come cheap.  According to E! News, Rachel's three-carat pear-shaped diamond ring cost more than $100,000, making it one of the more expensive engagement rings in Bachelor Nation history.  Luckily, the suitors are never expected to foot the bill for the engagement rings, which is probably a good thing since in the past, they‚Äôve cost a pretty penny. During Season 17 of The Bachelor, Sean Lowe gave Catherine Giudici an engagement ring that was more than three carats and retails for around $75,000. Season 19‚Äôs Chris Soules proposed to Whitney Bischoff with a 4-carat Neil Lane ring that reportedly cost $92,000.  Although The Bachelorette engagement rings are pretty much the cream of the crop, they‚Äôre also, for all intents and purposes, on loan to contestants. For all rings in Bachelor Nation, unless purchased by one of the contestants personally and not received through the Neil Lane arrangement, it‚Äôs in the contestants‚Äô contracts that they must remain in their relationship for two years or they forfeit the ring back to ABC. If they‚Äôre lucky enough to last as a couple outside of The Bachelorette and Bachelor bubble, then they get to keep their Neil Lane bling and live happily ever after in wedded Bachelor Nation bliss.  Even though some of The Bachelorette contestants this season were doctors and lawyers, who‚Äôs going to turn down the allure of a free and clear Neil Lane diamond, right? Rachel‚Äôs engagement ring on The Bachelorette is blingy for sure, but without being flashy or too over the top and I‚Äôd expect nothing less from someone who is already a Bachelorette favorite for so many fans. So at least in that respect, Bryan‚Äôs off to a good start as her future husband."

While 36-year-old Meghan Markle may seem like the ideal princess-in-waiting, we can reveal she had a wild youth just like 32-year-old Harry.  Meghan‚Äôs days at Northwestern University in Chicago in the early 2000s have rarely been spoken about.  But a visit to her old stomping ground by the Sunday Mirror has revealed she was a typical party-loving student who allegedly used fake ID to go clubbing.  One of her favourite haunts is said to have been a bar that has since been shut down following a battle with authorities over underage drinking.  We also uncovered an article from the college news magazine in which Meghan herself joked she put on a stone after bingeing on Burger King in her Freshman year.  Interviewed by the magazine in 2014, after returning to the Northwestern campus for a Q&A session alongside fellow cast members of TV show Suits, she said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs surreal because I haven‚Äôt been back since I graduated.  ‚ÄúAnd as I‚Äôm walking around I remember things like the schlep of getting to South Campus from up north.  ‚ÄúThe 24-hour Burger King also ¬≠definitely helped me put on the Freshman Fifteen.‚Äù  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  Meghan attended the university‚Äôs School of Communication at the same time as fun-loving Prince Harry was getting into trouble for heavy drinking.  In his late teens, the young prince was making headlines for his wild nights out in Gloucestershire pubs around Highgrove ‚Äì Prince Charles‚Äôs country home.  One pub in particular, the Rattlebone Inn, which has since changed hands, was infamous for its boozy lock-ins.  Prince Harry even set up a nightclub for his posh friends in the basement of Highgrove, calling it Club H.  And while the prince partied with his exclusive group of pals, Meghan was at college mixing with members of her own posh pack.  Hers was an all-female society, called the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, with a reputation for hard partying and social climbing.  Current KKG member Melania Hidalgo told the Sunday Mirror that Meghan had been a popular member of the student body.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  She said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre intelligent hot messes. The thing we all have in common is that we‚Äôre all very driven, ambitious and passionate.  ‚ÄúMeghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.  ‚ÄúShe was in charge of bringing in new girls ‚Äì you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.  ‚ÄúI lived in the house for a year and it‚Äôs a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you‚Äôd mix with.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  ‚ÄúAll of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies‚Ä¶ you develop very strong friendships.‚Äù  Meghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.  Former pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then ‚Äì and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.

One former student claimed: ‚ÄúMeghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.  ‚ÄúYou can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago ‚Äì it‚Äôs a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.

Everyone talks about her going here.‚Äù The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence ‚Äì after 36 years as a students‚Äô favourite ‚Äì following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.  It is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.  ‚ÄúIt was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,‚Äù general manager Chris Nora said. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.

She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William‚Äôs wife Kate and Harry‚Äôs nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.  Our trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan‚Äôs birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.  Rachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.  And photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned ‚ÄúRachel Markle‚Äù ‚Äì and another captioned ‚ÄúMeghan Markle‚Äù.  The find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.  And as speculation grows that the world‚Äôs most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe."
"Rob Kardashian took to Instagram last week to share his story of the messy split between himself and popular model/reality tv star Blac Chyna. He also revealed some secrets and explicit photos of the model online.  ABC‚Äôs Nightline aired an interview with the model and she explained how she felt when her estranged partner shared her nude pictures on Instagram.  ‚ÄúI was devastated. I‚Äôm looking at this and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòHow could someone do this to me?'‚Äù she confessed. ‚ÄúI was very fearful because I was like, ‚ÄòIf you could do this, what else could you do?'‚Äù  Chyna stood up for herself saying that her past as a stripper is irrelevant. ‚ÄúJust because of something that I used to do, I shouldn‚Äôt be bullied to say, ‚ÄòOK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,‚Äù.  ‚ÄúJust because of something that I used to do, I shouldn‚Äôt be bullied to say, ‚ÄòOK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,‚Äù She told Good Morning America.

Yes, this was in April.‚ÄùHe threatened to kill himself multiple times in text messages since we broke up in December 2016, trying to manipulate me to respond to his outbursts. I have been telling Rob to get help and go to therapy since June 2016. To my knowledge, Rob has not seen a licensed therapist.‚ÄùI am in fear of this angry, volatile, vindictive man, who has physically attacked me and tried to humiliate me so publicly. I am embarrassed by his posts. I ask for orders of protection so that I can live my life in peace and free of fear of him.‚Äù After the interview was recorded, Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob. Another court date has been scheduled for August.In spite of the troubles, Chyna hoped to work things out with Rob for the sake of their 8-month old daughter Dream Kardashian."
"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be staying in town after their May 19 wedding.  The pair will not jet off for their romantic honeymoon right after saying ""I do,"" Kensington Palace confirmed in a press briefing on Friday.  ‚ÄúThe couple will be going on honeymoon, but not straightaway,‚Äù Kensington Palace spokesman Jason Knauf said. ‚ÄúThey will have their first engagement as a married couple in the week after the wedding.‚Äù  Meghan Markle Spotted Getting in Shape for Her Royal Wedding  When they do get a chance to get away, Meghan and Harry are expected to honeymoon in Namibia -- a place where they'll find plenty of privacy, as it's one of the least densely populated countries in the world. Travel + Leisure magazine reported last month that the twosome will stay at Namibia's newest luxury camp, Natural Selection's Hoanib Valley Camp.

"Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately ‚Äî not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the ‚Äúcrazy and manipulative‚Äù estranged wife who has become increasingly ‚Äúunpopular in Hollywood.‚Äù She‚Äôs ‚Äúout for blood‚Äù in the divorce fight, or she ‚Äúwants to embarrass and punish‚Äù the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed ‚Äúan insane jealousy‚Äù jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes ‚ÄúAmal has stolen her identity‚Äù as the world‚Äôs most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency‚Äôs efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children ‚Äî girls especially ‚Äî whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can‚Äôt read or write and has been ‚Äúrobbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.‚Äù  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university ‚Äî while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  ‚ÄúThere are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,‚Äù Jolie wrote. ‚ÄúThere are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.‚Äù  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: ‚ÄúNot with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.‚Äù  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  ‚ÄúHardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,‚Äù Jolie wrote. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.‚Äù  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a ‚Äúpatient, long-term manner, guided by our values.‚Äù She concluded her piece by writing: ‚ÄúIf we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.‚Äù"
"Teresa Giudice isn‚Äôt looking to have another day in court. Following fan speculation that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 45, was planning to split from husband Joe Giudice after she posted an Instagram photo with a divorce attorney, Teresa clarified that she was simply at dinner with a friend.  As previously reported, Teresa posted a photo to Instagram on Saturday, January 6, posing with New Jersey attorney Loren La Forge-Kyriakoulis. The reality star originally captioned the photo, ‚ÄúDinner with a great friend getting great advice‚Äù before quickly changing it to ‚ÄúDinner with a great friend lots of laughs‚Äù with the hashtag ‚Äú#webothlovefood.‚Äù  During Teresa‚Äôs Wednesday, January 10, appearance with sister-in-law Melissa Gorga on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a fan called in to ask Teresa if the photo indicated she and Joe were on the rocks, which Teresa vehemently denied. ‚ÄúI was helping her. Just in case ‚Äì If anybody‚Äôs getting divorced, she‚Äôs a great divorce attorney to call,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúGet it? I was helping her.‚Äù  Gorga, 38, chimed in, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre saying you were publicizing her,‚Äù to which Teresa said, ‚ÄúYes! Capisce? Capisce.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter with two women sitting together and shooting the breeze,‚Äù Teresa continued. ‚ÄúTalking about growing up?‚Äù  Gorga, who happened to be at the same restaurant that night, also recalled her initial confusion when she approached the pair at dinner to say hello. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòWho are you?‚Äô and she was like, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm so and so‚Äô and Teresa‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs a divorce attorney,‚Äô and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòHuh?‚Äô‚Äù  During the interview, Teresa also opened up about the months-long period that she didn‚Äôt visit her husband, who is currently serving time for conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud. ‚ÄúMy mom got sick, so I didn‚Äôt see him the whole time my mom was sick, those three months,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI remember the one day I was going to see him, that‚Äôs when my dad got sick, and then I had to turn around and go back.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThen there was a chicken pox breakout there, in the prison, so we weren‚Äôt allowed to go see him,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúOh, and then they found contraband from other inmates!‚Äù  However, Teresa, who also served 11 months in prison in 2015 for fraud, isn‚Äôt exactly eager to return to jail ‚Äì even to visit Joe. ‚ÄúYou know, I don‚Äôt really enjoy going there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúEven when I was [in prison], I was like, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt come!'‚Äù  The couple has been plagued by divorce rumors in recent months, however two after before Teresa posted the photo with Forge-Kyriakoulis, the television personality‚Äôs attorney James Leonard Jr. shut down the speculation. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to say it any louder or plainer, but it ain‚Äôt happening.

"If you were left thinking, 'I've seen that face before' when Netflix hit Stranger Things first catapulted teen star Millie Bobby Brown to stardom - you weren't alone.  In fact, the now-13-year-old's near-identical resemblance to a fellow on-screen starlet is now the source of much hype on social media, with thousands of people taking to Twitter and Instagram to highlight the uncanny similarities between Millie and 36-year-old actress Natalie Portman.  And it's not just the simple similarities in terms of facial features like their noses, mouths, and dimples, that has people talking; interestingly both women have had shaved heads for previous roles, and both have modeled similar red carpet looks - making the resemblance between them all the more remarkable.  Twins: Millie Bobby Brown is a doppelganger of Natalie Portman and the similarities are shocking, like this photo of Millie in Stranger Things (left) and Natalie in V for Vendetta (right)  Crazy: Millie, 13, (left) at Netflix's Stranger Things Season 2 premiere on October 26, 2017 and Natalie, 36, (right) at the Flirting With Disaster premiere on March 21, 1996  ‚Äπ Slide me ‚Ä∫ Spot the difference: Everything from the shape of the actress's faces to the way that they have been styled for previous roles are similar. Millie is pictured left, and Natalie right  While this is by no means the first time two celebrities have been compared in terms of their similar looks, this is arguably the most impressive, with a series of side-by-side images revealing just how alike Millie and Natalie are.  In particular, pictures of the two with shaved heads - Millie for her ongoing role as Eleven in Stranger Things, and Natalie for her part in 2006 thriller V for Vendetta - have social media users convinced that the duo must be related in one way or another.  Although Natalie did not shave her head to play Evey Hammond until she was 25, while Millie has been modeling the style on and off since she began filming for Netflix at age 12, the pair almost indistinguishable - despite the 13-year age gap between them.  Many of the comparative images being shared on social media have actually left some users unable to tell which actress is which, while others have been prompted to demand 'answers' about how their similarities have only just come to light.  'Are Natalie Portman and Millie Bobby Brown related? I need answers!' one person wrote on Twitter, while share a series of lookalike images of the two.  Bald: The similarities between Millie (left) and Natalie are all the more obvious to see when images of them both with shaved heads are placed side by side  Hair: Millie attended the 75th Annual Golden Globes on January 7, 2018 and had the same exact slicked back hairstyle that Natalie rocked on a red carpet in January 1990  Scary: Both girls had to shave their heads for roles, as Millie plays Eleven in Stranger Things and Natalie played Evey Hammond in V for Vendetta in 2006  Shocking: One Twitter user shared a photo she edited where she morphed both Millie and Natalie's faces together and you cannot even tell who is who  'Well, clearly Millie needs to play Natalie's daughter at some point. Make it happen, Hollywood,' another person pointed out, noting that someone may as well capitalize on the incredible physical similarities between two such talented stars.  Another person chimed in that the process of being compared to another Hollywood star has landed Millie a spot among a group of incredibly successful actresses.  'Millie can join the pack of Winona Ryder, Natalie Portman, and Kiera Knightley of looking the exact same,' the Twitter user wrote.  Others were convinced that there was something a bit more sinister at play - perhaps those who are fans of Millie's sci-fi series which focuses on such eerie goings on.,  'I need a conspiracy video on this,' one person joked, while another insisted: 'She's actually a Natalie Portman clone created to grace us with more Natalie Portman.'  Identical: In another comparison tweet, someone pointed out how much Millie looks like the character Natalie played in Beautiful Girls back in 1996  Can you tell the difference? Not only are their eyes and noses the same, they both have the same exact mouth and dimples  Happy: Millie has tried similar hairstyles to Natalie, like these slicked back buns on the Tonight Show on October 31, 2017 and Natalie‚Äôs at an award show on November, 14 2003"
"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage ‚Äî and seven years as a couple.  ‚ÄúIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,‚Äù says a statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. ‚ÄúThis decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  ‚ÄúNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else‚Äôs fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ‚Äù  The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.

"Broadway star Jennifer Holliday has backed out as a performer at next week's presidential inaugural, saying she did not realize that her participation would be interpreted as a statement of support for President-elect Donald Trump.  Jennifer Holliday is backing out of performing at Trump's inauguration celebration after receiving backlash from her fans. Kareem Quow for KQ Photography  Holliday, best known for her Tony-winning role in Broadway's ""Dreamgirls,"" faced pressure from her gay, lesbian and black fans when it was announced she would sing at a Thursday concert at Washington's Lincoln Memorial.  Holliday said in a statement Saturday that she apologized for her lapse of judgment, for being uneducated on the issues and causing heartbreak for her fans.  Several prominent entertainers have declined to perform at Trump inaugural festivities. Country star Toby Keith and actor Jon Voigt are in the lineup for Thursday's concert.  Holliday's reversal was first reported by The Wrap; the publication obtained a letter Holliday wrote to her fans. Her representative, Bill Carpenter, confirmed the details in the letter to The Associated Press.  ""My only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!"" she wrote.  ""Please know that I HEAR YOU and I feel your pain. The LGBT Community was mostly responsible for birthing my career and I am deeply indebted to you,"" she added. ""You have loved me faithfully and unconditionally and for so many years you provided me with work even though my star had long since faded.""  Related: Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down to Play Inauguration-Related Event  In an interview with The Associated Press on Friday, Holliday defended her decision to perform at the inauguration.  ""I didn't see it as singing for Trump; I saw it as singing for the people on the mall,"" Holliday told the AP.  The performer, who most recently starred on Broadway in ""The Color Purple,"" said she was hurt by the angry backlash, which included calls to boycott her music. Others called her ""Uncle Tom"" and there was even a suggestion that she take her own life.  ""It just really made my heart drop to my feet,"" Holliday said. ""How could I have this much hate spewing at me, and I haven't even done anything? I guess it's not like those old days when political views were your own and you had freedom of speech. ... We live in a different time now, and a decision to go and do something for America is not so clear-cut anymore.""  Holliday was to perform at the ""Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration"" which included Keith, Voight, and Trump himself.  The celebrity wattage for Trump's inaugural festivities doesn't rival that of Barack Obama's inaugurations, which attracted top names including Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Alicia Keys, Kelly Clarkson, Eva Longoria and Jennifer Hudson, among others. But Trump has insisted that's how he wants it, saying the swearing-in festivities should be about the people, not the A-list stars."

"¬© Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt attend their ""By the Sea"" film premiere in Los Angeles on Nov. 5, 2015.  It's been nearly two years since Angelina Jolie left Brad Pitt and took their six kids with her in September 2016. But even after all this time, they have yet to finalize a divorce and custody agreement.  That's apparently now causing problems for the star, who allegedly wants to take their children -- Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 -- with her to London where she'll film Disney's ""Maleficent 2"" this summer. Brad is based in Los Angeles, where Angelina also bought a home in 2017.  In a May 23 report, Page Six writes that Hollywood sources familiar with her film have revealed Angelina, 42, ""is furious since she wants to bring the couple's brood with her while the film shoots."" The implication is that her current custody arrangement with Brad -- the terms of which have remained confidential -- doesn't allow her to do that at will.  ""They are figuring out how it would work, but she is not happy,"" a source told Page Six. ""She wants to take the kids to London with her while she's shooting -- and she's frustrated with the process. They're talking about how it would work.""  Angelina is so livid about the whole situation, the source added, ""Even the people around her are getting tired of it.""  ¬© Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock Angelina Jolie attends the Critics' Choice Awards in Los Angeles on Jan. 11, 2018.

""He chose a project that films in Los Angeles,"" an insider said in the new issue of Us Weekly. (Brad is starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino's upcoming ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."")

He is trying to drown it out by hanging with friends and doing stuff on his own time but he keeps thinking about her,‚Äù a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. ‚ÄúHe always wants to be around her, talk to her and be with her. She is like a drug for him, he just needs more and more and more.‚Äù  As the Biebs continues to struggle with their time apart, he‚Äôs got a few things up his sleeve for when she returns to LA. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt wait until she is back because he wants to really wine and dine her upon her return and really kick start the relationship back up again,‚Äù the insider reveals. It‚Äôs unclear when Sel is scheduled to return to the West Coast. But, as seen on her Instagram, she is having the time of her life. She posted a video which showed her laughing on a boat, accompanied by a subliminal message, that she ‚Äúchose‚Äù to take care of herself, ‚Äúnot to prove anything to anyone.‚Äù Was she trying to give us insight into her most recent split with Bieber?  Jelena fans went into panic mode after seeing Sel in the arms of another man on a boat on March 19. She was photographed hugging and goofing off in photos with Sydney native, Johnny Rays. While all signs point to a friendship between the two, the photos didn‚Äôt appear that way to some fans who claimed they looked too close for comfort.  While Sel has been vacationing Down Under, Bieber has been staying active. He‚Äôs been photographed playing hockey and soccer with friends. However, his emotions may be getting the best of him as he took a gnarly fall during a soccer game on March 19, and seemingly broke down on the sidelines of a hockey game on March 17.  As you may recall, Jelena reunited in October 2017, after her split with The Weeknd, 28. They seemed inseparable, having spent New Year‚Äôs together in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. However, their romance took a rocky turn around Bieber‚Äôs birthday on March 1, according to reports."
"Lest the Kardashians have pulled the greatest troll job on celebrity media since that time Joaquin Phoenix pretended to be a rapper, its safe to assume that Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are both pregnant , and have been for some time. Yet, the close-knit clan has stubbornly refused to confirm this. Like most open secrets, it's become almost frustrating. More frustrating than those two friends in your circle that everyone knows are secretly dating but refuse to admit it. More frustrating than knowing someone is throwing you a surprise birthday party but not knowing the exact details. More frustrating even than when someone you know keeps saying they're staying out of politics, but occasionally makes vague Facebook status that makes you think they're a secret Trump supporter. Yes, more frustrating than even that.  In the process, though, the Kardashian-Jenners have turned the presumably inevitable announcement and their surrounding anticipation into events on their own. It's not even a question of ""if"" that's interesting anymore, but rather ""how"" and ""when.... no seriously when? We're all waiting. There's a lot going on in the world right now. We have better things to think about.""  Well, at least one confirmation may be coming our way sometime sort of soon, if the latest preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians is any indication. The trailer begins with Kris Jenner (in that blonde wig ) and her three eldest daughters sitting around a table and presumably all cosplaying as powerful female crime lords, as Kris proposes, ""Let's raise a glass to Kris f------ Jenner."" Then they run through matters of Rob's whole situation with Blac Chyna, Kendall's anxiety issues, and a tarantula before we get to someone murmuring the phrase, ""Did you guys hear what's on TMZ?"" Then Kourtney says, ""I'm so sick of people like not saying anything."" (Yeah, us too.) Eventually, though, we wind up at a party where there's tears of joy and everyone is hugging Khloe. It definitely seems like a pregnancy announcement situation.  So, perhaps that's how the Khlo√© konfirmation goes down, almost as we all should have expected it, during a super-hyped episode of the family's show.  That leaves the matter of Kylie, who, save for some iPhone-shot footage, is as conspicuously absent from the preview as the part of her body below her neck is from her Snapchats. Some fans have theories about how her pregnancy could be revealed. Kim is currently teasing the family's Christmas card shoot on Instagram in a sort of 25 day long digital advent calendar: Khlo√© made her first full appearance today, but Kylie has been missing. Might she and her baby bump appear on day 25? Or could she too be waiting to reveal her news on the show?  Here's another curious matter to consider when mulling the timing: the trailer in question is for the second half of this season, which will begin on January 7th next year. So we may make it through the rest of 2017 without confirmation of either. What's another few weeks at this point? Then again, what's the point of calling the show Keeping Up With The Kardashians if we're all way ahead of it anyway?  Either way, the've managed to keep attention on this mystery for far longer than they should have. As they say in the trailer, ""Let's raise a glass to Kris f------ Jenner!""

"This is worse than a lump of coal in your stocking. We‚Äôve EXCLUSIVELY learned Brad Pitt fears Angelina Jolie will take their kids on a trip for the holiday, leaving him to spend Christmas alone!  Someone better cue up that Elvis Presley song, because Brad Pitt, 53, is headed for a ‚ÄúBlue Christmas,‚Äù especially if Angelina Jolie, 42, is particularly Grinchy when Christmas rolls around. What Brad wants more for the holiday is not a present or a toy, but a chance to spend the time with his kids ‚ÄîMaddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9. ‚ÄúThe holidays are extra hard for Brad,‚Äù a colleague of the Fury star EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. ‚ÄúHe misses his kids more than ever.

She‚Äôs very unpredictable.‚Äù A rep for Mr. Pitt declined to comment to HollywoodLife.com on this.

The Girl, Interrupted invited Brad to go trick-or-treating with the kids on Halloween, a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. She knows that Brad will always be a part of the kids‚Äô lives, so hopefully these two can work out the holiday schedule so they both have a happy Christmas.  After all, seeing Brad and Angie play nice during Christmas is exactly what their kids want. They would actually love it if they could spend the whole day with both mom and dad, an insider told HollywoodLife.com. Maybe next Christmas? While Angie and Brad have ‚Äúcome a long way‚Äù since she filed for divorce in 2016, they‚Äôre ‚Äúdefinitely not at the stage of being friends‚Äù yet. So, don‚Äôt expect Ms. Jolie to join the Pitts for a Missouri-style family Christmas.  What do you think Brad and Angie should do, HollywoodLifers?"
"According to CNN, the former police chief of a small New Jersey town said African-Americans had ‚Äúno value‚Äù and were ‚Äúlike ISIS,‚Äù and said he wanted to put them before a firing squad, and now the racist has been arrested.The FBI has arrested Frank Nucera Jr., who was the chief of Bordentown Township Police Department. They allege Nuncera referred to African-Americans using several racial slurs and told his officers to position police dogs at high school basketball games to specifically intimidate African-Americans.Nucera abruptly retired in February after he learned his use of racially motivated force was under investigation. He was making $151,418.31 per year. Nucera draws an annual pension of $105,992.76 ‚Äî $8,832.73 per month ‚Äî according to public records.Sixty-year-old Nucera is facing a hate crime charge and a federal civil rights charge. FBI Special Agent Vernon Addison wrote in an affidavit that Nucera ‚Äúhas a significant history of making racist comments concerning African Americans, to whom he frequently referred to as ‚Äòn*ggers'‚Äù. One of Nucera‚Äôs officers ‚Äúmade numerous recordings‚Äù of Nucera that ‚Äúcontained extremely offensive racist comments‚Äù over the course of a year because he was ‚Äúalarmed‚Äù by Nucera‚Äôs racism, according to the affidavit.The federal charges against Nucera relate to a Sept. 1, 2016, police encounter involving an 18-year-old African-American man and 16-year-old African-American girl. A hotel manager called police because he said the pair hadn‚Äôt paid for their hotel room the night before and were swimming in the hotel pool. The FBI affidavit states that their encounter with police ‚Äúescalated into a physical struggle,‚Äù that both teens ‚Äúresisted arrest‚Äù and that one of the officers used pepper spray.AdvertisementAfter both teens were handcuffed, Nucera grabbed the 18-year-old‚Äôs head and slammed it ‚Äúinto the right side of the metal doorjamb,‚Äù according to the affidavit. An officer heard the 18-year-old‚Äôs head make ‚Äúa loud thud‚Äù as it hit the doorjamb, the feds alleged. Officers said the 18-year-old wasn‚Äôt resisting when Nucera slammed his head, but had ‚Äústopped walking for a moment to loudly complain.‚Äù The use of force wasn‚Äôt reported to the department.Hours after the assault, Nucera was recorded telling an officer he was ‚Äúf*cking tired‚Äù of African-Americans.‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what, it‚Äôs gonna get to the point where I could shoot one of these motherfuckers,‚Äù Nucera allegedly said. ‚ÄúAnd that n*ggerr bitch lady, she almost got it,‚Äù he said, referring to the 16-year-old girl‚Äôs aunt, who was present at the arrest. ‚ÄúFucking nipple hanging bitch. I‚Äôm so tired of them, man.‚ÄùNucera allegedly said that black people should ‚Äústay the fuck out of Bordentown‚Äù and referred to the 18-year-old as ‚Äúfucking little, fucking n****r.‚ÄùIn a separate incident noted in the report that occurred in November 2015, Nucera said he wished an African-American from Trenton who he believed had slashed the tires of a police vehicle would give him a reason to ‚Äúput my hands‚Äù on him.‚ÄúThese n****rs are like ISIS, they have no value,‚Äù Nucera allegedly said. ‚ÄúThey should line them all up and mow ‚Äôem down. I‚Äôd like to be on the firing squad, I could do it. I used to think about if I could shoot someone or not, I could do it, I‚Äôm tired of it.‚Äù‚ÄúThe conduct alleged is shocking,‚Äù acting US Attorney William E. Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shocking breach of the duty of every police officer to provide equal justice under the law and to never mistreat a person in their custody.‚ÄùAdvertisementNucera appeared in court Wednesday afternoon in Camden, NJ, and waived his right to a preliminary hearing.

"With a baby on the way, Kim Kardashian & Kanye West have reportedly been fighting more than ever ‚Äî especially because Kim insists the birth be filmed for TV!  Kim Kardashian, 37, has already admitted that having a surrogate carry her and Kanye West‚Äòs, 40, third child is ‚Äúso much harder‚Äù than personally being pregnant. And it seems Kanye isn‚Äôt making things any easier for the reality star. In fact, a new report from InTouch Weekly claims the couple has been fighting constantly in the weeks leading up to their daughter‚Äôs arrival, and it‚Äôs driving Kim nuts. Their main source of tension? The mag claims Kim wants to film their child‚Äôs birth for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, while Kanye is totally against it.

Something that is different though, is the fact that the family had to use a surrogate this time around, as doctors advised Kim not to give birth for a third time. And while Kim‚Äôs said in the past that she and her surrogate get along, InTouch‚Äòs report also claims the tide has shifted, and now the surrogate doesn‚Äôt even want Kim in the delivery room when she gives birth!  ‚ÄúThere will be major tension between them in the delivery room,‚Äù a second source told the publication. ‚ÄúThe surrogate doesn‚Äôt even want Kim to be there at this point, but she has no other choice.

"Next Up Criminal Minds Exclusive: The New Case Has a Startling Connection to an Old Unsub  Jason Blossom's murderer has been found and it was a deeply chilling reveal for Riverdale fans.  It turns out that Clifford Blossom (Barclay Hope) is the one who pulled the trigger on his own son. A hidden flash drive found in Jason's (Trevor Stines) varsity jacket revealed footage from the Whyte Wyrm's basement that confirmed Clifford Blossom shot his own son in the head.  It took several twists and turns to get to the truth, though. The first gut punch was FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) confessing to the crime Archie (KJ Apa) and his friends knew he didn't commit. Then Hal Cooper (Lochlyn Munro) dropped the bomb that his grandfather was actually a Blossom ‚Äî meaning that Polly (Tiera Skovbye) and Jason are actually related.  Cole Sprouse, Casey Cott and Camilla Mendes, Riverdale Photo: Bettina Strauss, Bettina Strauss/The CW  Betty (Lili Reinhart) immediately assumed the incest was motive for the Blossoms to kill their own son. This put her a lot closer to the truth than Archie and Veronica (Camilla Mendes), who continued on their mission to find out if Veronica's imprisoned father, Hiram Lodge, had any connection to the brutal murder. It turns out that Veronica's father is guilty of many things, but murder isn't one of them.  Meanwhile, it turns out FP confessed because Clifford had threatened to harm Jughead (Cole Sprouse) if he didn't take the rap for the crime. While the sheriff knows who really pulled the trigger, FP still has to do time for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice, which leaves Jughead without a parental unit and staying with the Andrews until further notice.  Dear Diary: Why Do I Care More About Riverdale's Parents?  Now the big question heading into the Season 1 finale is, why did Clifford Blossom do it? The entire town knows that he's the man who pulled the trigger, but the Blossom patriarch hung himself before the police could bring him in for questioning. The finale next week will have to dig into what drove Clifford to want his son dead and, of course, set up the next mystery for the show's already-ordered second season.  The choice to make Clifford Blossom the murderer isn't the darkest route the show could have gone ‚Äî that would have been Archie ‚Äî but it does leave an open-ended path for the show to follow in their second effort. The mystery of who shot Jason may be wrapped up, but the ghost of the Blossom heir still looms over this sleepy small down, and there are more mysteries to uncover in the months after his fateful death.  Riverdale's first season finale airs Thursday, May 11 at 9/8c on The CW.  (Full disclosure: TVGuide.com is owned by CBS, one of The CW's parent companies)"

"Image copyright Roc Nation Image caption Jay-Z receives his platinum award from the RIAA  Jay-Z's latest album, 4:44, has been certified platinum less than a week after it was released - reflecting sales of one million copies in the US.  On the face of it, this is hugely impressive. In the space of just five days, Jay-Z has landed the sixth biggest-selling album of the year.  His first-week sales are now expected to double those of Kendrick Lamar's Damn! - previously the year's fastest-selling album - which shifted 603,000 copies back in April.  The feat looks even more impressive because 4:44 is only available on Tidal, the streaming service Jay-Z owns.  But then Variety magazine noticed something odd: The photograph of Jay-Z receiving his platinum award was taken before the album was released.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jay-Z's new song Bam is made Radio 1's ""hottest record""  How could the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) be so sure he'd pass the sales barrier?  Well, it turns out that Jay-Z had done a deal with mobile company Sprint (a major shareholder in Tidal), who gave away copies of the album to their subscribers.  Crucially, Sprint paid for each of those copies, making every ""free"" album eligible for a platinum award; and the RIAA says Jay-Z's label RocNation had to provide evidence that the downloads were in fact initiated by consumers.  But still - the RIAA rules state that the wholesale price of the album only needs to be $2 (¬£1.55) to register as a sale - so Sprint probably paid Jay-Z less than it would cost to air an advert during the Super Bowl (up to $3.8 million for 30 seconds).  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 4:44 sees Jay-Z respond to Beyonce's accusations of infidelity on her album Lemonade  It's almost certain that these downloads are what spurred Jay-Z's album to platinum status. To do it on streaming alone, the album's tracks would have had to be streamed 1.5 billion times, since 1,500 streams of a song count as one ""sale"" under current chart rules.  Given that Tidal has, at best, 3 million subscribers, each of them would have needed to listen to the album 500 times to push sales over the one million mark - an impossibility in just five days.  The album's performance in the UK - where the album is only available on Tidal - is instructive here. On Monday afternoon, when the Official Charts Company publishes its midweek sales flash, 4:44 hadn't been streamed enough times to make the Top 100.  (In the US, the free-but-paid-for downloads aren't chart eligible, so Jay-Z won't make a huge impact on the Billboard countdown, either).  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tidal was launched by an all-star line-up in 2015, promising better returns to artists - but it has struggled to compete with Apple and Spotify  So why go through this rigmarole? Well, the benefit to Jay-Z, in marketing terms, is huge. Music executives believe that gold and platinum awards have a bandwagon effect, leading to even-bigger sales.  And the RIAA has been accused of massaging the figures that count towards their awards before.  In 1994, for example, the music industry body claimed that the Lion King soundtrack had sold 7 million copies. SoundScan, which compiles the charts, contested the actual figure was 4.9 million. It turned out the RIAA had counted records that had been shipped to stores, but were still sitting on shelves and in warehouses (it also counts music distributed by non-retail record clubs, mail order houses, specialty stores and direct marketing sales).  So while you should take Jay-Z's figures with a pinch of marketing salt, it's also worth noting that 4:44 has been illegally downloaded almost a million times this week.  Fans are still eager to hear it, no matter how they're getting the music.  Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

"Alicia Keys is really in it to win it as a coach on The Voice. After promoting the reality competition on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last week, the singer appeared on NBC's The Today Show Tuesday (Mar. 7) to give morning viewers a taste of her fighting spirit.  While sitting down with Today's co-anchors Willie Geist and Carson Daly, the singer -- who was appropriately displayed on screen with the headline ""This Girl Is Still On Fire"" -- discussed motherhood, her singing career, and how they have influenced her judging role on The Voice. Both hosts were intrigued by the ""girl crush"" between Keys and her fellow coach, Gwen Stefani, even comparing their connection to the bromance of Blake Shelton and Adam Levine. But perhaps the most notable thing Keys said about her relationship with her fellow female coach is that it's even stronger than the one Stefani has with Shelton.  With a laugh and grin from ear to ear, the ""In Common"" songstress joked ""we love each other more than Blake and Gwen love each other, straight up!"" Shelton and Stefani -- who have been dating for about 16 months -- have been a guilty pleasure for viewers, as their fairytale romance is on full display each episode, especially this season.  Keys described her working chemistry with Gwen as ""amazing"" due to their long friendship. The singer had nothing but positive things to say about her experience as a judge calling it ""fun"" and boasting about the love that all the coaches share for one another.

The mom posted an image of herself wearing leggings and lifting up her t-shirt to reveal her abs, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost 20 pounds! Many asked how? Diet and cooking out of my cook book #wholenewyou,‚Äù she captioned the photo.  Although she mostly sticks to clean eating, Mowry will still indulge in the occasional treat. Prior to posting her weight loss photo, the star took to Instagram to share a picture of herself licking an ice cream cone. ‚ÄúIce cream didn‚Äôt stand a chance,‚Äù she wrote.

"Warner Bros. put a spell on Harry Potter fans Tuesday with the release of the first trailer for ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.‚Äù  In the trailer, Eddie Redmayne returns as the charmingly clumsy Newt Scamander, while Jude Law makes his Wizarding World debut as a young Albus Dumbledore. It‚Äôs teased that Scamander is acting under orders from Dumbledore to head to Paris, but as the future-Hogwarts headmaster notes, Scamander isn‚Äôt one for taking orders well.  The David Yates film follows Dumbledore and Scamander, his former student, as they join forces to recapture an escaped Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is on a mission to dominate all non-magical people with the help of his pureblood wizard followers.  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt move against Grindelwald,‚Äù Dumbledore tells Scamander in the clip. ‚ÄúIt has to be you.‚Äù  The trailer debuted amid casting controversy surrounding Depp, who was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in court filings. J.K.

"David Hasselhoff‚Äòs financial crisis continues.  The former ‚ÄúBaywatch‚Äù star can no longer afford the $21,000-per-month alimony payments to ex-wife Pamela Bach as he claims less than $4,000 to his name, according to TMZ. Hasselhoff, 63, who filed court documents last month to cut off the payments, has shelled out $2.3 million to his former spouse since their divorce in 2006.  Bach, 52, receives $252,000 per year from Hasselhoff, but the singer/actor only grosses $112,000 a month. Though Hasselhoff spends $66,000 of it, with living expenses, taxes and Bach‚Äôs payments, he has minimal funds to save. And while a court hearing has been set for the end of May, Hasselhoff isn‚Äôt sure if his current endeavors will be enough to salvage the payments.  Hasselhoff‚Äôs European tour was cut short due to poor ticket sales, and he‚Äôs reportedly unsure if his new reality show, ‚ÄúHoff the Record,‚Äù will find the same success as his previous small-screen endeavors.  While the documents obtained by the website noted that Hasselhoff‚Äôs assets, including real estate, cars, jewelry and retirement savings, among others, total $1.79 million, the cash flow is drying up.  Though Bach‚Äôs team alleges that Hasselhoff‚Äôs net worth is more than $120 million, the newly engaged star has already nixed retirement plans to stay afloat.  ‚ÄúI am 63 years of age, and am at an age when I should be preparing for retirement and not having to continue working in order to pay [Bach‚Äôs] support,‚Äù Hasselhoff said in papers filed in April.  Though he is set to make an appearance in next year‚Äôs ‚ÄúBaywatch‚Äù reboot, it‚Äôs unclear if that paycheck will ease his stress. In addition to Bach‚Äôs payments, as well as his own expenses, Hasselhoff is responsible for daughters Hayley, 23, and TaylorAnn, 25, who live under his roof.  A rep for Hasselhoff did not immediately return our request for comment."
"Shannon Beador has been 'blindsided' by her estranged husband David's new relationship.  David has gone public on Instagram with new girlfriend Lesley, who he reportedly started dating in December, just two months after Shannon announced their separation after 17 years of marriage.

He also added emojis of a plane, a tropical island, a sun and two glasses of wine.

The star is also asking for sole physical custody of their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody.  Shannon has requested David be granted child visitation.  She cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.

But still there were problems.  During the season 12 reunion show of RHOC she broke down in tears when she said it was David, not her, who wanted the marriage to end.  'It‚Äôs not what I wanted and it‚Äôs been really, really hard,' she said.  'We went on a trip to Hawaii, which I kind of hoped would bring everything together, but he left the trip early.

The star is asking for sole physical custody of her their three children, 16-year-old Sophie and 13-year-old twins Stella and Adeline and joint legal custody  'I said to David, when he told me it was over, ""What happened? We had a couple of amazing years."" And he goes, ""We had a couple good months."" It was just a knife in the heart.'  Shannon also revealed David became distant from her when she gained 40lbs.  She has been very frank with her fans about her struggle to lose weight and how the stress from her bad marriage made her eat more.  She told People last year: 'It‚Äôs heartbreaking for me and my daughters that this is the road that had to be taken but it‚Äôs the only way.  'I felt alone in my marriage. You can do what you can to keep your family together, but you have to have willing parties.  'You need two people to make a marriage work, and that just wasn‚Äôt happening in our relationship.'"
"If you‚Äôre looking for some fitness motivation, look no further than Brittany Cartwright. For the past year, the Vanderpump Rules SURver been on a serious health kick and the results of her lifestyle transformation are amazing.  The Kentucky beauty, who is currently planning a wedding with fianc√© Jax Taylor, revealed that she's lost 25 pounds.

"A leaked Hillary Clinton email confirms that the Obama administration, with Hillary at the helm, orchestrated a civil war in Syria to benefit Israel.The new Wikileaks release shows the then Secretary of State ordering a war in Syria in order to overthrow the government and oust President Assad, claiming it was the ‚Äúbest way to help Israel‚Äù.Newobserveronline.com reports:The document was one of many unclassified by the US Department of State under case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, following the uproar over Clinton‚Äôs private email server kept at her house while she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013.Although the Wikileaks transcript dates the email as December 31, 2000, this is an error on their part, as the contents of the email (in particular the reference to May 2012 talks between Iran and the west over its nuclear program in Istanbul) show that the email was in fact sent on December 31, 2012.The email makes it clear that it has been US policy from the very beginning to violently overthrow the Syrian government‚Äîand specifically to do this because it is in Israel‚Äôs interests.‚ÄúThe best way to help Israel deal with Iran‚Äôs growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,‚Äù Clinton forthrightly starts off by saying.Even though all US intelligence reports had long dismissed Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúatom bomb‚Äù program as a hoax (a conclusion supported by the International Atomic Energy Agency), Clinton continues to use these lies to ‚Äújustify‚Äù destroying Syria in the name of Israel.She specifically links Iran‚Äôs mythical atom bomb program to Syria because, she says, Iran‚Äôs ‚Äúatom bomb‚Äù program threatens Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù on nuclear weapons in the Middle East.If Iran were to acquire a nuclear weapon, Clinton asserts, this would allow Syria (and other ‚Äúadversaries of Israel‚Äù such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt) to ‚Äúgo nuclear as well,‚Äù all of which would threaten Israel‚Äôs interests.Therefore, Clinton, says, Syria has to be destroyed.Iran‚Äôs nuclear program and Syria‚Äôs civil war may seem unconnected, but they are. What Israeli military leaders really worry about ‚Äî but cannot talk about ‚Äî is losing their nuclear monopoly.An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today.If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.It is, Clinton continues, the ‚Äústrategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria‚Äù that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel‚Äôs security.This would not come about through a ‚Äúdirect attack,‚Äù Clinton admits, because ‚Äúin the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel‚Äù this has never occurred, but through its alleged ‚Äúproxies.‚ÄùThe end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel‚Äôs leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests.Bringing down Assad would not only be a massive boon to Israel‚Äôs security, it would also ease Israel‚Äôs understandable fear of losing its nuclear monopoly.Then, Israel and the United States might be able to develop a common view of when the Iranian program is so dangerous that military action could be warranted.Clinton goes on to asset that directly threatening Bashar Assad ‚Äúand his family‚Äù with violence is the ‚Äúright thing‚Äù to do:In short, the White House can ease the tension that has developed with Israel over Iran by doing the right thing in Syria.With his life and his family at risk, only the threat or use of force will change the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad‚Äôs mind.The email proves‚Äîas if any more proof was needed‚Äîthat the US government has been the main sponsor of the growth of terrorism in the Middle East, and all in order to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù Israel.It is also a sobering thought to consider that the ‚Äúrefugee‚Äù crisis which currently threatens to destroy Europe, was directly sparked off by this US government action as well, insofar as there are any genuine refugees fleeing the civil war in Syria.In addition, over 250,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, which has spread to Iraq‚Äîall thanks to Clinton and the Obama administration backing the ‚Äúrebels‚Äù and stoking the fires of war in Syria.The real and disturbing possibility that a psychopath like Clinton‚Äîwhose policy has inflicted death and misery upon millions of people‚Äîcould become the next president of America is the most deeply shocking thought of all.Clinton‚Äôs public assertion that, if elected president, she would ‚Äútake the relationship with Israel to the next level,‚Äù would definitively mark her, and Israel, as the enemy of not just some Arab states in the Middle East, but of all peace-loving people on earth."

"CLOSE These are the women that will represent the U.S. in Pyeongchang, South Korea in February. USA TODAY Sports  Mirai Nagasu, Bradie Tennell and Karen Chen will make up the Olympic team. (Photo: Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports)  SAN JOSE, Calif. ‚Äì There will be no surprises this year. The U.S. women‚Äôs Olympic figure skating team is set: Bradie Tennell, Mirai Nagasu and Karen Chen.  Unlike four years ago, when U.S. Figure Skating‚Äôs international committee chose to replace Nagasu with Ashley Wagner, the committee went by the order of the national championships, picking the first three finishers in the women‚Äôs competition at the 2018 nationals.  This means that the women‚Äôs team in Pyeongchang next month will be entirely different from the team that competed in Sochi four years ago: Wagner, Gracie Gold and Polina Edmunds. For most of the four years leading up to 2018, either Wagner or Gold, or both, were at the top of the sport domestically.  MORE: Wagner 'furious' at scoring  Each of the three women to make the team is something of a surprise. Tennell, 19, rose to prominence as recently as Thanksgiving weekend when she finished a surprising third at Skate America. That was the same competition Wagner, who finished fourth here, suddenly withdrew with an ankle infection.  Nagasu, 24, had an uneven fall season, but her attempts to land the difficult triple axel renewed her career. She won her only national title 10 years ago, in 2008. She finished fourth at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver.  Chen, 18, also overcame a disappointing fall season. She won the 2017 national title and finished fourth at the worlds in Helsinki, helping to secure three spots for the U.S. women at the 2018 Olympics.  Wagner, 26, the only U.S. woman to win a world championship medal in the past 11 seasons (silver in 2016), was named the first alternate.  PHOTOS: Best of the 2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championship"
"The heart wants what it wants ‚Äî and Selena Gomez's heart just wants her puppy back! It's been almost two months since she split from her ex-boyfriend The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) and even though they've both moved on, there's one major thing that the former couple is still fighting about ‚Äî the dog that they adopted while they were still together! Sources exclusively reveal to Life & Style that Sel thinks she should keep their Cavalier King Charles Spaniel pup, Charlie, ""and so does Abel.‚Äù  ‚ÄúSelena is angry,‚Äù says the source, ‚Äúbecause she feels like it was more of a gift from Abel to her than a mutually adopted pet, so she‚Äôs determined to keep it.‚Äù  Selena Gomez gave her dog Charlie a kiss while on set of her untitled film project. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Back in September ‚Äî just one month before their split ‚Äî Selena, 25, and Abel, 27, were spotted together at an NYC pet shop and they seemed to have picked out the puppy together. It also seemed like they shared custody of the pup even though Selena is the only one who had been spotted with Charlie in public. But it seems like Abel has grown attached to Charlie too, and he shared photos of the adorable dog on his Instagram story before their split.  Selena got Charlie just days after she announced that she had spent the summer recovering from a kidney transplant as a result of her battle with lupus, so it seems like Charlie helped her get through that health scare. But now that she's feeling better, Sel is getting back to work on an untitled project with controversial filmmaker Woody Allen and that's why Abel thinks he should be the one to have custody of Charlie.  ‚ÄúHe thinks Selena won‚Äôt be able to take care of Charlie as well as he will because of her schedule,‚Äù the source says, adding that Selena isn‚Äôt listening ‚Äî and she won't give up Charlie without a fight. ‚ÄúShe is in love with her puppy.‚Äù  For more on your favorite celebrities, pick up the new issue of Life & Style on stands now!

"More than a month has passed since Matt Lauer was fired from the Today show, and his former longtime colleague, Katie Couric, is now opening up about the former NBC anchor‚Äôs shocking dismissal.  ‚ÄúThe whole thing has been very painful for me,‚Äù Couric, 61, tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúThe accounts I‚Äôve read and heard have been disturbing, distressing and disorienting and it‚Äôs completely unacceptable that any woman at the Today show experienced this kind of treatment.  ‚ÄúI had no idea this was going on during my tenure or after I left,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI think I speak for many of my former colleagues when I say this was not the Matt we knew. Matt was a kind and generous colleague who treated me with respect. In fact, a joke I once made on late-night television was just that, because it was completely contrary to our brother-sister relationship. It‚Äôs still very upsetting. I really admire the way Savannah [Guthrie] and Hoda [Kotb] and the entire Today show staff have handled a very difficult situation.‚Äù  The late-night show joke that Couric refers to is when she said on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in 2012 that Lauer ‚Äúpinches me on the ass a lot.‚Äù A clip of the comment made the rounds online in the wake of Lauer‚Äôs firing.  Couric spent 15 years co-hosting NBC‚Äôs Today show with Lauer, 60, but left in May 2006 to anchor the CBS Evening News.  NBC/Getty  Lauer was fired at the end of November by NBC News after the network received a ‚Äúdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,‚Äù with reason to believe ‚Äúthis may not have been an isolated incident.‚Äù Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  ‚ÄúThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,‚Äù he said, in part. ‚ÄúTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.‚Äù  Although her PEOPLE interview is the first time Couric has spoken in detail about Lauer‚Äôs exit, she briefly broke her silence about the scandal on social media in December.  In a short response to an Instagram user, who called Couric out for not publicly addressing the scandal, the veteran journalist said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs incredibly upsetting and I will say something when I‚Äôm ready to. Thanks for your interest.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time‚Äôs Up Movement  The claims against Lauer came as hundreds of women and men ‚Äî including Rose McGowan, Ashley Judd, Terry Crews and Anthony Rapp ‚Äî have publicly came forward about alleged sexual misconduct at the hands of powerful men in Hollywood, including Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey.  The movement inspired the new Time‚Äôs Up initiative and legal defense fund that was created to help victims of sexual misconduct pursue legal action against their perpetrators. Time‚Äôs Up was a major focus at this year‚Äôs Golden Globes, where almost all the famous attendees wore black to raise awareness about the cause.  ‚ÄúI think it was really moving to see so many women support each other and demand change, not only for themselves, but for mistreated and marginalized women in all kinds of industries,‚Äù Couric tells PEOPLE about Time‚Äôs Up. ‚ÄúClearly we are witnessing a sea change and a long overdue course correction.‚Äù  She also said that one of the new of the episodes of her upcoming six-part documentary Nat Geo series will focus on harassment women have experienced in their workplaces.  ‚ÄúOne of my Nat Geo episodes explores the various obstacles that are holding women back in Hollywood, Silicon Valley and beyond,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI just interviewed Elisabeth Moss about this. Harassment is just one part of the equation.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie Are Today‚Äôs New Anchor Team  As for future projects, Couric is focused on her new documentary series as well as her popular podcast ‚Äî and teaching her husband John Molner about social media.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm having so much fun doing my podcast with my friend Brian Goldsmith,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been able to have extended and substantive conversations with so many great, interesting people, like Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Alec Baldwin, David Axelrod, Ava DuVernay and Ina Garten. And now we‚Äôre ‚Äòdropping‚Äô episodes weekly. Coming up: Laverne Cox and Amy Schumer.  ‚ÄúMeanwhile, I‚Äôm still happily married (after three years!) and I‚Äôm teaching John how to do Instagram stories,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúHis are pretty lame so far.

"John Cena and Nikki Bella had a lot of ups and downs in their six-year relationship, one of which was the time Bella revealed that she had been married before she met Cena.  The secret was one of the biggest plot points of Total Divas season 2, which aired in 2014.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  By that point, Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, had been dating for two years. She was even living with him, having signed his 75-page cohabitation agreement that forces her to move out all her belongings ‚Äúas soon as possible‚Äù upon their separation.  But Bella was still hiding her past nuptials. And it turns out, it was not just from Cena.  During an emotional sit-down captured on camera, Bella told her family about her wedding for the first time ‚Äî explaining to mom Kathy Colace, brother JJ Garcia and twin sister Brie (among others) that she was ashamed of her decision.  ‚ÄúI got married when I was 20. And got divorced at 23, to my high school sweetheart,‚Äù Bella said. ‚ÄúBasically we got married by Elvis. We drove to Vegas, did it.‚Äù  The union was something Bella regretted from the beginning. ‚ÄúEven when I started walking down the aisle, I knew this was a huge mistake and how can I get out of it and I couldn‚Äôt,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúI tried to forget about it but now it‚Äôs starting to come up, and I figured you guys have to hear from me before you hear from anyone else.

I‚Äôd be pissed for him if you hadn‚Äôt told him. ‚ÄòCause you talk about marriage all the time with him, don‚Äôt expect it to be easy,‚Äù Garcia said. ‚Äú[These things] really don‚Äôt just happen. You don‚Äôt just run off and get married and not tell your family for 10 years. That doesn‚Äôt just happen.

Cena look flabbergasted but kept the conversation moving.  Later, Bella finally got the courage to say something to Cena herself.  Luckily, having gone through a divorce (to ex-wife Elizabeth Huberdeau in 2012 after three years of marriage), Cena was more understanding than anything. Still, as the two had been fighting about marriage ‚Äî with Cena reluctant to walk down the aisle again ‚Äî he encouraged Bella to be more honest with him.  ‚ÄúWhen the focus of most of our problems has to do with that particular topic, maybe I should know that stuff,‚Äù he told Bella. ‚ÄúI know how you feel. You‚Äôre a human being, so I know you want certain things. But I would especially know how you feel about it because you had a bad experience.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care,‚Äù Cena added. ‚ÄúWhat you did before you met me is what you did before you met me, I don‚Äôt need to know everything about you.

The 20-year-old, who shares baby Stormi with boyfriend Travis Scott , proved once and for all that she's still got it as she posed up in nothing but a white swimsuit.  In a pair of pictures she posted on Instagram, Kylie, who recently ditched her lip fillers, gives the camera a sultry gaze as she shows off her curves.  ""Good morning,"" the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star captioned the sexy snaps, and her fans couldn't get enough.  (Image: Splash News)  In the first picture, lip kit mogul Kylie lies on her side in the white swimsuit, which features mesh detailing on the body and mesh sleeves.  She clasps her hands together, revealing a neutral shade on her famous talons, as she stares into the lens.  Her lips are noticeably smaller after she got rid of her fillers and her brunette locks flop over onto the bed with her nude lips and brown eyeshadow giving her a much more natural look.  In the second snap, Kylie lies on her back with her eyes closed and her hands placed on top of her head.  ""In love w/ you,"" one fan commented.  While another said: ""Ok these are hot babe ""  (Image: Instagram/kyliejenner)  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  ""QUEEN,"" one dubbed her.  And another said: ""what a babe!! Loving this look""  It comes after fans came up with some bizarre theories about why she decided to stop getting lip injections to plump up her pout.  Some fans have a wild theory that she's got rid of her fillers and stopped using fake tan in order to look more 'Asian'.  And some trolls think it's because there was some overlap in her relationship with Tyga, who is of Vietnamese descent, and her current boyfriend Travis.  They think that Kylie is trying to make herself look more like Stormi in a bid to stop people questioning who her father is.

Kylie's mum Kris Jenner was forced to swing into action after Tyga took to Snapchat when news of her pregnancy broke, alleging, ""hell nah that's my kid.""  The couple split in April 2017 but were rumoured to have still been sleeping together around the time she fell pregnant.  But the rumours were dismissed by the famous family as ""silly"".  And soon afterwards, Tyga backtracked on it.  ""I didn‚Äôt comment on anything, I didn‚Äôt comment on anything, it was a fake story. It‚Äôs all a fake story,"" he told Metro."

But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, ‚ÄúUh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.‚Äù  By the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.  Jason? He knew a year later.  I have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I‚Äôm going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.  First, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.  The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.  He is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him ‚Äî or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes ‚Äî know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.  If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food ‚Äî man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening‚Äôs meal.  Jason loves listening to live music; it‚Äôs our favorite thing to do together. I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, Paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else."

The deal with ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù scuttles any possible return to ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù for Clarkson, who was the winner of the talent competition‚Äôs first season in 2002 and appeared as a guest judge during the show‚Äôs 15th and final season on Fox.  Related ‚ÄòAmerican Idol‚Äô: Ryan Seacrest in Advanced Talks to Return as Host for ABC Revival (EXCLUSIVE)  With season 14 of ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù set to premiere in February, Clarkson will likely be spinning her chair at NBC at the same time that ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúIdol,‚Äù expected to debut in March, is getting off the ground. The two shows could even find themselves going head-to-head. ABC has committed to roughly 40 hours of ‚ÄúIdol,‚Äù making it highly likely that the show will air two nights a week, as it did on Fox. According to sources, ABC is eyeing Sunday as one of those nights. The end of the spring cycle of ‚ÄúThe Bachelor‚Äù in mid-March would open up Monday evenings for an hour-long weekly ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù results show. There it could face NBC‚Äôs regular 8-10 p.m. episode of ‚ÄúThe Voice.‚Äù  In addition to being the first ‚ÄúIdol‚Äù champion, Clarkson is also one of its most distinguished alums, having risen to pop-star status on the strength of singles such as ‚ÄúSince U Been Gone.‚Äù Clarkson was also a judge on ABC‚Äôs short-lived singing competition ‚ÄúDuets.‚Äù In addition to manager Blackstock, she is represented by CAA.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited to join ‚ÄòThe Voice‚Äô at NBC,‚Äù Clarkson said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve gone back and forth about a role as a coach for years, but the timing hasn‚Äôt been right until now. I have always loved appearing on the show as an adviser or performer and established an amazing relationship with the network during my Christmas special. I can‚Äôt wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up-and-coming artists and provide them with the help and support they‚Äôve needed to break into the industry. Watch out Shelton, I‚Äôm comin‚Äô to win!!‚Äù  ‚ÄúKelly has been a part of ‚ÄòThe Voice‚Äô family for many years as an adviser and performer. We are thrilled she has chosen to join us as a coach to mentor the next generation through our unique vocal boot camp,‚Äù said Paul Telegdy, president, alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. ‚ÄúEvery time Kelly Clarkson sings you are reminded what an incredible voice really is. We are looking forward to the sound of Kelly Clarkson on ‚ÄòThe Voice.‚Äô‚Äù"
"Zayn Malik released the action-packed video for his new single ""Let Me"" on Thursday (April 12), and fans were quick to notice a face that was quite similar to ex-girlfriend's Gigi Hadid .  Let's start at the top: The song is essentially about Zayn asking someone to let him love them forever. He makes specific references at a number of points in the song, alluding to wanting ""walks on the beach in April,"" and ""duvet days and vanilla ice cream"" again. Elle has already pointed out that the beach walking thing could be referencing Gigi's birthday, which is in April. According to now-deleted Instagram pictures, the two spent celebrated her birthday in 2016, you guessed it, exploring the beach together.  However, while the lyrics are vague enough to keep fans speculating, what seems to be more obvious is his on-screen companion, model Sofia Jamora . Fans on social media have repeatedly noted that she looks strikingly similar to Gigi, between her middle-part blonde hairstyle to even some of her facial features. One person tweeted, ""and also does anyone else think the girl in 'let me' by zayn looks alot like Gigi Hadid?!"" Another fan wrote, ""I‚Äôm seeing a lot of comments under the video about Sofia Jamora looking a lot like Gigi and now I can‚Äôt unsee it.""  As with everything, it stands to be remembered that it could sincerely all be chalked up to coincidence. Songs and videos are often produced way in advance, and with multiple writers and producers on board. It's more than possible that the song could have nothing to do with his relationship, and Sofia was just an apt fit. Either way, the single is definitely a jam, so we can enjoy it no matter what.

"How much would you pay to watch an episode of ""Game of Thrones"" with Daenerys Targaryen?  Turns out Brad Pitt would have happily plunked down six figures for the honor.  Greg Doherty / Patrick McMullan / Getty Images / Kevin Mazur / Getty Images / .  On Saturday, Jan. 6, Brad joined celebs including Lena Dunham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Segel, Connie Britton, Patricia Arquette, Mark Burnett, Leonardo DiCaprio -- and ""GOT"" stars Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington -- at Milk Studios in Los Angeles for a gala to benefit Sean Penn's Haiti disaster recovery charity, the J/P HRO & Disaster Relief Organization.  According to the New York Post, the evening featured an auction where an Emilia-adjacent ""GOT"" viewing session was one of the prizes available to bidders.  Bidding reportedly started at $20,000 as the auctioneer teased the A-list crowd, hollering lines like , ""Is the King of the North here?!"" (The King of the North, it seems, had stepped out of the room to use the men's room.)  Brad, who is reportedly dating but still single since his split from Angelina Jolie, initially offered to pay $80,000 to watch the show with its dragon-mother star, then one-upped his own bid by offering to cough up $90,000. When Kit Harrington returned to the room, he threw an offer in the pot as well, according to the Post, a move that apparently inspired Brad to raise his bid to $120,000.  Ultimately, the actor lost out to another attendee who posted a $160,000 bid.  The annual event also used its platform to celebrate the environmental work Leonardo DiCaprio has been doing in the realm of climate change through his foundation.  ""The biggest challenge now is to make sure that everyone understands what's at stake. But how can we do this when we have a president who, just this week, proposed a massive increase in offshore drilling?"" Leo asked the crowd during his speech.  MediaPunch/REX/Shutterstock  He added: ""Their denial of so much of the scientific proof and evidence belongs in 'the Earth is flat' chapter of human history.""  Leo went on to praise Sean Penn for his aid and recovery work in Haiti.  ""These are obviously incredibly turbulent and scary times,"" Leo said. ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that has.""  The $15,000-a-plate gala, which Sean has held annually the night before the Golden Globes every year since 2010, raised more than $3.5 million for his J/P HRO charity, according to the Associated Press. The organization recently expanded its recovery efforts and now works with partner organizations to provide aid in hurricane-damaged communities in Texas, Florida and the Virgin Islands, as well as Haiti."
"Harry Styles has a unique sense of style ... or does he? The singer-songwriter admits he has models his look after '90s country-pop superstar Shania Twain , who was one of his mom's favorite artists when he was growing up.  ""I think both music and fashion, [my] main influence was probably Shania Twain. I think she's amazing,"" Styles raves to Entertainment Tonight .  It's a surprising connection, no doubt, but makes sense when you look at the former One Direction frontman and the country icon ‚Äî both love colorful, extravagant outfits that defy the norm.  Styles has been putting his foot in the water of country music a lot recently, offering a stellar rendition of Little Big Town 's "" Girl Crush "" during a show at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium, where Cam was his opening act. He says the track is ""one of my favorite songs recently that's come out of this place,"" meaning Nashville.  He'll also take trailblazer Kacey Musgraves out on the road with him as an opening act during the U.S. dates of his 2018 Live on Tour . Additionally, the pop singer has said that he wants to collaborate with Chris Stapleton , citing himself as a ""massive fan."" He also has a fan in Gretchen Wilson , who praised his 2017 self-titled album, calling it ""something real.""  Twain's latest album, Now, her first studio album release since 2002's massively successful Up!, landed at No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Country Albums chart in 2017. The album's second single ""We Got Something They Don't"" is currently on country radio."

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel in one week, and ET is breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  The excitement is in the air, as Meghan's family and friends are starting to make their way to London. Just in time for Mother's Day, Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, arrived in England earlier this week.  A source told ET on Thursday that Meghan has ""normal last-minute nerves"" ahead of her nuptials, but is happy to have her mother by her side in the days before she says ""I do."" According to our source, this is the first time Doria will see Meghan's dress, as Meghan just had her final fittings a week and a half ago. The Los Angeles native's father, Thomas Markle, is also expected to arrive by the weekend.  ""Doria will be here to help Meghan relax in the last days before she becomes a [royal],"" the source said, adding that one of Meghan's closest pals, Jessica Mulroney, will arrive next week to ""help Meghan out with last-minute touches ahead of her big day.""  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be tying the knot in:  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  The rumor mill this week has Queen Elizabeth sneaking a peek at Meghan's wedding dress. The bride's gown is said to be hidden away in Windsor and will show it to the queen this week or possibly the next, according to US Weekly.  Another story circulating the web is that Meghan's gown -- rumored to be a custom Ralph & Russo Couture creation -- will cost approximately $135,600.  ""Meghan‚Äôs dress is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" royal expert Melanie Bromley told Harper's Bazaar. ""It's going to be featured in the history books, so needs to stand the test of time.‚Äù  The price may seem quite high, though that doesn't compare to Kate Middleton's custom Alexander McQueen design that cost around $400,000. ""But that eye-watering price was befitting for a future queen, so it‚Äôs unlikely Meghan‚Äôs will be as expensive because it could be seen by some as being disrespectful,‚Äù Bromley added.  ET‚Äôs royal expert Katie Nicholl had echoed those sentiments back in March, saying, ""I think it's very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that and in doing so try and upstage a future queen.""  OUT AND ABOUT  Although we didn't get a real sighting from Meghan and Prince Harry this week (they're kinda busy, ya know, preparing for a royal wedding!), fans freaked out via social media when Madame Tussauds unveiled two wax figures of the bride-to-be on Wednesday.  One is located in New York City, in the Madame Tussauds' Royal Palace Experience. Meghan's likeness, dressed in a gown donated by one of real Meghan's favorite designers, Self Portrait, is perfectly placed right next to a wax replica of Harry.  Cindy Ord/Getty Images for Madame Tussauds  A second wax figure of the former Suits star was unveiled at the museum's London location, where the statue sports a green dress and nude heels, with her hair flowing past her shoulders in a similar style.  Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images  According to Christine Haughney, Madame Tussauds' regional head of marketing for northeast, Meghan is aware that the wax figures exist. ""She has [seen photos],"" Haughney told ET. ""We hope [she approves].""  RATHER REGAL LOOKS  We already took a look back at Meghan's royal style since first being spotted with her fiance.

"Shay Mitchell, who frequently documents her vacations on social media, responded to accusations on Friday that she had faked some of her travel photos from a recent trip to China.  ‚ÄúView so nice it almost looks‚Ä¶ fake,‚Äù the former Pretty Little Liars star, 30, wrote alongside an image of herself standing in front of Shanghai‚Äôs famous waterside attraction The Bund.

"Remember when dry shampoo first became popular? It was like the godsend we didn‚Äôt know we were waiting for. Finally a product that allowed us to skip showers without having the world know how lazy we are! You could practically hear the scalps of oily-haired girls rejoicing. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve taken things a bit far. We‚Äôre misusing the product, and our hair is paying the price.  When I went to visit Nunzio Saviano‚Äòs salon for a new cut, he took one look at my hair and asked, ‚ÄúHow often are you using dry shampoo?‚Äù Apparently my dull color and rough texture were telltale signs that I‚Äôd been hitting the bottle a little too often.  Since my hair is pretty thick and incredibly hard to dry, I tend to wash it once every five days. To make the shampoo last, I spray a little dry shampoo onto my roots every morning. This, according to Saviano, is far too often. ‚ÄúYou should only get a day out of your dry shampoo, and then wash,‚Äù he says.  So why should dry shampoo be used so sparingly? As Saviano points out, it‚Äôs not just baby powder inside those aerosol cans. Tons of chemicals are being sprayed onto your scalp, which clog the pores and don‚Äôt let the scalp breathe. Think of it like nail polish. If you‚Äôre wearing nail color 24/7, you‚Äôre not letting your nails get any oxygen, which is why they can turn yellow. Scalps should be allowed to breathe as well.  To use dry shampoo correctly, only use on your last day of a blowout, and make sure to shampoo it out the following day.  Read more: 6 New Ways to Use Dry Shampoo"
"Julianna Margulies is adding her own experience to the ongoing conversation about sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood‚Äîand claims she had a frightening encounter with actor Steven Seagal. The Emmy-winning actress and Seagal costarred in the 1991 film Out for Justice.  A representative for Seagal did not respond to PEOPLE‚Äôs request for comment on Friday,  ‚ÄúWhen I was 23, a casting director, a woman, said, ‚ÄòSteven Seagal wants to go over the scene with you in his hotel room at 10 o‚Äôclock at night,'‚Äù Margulies told Jenny Hutt for SiriusXM‚Äôs Just Jenny on Friday.  ‚ÄúI lived in Brooklyn, and I said, ‚ÄòOh, I don‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt travel. I don‚Äôt have money for a cab.‚Äô And I didn‚Äôt. And I said, ‚ÄòAnd I don‚Äôt take subways late at night.‚Äô And she says, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry we‚Äôll reimburse you. And I‚Äôm here, a woman,‚Äô ‚Äù the E.R. alum recalled. ‚ÄúI got to the hotel at 10:40, and she wasn‚Äôt there. And he was. Alone. And he made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life. And I got out of there unscathed.‚Äù  Gary Gershoff/WireImage; Paul Archuleta/Getty  In late October, Seagal joined the list of major Hollywood figures accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. Inside Edition correspondent Lisa Guerrero‚Äôs recent accusations against Seagal came nearly a decade after Jenny McCarthy recalled an alleged incident in which he asked her to strip naked for the movie Under Siege 2 during a private audition in 1998.  A spokesman for Seagal previously denied McCarthy‚Äôs claims. Representatives for Seagal have not responded to PEOPLE‚Äôs request for comment regarding any of the claims.  Marguiles also spoke about an alleged past incident with Weinstein.  ‚ÄúI have my own Harvey story, but I never was raped. And I never was harmed. And I don‚Äôt know how I got out of that hotel room,‚Äù the actress said during her SiriusXM interview. ‚ÄúIt always starts with, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a healer, I want to massage you‚Äô and all. I sorta screamed my way out‚Ä¶But, the point is that for years, years, we all just shrug it off.‚Äù  Concluding, ‚ÄúAnd because of my experience with Steven Seagal in that room, which was horrific, I refused to meet Harvey Weinstein in his hotel room when another woman brought me, saying ‚Äòyou will absolutely get [a screen test].‚Äô ‚Äú  WATCH: Multiple Women Accuse Movie Mogul Harvey Weinstein of Sexual Harassment as He Announces Leave of Absence  Get push notifications with news, features and more.

You know, one of the things I want to stay clear of in this dialogue, collectively with other women and men, is that it‚Äôs not always the men that are awful,‚Äù Margulies said.  Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct in the past couple weeks by more than 50 women, including multiple allegations of assault. (The movie mogul has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.)  Margulies appeared on Just Jenny along with Erin Merryn, a childhood sexual abuse survivor who is fighting for states to pass Erin‚Äôs Law, which mandates schools teach sexual abuse awareness and prevention.

"The clock is ticking for ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerican Idol‚Äô reboot to find two more judges to join Katy Perry. We‚Äôve got EXCLUSIVE details on how producers have their eyes on Selena Gomez to join the show.  It would be pretty awkward to see Taylor Swift‚Äòs BFF Selena Gomez, 25, sitting next to arch-enemy Katy Perry, 32, week after week on American Idol, but the ‚ÄúFetish‚Äù singer is at the top of the show producers‚Äô wish-list for judges. ‚ÄúProducers think that Selena would be great to join the judging panel because she‚Äôd bring in a younger crowd for ratings, she‚Äôd be considered the nice judge and they would love her to join because the impact she has with social media,‚Äù an AI insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Sel is the most followed person on Instagram with a whopping 127 million followers, so of course the show would love to have a judge who can reach so many people.  ‚ÄúThey are putting together a proposal for her and are hoping she will accept it and join the show, it‚Äôs a long shot but they are taking the chance to get her. They‚Äôd love to have her signed up and all judges by mid October,‚Äù our insider adds. So far the show has been striking out right and left when it comes to getting other stars to join Katy on the panel. ABC reportedly spent a whopping $25 million to land her back in May, which is over half of the show‚Äôs budget. As a result, they don‚Äôt have much money left over to get other top names. After all, who wants to do the same job as Katy for a fraction of the paycheck? Especially in Selena‚Äôs case, she is the bigger star these days! See pics of beautiful Selena, right here.  If by some chance Selena actually agrees to join the show, they definitely need a ‚Äúnice‚Äù judge cause Katy said she won‚Äôt be holding back when it comes to the contestants‚Äô talent. She called in to On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Aug. 23, to give her judging strategy. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to maybe be more the Simon Cowell. I really respect him. As much as people said, ‚ÄòOh, he‚Äôs grumpy or he‚Äôs mean,‚Äô he was just truthful, you know? He‚Äôs seen it. I don‚Äôt need to be there to win the popular race.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúHonestly sob stories come second for me. Everyone has a situation and God bless them‚Ä¶but if you don‚Äôt have the goods, you don‚Äôt have the goods.‚Äù Brutal!    HollywoodLifers, do you think it would be a good career move for Selena to join American Idol? Or would be it be a big step down?"

In the wake of the deluge of sexual misconduct accusations involving Harvey Weinstein and Ben Affleck, two men who Damon has worked closely with, the Downsizing actor spoke to Peter Travers on ABC on Thursday about the cloud of allegations hovering over Hollywood. He pointed out that the men being accused are being put into ‚Äúone big bucket‚Äù and then said that there is a ‚Äúspectrum of behavior.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou know, there‚Äôs a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?‚Äù he said in the interview. ‚ÄúBoth of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn‚Äôt be conflated, right?‚Äù  When Driver received word of his comments, she took to Twitter saying, ‚ÄúGod God, SERIOUSLY?‚Äù From there, she did not hold back and continued to drag Damon and other men who share the same opinions.  ‚ÄúGosh it‚Äôs so interesting how men with all these opinions about women‚Äôs differentiation between sexual misconduct, assault and rape reveal themselves to be utterly tone deaf and as a result, systemically part of the problem (profoundly unsurprising),‚Äù she tweeted.

In an interview with the Guardian, Driver said that she felt the need to say something and that men ‚Äúcannot understand what abuse is like on a daily level.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI honestly think that until we get on the same page, you can‚Äôt tell a woman about their abuse,‚Äù continued Driver. ‚ÄúA man cannot do that. No one can. It is so individual and so personal, it‚Äôs galling when a powerful man steps up and starts dictating the terms, whether he intends it or not.‚Äù  Other women in Hollywood came forward to criticize Damon‚Äôs clouded point of view including Alyssa Milano. In a series of tweets, Milano addressed Damon in a series of tweets saying that women are outraged ‚Äúbecause we were silenced for so long.‚Äù She went on to compare sexual harassment, misconduct, assault, and violence to cancer saying that it is a ‚Äúsystemic disease.‚Äù She concluded, ‚ÄúThe tumor is being cut out right now with no anesthesia. Please send flowers.‚Äù  Dear Matt Damon, It‚Äôs the micro that makes the macro. (Thread) ‚Äî Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  We are in a ‚Äúculture of outrage‚Äù because the magnitude of rage is, in fact, overtly outrageous. And it is righteous. ‚Äî Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) December 16, 2017  I have been a victim of each component of the sexual assault spectrum of which you speak. They all hurt.

"The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)  This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.  Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.  Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""  According to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit ""Hollaback Girl"" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.  And, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time ‚Äî it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. ""I don't have any plans to come back,"" she told the outlet. ""I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.""  The new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine. And, Hudson not only was a contestant on American Idol, she also was a Voice coach on the UK version of The Voice UK Season 6. So, she has plenty of experience to take Stefani's spot.  The Voice has remained a strong competition show because of its ability to mix things up. Hopefully, the shake-ups continue in the future and put Stefani back in a chair ‚Äî because going too long without her would be bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s."

"For other people of this name, see Henry Hall (disambiguation)  Henry Robert Hall, CBE (2 May 1898 ‚Äì 28 October 1989) was an English bandleader who performed regularly on BBC Radio during the British dance band era of the 1920s and 1930s, through to the 1960s.  Early life and career [ edit ]  Henry Hall was born in Peckham, South London. He won a scholarship to Trinity College of Music where he studied trumpet, piano, harmony and counterpoint.  His first job was as copyist at the head office of the Salvation Army for which he wrote several marches. During World War I, Hall served with the Royal Field Artillery and played trumpet and piano in the regimental band.  Hall's musical career was slow to start but eventually he was engaged by the London Midland and Scottish Railway to take charge of music throughout their then large chain of hotels, including Gleneagles Hotel, where he had previously led the band.  Hall describes in his autobiography, Here's to the Next Time, that on a Thursday in October 1923 he met a young woman named Margery while traveling by rail to Dartmoor. Hall mentions that he and Margery were about the same age and had much in common after discussing the C.B. Cochran production of the musical, ""Little Nellie Kelly"" and Paul Whiteman's take on ""Till My Luck comes Rolling Along"", a tune from the play. The following day, Henry invited Margery to a dance and proposed to her at the end of the evening. By Saturday, just two days after meeting, the two were engaged and were married in January 1924, at St. George's, Hanover Square, London.[1] Henry and Margery had two children during their marriage, Mike and Betty.  In June 1924, on the opening night of the Gleneagles Hotel, Hall persuaded the BBC to broadcast the event on radio, which began his long association with BBC radio.  The 1930s: broadcasting star [ edit ]  It was from Gleneagles that the BBC took him in 1932 to succeed Jack Payne as band leader of the BBC Dance Orchestra.[2] At 5.15pm each weekday, Hall's radio programme from Broadcasting House gathered a huge following across the nation.[3] His signature tune was ""It's Just the Time for Dancing"", and he usually concluded with ""Here's to the Next Time"".  In 1932 he recorded the songs ""Here Comes the Bogeyman"" and ""Teddy Bears' Picnic"" with his BBC Orchestra, featuring singer Val Rosing on vocals. The latter song gained enormous popularity and sold over a million copies. In 1934 his popularity was confirmed when his orchestra topped the bill at the London Palladium.  He featured in the documentary BBC The Voice of Britain (1935), the source of the ""This is Henry Hall speaking"" clip much used in documentaries on this period.  In 1936 Henry Hall made his first feature film and in the same year he was guest conductor of the ship's orchestra on the Queen Mary‚Äôs maiden voyage.  In 1937 the BBC Dance Orchestra played at the opening of the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn. The same year Hall left the BBC to tour with his own band, which comprised many members of his BBC band. He toured the halls of Britain and Europe, and generated controversy by dropping songs by Jewish composers while playing in Berlin in February 1938.[4]  Hall's band was the first to appear on television.[citation needed]  Later years [ edit ]  During the Second World War, Hall played for the troops, and gave concerts and shows in factories all over Britain. Many of these concerts came in the form of ""Guest Night"" broadcasts. From June to November, 1943, ""Guest Night"" was replaced by ""Henry Hall's Rhythm Entertainment"" intended to provide radio entertainment for troops overseas.  After the war he developed his show business interests, becoming something of an agent and producer. His BBC work again blossomed as he hosted Henry Hall's Guest Night on the radio and later on television. Hall was also involved in the launch of the television programme Face the Music.[citation needed]  Hall had a son, Michael, who served in the Royal Navy, and a daughter, Betty.  In 1955, Hall published his autobiography Here's to the Next Time. He dedicated it to his wife, Margery.  He ceased regular broadcasting in 1964 and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, CBE, in 1970. He died in Eastbourne, Sussex, in October 1989.  A green memorial plaque on the site of his former home at 8 Randolph Mews, Little Venice, was unveiled on 2 May 1996.[5] A blue plaque commemorates Hall at 38 Harman Drive in Cricklewood, London, where he lived between 1932 and 1959.[6]  Popular culture [ edit ]  Hall unknowingly lent his name to a work shift at Frickley Colliery in South Yorkshire. Miners at the colliery who worked the unpopular night shift referred to the shift as Henry Hall's shift or simply Henry's. This was due to the fact that the shift began at 6pm, the same time as Hall started his show on the radio. When he died, the local football club Frickley Athletic, who had close ties with the colliery, marked the occasion in their matchday programme with a page, dedicated to Hall, entitled ""No More Henry's"".[citation needed]"
"A new trailer for Ridley Scott‚Äôs All the Money in the World has offered up a first glimpse of Christopher Plummer as billionaire John Paul Getty, following the replacement of Kevin Spacey in the role.  Scott made the decision earlier this month to remove Spacey from the crime drama and replace him with Plummer, after Spacey was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct. Despite principal photography for the film having concluded in August, scenes featuring Spacey were reshot at short notice, in order for it to be completed in time for its scheduled US release date of 22 December. The reshoots are said to have cost around $10m, a significant addition to the film‚Äôs original $40m budget.  All the Money in the World tells the true story of the kidnapping of Getty‚Äôs grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973, and the billionaire‚Äôs refusal to pay the ransom. The film stars Michelle Williams as Getty III‚Äôs mother Gail Harris and Mark Wahlberg as Fletcher Chase, the former CIA operative who tried to persuade Getty Sr to co-operate with the kidnappers‚Äô demands. Both Wahlberg and Williams are thought to have been involved in the reshoots.  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scott said that he made the decision to remove Spacey as soon as he first heard the allegations made against the actor. ‚ÄúI sat and thought about it and realised, we cannot. You can‚Äôt tolerate any kind of behaviour like that,‚Äù the director said. ‚ÄúAnd it will affect the film. We cannot let one person‚Äôs action affect the good work of all these other people. It‚Äôs that simple.‚Äù  Police in London are believed to be investigating two claims of sexual assault made against Spacey, who has been accused of misconduct by a number of men. Earlier this week, the Old Vic theatre, which employed Spacey as its artistic director between the years 2004 and 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people about Spacey, and received 20 allegations of inappropriate conduct. The theatre apologised ‚Äúwholeheartedly‚Äù for failing to create an environment in which people could raise concerns about Spacey‚Äôs behaviour. A statement released by Spacey‚Äôs former spokeswoman said he was ‚Äútaking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment‚Äù.  All the Money in the World is not the only production to have cut ties with Spacey. Last month, Netflix said that it would not release a film in which the actor played Gore Vidal, and had also dropped him from the sixth and final season of its popular drama House of Cards.  All the Money in the World is scheduled for release in the UK on 5 January 2018."
"'This is McCarthyism!': Trump accuses Obama of 'wire-tapping' his office before election  Donald Trump has accused Barack Obama of ‚Äúwire tapping‚Äù his offices in New York City before the presidential election in November, claiming the former president had overseen a ‚ÄúNixon/Watergate‚Äù-style intervention.  Launching a series of tweets at 5.35am eastern time on Saturday, the US president said: ‚ÄúTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‚Äòwires tapped‚Äô in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!‚Äù  How Trump lambasted Obama ‚Äì and Obama trashed Trump Read more  He followed up that initial tweet with a string of others in the following 30 minutes which claimed Obama had defied a court‚Äôs rejection of a request to tap his office, and invited a ‚Äúgood lawyer‚Äù to make a case against the alleged operation.    Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Is it legal for a sitting President to be ""wire tapping"" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!  The president then compared the alleged surveillance of his communications to Watergate ‚Äì the scandal in the early 1970s that brought down Republican president Richard Nixon after he ordered a break-in of the Democrat party‚Äôs Washington headquarters.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!  Trump also made efforts to defend Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, who is facing questions over his meeting with the Russian ambassador to Washington during the 2016 presidential election campaign.  He tweeted: ‚ÄúThe first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs...‚Äù .  He added: ‚ÄúJust out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.‚Äù  There was no additional information provided to substantiate the president‚Äôs claims that Obama had ‚Äúwire tapped‚Äù Trump Tower, and it was not clear on what information Trump was basing the allegations.  There has been no response to the tweets from Obama.  The Trump administration has been on the back foot over its contacts with Russian officials before the president took office in January.  Last month Michael Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser over conversations with the Russian ambassador to Washington and misleading statements about them to the press and the vice-president, Mike Pence.  This week it was revealed that Sessions had two meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, last year twhich he failed to disclose to senators during his confirmation hearing.  Sessions said on Friday that he would recuse himself from investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election despite backing from Trump, who described the controversy as ‚Äúa total witch hunt‚Äù.  Trump‚Äôs tweets follow claims made by the conservative radio host Mark Levin on his Thursday night show about the alleged steps taken by the Obama administration to undermine the Republican candidate‚Äôs campaign to win the White House.    Donald Trump accuses Obama of orchestrating protests against him Read more  The presenter called the effort a ‚Äúsilent coup‚Äù by the Obama administration and called for a congressional investigation into the issue. That contrasts with demands from across the US political spectrum to examine Russian interference in the presidential election.  Levin‚Äôs comments were followed up by Breitbart News, the ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù website formerly run by Steve Bannon, who ran the Trump campaign and is now the president‚Äôs chief strategist.    The article stated: ‚ÄúThe Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorisation to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the NSA [National Security Agency] rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media.‚Äù    The Breitbart story references recent claims that the FBI had asked the foreign intelligence surveillance court for a warrant last year to monitor members of the Trump team suspected of being in contact with Russian officials. The request for the warrant was initially rejected before being granted in October, the reports have said.  Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, said: ‚ÄúI am very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally. I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about the Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. It‚Äôs my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this ‚Äì I promise you I will.‚Äù  The Democratic congressman Seth Moulton, a member of the House armed services and budget committees, told the MSNBC channel: ‚ÄúThis is right out of Donald Trump‚Äôs reality TV playbook. He‚Äôs trying to distract attention from the real story here, which is his campaign, his administration‚Äôs contact with Russian officials ... There‚Äôs clearly a deeper story here and we the American people need to know how high this conspiracy goes.‚Äù  Moulton added: ‚ÄúObviously contacts with Russian intelligence officials are monitored ‚Äì that‚Äôs part of maintaining our national security. So if under the Obama administration they were simply monitoring contacts with Russian officials ‚Äì not trying to wiretap into the Trump campaign but simply looking at who Russian officials were talking with ‚Äì and then Trump campaign officials got ensnared in that net, then it‚Äôs a total mischaracterisation to say President Obama was wiretapping Trump.‚Äù  Rep Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who is a member of the House intelligence committee, told Fox News that Trump ‚Äúis not credible when it comes to talking about Russia‚Äù.  Swalwell downplayed Trump‚Äôs allegations. ‚ÄúI think this is just the president up early doing his routine tweeting, he said. ‚ÄúPresidents don‚Äôt wiretap anyone. These are pursued by the Department of Justice in accordance with the FBI and signed off by a judge.‚Äù"

"/ Updated By Foluk√© Tuakli  It was the same-sex kiss heard 'round the world ‚Äî or at least around television and social media.  In a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit over the weekend, ""Wonder Woman"" star Gal Gadot joined openly gay ""SNL"" cast member Kate McKinnon in a parody of the hit franchise ‚Äî and a play on the rampant speculation that the film's title character is less-than-heterosexual.  McKinnon and fellow ""SNL"" cast member Aidy Bryant play two self-identified lesbians, Megan and Dre, who are lost at sea and dock their boat on the fictional island nation of Themyscira. The island, home to Wonder Woman, is inhabited solely by women.  ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôll cut to the chase,"" McKinnon's character says. ""Show of hands: Who all here is a lez?""  When none of the island's inhabitants raise their hands, McKinnon's character shares the frustration of many of the film's fans, exclaiming, ""The whole thing seemed so super gay.""  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like we‚Äôre in a porn, but the plumber is genuinely there to fix the pipes,"" Bryant's character says as the island's inhabitants brush each other's hair and play wrestle.  Gadot's character offers to comfort the disappointed duo by conducting an experiment to test her heterosexuality ‚Äî or lack thereof ‚Äî with a kiss.  As of Monday afternoon, the YouTube video showing the steamy 14-second kiss between Gadot and McKinnon had more than 2.7 million views. And social media was ablaze with reaction to the skit.  Speculation has long swirled regarding the sexuality of Wonder Woman ‚Äî also known as Diana Prince‚Äî and in 2016, the current writer of the ""Wonder Woman"" comic book series, Greg Rucka, confirmed that she is in fact ""queer.""

"Aisha Tyler‚Äòs divorce from Jeffrey Tietjens has been finalized, PEOPLE confirms.

"The rekindled romance between Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber has been put on pause, multiple sources exclusively tell Us Weekly.  ‚ÄúSelena and Justin decided to take a break mainly because of Selena‚Äôs mom and her disapproval of Justin. Justin‚Äôs family loves Selena, but Selena‚Äôs family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don‚Äôt trust Justin,‚Äù an insider tells Us Weekly exclusively. ‚ÄúSelena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed ‚Ä¶ but her family just isn‚Äôt budging right now.‚Äù  The relationship between the ‚ÄúWolves‚Äù singer, 25, and her mother, Mandy Teefy, became rocky when Gomez started seeing Bieber again after undergoing a kidney transplant and recuperating from complications last summer. (She split from The Weeknd in October 2017 after 10 months of dating.) Though the ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù singer, 24, and the 13 Reasons Why executive producer went public with their reunion shortly after, Gomez chose not to bring Bieber along to celebrate Thanksgiving with her family. A source told Us Weekly at the time that Gomez didn‚Äôt think her mom in particular ‚Äúwould approve.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHer relationship with Justin has really affected her relationship with her mom, and it‚Äôs been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications,‚Äù the insider also adds to Us. ‚ÄúJustin and Selena decided to take a break to give her family some more time to heal and take in the idea of her and Justin being a couple again.‚Äù  Another source tells Us that another contributing factor to the on-off couple is that Bieber ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt care about anyone but himself.‚Äù Adds the source: ‚ÄúThe second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn‚Äôt need him.‚Äù  The pair, who have dated off and on since they were first linked in 2011, were last seen leaving church separately on March 8 after vacationing in Jamaica.

"Rapper Rick Ross went on Power 105.1‚Äôs The Breakfast Club show recently and was asked why he has never signed a female rapper to his label Maybach Music Group. His excuse? It would just be too easy to have sex with them.  He said:  You know, I never did it because I always thought, like, I would end up fucking a female rapper and fucking the business up... I‚Äôm so focused on my business. I just, I gotta be honest with you. You know, she looking good. I‚Äôm spending so much money on her photo shoots. I gotta fuck a couple times.  Advertisement  It is unfortunately not surprising that a label exec like Ross would expect sex from the artists he signs (or, in this case, doesn‚Äôt sign), especially now when the longstanding misogyny of powerful men in music is becoming more transparent in cases like Dr. Luke, R. Kelly or LA Reid. But Ross‚Äôs comments about spending so much money on photo shoots for female artists are particularly interesting.  The number of female rappers signed to major labels has been steadily dropping since the 1980s. When NPR interviewed MC Lyte‚Äîthe first woman with a solo rap record on a major label‚Äîabout this topic in 2014, one of the reasons she offered for the decline was the fact that signing women is risky because of the costs that add up concerning their looks: hair, makeup, photo-shoots.  And this has long been the excuse. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why labels only release a new female MC every few years,‚Äù former Vibe editor-in-chief Mimi Valdes said in 2007. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just too damn expensive!‚Äù  Advertisement  ‚ÄúWomen are viewed differently because we cost more money, number one,‚Äù Nicki Minaj‚Äôs former manager Debra Antney told Vice in 2014. ‚ÄúA guy could look like Cyclopes‚Äô twin and get up there and make it. He just throws on a T-shirt and some jeans and he‚Äôs fly. For us, it‚Äôs the whole glam squad‚Äîthe hair, the makeup‚Äîall these things that you have to have.‚Äù  The whole thing just seems like a snake eating its own tail: you have to be professionally gorgeous to be a successful rapper, but then your gorgeousness apparently makes your male bosses want to have sex with you, and then that‚Äôs bad for your career. Seems like a good way around this would be to see women rappers as actual artists with agency?"
"Selena Gomez reportedly walked out on Justin Bieber during their date night in Seattle.  A source told E! News that Gomez disliked the fact that Bieber‚Äôs dancing drew too much attention. Immediately after Gomez walked out of the venue, Bieber followed her, and they both returned to Los Angeles together.  The couple rode a private jet over the weekend to enjoy some quality time together. Another source told the same publication that the two are doing great ever since they started seeing each other again in October.  ‚ÄúSelena and Justin are doing great. Justin is very affectionate to Selena. He wears his heart on his sleeve lately especially when it comes to her. They are still learning about each other as grown adults,‚Äù the source said.  The same source claimed that Bieber and Gomez will be spending New Year‚Äôs Eve together since they won‚Äôt be able to celebrate Christmas together. However, nothing has been finalized as of late.  Another source told People last week that Gomez‚Äôs family doesn‚Äôt like Bieber for the ‚ÄúWolves‚Äù singer that‚Äôs why she never invites him to attend their gatherings.  ‚ÄúJustin‚Äôs family always loved Selena, but Selena‚Äôs family is still not happy about her seeing Justin. Selena doesn‚Äôt bring Justin to any family events. Selena is spending Christmas with her family. As of now, Justin is not invited,‚Äù the source said.  Gomez and Bieber dated on and off from 2010 to 2015. The two rekindled their romance after she underwent kidney transplant. Following her split from The Weeknd, Bieber and Gomez started hanging out more frequently. Last month, they were also photographed kissing each other on the lips.  While speaking with Billboard, Gomez also said that she‚Äôs more mature now to know who is good for her.  ‚ÄúI cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn‚Äôt right. But that doesn‚Äôt mean caring for someone ever goes away. And that goes for people in general,‚Äù she said."

"Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage ‚Äî and seven years as a couple.  ‚ÄúIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,‚Äù says a statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. ‚ÄúThis decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  ‚ÄúNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else‚Äôs fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. ‚Äù  The couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.

"For Khlo√© Kardashian‚Äôs 34th birthday, Kim Kardashian mended her relationship with Tristan Thompson. Kim begged the Cleveland Cavaliers player to unblock her on Instagram while attending Khlo√©‚Äôs party on Wednesday, June 27.  ‚ÄúAll right, guys. So, what do you think? It‚Äôs Khlo√©‚Äôs birthday. Do you think I should ask this guy to unblock me?‚Äù the KKW Beauty founder, 37, said in a series of hilarious videos shared on her Instagram Story while sitting next to Thompson, 27, who blocked her on the social media app after she spoke out about his cheating scandal.  ‚ÄúFor Khlo√©‚Äôs birthday, I think it‚Äôs only right. I got you,‚Äù the athlete replied with a laugh. The birthday girl then implored her boyfriend of nearly two years to ‚Äúdo it right now.‚Äù  When Thompson pulled out his iPhone, Kim jokingly asked for his passcode. ‚Äú[Khlo√©] knows it,‚Äù he responded before opening Instagram and going to Kim‚Äôs profile. The Selfish author zoomed in on the NBA star as he counted down and then tapped the ‚ÄúUnblock‚Äù button. He quipped, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no going back now,‚Äù to which Kim replied, ‚ÄúNow the question is, should I follow you again?‚Äù  The social media mogul was shocked to find out that Thompson also blocked Khlo√©‚Äôs best friends Malika and Khadijah Haqq. ‚ÄúWait, you guys! Did you know he blocked you also?‚Äù she asked the 35-year-old twins, who were sitting nearby. As all of the guests collectively freaked out, Kim demanded silence and shouted, ‚ÄúThis is a birthday party!‚Äù  As previously reported, Thompson blocked Kim in late April after she said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that it was ‚Äúso f‚Äìked up‚Äù that he cheated on Khlo√© while she was pregnant with the couple‚Äôs daughter, True. ‚ÄúLast time I went on TV and answered some questions about [Khlo√©], I got blocked on social media.

"An object example of how a film can be entertaining and even exhilarating without being particularly good, ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù has the driving energy of a stadium anthem and the fizzy meaninglessness of a bubblegum pop song.  As a biopic of flamboyantly theatrical gay frontman Freddie Mercury, the movie frequently falls short, but it does provide interesting origin stories for many of the hits created by Mercury‚Äôs band Queen. Wisely, the movie wraps everything up with a rousing recreation of Queen stealing the show at 1985‚Äôs Live Aid, providing the equivalent of a band making you forget a mediocre set by performing a dazzling encore. The end of ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù marks the first (and no doubt last) time that I was brought to tears by ‚ÄúRadio Gaga.‚Äù  Very much an ‚Äúauthorized‚Äù biopic ‚Äî band members Brian May and Roger Taylor are credited as ‚ÄúExecutive Music Producers‚Äù ‚Äî the film is a rather rote road-to-stardom tale: In 1970, a Heathrow baggage handler named Freddie Bulsara (Rami Malek) meets dental student Roger (Ben Hardy, ‚ÄúOnly the Brave‚Äù) and astrophysics student Brian (Gwilym Lee, ‚ÄúMidsomer Murders‚Äù) and informs them that they need to make him their lead singer. Add bassist John Deacon (Joseph Mazzello, ‚ÄúG.I. Joe: Retaliation), and Queen is born.  Watch Video: 'Bohemian Rhapsody': Rami Malek Is the Champion of the World in Trailer for Freddie Mercury Biopic  The group quickly gets label attention, due mainly to the vocal chops and stage presence of their lead singer, who has redubbed himself ‚ÄúFreddie Mercury,‚Äù much to the chagrin of his Parsi parents. Queen battles with EMI over the ‚ÄúA Night at the Opera‚Äù album, particularly over ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody,‚Äù which gives the eponymous film one of its most rapturous segments, as the band pieces together this complicated, elaborate, genre-defying pop single. (The casting of Mike Myers as BMI exec Ray Foster is amusing, given the connection between the song and ‚ÄúWayne‚Äôs World,‚Äù but the movie overplays its hand by having Foster say that kids in cars will never bang their heads to the song.)  In his personal life, we see Freddie fall for Mary Austin (Lucy Boynton, ‚ÄúSing Street‚Äù), to whom he would propose, compose love songs for, and repeatedly refer to as the love of his life. But when Queen goes on the road, Freddie enjoys a series of quick and anonymous liaisons with men. Upon his return, she confronts him about the cracks in their marriage; ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm bisexual,‚Äù he finally confesses, which Mary shuts down with a firm: ‚ÄúFreddie. You‚Äôre gay.‚Äù  Also Read: Bryan Singer Preemptively Denies Accusations About Him in Upcoming Esquire Article  There was concern in some quarters that the film would tamp down Mercury‚Äôs homosexuality, and to its credit, it‚Äôs right there on screen from the get-go. (Moments before he catches Mary‚Äôs eye for the first time, he cruises a handsome young man.) And for a movie that literally opens with an HIV-positive Mercury coughing ‚Äî letting us know early that subtlety will not be on the menu ‚Äî the film does handle its protagonist‚Äôs issues with AIDS-related complication respectfully, if fleetingly.  It‚Äôs worth noting, however, that ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù also goes out of its way to create a hissable gay villain: manager Paul Prenter (Allen Leech, ‚ÄúDownton Abbey‚Äù), presented here as an old-school Devious Queen, all but twirls his ‚Äô70s-clone mustache as he drives a wedge between Freddie and the band, leading to an unsuccessful solo career and a schism that will have to be healed in time for Live Aid, even though most biographical accounts of Queen seem to suggest that this parting and reuniting is pure fiction. (Mercury‚Äôs first solo album under his own name didn‚Äôt come out until 1985, the year that Live Aid took place.)  The film offers interesting glimpses into how hits like ‚ÄúWe Will Rock You‚Äù and ‚ÄúAnother One Bites the Dust‚Äù came to be, while leaving out other moments that fans might want to see, from triumphs (‚ÄúFlash Gordon,‚Äù recording ‚ÄúUnder Pressure‚Äù with David Bowie, opera-lover Mercury‚Äôs duet with legendary diva Monserrat Caball√©) to debacles (‚ÄúBody Language‚Äù). Screenwriter Anthony McCarten is no stranger to biopic contrivance (he previously wrote ‚ÄúDarkest Hour‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Theory of Everything‚Äù), but he outdoes himself in the third act of ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody,‚Äù in which disparate emotional arcs in Freddie‚Äôs life are all resolved en route to Wembley for Live Aid. Here‚Äôs hoping that chauffeur got a hefty tip for all that dramatic reconciliation.  Also Read: 'Venom,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' Among Most Anticipated Fall Movies, Fandango Survey Finds  But admittedly, that Live Aid sequence so thrillingly captures what is considered both a high point in live rock performance and a historical moment in Queen‚Äôs career that it justifies making and seeing the movie. Malek doesn‚Äôt always nail the off-stage Mercury ‚Äî he struggles with the dental prosthetic he‚Äôs been given to match the singer‚Äôs legendary overbite, as though it had been thrust into his mouth for the first time seconds before cameras were rolling ‚Äî but with a microphone in his hand and lip-synching to Mercury‚Äôs vocals, Malek captures the electricity of a rock god at the height of his powers. It‚Äôs a moment where everything the movie has to offer and everyone who worked on it ‚Äî particularly cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel (‚ÄúDrive‚Äù) and editor John Ottman (‚ÄúX-Men: Days of Future Past‚Äù) ‚Äî are firing on all cylinders.  As an inducement to dig into the Queen back catalog, ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù is an unqualified success. But when it tries to be a genuine biopic of a groundbreaking band and its singular lead singer, it‚Äôs more like a little silhouette-o of a man.  Ôªø"

"Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian. Reuters  Being married to 23-time Grand Slam tennis champion Serena Williams is like a ""front row seat to greatness,"" according to her husband Alexis Ohanian.  Ohanian, an internet entrepreneur, said in an interview with Fox Business that he always presumed ""tech was the hardest working industry.""  But, after speaking with Williams, Ohanian quickly changed his mind.  ""I really thought I was like the hardest working person I knew,"" he said. ""I thought tech was the hardest working industry. Our businesses are open 24/7 and, of course, we're always working and grinding. But then I started talking to her and then realised, very quickly, just how wrong I was.""  Ohanian co-founded the news website Reddit in 2005 and became a multi-millionaire aged 23 when he sold it 16 months later. He met Williams at a cafe in Italy in 2015 and improved the tennis ace's website with a superior ""tech strategy"" while also helping secure ""deal flows with sponsorships and investments.""  The pair got married in 2017 and Ohanian said Williams has inspired him in business.  ""It's a front row seat to greatness and that is what I'm working towards in my own career,"" he said.

Ohanian co-founded Initialized Capital in 2010, is an Open Internet activist (an advocate for net neutrality), and is widely regarded as ""one of the most creative people in business."""

"When you collect together Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum, Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Mark Mothersbaugh, and director Taika Waititi, there‚Äôs no way you can make a bad movie. And judging by a new behind the scenes video released by Marvel, Thor: Ragnarok looks every bit as good as we expected.  ‚ÄúRagnarok is a new cycle; new realms, new universe,‚Äù explains Waititi. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the destruction of the old and the rebirth of the new, and that‚Äôs really exciting to me. The way that I‚Äôve approached this is to rebuild it in a new way.‚Äù  As we‚Äôve seen from the posters and trailers, the tone of Thor: Ragnarok is completely different from the first two Thor movies, which were dark and brooding. It was a conscious choice by the cast and crew, one that mixes action and humor‚Äîsort of using the Guardians of the Galaxy approach.  If you‚Äôve ever seen Waititi‚Äôs other work‚ÄîI highly recommend Hunt for the Wilderpeople‚Äîthe director seems like the perfect person to usher in this new version of Thor. If you want a taste of Waititi‚Äôs brand of humor, look no further than the ‚ÄúTeam Thor‚Äù shorts he made about what Thor was up to during the events of Captain America: Civil War.  ‚ÄúWhat are the odds we survive this trip,‚Äù Thor asks Bruce Banner.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say the odds are a million to fun,‚Äù Banner retorts.

A Pregnancy Scare  In May 2016, just five months after Saint was born, Kardashian West bought three pregnancy tests and took one in a cramped airplane bathroom during a flight, taking to Snapchat to share the experience with her fans.  Kim Kardashian/Snapchat  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm legit in the airplane bathroom taking a pregnancy test because I‚Äôm having a little bit of a scare,‚Äù she said in one video.  After her frantic message, the star snapped a pic of the clear ‚Äúnot pregnant‚Äù result.  Kim Kardashian/Snapchat  The next day, Kardashian West took to Snapchat yet again, this time to explain her decision to document the experience.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs discuss,‚Äù she started. ‚ÄúSome people were asking me why I would Snapchat the pregnancy test on the airplane. And I just thought it was funny, because I‚Äôve been so private before ‚Äî and what do I really care if I was pregnant again?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get my period this month, so I was just really confused,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAnd I couldn‚Äôt stand to be on a flight for 10 hours not knowing.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Is Trying for a Third Baby ‚Äî But Doctors Warn It‚Äôs Not Safe  Exploring Other Options  A few months later, in a November 2016 episode of KUWTK, Kardashian West broached the possibility of having someone else carry her third child.  Kardashian West then met with two fertility specialists, including Dr. Wong, who was on board with the option considering the medical risks of a third pregnancy for the star.  ‚ÄúUsing a surrogate is not an unreasonable option,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf our goal is to grow your family like you want to, then a surrogate makes sense.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIf the two doctors that I trust have told me it wouldn‚Äôt be safe for me to get pregnant again, I have to listen to that,‚Äù said Kardashian West. ‚ÄúBut because I don‚Äôt know anyone that has been a surrogate or used one, I didn‚Äôt really think about that as an option for me.‚Äù  Kim Kardashian West/Instagram  At sister Kourtney Kardashian‚Äòs suggestion, Kardashian west met with a woman named Natalie who had both carried a pregnancy herself and used a surrogate.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more worried because I gave birth to two [children] ‚Äî there‚Äôs a sense in me that because I went through all that pain for these two babies and that I know we did this together ‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no one that would feel your love [like that],‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey are literally near your heart and inside of you.‚Äù  ‚ÄúMy bond with my kids is so strong,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI think my biggest fear if I had a surrogate is: Would I love them the same? That‚Äôs the main thing I keep thinking about.‚Äù  Natalie reassured the star that the bond is just as strong, and Kardashian West sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the news.  ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I can‚Äôt carry another one,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want to explore surrogacy.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThat scares me for you,‚Äù said Jenner. ‚ÄúWhat if she gives birth and then grabs the baby and makes a run for it?‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she can,‚Äù said Kardashian West. ‚ÄúAlso, the best thing is I could have a new baby and have no one know and live my life for a good year before we announce it.‚Äù  FROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Reveals the Emotional Way She Told Her Daughters She Was Pregnant  Baby Fever Hits Hard  In an April episode of the most recent season of KUWTK, the reality star revealed that she and West, 40, are trying to conceive again despite their challenging pregnancies.  ‚ÄúI want my kids to have siblings, but the doctors don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs safe for me,‚Äù she said, telling sister Kourtney and Khlo√© Kardashian that she‚Äôs ‚Äúgoing to try to have one more baby.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love nothing more than to expand my family and just know that I have this world at home that‚Äôs safe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd if for some reason I left this earth sooner than I really wanted to, then my kids would have a support system at home ‚Äî so that I know that they would be okay if I wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù  ‚ÄúKanye and I have always talked about having more kids,‚Äù she admitted. ‚ÄúBut after what I went through in Paris, the urgency is even greater.‚Äù  At the time, Kardashian West and her husband had been working hard on their relationship, having finally settled into a good place after enduring a period of marital strain sparked by her Paris robbery last October, followed swiftly by the rapper‚Äôs hospitalized for exhaustion in November.  ‚ÄúEveryone knows she had major medical complications during her other two pregnancies,‚Äù a source told PEOPLE. ‚ÄúBut whenever things are going great with Kanye, Kim talks about having another baby.‚Äù (The insider also acknowledged that a third baby would be ‚Äúa great storyline for the show.‚Äù)  Source: Kim Kardashian Instagram  Getting Serious About Surrogacy  In the same April KUWTK episode, Kardashian West underwent a procedure in an attempt to help her become able to carry another child ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt successful.  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt carry anymore kids ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the worst,‚Äù she confessed. ‚ÄúI give up.‚Äù  As a result, the star decided it was time to revisit the option of hiring a surrogate.  ‚ÄúKanye was really nervous about the surgery ‚Ä¶ but I know he would want to have more kids,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI feel like surrogacy is the only option for me. Kanye and I are going to look into other options and see what we are comfortable with ‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm definitely leaning towards [surrogacy].‚Äù  ‚ÄúI always knew surrogacy was an option ‚Äî now it‚Äôs my reality,‚Äù she eventually concluded. ‚ÄúWhatever is meant to be will be.‚Äù  A Plan in Motion  In June 2017, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that the stars had hired a surrogate. TMZ was the first to report the news.  It‚Äôs a Girl!  The soon-to-be mother of three told host Ellen DeGeneres that her 4-year-old daughter North had taken to calling the unborn child, ‚ÄúBaby Sister‚Äù during an October 2017 appearance on the talk show. ‚ÄúMy daughter thinks she‚Äôs tricky,‚Äù Kardashian West said. ‚ÄúWe had a baby shower over the weekend, and I thought, ‚ÄòYou know, I really do want to have a baby shower because I want [North] to feel that something‚Äôs coming and for her to really understand it.‚Äô ‚Äù  A New Experience  While she was excited to share the news with the rest of the Kardashian crew, Kardashian West admitted the situation felt different than when she was pregnant the first two times. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kind of weird when it‚Äôs not you, so I don‚Äôt know whether I should start eating donuts and celebrate like I would like old times or just go to the gym,‚Äù Kardashian West told sister Kourtney on a December 2017 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm totally gonna forget and then a month before I‚Äôm gonna be like holly sh‚Äî, we need to get a nursery.‚Äù  She‚Äôs Here!  The couple‚Äôs second daughter has arrived via surrogate, Kardashian West shared via her website on January 16, 2018. The baby girl was born Jan. 15, at 12:47 a.m., weighing 7 lbs., 6 oz. ‚ÄúKanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,‚Äù she wrote in a post titled ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs Here!‚Äô.  ‚ÄúWe are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.‚Äù"

"He's used to fans falling over themselves at his every word.  But Justin Bieber came unstuck on Sunday at the BST Hyde Park concert with a shaky performance which left a packed crowd baffled.  During his set, the pop singer revealed he had stuck vapour rub up his nose before getting into a funk when a joke he cracked was met with a stony silence - leaving the singer to quip: 'I'm having a bad night don't judge me.'  Scroll down for video  Justin Bieber came unstuck on Sunday at the BST Hyde Park concert with a nightmare performance which left a packed crowd scratching their heads.  And things went from bad to worse when he publicly scolded his backing singers for talking in-between songs, sneering: 'Whatever you're talking about can't be more important than what I'm saying,' leaving his audience stunned.  The problems began early when the Sorry hit-maker pointed out the Merry-go-round near the stage and joked: 'That looks fun... Said no one ever!'  Sadly, the discerning British crowd failed to see the funny side of Bieber's wisecrack leaving him to awkwardly tap his microphone and quip: 'Is this thing on?' before adding: 'Tough crowd!'  In the singer's defense, it appears as if he was nursing a cold.  Bad night at the office: During the botched performance, the pop singer revealed he had vapour rub stuck up his nose before getting into a huff when a joke he cracked was met with a stony silence  Whoops: Bieber told the crowd 'I'm having a bad night, don't judge me'  Explaining to fans that he was bunged up and had to use Vicks Vapour in order to perform.  'I usually use Olbus oil' he told the confused audience. 'But I had to use Vicks here and now and it's stuck up my nose,' he continued.  Finally adding: 'I'm having a bad night, don't judge me.'  Dressed in a red Louis Vuitton X Supreme baseball shirt, the singer donned a pair of loose fittign basketball shorts and Adidas trainers in order to aid his usually upbeat performance.  Previous form: In 2016 he stormed off stage in Manchester when fans refused to storm screaming when he sang  Angry: 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is ‚Ä¶ people try to twist things, some people don't want to listen'  Doubling down: In a later post on Instagram he reiterated his point, writing 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is ‚Ä¶ people try to twist things'  Another look: Justin later made an outfit change as he took to the stage at BST Hyde Park  Professional: Despite his prior performance, Justin continued to be in the zone as he belted out his hit tunes  The Sorry artist has form when it comes to hit and miss gigs.  In 2016 he stormed off stage in Manchester when fans refused to storm screaming when he sang.  Scolding the crowd, he said: 'Just try to show me you love me, in a different way. I get it. The screaming is just so obnoxious. I get it, it's been in our blood and it's been grand, you go to a concert and scream and stuff.  'But if we could just ... scream after the song, enjoy the songs ... the screaming is awesome, it's fine, and then we take a chill pill for a second and we just listen to me speak.  'Because ... I don't feel like I'm being heard sometimes and it's getting a little pressuring. So, if when I'm speaking you guys could not scream at the top of your lungs. Is that cool with you guys?'  In a later post on Instagram he reiterated his point, writing: 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is ‚Ä¶ people try to twist things, some people don't want to listen.  'But I simply feel like, if I didn't use this platform to say how I truly feel, and if I didn't use this platform to be the man that I know I am, and speak from what's in my heart, then I'm doing myself injustice, and I'm not doing anybody in this audience any justice.  'There's going to be times where I say the wrong thing, because I'm human. But I don't pretend to be perfect and I hope to God that, you know, I don't say the right thing all the time because if that was the case then I'd be a robot, and I'm just, I'm not a robot.'  Fashionable: Justin donned a tight white vest top and a funky Supreme printed shirt  Dream team: Justin was joined by a bevy of back-up dancers on stage  Down to earth: He once again got comfortable on the floor  Shielding himself: The glare of the sunset got too much for Justin and he donned a pair of shades  Sitting: He looked very much at ease as he relaxed on the floor  In the moment: Justin was clearly feeling the energy of his back-up dancers as he performed up a storm"

The couple's big day celebration had an impressive guest list, with A-list celebs including the bride's The Theory of Everything co-star Eddie Redmayne, 36, and Tom Hanks, 61.  Finally hitched: Felicity Jones, 34, married her boyfriend of three years Charles Guard, 45, on Saturday in their native England in a secret ceremony (pictured in 2017)  According to The Sun, the bride wore an elegant full-sleeved white gown with sheer fabric above the bust and a frilled neck.  Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony.  Wearing an expression of utter delight, she slicked her wavy dark hair back beneath a classic mesh veil that fell to the floor.  Meanwhile, her groom, 45, cut a dapper figure in a three-piece suit with silver trousers, a black jacket and a pale yellow waistcoat.  A day in the Cotswolds: The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, a spectacular structure near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England  Rounding off the look with a sky blue tie over a white dress shirt, he popped a flower in his lapel for his special day.  The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII‚Äôs six wives.  It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding.  The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago.  Historic: The majestic venue is the only private castle in England to have a queen buried within its grounds, Katherine Parr, the last of Henry VIII‚Äôs six wives  Special day: It closed its grounds early to the public on Saturday to accommodate the wedding  Spellbinding venue: It is being said that Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony  The movie director popped the question in May 2017 after just two years of dating.  He is best known for the 2009 horror film The Uninvited, which he co-directed with his brother, Thomas Guard.  Before the Hollywood actress dated Guard, Felicity, 34, was with a sculptor named Ed Fornieles.  They were together for ten years. and had met while they were both attending the University of Oxford  Wedding details: The newlyweds have mostly managed to keep out of the public eye since they began dating three years ago  Epic guest list: Some of their A-list guests that watched on included the bride's The Theory of Everything co-star Eddie Redmayne, 36, and Tom Hanks, 61  A-list: Eddie Redmayne was one of the guests at the wedding (he and Felicity starred together in The Theory Of Everything)  Friends in high places: Tom Hanks was also a guest at the wedding  Details about the bride's infamous wedding outfit remain under lock and key but it‚Äôs unlikely Jones wore a budget dress, like she did when she first attended the BAFTAs in 2011.  The British beauty admitted that when she was invited to the British Academy Film & Television Awards for the first time shortly after winning a special jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for her work in indie movie Like Crazy, she was totally unprepared for the glamorous event.  Instead of breaking the bank to purchase an expensive couture gown, she sourced her dress from a second-hand store.  She even did her makeup in her brother‚Äôs bathroom before the ceremony.

"Meghan Markle has gone from being portrayed as just another one of Prince Harry‚Äôs girlfriends to the biggest role of her life: Prince Harry‚Äôs soon-to-be wife. In the wake of the engagement announcement, Markle has shown that she can swim with the media sharks by getting tossed into the deep end and handling her new royal role gracefully.  But there are rumors of one obstacle that Meghan and Harry never anticipated, and that is the alleged attitude of his stepmother, Camilla Parker Bowles. Fairy tales famously have an evil stepmother who mistreats her stepchildren, and for Markle and her Prince Charming, Camilla is rumored to be the real-life version of those tales.  Meghan Markle Praised For Rising To Role As Prince Harry‚Äôs Future Wife, But Is Camilla Parker Bowles Out To Stop Her?  Meghan has managed every challenge gracefully since the engagement. Markle has undergone hostage training and behaved perfectly during her initial appearances as Prince Harry‚Äôs now-official future wife during public outings. But Yahoo quoted sources as issuing a warning about Camilla Parker Bowles‚Äô alleged power in obstructing Meghan‚Äôs smooth path to the altar with Prince Harry.  While rumors have swirled for months that Camilla disapproved of Prince Harry‚Äôs choice, it was never quite clear why Parker Bowles didn‚Äôt like Meghan. As the Inquisitr reported, there were even reports that Camilla was conducting a ‚Äúsmear campaign‚Äù against Markle that horrified Harry.  Camilla Parker Bowles‚Äô Rumored Reasons For Disliking Meghan Markle Revealed  Now, however, these insiders are clarifying the reasons. Even though Meghan reportedly is seeking to embrace her new life as a future member of the royal family, Parker Bowles isn‚Äôt exactly making herself open to hugs and kisses, according to the sources. Instead, Camilla is reportedly in a state of fury about the way that Markle is being adored by the public while Parker Bowles is disliked.  In public, Parker Bowles has described herself as ‚Äúabsolutely delighted‚Äù about Prince Harry‚Äôs royal wedding. But behind the palace walls, insiders claim that Camilla is comparing the hostility that she faced in her 2005 wedding to Prince Charles to the warmth and welcome that Meghan is enjoying in planning her nuptials to Harry.  After fighting her way into the royal family, the Duchess of Cornwall sees how easy it is for Meghan Markle.  Camilla Parker Bowles clawed and fought her way to acceptance into the British royal family and can‚Äôt understand how easy it is for one woman to be so warmly welcomed. Granted, this woman isn‚Äôt having an affair with a married future king or is central to placing the monarchy in a scandal. Instead, she‚Äôs an American who has caught the eye of a younger royal. Times have changed and tolerance for the unconventional exists more now than it did when Camilla was having an affair with Charles while he was married to the late Princess Diana."

"Getty  Now, according to a report by In Touch, Brad has won a major victory in the wake of their bitter split.  After months of biding his time, Brad's waiting has finally paid off!  A source close to the actor told In Touch, 'Brad's finally got the kids, and he's overjoyed.  'To Brad's delight, Angelina has decided to let the majority of the children, who have summer camps and a slew of other activities in the works, stay in LA with their father while she's in Britain filming Maleficent 2.'  Brad was reportedly livid when Angelina told him she'd found a home in London to live in with all six children while she filmed the Disney sequel, 'but to keep him from fighting her on it,' a friend tells, 'she promised Brad that he could spend longer periods with their children.'  In Touch's report claims that's what their children want too.  RELATED:  The 54-year-old actor, 'couldn't be happier' according to In Touch, because now he knows he'll have his quality time with all six children.  In Touch's report further reveals Brad's already preparing his LA home.  'He gets such enjoyment out of seeing them cut loose at their amusement park-like former home,' the friend tells the publication. 'So, he's really spruced up the pool area, the skateboard ramp and the bike track.'  Spending time with his kids over the summer could give the actor the leverage he needs to get joint custody once and for all.  'He's been patient long enough,' says the friend. 'Something's got to give. Angelina can't control everything forever.'  Neither Brad or Angelina have responded to In Touch's report."
"Can music fans expect an amazing ""Starboy""/""Swish Swish"" mashup sometime soon? Katy Perry and The Weeknd recently had dinner together, according to multiple sources. But since the two singers are both currently single ‚Äî with Perry's breakup from Orlando Bloom and The Weeknd recently splitting from Selena Gomez ‚Äî could this dinner date be a sign of anything more than a friendship or a possible collaboration going on between the two?  Sources including Glamour UK and Vogue, reported that the two singers had a fashionable dinner date. According to The Sun's report, Perry and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, dined together in West Hollywood and apparently had a great time with each other. They then reportedly went home separately. The Sun's report suggests that the date between the pair was romantic and not just a dinner between friends, but take that with a grain of salt. Not only are there are no details available from the singers themselves, but other publications are reporting that they simply got dinner, no romance involved.  While many sources have reported on this dinner between Perry and The Weeknd, most outlets have yet to report anything regarding a potential relationship between the pair. Sorry to burst the bubble of any Katy Perry and The Weeknd shippers, but it's probably just a rumor that the two are dating ‚Äî at least right now.  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The Weeknd has found himself linked to a couple of different women after his breakup with Gomez, and it's not likely that he's actually dating every single person he'e seen with. On Nov. 11, Us Weekly reported that he was seen holding hands with Yovanna Ventura, who was previously linked to Justin Bieber, who is currently dating his ex-girlfriend (and The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, for that matter) Gomez. According to an Us Weekly source, ""[The Weeknd] was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the whole night.""  There were also reports that The Weeknd was back in contact with his ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid. Although they reportedly haven't gotten back together romantically, People reported on Nov. 17 that ""He is talking to Bella a lot and they've hung out too."" The Weeknd and Hadid apparently ""still love each other"" and are seeing where things go with them, according to E!. It was also reported by Hollywood Life that he sent Hadid flowers before the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show ""with a sweet note"". The abundance of rumors surrounding The Weeknd's love life, show that romance rumors might be quick to catch-on whenever he's seen hanging out with anyone, as in the case with Perry.  Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Romance rumors surrounding the ""Starboy"" singer have been abundant ever since he and fellow singer Gomez were reported to have broken up. According to E!, the two singers dated for 10 months before they called it quits in late October. The split was reportedly amicable and it had nothing to do with Gomez hanging out with her ex. A source said, ""The relationship was basically over before Justin Bieber and Selena hung out."" It wasn't long after those two lovebirds' reunion hit the headlines. But, since it doesn't sound as though there wasn't any bad blood with that breakup, it's likely that The Weeknd is just focusing on doing his own thing.  Does his own thing involve Katy Perry? Probably not in a romantic way. Until the two singers confirm anything about a potential relationship, it's more likely that they are just two friends hanging out and possibly making some fans' pop dreams come true."

"It's officially time to start brainstorming couple names.  Last night, low-key lovers Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx both attended the glamorous Clive Davis Pre-Grammy Awards Gala, and they looked so enamored of each other the whole time. Are things getting serious between these two?  For the Pre-Grammy event, 39-year-old Holmes looked ravishing in a floor-length red gown and dark red lipstick. Foxx kept it sharp in a navy blue tux, and while the two arrived separately, they were seated together and looked incredibly cozy throughout the night, smiling from ear-to-ear all the while.  Image zoom Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for NARAS  According to People, Holmes tried to play it coy at the Gala, leaving the table before Clive Davis announced Foxx's presence. However, Davis pulled no punches, calling out the actress!  ‚ÄúThis lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else,‚Äù Davis said, according to the source. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to sit together what better night then tonight?‚Äù  Holmes and Foxx have been the subject of romance rumors for several years, but they've done a great job keeping their relationship out of the spotlight. However, they've been making more public appearances together lately, and we can't help but swoon over their relationship. They make an amazing couple!"

"Expanding Opportunity ‚Äî #KempForum16Let‚Äôs get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America. Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on fighting poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16.I just wanted to say a few words about why we‚Äôre here today. And one reason why I‚Äôm here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty.So I couldn‚Äôt think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century.We‚Äôve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I don‚Äôt think you can call it anything but a stalemate. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And yet today, if you were raised poor, you‚Äôre just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.I‚Äôm not saying we haven‚Äôt made progress. We have. But today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that lifts people out of poverty ‚Äî that helps them earn a good paycheck so they can support themselves. So, what is the problem?It is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation ‚Äî or not having enough money.We treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, we‚Äôve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in people‚Äôs budgets: health care,child care, energy, education ‚Äî with almost no coordination among them.Here‚Äôs the catch: You qualify for these programs based how much you make. So if you don‚Äôt make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits.And because we‚Äôve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and you‚Äôll lose a ton. So we think we‚Äôve been filling holes. But we‚Äôve actually been building a trap. And that‚Äôs because poverty is about more than deprivation; it‚Äôs about isolation.There are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They don‚Äôt have the support they need to grow, whether it‚Äôs a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss.What they need is someone they can trust, someone who can help them learn new skills. And by discouraging work, the federal government is isolating the poor.That‚Äôs why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Don‚Äôt just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty.Don‚Äôt measure success based on inputs. Measure the results.And this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is not the money in Washington.It is the people in our communities ‚Äî the people with credibility. They‚Äôre the ones who can break through. And I‚Äôm not saying just cut money for the safety net. I‚Äôd say spend the same amount of money we do now ‚Äî because this isn‚Äôt about saving money; it‚Äôs about saving lives.What I‚Äôm saying is, don‚Äôt minimize; customize. Take the money we‚Äôre spending now and direct it to homegrown solutions. Design aid to fit each person‚Äôs needs. And whatever you do,encourage work ‚Äî because that‚Äôs how people reconnect with their community. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the people around them, and they grow.They‚Äôll not only have enough money; they‚Äôll be able to make enough money to get off assistance.The way I see it, the federal government is the rearguard; it should direct the supply lines. But the people in our communities ‚Äî they‚Äôre the vanguard; they should fight poverty on the front lines.Now, I know a lot of people are wondering, ‚ÄúWhy do you care about this? You‚Äôre Republicans.‚ÄùI remind them, ‚ÄòWell, we‚Äôre Americans too.‚Äô We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth doesn‚Äôt determine the outcome of your life.If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can redeem yourself.But a lot of people don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are.And it‚Äôs not enough to pay your taxes and think, ‚ÄúGovernment is going to take care of this.‚Äù We all have to get involved.And I know it‚Äôs easy to get discouraged. But what I‚Äôve learned is, there are thousands of people beating poverty every day. The solutions are out there; they‚Äôre already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not they‚Äôre right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America.So I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more prosperous, a more secure, and a more confident America."

The network will inevitably air back-to-back episodes at some point before the finale.)  As previously reported, Season 7 kicks off with a four-year time jump. After returning from a European book tour (that Julius Pepperwood novel must have really taken off!), Nick and Jess begin contemplating marriage. Potentially complicating matters is Jess‚Äô decision to take a job working for ex-boyfriend Russell (again played by Dermot Mulroney).

"Though he's been busy releasing new music for the past few weeks, Kanye West has been on his design hustle, too.

The shots feature a diverse roster of models wearing West‚Äôs new footwear, along with other Yeezy pieces like sports bras, leggings, and sweatshirts. But a few models really wore nothing but the shoe. One of them included adult-film actress Lela Star (who has an uncanny resemblance to West's wife, Kim Kardashian).  The campaign was photographed by Eli Linnetz (who shot the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card). He shared another revealing angle from the shoot.

Some wore Yeezy's signature oversized sweaters and biker shorts (√† la Kim Kardashian), others even sported jeans.  The roster also included younger-looking models, including a child.  This isn't the first time Kanye has launched a new campaign on social media. For his recent collections, Kim has worn his design in public and shared the paparazzi photos online to debut the clothes. He also enlisted other models including Paris Hilton, Amina Blue, and Sami Miro to pose as Kim lookalikes for the shots, resulting in a full-on social media swarm."

The publication claims that there's a ""hush-hush government investigation"" surrounding the ""Money Monster"" actor and ""the hoity-toity dinner party that spawned it."" The alleged event was reported being held to celebrate the success of his tequila line, Casamigos.  The publication further contends Clooney, who is known for his ""generous nature,"" had a ""desire to spread the wealth."" It goes on citing a so-called source as saying, ""Being the practical joker he is, George would've known that doling out $1 million in cash to each guest would've caused some intrigue and embarrassment when they went to deposit the money at a bank.""  ""There is a protocol, and the FBI would've been called in to question the depositor,"" the insider continued, before adding, ""But in the end, it was proven that George did, in fact, throw a party and gave everyone $1 million in cash, not to mention a designer bag."" The insider asserts, ""This is the last thing that George needs right now. He's got twins on the way and G-men at his proverbial doorstep!""

"The announcement that Mall of America was welcoming its first black Santa Claus was greeted in many quarters as a good thing but, as might be expected in a country that has become increasingly more comfortable saying any racist thing that comes to mind, many were highly offended. Three years after Fox‚Äôs Megyn Kelly definitively explained to America that both Jesus Christ and Santa Claus were white men, Mall of America dismissed her advice and hired Larry Jefferson, a retired U.S. Army veteran from Irving, Texas to spend four days at the mall listening to the wish lists of children of all colors.Among many who were offended by this move was former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin. The sharp-tongued Republican wasted no time in condemning the company‚Äôs actions, going on social media and posting comments that called for boycotting and ‚Äúrunning Mall of America into the ground,‚Äù on the basis of Santa ‚Äúalways having been white in the Bible.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, I refuse to believe that they went this far in trying to cater to the minorities, I thought the company had some backbone but I guess I was wrong,‚Äù Palin told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.She also argued that hiring a non-white Santa Claus was ‚Äúthe last straw‚Äù in corporate America‚Äôs twisting of traditional, conservative Christian values, ‚Äúbecause they realized they couldn‚Äôt make any more money off of the usual scams and techniques they‚Äôve been using so far.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why they had to come up with something new and out of the box, at least something that appeared that way in their minds. But, this proves that they have no morals and that they won‚Äôt shy away from even the most blatant twisting of traditional Christian values, just so they could make more money. I understand having to make a profit in order to get by and have a good life, but I don‚Äôt understand stomping on things that are holy and sacred in order to accomplish that.‚Äù‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why Americans, especially white ones, need to boycott the company and need to run it into the ground, so that they never ever come up with such an offensive and sacrilegious idea again,‚Äù Palin added. ‚ÄúThe Holy Book always said Santa Claus was white and any kind of deviation from that, regardless of its magnitude, is a sin. And we need to make an example out of Mall of America. If we don‚Äôt, if we let them get away with it, what‚Äôs next? Others will follow their example and the next thing we know, we‚Äôre going to be having Arab Santa Clauses that are going to be teaching our kids how to make IEDs out of Christmas lights. I mean, just look at the number of white youngsters infatuated with rap and hip-hop music; you think that‚Äôs happening by accident?‚Äù‚ÄúNope, our children are systematically being indoctrinated into other cultures and interests that have nothing to do with traditional, white Christianity. The numbers of converts to Islam have also spiked, just as much as interracial marriages between white women and members of other ethnic groups. We are being bred out, people, and as innocent as it may seem, a black Santa is just the beginning,‚Äù she concluded."

"Harry Styles knows that you care way more than you should about his relationship with ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift, and he's ready to play with your feelings a little more.  Onstage at one of his concerts the other night, Styles mentioned Swift in such a sly way, that fans are already praying for a reunion. Wishing an audience member happy birthday, Styles asked how old she was turning, to which the fan replied, ""22."" It's not hard to guess what happened next.  Announcing the news to the audience, Styles said, ""22. She‚Äôs 22, okay? I don‚Äôt know about..."" And as every Swift fan knows, that's exactly how the lyrics to ""22"" go. You can watch the whole interaction on Twitter:    Unfortunately, Styles didn't launch into a full-on cover of ""22,"" although he should definitely consider doing so in a future set.  Styles and Swift started dating in November 2012, and were photographed together for the first time in December the same year, when they were spotted in Central Park. Perez Hilton reported their breakup on January 7, 2013, with a source revealing, ""They are both really busy and never in one place for long. Harry's really upset about the split and is really sensitive about it."" They both went on to write songs about each other.  the tea is that harry will never forget taylor as long as he lives as well pic.twitter.com/jyutkmDj95 ‚Äî hanna (@poeticsswift) March 19, 2018  imagine thinking taylor alison swift and harry edward styles aren‚Äôt soulmates ‚Äî juliet‚òÉÔ∏è (@seIenatayIors) March 21, 2018  me: i'm over haylor now they're both in separate relationships and it's been years  harry: taylor  me: HELLO BITCH! ‚Äî ash (@thestorycfus) March 19, 2018  Perhaps the best things that Swift has bestowed upon the world are the copious references to ex-boyfriends that she's scattered throughout her discography.

"Harvey Weinstein pled not guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in 2006 during an arraignment in downtown Manhattan on Monday.  It was a familiar scene for the 66-year old movie mogul. He had previously been arraigned in June on charges of first- and third-degree rape, and a first-degree criminal sexual act involving two other women. The charges stem from incidents that allegedly took place in 2004 and 2013.  A handcuffed Weinstein entered the court room on Monday wearing a dark suit, a white shirt, and a navy blue tie. He looked ashen and appeared to have shed some weight from his hulking frame. He was flanked by his attorney Benjamin Brafman, and whispered to him at various points during the arraignment.  Weinstein, the producer of hit indie films such as ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù and ‚ÄúShakespeare in Love,‚Äù was a force in Hollywood, renowned for his ability to pick art house fare that could cross over into the mainstream, and feared for his volatile temper. He also had deep ties to the Beltway, raising money for President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during their White House runs.  However, Weinstein‚Äôs career is in tatters. Dozens of women have come forward in recent months to accuse the producer of assaulting or harassing them. His accusers include prominent actresses such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Ashley Judd. Weinstein‚Äôs fall helped lead to an industry-wide reckoning, one that led to charges of assault or misbehavior being leveled against other powerful figures such as Kevin Spacey, Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, and Brett Ratner.  The new charges stem from accusations that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on a woman in July 2006. It carries a potential life sentence if convicted. He faces ‚Äãa minimum of 10 years in prison if found guilty. Law enforcement has not publicly identified any of the three women accusing Weinstein of assault, but one accuser, former marketing executive Lucia Evans, previously said she was pressing charges.  Weinstein faces a number of potential legal issues. Police in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and London are also investigating allegations that the producer assaulted or sexually abused women.  Weinstein is currently free on $1 million bail. Prosecutors spent most of the 20-minute hearing pushing to have the mogul placed under house arrest in New York City, a proposal that Weinstein‚Äôs attorney objected to, noting that he currently lives in Connecticut.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs 66 years old with no criminal record,‚Äù said Brafman, arguing that if Weinstein moved to New York City, he would be hounded by media and would have to deal with a ‚Äúcircus atmosphere.‚Äù His Connecticut home has been sold, but Weinstein can remain there through February.  Manhattan Supreme Court Justice James Burke said that bail conditions will remain the same and Weinstein will not be under house arrest. In an impromptu press conference on the steps of the court house, Brafman said he had emails to defend Weinstein and added that ‚Äúhe is not a rapist or a predator.‚Äù  The attorney said that Weinstein was trying to clear his name so he could ‚Äúhopefully go back to making movies.‚Äù  On Monday, the court room was nearly filled with media. Gloria Allred, an attorney who is representing one of Weinstein‚Äôs accusers, was also on hand. Brafman approached Allred shortly before the hearing and shook her hand.  ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúGlad you could make it.‚Äù  Allred later released a statement asking if Brafman was willing to put Weinstein on the witness stand.  ‚ÄúMy client will testify under oath at the trial,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAre you ready to state unequivocally that Mr. Weinstein is ready to take the witness stand and testify as well?‚Äù"

"Portia de Rossi appeared on wife Ellen DeGeneres' talk show Wednesday to share the reason she said goodbye to acting.  ""I was approaching 45, aging out,"" de Rossi joked. ""I was just kind of wondering if there was something I could tackle now that I've never done before that would be really wonderful and different. I kind of knew what acting would look like for me for the next 10 or 20 years, so I decided to quit and start a business.""  In lieu of acting, de Rossi started General Public, an art curation and publishing company that uses special technology to print paintings.  ""I see a lot of women in their mid-forties kind of thinking about the next stage of their lives and I just didn't want to regret not trying something,"" de Rossi said.  The decision to quit wasn't one that initially stuck, though. After being written off Scandal, de Rossi still found herself filming season five of Arrested Development, which hits Netflix May 29.  ""I made this decision about 18 months ago, Shonda Rhimes wrote me off Scandal, it was fine,"" de Rossi recalled. ""I called Mitch Hurwitz, who's the creator of Arrested Development, and I said, 'If there is a season five I won't be doing it because I quit acting.' And he seemed really understanding and he totally got it, we had a really great conversation ... and then he wrote me into five episodes. I don't know how it happened, but yes, I am on season five.""  Apparently, Arrested Development appreciated de Rossi's appearance; the team there donated $50,000 to the Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund ‚Äî the gift that de Rossi gave DeGeneres for her 60th birthday in January.  It turns out that gift, which de Rossi had to keep secret for five to six months, was hard to pull off.  ""It was so hard too because she's really observant. Not nosy, just observant,"" de Rossi assured. ""So yeah, it was really quite a feat to pull that off. I mean, you know, it's kind of hard to know what to get you, right?""  In between trying to successfully prepare DeGeneres' gift, de Rossi admittedly made a few mistakes with the guest list for her wife's birthday party.  ""I need to say this on the air. So it was up to me to do the guest list and I may have left a couple of very important people off the guest list. It's my fault. That's what I want to say,"" de Rossi said. ""Sorry, Jane Fonda. She's, like, my idol and I forgot her. Heidi Klum, you make the best swimsuits ever, thank you. I'm so sorry.""

"Jennifer Lawrence has nothing to hide.  While promoting her new movie, Red Sparrow, the 27-year-old actress sat down with Vanity Fair for a different kind of interview. Lawrence was hooked up to a lie detector test, where she was promptly quizzed on relationships, beauty, philosophy, pop culture and Vanity Fair's last category: the essentials.  So what did we learn about J.Law? First, she's not exactly calm under pressure. The polygraph itself was enough to get her heart racing, but she was pretty honest. She has no shame about her love for reality TV, she's open to dating a non-celebrity and she definitely regrets some of her red carpet looks.  The actress even volunteered information about herself, like the ""psychotic"" thoughts she has every time she's about to take the subway, why we should all believe in aliens, and her self-tanning habits.  Watch below:  Lawrence has no problem keeping it real. On Thursday's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, she opened up about the rumors that she dated Brad Pitt, confessing that she didn't exactly mind seeing herself and the 54-year-old actor together in the tabloids.

"Shonda Rhimes' Scandal will come to an end next year, according to a report from TVLine. The series, which is part of ABC's popular T.G.I.T Thursday night lineup, has been a hit for the network and has helped secure Rhimes' dominance and make a big name out of star Kerry Washington, who plays Washington D.C.'s ""fixer"" Olivia Pope.  This should not come as a huge surprise to big Shondaland fans, as Rhimes herself said that the show would have a shorter shelf life than her original hit, Grey's Anatomy, which is now in its 13th season. ""I feel like there is a finite amount of Scandal to be told,"" she told NPR in 2013. ""So I know what the end of Scandal will be, and I feel really good about that. And I can see where the end point is.""  Thus the show's conclusion was the decision of Rhimes, not the network. Among the advertiser-coveted 18 to 49 demographic, the show was among the 20 highest-rated shows of 2016. The current season averages 5.699 million viewers and 1.46 viewers in the 18-49 demo. While this marks a drop from the fifth season's average of 7.18 million viewers, the current live number is impressive considering the steady decline of live-viewership. Scandal remains one of ABC's most popular series and a large reason why the network routinely beats the other broadcasters on Thursday nights.  These ratings, of course, have allowed the network to pull in a hefty amount in ad revenue. At its peak, Scandal was part of a Thursday night block that brought ABC over half a billion dollars. In 2016, Scandal brought in $75 million for ABC--more than How to Get Away with Murder or The Catch, according to iSpot.tv.  ""What Shonda Rhimes possesses is this extraordinary instinct and compass for what our audience needs,"" then-president of ABC Entertainment group Paul Lee told FORBES in 2013. ""That Shonda is free and has a huge amount of power to pursue her vision is precisely how the magic happens.""  The network isn't the only beneficiary of Scandal's popularity. The show's stars have risen to prominence--and their wallets have grown--with the series. Washington routinely lands high on Forbes' list of highest-paid TV actresses. Last year, she pulled in $12 million, with about half of that coming from her salary from the show. Being on the show has made her well-known enough to land lucrative endorsement deals with the likes of Neutrogena and a commercial with Apple Music.  As a black lead on a broadcast series, Washington's star turn has also brought much-needed diversity to prime time. After the success of Scandal, Rhimes brought another African American woman--Viola Davis, the first black woman to ever win the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama--to the limelight on How to Get Away with Murder. On broadcast TV, only 22.6% of series regulars are of underrepresented racial minorities according to the 2016 Annenberg report on diversity. In dramas, like Scandal, this percentage drops. Unfortunately, that means two dramas with black leads is a big deal for the industry.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always room for our film and television, for our art, to be more representative of who we are as a culture. I think for me especially, being a person of color and a woman, you really see that intersection,"" she told WWD."

Poking fun at how long it took to give her child a name, she posted: 'Lux Russell, 08/05/17. 7 lbs 15 oz, 19 3/4‚Äù born at 3 am on the dot. It only took us 7 weeks to decide a name and 8 weeks to make it official.'

Baby Lux's father is Kailyn's longtime friend Chris Lopez.  Wait for it! The MTV star, 25, welcomed her third child into the world in early August, but it took her seven weeks to decide on a suitable moniker for the little one  Oh baby: Kailyn previously referred to her third child as Baby Lo, in reference to both herself and his father, her longtime friend Chris Lopez  Back around in August, the best-selling author made a birth announcement where she called the little one 'Baby Lo,' referring to both her and baby-daddy Lopez's surnames.  As Kailyn is getting used to life as a mother-of-three, she also announced she'll be joining the next season of Marriage Boot Camp Reality Stars along with ex and co-parent Javi Marroquin.  Kailyn and Javi have one son Lincoln, while the MTV figure's older boy Isaac's dad is her ex Jo Rivera.  The reality star first announced her pregnancy in a blog post back in February.  'This was the choice I made. This is the baby I thought I wasn't sure if I could have,' she wrote. 'I know this isn't an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay.'  Three times a mama! The mother-of-three older boy Isaac's, seven, was fathered by ex Jo Rivera and she shares middle son Lincoln, three, with ex Javi Marroquin  In May, Kailyn discussed balancing motherhood with her studies as she graduated from Delaware State University with a bachelor's degree.  She told E!: 'It's been a long and emotional journey, especially without any support from my parents. But I'm so happy and relieved!'  Kailyn later added on her blog: 'If you follow any amount of the show, you know I've been struggling to get through school and earn my bachelor's over the last 6 years...Yes, 6 years.  'Between teen motherhood, financial hurdles in the beginning, then moving to a new state, marriage, babies and divorce... and then of course just wanting to give up, I (barely) held on and I'm FINALLY graduating May 13!'"

"218.9k SHARES Share Tweet ShareWaukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing people in the area in the last decade, has confirmed the U.S. Coast Guard this morning.Canadian tourist, John O‚ÄôKeef and his friend from Chicago, Allan Brooks captured the 3,000-pound beast while fishing for sturgeon in Michigan Lake.‚ÄúWe reeled in the beast for a good 4-5 hours before my friend Allan finally shot it with a rifle and wounded it to the head‚Äù explains O‚ÄôKeef.‚ÄúI‚Äôd heard of the Lake Michigan monster, but never did I expect to catch it myself,‚Äù claims the 63-year-old Canadian tourist.The great white shark estimated at more than 1.2 tons is the biggest fish ever caught in the region, believe experts.Professor of biology at the University of Illinois, Allan Jameson said: ‚ÄúThis is not common to find such a beast so far inland. Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.‚Äù he admits, visibly puzzled. ‚ÄúIt is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,‚Äù he told reporters.According to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.U.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region‚Äôs waters ‚Äúis highly unlikely‚Äù as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.In 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930."

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe for more exclusive interviews and photos, only in EW.  Wedding bells will soon be ringing at Grey Sloan!  EW can exclusively reveal that Jo (Camilla Luddington) and Alex (Justin Chambers) will be getting married in the season 14 finale of Grey‚Äôs Anatomy.  Slated to air Thursday, May 17, the finale is gearing up to be a big event ‚Äî which, in the world of Shondaland, means things will certainly go awry.  ‚ÄúI am so excited for Jo and Alex to finally seal the deal and get married,‚Äù Luddington tells EW. ‚ÄúBut in true Jolex form, the wedding will have lots of twists and turns to it.‚Äù See?  EW‚Äôs exclusive photo from the wedding definitely seems to speak to impending disaster.  Eric McCandless/ABC  It‚Äôs been a long road to the altar for these two. After his failed marriage to Izzie (Katherine Heigl) in the early years of Grey‚Äôs, Alex and Jo started dating in season 9. But the couple hit a major roadblock at the end of season 12 when Jo rebuffed Alex‚Äôs proposal, afraid to reveal her name wasn‚Äôt actually Jo Wilson ‚Äî it was Brooke Stadler ‚Äî and she was still married to an abusive man from whom she ran.  After Alex nearly landed in jail back in season 13 ‚Äî long story involving him beating up DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), whom he believed was hooking up with Jo ‚Äî and Jo‚Äôs estranged ex Paul (Matthew Morrison) ended up dead in season 14, Jo ultimately proposed to Alex earlier this year.  The ABC medical drama will also close out the season with emotional farewells to longtime series regulars Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew. Geena Davis will be reprising her role as Dr. Nicole Herman, who returns to discuss an exciting opportunity with Arizona, seemingly signaling how Arizona will exit.  Details on Drew‚Äôs departure are being kept under wraps, but the logline for the penultimate episode, in which Davis also returns, does tease that one of Grey Sloan Memorial‚Äôs own will be seriously injured, prompting the team to reflect on what is truly important to them. Could their patient end up being Drew‚Äôs character April? We‚Äôll find out when the penultimate hour airs on May 10.  Grey‚Äôs Anatomy airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC."

"Wolf writes that Jolie is a feminist superhero who actually has it all. And not in the Carrie Bradshaw sense (you know‚Äîsex, shoes, fashion, NYC, girls' night out!, cosmos); rather, admired for her sexuality as much as for being a good person and mom.  Examples please, Ms. Wolf:  1. It all started with her early roles like Girl, Interrupted and Tomb Raider, which established her as ""sexy and daring, confrontational and independent."" That set the stage for everything else.  2. Then she adopted Maddox. ""Suddenly, she seemed more mature, more beautiful, and more serious"" and made single motherhood look awesome. ""She was reframing single motherhood from a state of lack or insufficiency to a glamorous, unfettered lifestyle choice,"" Wolf suggests.  3. She learned to fly a plane, which is the ""ultimate in single-mom chic."" Also, Wolf points out that flying a plane is typically a man thing, so Angie is metaphorically making her own decisions without the help of men. Girl power!  4. Then she chose the most perfect man who ever existed and didn't care about whether he was married. Yes, this makes her a homewrecker. But Wolf argues that Brad Pitt looked so good with the kids as the ultimate male role model that Angie was able to get away with it unscarred.  5. Taking Brad as her lover was also Angie's big ef you to society and rules (like don't steal people's spouses). Break it down, Wolf-style: ""Jolie's evident disdain of that social constraint certainly, for better or worse, put her in the same self-entitled category as those men who have traditionally taken what they wanted and let the emotional chips fall where they may.""  6. And finally, by visiting Afghan refugees in Pakistan and penning op-eds about Darfur in Time, Angelina makes other female stars look lazy with their silly tanning and partying.  And so, Angie is the ""ego ideal"" for ladies. They can live out the fantasy of achieving ultimate single-mom chic, taking the sexiest married man alive as their lover (consequence free), building a small multi-ethnic baby army and solving the world's injustices‚Äîwhile still being desired sexually throughout it all.  Case closed on the Mystery of the Great Straight Lady Desire for Angelina Jolie."

"Roger Ailes, Former Fox News CEO, Dies At 77  Enlarge this image toggle caption Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images Wesley Mann/Fox News via Getty Images  Former Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes has died, the network says, citing a statement from the late executive's family. Ailes resigned from his post leading Fox News last July, amid allegations of sexual harassment. He was 77.  Ailes helped found Fox News in 1996. On Thursday, the network initially announced his death by citing the Drudge Report, which had published a statement from Ailes' wife, Elizabeth.  According to Fox News, that statement reads:  ""I am profoundly sad and heartbroken to report that my husband, Roger Ailes, passed away this morning. Roger was a loving husband to me, to his son Zachary, and a loyal friend to many. He was also a patriot, profoundly grateful to live in a country that gave him so much opportunity to work hard, to rise ‚Äî and to give back.""  Remembrances Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Roger Ailes, Founder Of 'Fox News,' Dies At 77 Listen ¬∑ 4:36 4:36  Anchors of the channel's morning show Fox & Friends were noticeably emotional in announcing Ailes' death.  ""Beth, you are in our thoughts and prayers,"" co-host Ainsley Earhardt said, ""and so is Zachary, their beautiful son. Roger, rest in peace.""  Ailes was famous for his shrewd leadership of Fox, including his focus on airing conservative opinions and hiring anchors and reporters with big personalities. But he left Fox with a tarnished legacy, facing legal actions over allegations of sexual harassment.  Ailes denied accusations that he built a culture at Fox that encouraged harassment, after a lawsuit by former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson prompted other women at the network, including high-profile anchor Megyn Kelly, to step forward with similar claims. He abruptly resigned last July.  In the decades before he created a ratings juggernaut in Fox News, Ailes worked in politics, serving as a media adviser and consultant ‚Äî most famously for Richard Nixon, whom Ailes helped to win the presidency in 1968. He later worked for other Republican leaders, from Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  Ailes was a producer of the variety and talk program The Mike Douglas Show when he met Nixon. In the years that followed, as NPR's David Folkenflik has reported, Ailes ""kept toggling between producing television specials and serving as a political consultant, sometimes doing both at once.""  The architect of Fox News was also close to President Trump, to whom he gave a weekly slot on Fox & Friends ‚Äî a show that the president has regularly touted in his tweets from the White House.  Trump ""sort of represents Roger Ailes' legacy of 50 years of using television to advance a style ‚Äî a populist style of conservative politics,"" journalist and author Gabriel Sherman told NPR's Terry Gross last summer.  Sherman, who wrote a biography of Ailes titled The Loudest Voice In The Room, also spoke to Terry back in 2014, when his book was first published.  Discussing Ailes' impact on politics and culture in the U.S., Sherman said, ""One of Ailes' lasting legacies will be that for millions of Americans, news is now no longer viewed as a way to be informed about the world; it's a way of gathering information that advances your side."""

"We have learned that Kourtney Kardashian is not at all impressed by the fact that it looks like her ex Scott Disick‚Äôs current girlfriend Sofia Richie is morphing into her! As fans of KUWK may already know, it has become apparent for a while that the 19-year-old is stealing her style and Kourt is convinced it is all Scott‚Äôs doing!  One insider explained that ‚ÄòKourtney‚Äôs definitely more than a little creeped out by how Sofia appears to be stealing her look. But, it also makes her sad because she realized how young and impressionable Sofia is.‚Äô  The source went on to say that the mother of three suspects Scott is to blame for Sofia‚Äôs drastic physical change ever since she started dating him.  ‚ÄòKourtney thinks she is probably being controlled, or at the very least, manipulated, by Scott. Some people might find it flattering, but she just thinks it‚Äôs gross, and Scott needs to grow up, move on, and start living as an independent adult for once.‚Äô  As you may remember, at the beginning of Scott and Sofia‚Äôs relationship, the teen was rocking her blonde hair and was wearing pretty colorful clothes.  Now, however, not only did she dye her hair brunette but her wardrobe consists of mainly dark blazers and crop tops as well as very thin sunglasses.  Fans of KUWK know that all of these style elements are staples of Kourtney‚Äôs fashion.  @milesrichie ? ? @alansilfen A post shared by Sofia Richie (@sofiarichie) on Mar 7, 2018 at 7:39pm PST  We have previously learned that Kourtney did try to discuss with Scott the fact that Sofia keeps on copying her look, but he laughed it off.

"Roy Halladay, a two-time Cy Young Award winner admired as much for his off-the-field persona as his Hall of Fame pitching ability, died Tuesday when the private plane he was piloting crashed off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico.  A fearsome competitor on the mound, Halladay, 40, earned universal appreciation within the sport, from teammates and opponents alike. He was one of 23 pitchers to throw a perfect game, and joined the Yankees‚Äô Don Larsen as the only two to fire a no-hitter in the postseason.  Halladay did it for the Phillies in his playoff debut, on Oct. 6, 2010, and came within a fifth-inning walk to the Reds‚Äô Jay Bruce of also being perfect that remarkable evening at Citizens Bank Park. The baseball world was in shock Tuesday after learning of Halladay‚Äôs fatal accident, which came only four years after his retirement from the Phillies, his 16-year career prematurely ended by his decision to avoid back surgery.  ‚ÄúWe are numb over the very tragic news about Roy Halladay‚Äôs untimely death,‚Äù the Phillies said in a statement. ‚ÄúThere are no words to describe the sadness that the entire Phillies family is feeling over the loss of one of the most respected human beings to ever play the game.‚Äù  Halladay recently purchased the A5 ICON, a two-seat, single-engine amphibious plane capable of landing on water, and his Twitter feed was filled with photographs of him flying the aircraft. According to the Pasco County (Fla.) Police Department, the plane went down in the water, about a quarter-mile offshore, and Halladay died in the crash. There was no one else traveling with him.  Halladay‚Äôs accident is the latest in a number of plane crashes that have claimed the lives of prominent baseball players. The Pirates‚Äô Roberto Clemente perished while on a relief mission to Nicaragua on New Year‚Äôs Eve in 1972, the Yankees‚Äô Thurman Munson crashed while piloting his own plane near his Ohio home, and another Yankee, Cory Lidle, died when his plane collided with a Manhattan apartment building in 2006.  ‚ÄúOur hearts are broken,‚Äù said Tony Clark, the union‚Äôs executive director and a former player. ‚ÄúRoy Halladay was not just one of the greatest competitors, but was also among the best men in our generation of players.  Subscribe to Sports Now newsletter By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.  ‚ÄúOur paths crossed many times during our careers, and I can tell you he was among the toughest pitchers I ever faced. But while he never gave in on the mound, he was known in both leagues as an outstanding teammate, a guy who would go out of his way to help other players.‚Äù  Halladay, nicknamed ‚ÄúDoc,‚Äù was a throwback. As baseball gradually moved to de-emphasize the starting pitcher, he still took pride in going the distance, with 67 complete games, including 20 shutouts. An eight-time All-Star, Halladay also was a three-time 20-game winner, twice during his 12-year stint in Toronto. Halladay will be eligible for the Hall of Fame in 2019.  ‚ÄúThe Blue Jays organization is overcome by grief with the tragic loss of one of the franchise‚Äôs greatest and most respected players, but even better human being,‚Äù the team said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to express what he has meant to this franchise, the city and its fans.‚Äù  In addition to his impact on baseball, Halladay left a lasting imprint on his Florida community, with the Pasco County Police struggling both to investigate the crash and mourn a friend.  ‚ÄúHe was one in a million,‚Äù Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco told The Associated Press. ‚ÄúIt is a true loss for us.‚Äù  Nick Fanti, the former Hauppauge High School pitching standout, fondly remembered Halladay after having him as an instructor at the Phillies‚Äô camp in spring training.  ‚ÄúI was fortunate enough to work with Roy Halladay and can honestly say I‚Äôm not only a better baseball player, but a better person off the field for it,‚Äù Fanti tweeted. ‚ÄúTo be able to listen to him talk about his process and how he played the game was an honor. Truly a professional and a legend and will be missed.‚Äù  Halladay is survived by his wife, Brandy, and two sons, Ryan and Braden.  Former and current players flocked to Twitter to express their condolences, with Dodgers pitcher Brandon McCarthy summing up a generation‚Äôs feelings.  ‚ÄúRoy Halladay was your favorite player‚Äôs favorite player,‚Äù McCarthy tweeted. ‚ÄúA true ace and a wonderful person. Heartbroken for those who knew him best.‚Äù"

"Kim said she decided to use a surrogate after experiencing ""bad deliveries"" and having a few surgeries on her uterus.  ""I really didn't have a choice,"" she said. ""I, at this point, couldn't get pregnant and we wanted to expand our family. So the fact that that is something that you can do, and it's really taboo to talk about and people don't really understand it, I mean, even throwing my baby shower, do I a baby shower? What do I do? I thought I wanted to because I wanted North to experience a party, like, 'Something's coming, someone's coming. We're going to welcome our little sister coming.' So I think that...that really like got everyone in the mood.""  ""But there are no rules. It's like, you know, I saw online people were saying today, like, 'Did you invite your surrogate to the shower? Is she invited?'"" Kim continued. ""What are the rules? There are no rules and I'm trying to figure it out. But I thought I'd want to be open about my experience because it's what I'm going through.""  Kim said she decided she wanted a baby shower days before it was held.  ""I was in the mindset of, 'I'm not going to do a baby shower,'"" Kim said on The Real. ""And all of a sudden, like five days before the baby shower, I was like, 'I have to do it.' Cherry blossoms, it's what I wanted. We had to rent off these cherry blossoms. They pulled it off in four or five days...and it was so beautiful and it was just a tea for my friends and it was beautiful. I'm so glad that I did it.""  The baby shower featured pink cherry blossom trees, which fueled speculation Kim and Kanye are expecting a girl. Kim then confirmed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week that they will be welcoming their second daughter.  Kim and Kanye's new baby will join big sister North West, 4, and big brother Saint West, who will turn 2 in December.  ""It is an interesting transition. She is so excited it's a girl,"" Kim said about North. ""She is so excited. I think my son's gonna have a harder time with it, I don't know why. I hope he doesn't. I tell her every night, 'You know, when you're coming in my room and it's now two in the morning, you know I might be in Baby Sister's room feeding her, so you can't, you know, I'm not always gonna be here.' And she's like, 'I know, Mom.' Let's see. Let's see."""

"Jennifer Lawrence‚Äôs nude scene in her new spy film is all about reclaiming her agency.  In ‚ÄúRed Sparrow, ‚Äù which hits theaters on Friday, Lawrence plays a Russian ballerina-turned-assassin who uses her sexuality for espionage. The film requires her to go nude ‚Äï a first for the actress, and something she said ‚Äúscared the hell out of me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI tried to do the movie without nudity but realized it just wouldn‚Äôt be right to put the character through something that I, myself, am not willing to go through,‚Äù Lawrence told Vanity Fair for the March edition cover story.  But her decision was that much more difficult in light of a photo hack back in August 2014 that targeted her and other celebrities like Kate Upton, and leaked intimate photos of them on the internet.  Vanity Fair Jennifer Lawrence covers Vanity Fair's March 2018 issue.  ‚ÄúMy biggest fear was that people would say, ‚ÄòOh, how can you complain about the hack if you‚Äôre going to get nude anyway?‚Äô‚Äù Lawrence said.  The photo hacker has since been sentenced to 18 months in prison for using fraudulent email addresses to gain access to various iCloud and Gmail accounts.  Lawrence previously described the photo-hack experience as being ‚Äúgang-banged by the f**king planet.‚Äù But going nude in ‚ÄúRed Sparrow,‚Äù she said, was about feeling empowered on her own terms.  ‚ÄúOne is my choice,‚Äù she explained to Vanity Fair. ‚ÄúI got something back that was taken from me, and it also felt normal.‚Äù  Karwai Tang via Getty Images Jennifer Lawrence attends the European Premiere of ""Red Sparrow.""  The spy film reunited Lawrence with ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù director Francis Lawrence, who she said helped her adjust to some potentially uncomfortable moments on set.  ‚ÄúHe looked me right in the eyes like I had clothes on and then all of a sudden I was like, ‚ÄòOh, O.K., it‚Äôs just like I have clothes on,‚Äô‚Äù she told the magazine. ‚ÄúEverybody here is professional. You‚Äôre still at work. One look just made me comfortable. It didn‚Äôt make me feel naked.‚Äù  Still, Lawrence admitted there was something icky about baring it all in front of a crew she‚Äôs worked with since the first installment in the dystopian ‚ÄúHunger Games‚Äù trilogy.  ‚ÄúThey all knew me since I was a baby,‚Äù Lawrence said, adding that she teased crew members after filming wrapped, telling them, ‚ÄúI hope you guys feel creepy.‚Äù  Dave J Hogan via Getty Images Joel Edgerton and Jennifer Lawrence attend a ""Red Sparrow"" photocall.  The role also required her to get in ballerina-ready physical condition and undergo months of serious training to make the dancing scenes look believable.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wondered what it would take to get me to really diet, to really be hungry, because I‚Äôve never done it for a movie,‚Äù Lawrence said. ‚ÄúFor ‚ÄòHunger Games,‚Äô they told me to lose weight, and then I discovered Jack in the Box. ‚ÄòRed Sparrow‚Äô was the first time that I was really hungry, and disciplined. I can‚Äôt be in character as an ex-ballerina and not feel like an ex-ballerina.‚Äù  Lawrence previously opened up about being told to stand in a nude photo lineup for an audition early in her career to shame her into losing weight. But her days of dieting without relief and subscribing to Hollywood‚Äôs toxic beauty standards are over.  ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt work on a diet. I‚Äôm hungry. I‚Äôm standing on my feet.

"I‚Äôve been saying for a solid year that Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux‚Äôs marriage seemed very strange. They barely seemed to spend any time together, and it wasn‚Äôt like their time apart was just about competing work schedules at all. Things got even stranger in the past week, with Jennifer celebrating her 49th birthday in Malibu, all while Justin was in New York, hanging out with his dog and not doing anything particularly important. I told you guys I was getting a weird feeling about JustJen. And look, I was right. Justin and Jennifer are over.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux have split after two and a half years of marriage ‚Äî and seven years as a couple, the Associated Press reports. The two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months, with Theroux often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin‚Äô in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest. The decision comes just days after the actress‚Äôs 49th birthday, which she and Theroux spent apart. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering alongside pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday. Theroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends.  [From People]  I mean‚Ä¶ again, I‚Äôve been thinking for a while that they were barely even together at this point. He was always in New York or traveling for work. She stayed in LA. Was it all that time apart that ultimately destroyed their marriage? Honestly ‚Äì and I‚Äôm not saying this just to be mean ‚Äì I never believed they had the most solid foundation in the first place. They got together when he was living with his then-longterm girlfriend Heidi Bivens. He hated the idea of moving to LA, and she pretended to move to New York for a short time to make him happy, but she gave that up. It took forever for them to go through with the wedding, and it was reported in People Magazine that HE was the holdout, that he was always wary of becoming Mr. Jennifer Aniston. I don‚Äôt know. It just felt like there was always too much going against them. Anyway, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be hearing a lot more in the days, weeks and months to come. So long, bizarre quartz engagement ring!  Update: Here‚Äôs the Associated Press‚Äôs piece, which includes the statement they made together:  The couple says in a statement released through her publicist Thursday that the decision to split ‚Äúwas mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.‚Äù The couple says they are making the announcement publicly ‚Äúin an effort to reduce any further speculation.‚Äù ‚ÄúNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,‚Äù says the statement released by longtime Aniston publicist Stephen Huvane. ‚ÄúWhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else‚Äôs fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.‚Äù Aniston and Theroux say they are ‚Äútwo best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.‚Äù  In case anyone was wondering if the ‚ÄúPoor Jen‚Äù narrative was going to be revived, there‚Äôs your answer. Poor Jen, still being hounded by gossip!"

"Selena Gomez has had a rough year with reports she's battling lupus, a stint in rehab, and her altogether exhausting on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber.  All that aside, the 21-year-old's rep says that In Touch Weekly's report claiming the former Disney star was pregnant in 2012 -- but miscarried -- while she was dating Bieber is completely false. In Touch alleges that Gomez wanted to have the child and subsequently went into a ""downward spiral,"" which later led to said stint in rehab in 2014.  The rumor also had one of the tabloid's sources claiming Bieber's team felt the baby would ""ruin his career because at the time he had a clean image."" And while the thought of Bieber with a ""clean image"" these days is worth a few chuckles, Gomez's rep told Us Weekly that the entire pregnancy report is ""100 percent fictional.""  As for her recent stay in rehab, which she left after just 14 days into a six-week program, much to the objections of facility staff, Gomez's rep also confirmed that it wasn't because of a miscarriage.  In the months since Gomez left rehab, there has been plenty of shakeup in her life, including rumored tiffs with friends. Without warning, she also fired her mother and stepfather as managers in April. A few days later, Gomez left CAA for WME, signing with Brillstein Entertainment Partners for management -- a ""crucial piece of the Disney alum's strategy, long in the works, to move on to more adult-oriented fare in film and music,"" according to The Hollywood Reporter."

"Her 'Today' co-anchor Al Roker attacked the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce"" on people over mistakes and called out the New York Times for its participation. ""It's a cheap shot.""  Jenna Bush Hager issued an apology over her Golden Globes snafu on Monday morning's Today.  The NBC News correspondent was covering her first red carpet for the network Sunday when she found herself thrust into the viral news spotlight after interviewing Hidden Figures nominee Pharrell.  ""So you're nominated for Hidden Fences,"" said Bush Hager, mistakenly combining the title of his film, Hidden Figures, with the also nominated Fences, starring Viola Davis and Denzel Washington. The New York Times' Dave Itzkoff highlighted the moment with a video on Twitter, sparking social media to quickly comment on Pharrell's taken-aback expression.  ""I had an error in the night, which I have to apologize for,"" said Bush Hager, who was joined by Al Roker and Natalie Morales on the NBC morning show. ""When I was interviewing the incomparable Pharrell, who I adore, I accidentally ‚Äî in the electricity of the red carpet, which I've never done one before ‚Äî called Hidden Figures 'Hidden Fences.' I have seen both movies, thought they were both brilliant. I've interviewed casts for both of the movies, and if I offended people I am deeply sorry.""  Later in the night, Michael Keaton made the same notable error when presenting the best supporting actress award, sparking the term #HiddenFences to trend on Twitter. While some users posted jokes and memes, others such as Gabrielle Union and Justin Simien noted their disappointment about the confusion and comedian-actress Robin Thede said, ""All movies with black people don't sound alike.""  ""It was a mistake, because ya'll know I'm not perfect,"" continued Bush Hager, who at this point began to choke up and get teary-eyed. ""I am authentic, but a human. And what I didn't want to do is make anyone lesser than who they are. I apologize to both the cast, to Pharrell, but it was a mistake and I hope we can move on.""  Both Roker and Morales swooped in to defend Bush Hager, with Roker blasting the ""culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce on people"" for what he said is a common mistake for live TV broadcasters.  ""We've all been in live situations and you make a mistake,"" said Roker, adding how he forgot Braveheart when he was interviewing Mel Gibson and referred to Jessica Biel as Jessica Alba during his Sunday interviews. ""Honest mistakes happen in live television and this culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce and get on people, it's got to stop. It's got to stop somewhere, because it's pretty ridiculous.""  He then chided The New York Times.  ""For The New York Times to pile on and repeat these tweets, it's a cheap shot,"" said Roker.  Bush Hager conceded that she has thick skin, but ""to act as though I don't care about people really hurt,"" prompting Morales to point out the red-carpet chaos.  ""It's like a mosh pit,"" she said. ""You're getting celebrities coming at you from all directions. It's a lot happening at the same time, and I think you had just interviewed the cast of Fences also, I think you were just right there in the moment, so it happens.""  But Bush Hager wouldn't cop to the excuse and ended with more of her apology.  ""I know how brilliant those films are and I did not want to make anyone feel lesser,"" she said.  Shortly after the segment aired, Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer took to Twitter to say she accepted Bush Hager's apology. ""We all make mistakes, hon! Thanks for your apology!"" she tweeted.  Hidden Figures co-star Janelle Monae and director Theodore Melfi ‚Äèalso accepted Bush Hager's apology on Twitter.  Dearest, @octaviaspencer Your kindness means so much to me + your compassion is matched only by your incredible talent in Hidden FIGURES!

""We all get to the peak together or we don't get there at all."" Blessings, Ted ‚Äî Theodore Melfi (@theodoremelfi) January 9, 2017  Later, Pharrell himself took to Twitter to tell Bush Hager that ""everyone makes mistakes."" He also joked that ""Hidden Fences does sound like an intriguing movie.""  Don't worry @JennaBushHager!Everyone makes mistakes. Hidden Fences does sound like an intriguing movie though. Just saying... ‚Äî Pharrell Williams (@Pharrell) January 9, 2017  Also on Monday, Hidden Figures beat out the reigning Rogue One: A Star Wars Story at the weekend box office, coming in at No. 1 with $22.8 million.

"Liam Hemsworth (born 13 January 1990)[1] is an Australian actor. He played the roles of Josh Taylor in the soap opera Neighbours and Marcus in the children's television series The Elephant Princess. In American films, Hemsworth starred as Will Blakelee in The Last Song (2010), as Gale Hawthorne in The Hunger Games film series (2012‚Äì2015), and as Jake Morrison in Independence Day: Resurgence (2016).  Hemsworth's older brothers, Luke and Chris, are also actors.  Early life  Hemsworth was born in Melbourne, Australia, to Leonie (n√©e van Os), an English teacher, and Craig Hemsworth, a social-services counsellor.[2][3][4] His two older brothers are Chris and Luke Hemsworth, who also work as actors.[5] His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant, and his other ancestry is English, Irish, Scottish, and German.[6] Hemsworth has said that though there is competition for jobs among them, it is friendly: ""We are brothers and we are always competitive, but it is a good thing, it pushes us and we are always happy whenever someone books something.""[7]  When Hemsworth was in year 8, he and his family relocated to Phillip Island,[8] a small Australian island southeast of Melbourne. Hemsworth says he spent much of his time there surfing with his brothers.[9] In March 2009, Hemsworth moved to the United States to pursue his career there.[10] He and his brother Chris first stayed in the guest house of Chris's manager, William Ward,[11] before renting their own Los Angeles apartment.[7]  Acting career  2007‚Äì2010: Career beginnings  Prior to becoming an actor, Hemsworth laid floors for six months.[7] He began to seriously consider following his elder brothers' footsteps in high school by participating in school plays.

Hemsworth plays the love interest of Miley Cyrus's character in the film.[18] Nikki Finke reported that Hemsworth had been in Los Angeles for just three weeks and had not yet found an agent when he was cast.[11] Hemsworth next appeared in the music video for Cyrus' ""When I Look at You""[19] which was recorded on 16 August 2009.[20]  In September 2009, Hemsworth appeared at a dinner event to promote Foxtel, an Australian pay television company.[21] In March 2010, Details magazine selected Hemsworth as one of their predictions for ""The Next Generation of Hollywood's Leading Men"".[17] Later that month, it was announced that Hemsworth was in negotiations to star in Arabian Nights, a 3D action film that will be directed by Chuck Russell for Inferno Entertainment.[22] It was later confirmed that he will be starring in the movie.[23] He has also reportedly been offered the lead role in Northern Lights after Taylor Lautner withdrew from the David Ellison-financed project.[23]  Hemsworth was the Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards 2010 host. He and Miley Cyrus won the ""Fave Kiss"" category.[24]  Hemsworth starred in the music video for ""Colder Weather"" by the Zac Brown Band.[25]  2011‚Äìpresent  Liam Hemsworth, November 2014  On 4 April 2011, Lionsgate announced Hemsworth to be one of the leads, Gale Hawthorne, in The Hunger Games, which was released in 2012.[26] In June 2011, he became attached to war drama Love and Honor which also stars Aimee Teegarden and Teresa Palmer.[27]  In 2013, Hemsworth appeared in Empire State, with Emma Roberts, and Paranoia, co-starring Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman and Amber Heard.  He reprised his role, Gale Hawthorne, in three sequels to The Hunger Games, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, released in November 2013, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 1, released in November 2014, and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 2, released in November 2015.

"One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either ‚Äî but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all ‚Äî where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's ""no ring, no bring"" policy ‚Äî meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed ‚Äî for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the ""no ring no bring"" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle ‚Äî in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place ‚Äî which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding ‚Äî the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement ‚Äî likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life."

"Adele is NOT ""panicked"" that her entourage might miss Sunday's Grammy Awards due to the East Coast snowstorm, despite a made-up webloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim. We're told it's ""not true.""  ""Grammys Ruined For Adele! Singer Stranded Without Her Team,"" blares a new RadarOnline headline. The accompanying article goes on to purport that the singer is ""freaking out"" because she's alone in Los Angeles while her crew is snowed in out east. A so-called ""source"" tells the site, ""Adele is panicked that her team will not make it out in time. Some key players were scheduled to fly west tomorrow but have just been cancelled by the airline.""  The outlet's dubious insider adds, ""With so many cancellations it looks like the show will have to go on without them.""

"If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story. Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing wrong with making a mistake, what‚Äôs wrong is not making the effort to make it right,‚Äù and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all in God‚Äôs hands always,‚Äù along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, ‚ÄúThat was aimed directly at Alex.‚Äù  Hollywood‚Äôs hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he‚Äôs still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months ‚Äî including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, ‚Äúsomeone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that‚Äôs what made Jennifer lose it,‚Äù the insider tells In Touch. ‚ÄúOf course, he said it wasn‚Äôt physical, and maybe it wasn‚Äôt, but in Jennifer‚Äôs book, that‚Äôs still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex‚Äôs actions have jeopardized everything.‚Äù  The damage runs deep. Jennifer, who‚Äôs endured three failed marriages, ‚Äúwas heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,‚Äù says the insider. ‚ÄúEven though they didn‚Äôt meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex‚Äôs antics.‚Äù  She has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. ‚ÄúA week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,‚Äù she claimed. ‚ÄúHe never even mentioned her.‚Äù Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer ‚Äúwould be an idiot to believe he‚Äôd be faithful,‚Äù she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs sexually attracted to her,‚Äù she dished. ‚ÄúIn bed... he's probably picturing me.""  Jennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she‚Äôs not sure what to believe. ‚ÄúJennifer‚Äôs still on the fence,‚Äù says the insider. ‚ÄúShe can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she‚Äôll fight for it.‚Äù  More from In Touch  Alex Rodriguez Encourages New Girlfriend Jennifer Lopez to ‚ÄúSex up‚Äù Her Wardrobe (EXCLUSIVE)  Jennifer Lopez Hints That She Has Made a Sex Tape ‚Äî Watch the Scandalous Clip!

"Khlo√© Kardashian, just welcomed her first child ‚Äî a baby girl! ‚Äî amid rampant speculation about Tristan Thompson‚Äòs alleged infidelities.  A source previously told PEOPLE that though Kardashian, 33, was devastated, she would remain focused on motherhood, explaining that the scandal ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt change that Khlo√© has dreamed of becoming a mom.‚Äù  It‚Äôs also not the first time the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star has faced similar rumors. Before she was romantically linked to NBA boyfriend Thompson in September 2016, Kardashian dealt with allegations of extramarital affairs during her nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Lamar Odom.  A source close to Odom, 38, told PEOPLE recently that ‚ÄúLamar feels terrible for Khlo√©. He wasn‚Äôt sure if he should reach out and see how she‚Äôs doing. He feels for her.‚Äù  Kardashian and Odom wed on Sept. 27, 2009 ‚Äî one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) ‚Äî but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player‚Äôs cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Watch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.  Cheating rumors against Odom first circulated in January 2012, when a tabloid report claimed Odom cheated on Kardashian with a woman he met at a Washington, D.C., strip club. And in July 2013, the pair were confronted rumors claiming Odom had been unfaithful to Kardashian after playing a game for the Dallas Mavericks.  RELATED: Everything We Know About Khlo√© Kardashian‚Äôs Romance with Tristan Thompson (So Far)  JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  ‚ÄúLove is blind ‚Ä¶ Lamar was so great at making me feel like I was the only one and I‚Äôm this princess. I never speculated cheating ‚Ä¶ so I didn‚Äôt know about cheating ‚Ä¶ until before the DUI [in 2013],‚Äù Kardashian told Howard Stern in January 2016.  ‚ÄúHe was so good. So nothing was on his cell phones, [but] he had an assistant. They were all on his assistant‚Äôs phone, so he was really crafty,‚Äù she recalled as Stern asked the former Kocktails with Khlo√© host: ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt that feel awful when the assistant knows, and everyone knows?‚Äù To which Kardashian agreed, ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs disgusting.‚Äù  RELATED GALLERY: Khlo√© Kardashian & Lamar Odom: A Timeline of Their Relationship  ‚ÄúBut all these rumors kept coming out in the weeklies, and as much as I know they‚Äôre bull‚Äî-, where there‚Äôs smoke there‚Äôs fire. Something has to be right here,‚Äù Kardashian revealed. ‚ÄúIt is humiliating on any level, but I found out he was cheating on me the majority of our marriage, I just didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù  In October 2015, Odom was rushed to the hospital after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Near death, he spent four days in a coma, and Kardashian rushed to his side and called off their divorce proceedings temporarily.  Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty; JB Lacroix/WireImage  Months before, in July 2015, both stars had signed divorce papers, but the judgment had not yet been entered in court by the time Odom was hospitalized; thus, they were technically still legally married. As a result, Kardashian was making all of Odom‚Äôs medical decisions.  Upon his recovery, Odom completed a 30-day drug rehab program.  Khlo√© refiled for divorce once Odom recovered from the Nevada incident, and their split was finalized in December 2016.

Jerritt Clark/Getty Images  One of his ‚Äúdarkest‚Äù moments, he admitted, was when Kardashian caught him doing drugs with another woman. ‚ÄúI was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife (at the time) walked in. That probably was like rock bottom. First of all I was in a motel. A motel,‚Äù he remembered.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a millionaire. I‚Äôd made it out of Jamaica, Queens, and won two NBA titles. And I‚Äôm in a motel, with some random person, doing coke. But I just wanted to get high with this girl, and I had no other place to go. I couldn‚Äôt take her home. You know, I was being a scumbag,‚Äù he wrote.  Odom still thinks highly of Kardashian. Asked in January by BET‚Äôs Mancave about Khlo√© being pregnant, Odom said he‚Äôs ‚Äúhappy for her,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúShe took care of me, she‚Äôll be a good mother. For real. She‚Äôs a great woman.‚Äù  Now, a source told PEOPLE that when Kardashian got together with Thompson, her sisters were ‚Äúreally happy to see Khloe so excited about someone again because she hadn‚Äôt felt that way about a guy since Lamar. Eventually Tristan won over her family too ‚Ä¶ he really seemed dedicated to her, so this must be a shock to everyone.‚Äù"

"Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, ‚ÄúJen To Justin: I‚Äôll Raise Our Baby Alone!‚Äù followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston‚Äôs marriage is ‚Äúon the rocks,‚Äù and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?‚Ä¶‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåÔ∏è A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  ‚ÄúPrivately, she has told friends that she‚Äôs secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth.

But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn‚Äôt right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn‚Äôt mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one‚Äôs business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people‚Äôs choices.

"Tennessee middle-schooler Keaton Jones is opening up about life after his anti-bullying video, revealing that he hasn‚Äôt returned to school since the footage spread across the Internet.  The 11-year-old and his mother, Kimberly Jones, appeared on British talk show This Morning on Thursday where they said they aren‚Äôt sure when Keaton will return to Horace Maynard Middle School in Maynardville, Tennessee.

Love What Matters/Facebook  Keaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he‚Äôs endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, ‚Äúmake fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.‚Äù  However, Keaton‚Äôs emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton‚Äôs story for financial gain.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve said over and over, I‚Äôm an adult, I know who I am. I‚Äôm obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children‚Ä¶‚Äù Kimberly said during the morning show. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something I wouldn‚Äôt wish on anybody.‚Äù  She added that the backlash has ‚Äúbrought the bullies out.‚Äù Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.  As the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton‚Äôs allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda.

"In the past, Kanye‚Äôs capriciousness has been repeatedly forgiven and, at times, belatedly rewarded with accolades. It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ‚Äî one of the greatest rap albums of all time ‚Äî without an ‚ÄúImma let you finish‚Äù at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn‚Äôt merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn‚Äôt sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month‚Äôs behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist‚Äôs personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‚ÄòI Thought About Killing You‚Äô, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‚ÄòNo Mistakes‚Äô, to keep his fans just interested enough. It‚Äôs telling that the one standout track, ‚ÄòGhost Town‚Äô is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn‚Äôt even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he‚Äôs become blas√© and doesn‚Äôt want to spend time on music anymore. He did say he wanted to run for President in 2020 (or 2024?) anyway."
"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Elle King‚Äòs wedding day was anything but textbook.  On Saturday, the ‚ÄúEx‚Äôs and Oh‚Äôs‚Äù singer was set to wed fianc√© Andrew ‚ÄúFergie‚Äù Ferguson but was actually at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Seattle instead.  ‚ÄúSkipped out on my wedding. I married Rock&Roll instead so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F‚ÄìKING DEATH METAL,‚Äù King shared on Instagram.  The daughter of comedian Rob Schneider, King, 27, accepted Ferguson‚Äôs proposal last February after he popped the question on a sailboat under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. As King recalled on a March episode of ‚ÄúSay Yes to the Dress,‚Äù Ferguson proposed 12 days after they met.  ‚ÄúWe met in London in the lobby of my hotel, and it was like we had known each other for 10 years,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe hung out all night, it was my last day in London, and he was like, ‚ÄòYou can‚Äôt go home.‚Äô And I didn‚Äôt get on my flight, and I stayed in London. Two days later, he quit his job and moved to America.‚Äù  While she found her dream dress, King hinted the pair had split following a cryptic Instagram post from March 28.  ‚ÄúGotta say ‚Ä¶ no matter how heartbreaking one day may be, it‚Äôs hard to not smile in this California sunshine,‚Äù she wrote.  Earlier this month, King penned a lengthy note detailing the importance of self-worth.  ‚ÄúBeen a really rough and insane start to this year,‚Äù King shared, along with a snapshot of her puppy. ‚ÄúLately I don‚Äôt cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She‚Äôs my best friend and the only true loyalty I‚Äôve ever known.  ‚ÄúToday someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself. But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don‚Äôt give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúAlways be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you‚Äôre beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness. Be safe. Be smart. Don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel fearful or small. Love yourself.‚Äù  A rep for King did not immediately return a request for comment."

"Though Brad Pitt hasn‚Äôt confirmed that he‚Äôs dating MIT professor Neri Oxman, the mere thought of him moving on reportedly sent a ‚Äòjealous‚Äô Angelina Jolie into a fit of rage!  Brad Pitt, 54, has reportedly struck up a relationship with renowned architect Neri Oxman, 42. While some of Brad‚Äôs friends, like George Clooney, 56, hope that this friendship leads to something more serious, the Fight Club actor‚Äôs ex, Angelina Jolie, 42, was furious to hear that Brad may be dating again.

"The custody battle between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie just heated up, with a judge ordering new restrictions for Jolie‚Äôs involvement in Pitt‚Äôs interaction with their six children.  According to court documents obtained by PEOPLE, Jolie could be in danger of losing primary custody of the children if she doesn‚Äôt take steps to improve their relationship with their father. A judge in the couple‚Äôs ongoing divorce case said in the documents that ‚Äúit is critical that each of [the six] children have a healthy and strong relationship with their father and mother,‚Äù and that Jolie must allow Pitt to maintain and repair that.  Family law attorney David Glass, who is not associated with the case, tells PEOPLE that it ‚Äúis extremely rare‚Äù to see a court intervene in this way, though they typically do so after extensive evaluation and to prevent children from being alienated from one parent.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Jason Merritt/Getty  ‚ÄúIt looks like what this judge was weighing was the difference between estrangement and alienation,‚Äù says Glass, who has not had access to the court documents. ‚ÄúThe difference there is, estrangement is when children aren‚Äôt connected to one of the parents, mainly because of something that parent did. So a hypothetical, if dad screams and yells at the kids and doesn‚Äôt treat them nicely, the kids stop wanting to see dad, that‚Äôs estrangement. An alienation refers to where children have been told by the other parent that the parent they‚Äôre not seeing is bad, or doesn‚Äôt like them, or doesn‚Äôt care about them. Just talking badly about the other parent and the kids start to internalize what the other parent is telling them. In alienation cases, kids will typically just repeat words that are beyond their years, or they will repeat reasons that they don‚Äôt possibly have access to the information.‚Äù  He adds: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a rare case where the court will find that someone alienated the kids. It takes a lot to move the court past estrangement into alienation, but once it‚Äôs determined that one parent is alienating the kids, the court has no choice but to jump in and make pretty strong orders right away.‚Äù  The judge also outlined specific steps Jolie should take to aid Pitt‚Äôs access to and relationship with the children, including a detailed summer visitation schedule, and easy phone access between Pitt and each of the kids, without monitoring or interference from their mom. Glass says that the goal of the new guidelines is to ‚Äútry to figure out what‚Äôs in the children‚Äôs best interest.‚Äù  Angelina Jolie, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt and Zahara Jolie-Pitt in 2018. Dia Dipasupil/FilmMagic  ‚ÄúThe schedule worked out by the court is the typical post-alienation reunification schedule,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou see them a couple hours a day and that starts leading to full days and eventually if things go well it leads to overnights, so you‚Äôre slowly acclimating the kids to the parent who‚Äôs been cut out of the kids lives.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is ‚Äòin a Better Place‚Äô Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source  According to the court documents, the kids have to continue to see their therapist with Pitt, which Glass says is a positive step.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the first good news, that the kids are in therapy and that dad is somehow involved in the therapy. That‚Äôs where the kids can work out whatever issues they have. It‚Äôs that continuing contact with dad ‚Ä¶ all those little pieces that eventually lead to some sort of reunification with their dad.‚Äù  Reps for both Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, have not yet responded to a request for comment.

"It is being reported that Australia is becoming the first nation in the world to begin microchipping its citizens. This surprising new development is the result of several years of a sustained propaganda that has actually led to Australian citizens voluntarily putting themselves forward for the controversial program.Australia is getting its citizens microchippedShanti Korporaal, who lives in the Australian city of Sydney has found herself at the center of headlines of the new venture after having implants surgically implanted in both of her hands. She says that she has no regrets about the procedure and that she encourages others to follow in her footsteps. The implants are fitted with a unique identifier which can be used to get through locked doors, to transfer personal information into devices and even connected to bank details. ""You could set up your life, so you never have to worry about any passwords or PINs, ""Korporaal told reporters when justifying her decision. Another anonymous individual who had also voluntarily undergone the procedure said that they had done it for the purpose of ‚Äòconvenience.'But while it may be convenient in the short-term, the long-term implications of having microchips implanted directly into the human body are terrifying. Modern technology has allowed the government and law enforcement agencies an almost unprecedented level of access to the details of the lives of ordinary citizens. In the United States, there are regular reports that indicate that law enforcement agencies such as the police and the FBI are already tracking cell phones without a warrant on a fairly routine basis. In addition to this, revelations by the whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the government is accessing and storing a vast amount of information about every single person, whether they are under suspicion or not, from their online devices.This means that civil liberties campaigners are deeply concerned about this burgeoning trend of microchipping which will essentially allow the government to have a permanent record of a citizen‚Äôs every movement and transaction. After all, the only way to remove a surgically implanted microchip is another painful operation. Civil liberties advocates are baffled by the way private citizens are actually volunteering to forego their privacy and security in such an intrusive manner."

"Tarek El Moussa and his ex-wife Christina have been making headlines due to their recent divorce, but one thing that Tarek doesn't have to worry about is money. The couple has also announced that they will continue to work together on their HGTV show Flip or Flop, which will only add to their hefty bank accounts. So just how much is Tarek El Moussa worth?  According to Celebrity Net Worth, Tarek had a net worth of $4 million while he was married to Christina, and The Huffington Post also noted that the couple's net worth was $4 million. While his accountant is the only one to know for sure, it would be safe to bet that he is still doing just fine financially after the divorce. Based on what they've made together on the show and his profits from his house flipping business, it's certainly no surprise to see Tarek has made so much over the years‚Äîbut it wasn't always like that for the couple.  In 2008, after the housing market crash, the then-couple had to move out of their lush house and move into a $700-per-month apartment to stay afloat, according to The Ocean County Register. They continued to work on their business and in 2011, Tarek and a close friend rented a video camera and filmed their own audition tape for an HGTV show. The video worked, and the El Moussas had their first season of 13 episodes OF Flip or Flop ordered.  On top of the money that they made from flipping the houses and selling them, the couple also made $10,000 per episode, according to The Ocean County Register. They are also co-producers on Chi-Town Flip, a Flip or Flop spin-off that takes follows husband and wife Bryan and Maria Segal in Chicago, Deadline notes.    After the divorce, Tarek purchased a 3,010-square-foot home for $2.28 million. He also recently rebranded his realtor business, Tarek & Associates, according to Realtor.com, where he continues to buy properties and flip them. He said that although Christina's name is not on the business anymore, he will still continue to work with her. Despite their split, the former power couple is certainly keeping the money rolling in."
"Like those holographic snakes that periodically go viral on Twitter, eye shadow palettes are simultaneously beautiful and terrifying things. The myriad of matte and metallic shades look stunning, but the thought of getting a selection of them onto lids without looking like a child's art project gone wrong can scare people away from them entirely. Without the right blending, the shadows could end up looking muddy, splotchy, patchy, or harsh. Cringe. The word ""blending"" in and of itself freaks some people out. Trust and believe that there's nothing to be afraid of. Unlike those holographic snakes, eye shadow doesn't have fangs.  I asked a handful of professional makeup artists to demystify eye shadow blending, and I swear blending is easier than it looks with their tips. You don't have to be giving celebrities perfectly diffused smoky eyes all day and all night to master the technique.  Before you do anything, though, don't do anything at all. If you ask Patrick Ta, a professional makeup artist who's worked with Gigi Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski, your eye makeup should be applied before the rest of your makeup. ""I always say to do your eyes first to avoid fall-out from your eye shadows,"" Ta tells Allure. ""If you prefer to do your face first, you can use Shadow Shields to avoid this as well.""  OK, now that we have that out of the way, here are five steps to eye shadow blending.  1. Prime for success.  If you're going to take the time out of your busy day to blend your shadow to perfection, you might as well smooth some eye shadow primer onto your lids to keep everything in place. Amy Strozzi, who's worked with Rowan Blanchard and Aly & AJ, tells Allure, ""I keep it closer to the lash line and fade it as I go upward so I have more flexibility to blend in the crease area."" Then let it dry for at least 10 seconds before moving on to the main event.  Need a primer rec? Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion is always a good choice. Allure editors also love Too Faced Shadow Insurance.  Primer isn't required for pro blending, though. Many makeup artists, like Mario Dedivanovic, would rather skip it. Instead, he prefers to tap leftover foundation or concealer onto lids to give the shadows some grip.  2. Pick your tools.  Depending on which makeup artist you ask, you're going to get a different answer for what the best blending brush is. Regardless, ""flawless eye shadow blending is all about brushes,"" says Giselle Ali, who's worked with SZA and Cynthia Erivo. ""You have to have the right tools for the job. You can never have enough blending brushes, but two is good to start with."" The key is to keep both of these clean. Don't dip these into your eye shadow pans. Instead, use a denser brush like the Best of Beauty Award‚Äìwinning E.L.F. Beautifully Precise Eyeshadow Brush No. 201 to lay down pigments before blending.  Ta swears by the Anastasia Beverly Hills A12 Small Contour Brush. Ali prefers the Sigma E40 Tapered Blending Brush.  Strozzi, on the other hand, has a completely different list of essentials. For blending powders all over the lid, the M.A.C. 224 Tapered Blending Brush is her ride-or-die. When focusing on the creases, she prefers the Smith Cosmetics 230 Quill Crease Brush. For cream shadows and powders that are on the denser side, she reaches for M.A.C.'s 234 Split Fibre Eye Blending Brush because ""one side is synthetic, which helps apply the product, and the other natural side is great for blending it out,"" she explains."
"CLOSE Actor Brian Dietzen weighs in on the impending departure of his ""NCIS"" co-star, popular actress Pauley Perrette. (Nov. 7) AP  Abby (Pauley Perrette) was seen hospitalized, and in imminent peril, after being shot in a street holdup in last week's 'NCIS' episode. (Photo: CBS)  Spoiler alert: If you haven't watched Tuesday's NCIS episode ""Two Steps Back,"" put your headphones on, crank up some Goth rock, refill your Caf-Pow cup and come back after you've seen it.  Leave it to NCIS forensics genius Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette) to solve what first appeared to be her own murder.  Tuesday's ""Two Steps Back,"" which marked the final episode for Perrette after 15 seasons and more than 350 episodes, opened with Abby on the verge of death after a suffering a gunshot wound during a street holdup at the end of last week's episode.  Moments later, it appeared she was dead, as medical examiner Ducky Mallard (David McCallum) approached a covered body on the exam table and spoke about performing an autopsy on a colleague.  But, in a big fakeout, it was Clayton Reeves (Duane Henry), the big-hearted NCIS colleague who was with Abby when she was robbed, who had been killed.  Investigate: The common thread connecting Pauley Perrette's favorite 'NCIS' episodes  More:Perrette says fans will need 'a couple boxes of tissues' for Abby's 'NCIS' exit  As team leader Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), special agent Tim McGee (Sean Murray) and Dr. Jimmy Palmer (Brian Dietzen) took turns standing vigil over a comatose Abby, her colleagues searched for the killer.  Blood found on Reeves led Gibbs and agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) to the home of the shooter. They found him murdered, along with evidence that he had been hired to kill Abby.  Since Abby's sleuthing skills had put so many bad guys away, there were many suspects to consider. The hit CBS drama took a trip down its own villainy lane, as agents interrogated embezzler Terry Spooner (from Season 3's ""Bloodbath,"" one of Perrette's favorite episodes) and Alejandro Rivera (seen in several episodes, starting with Season 10's ""Obsession""), a Mexican Justice Department official and brother of a drug lord.  NCIS team leader Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon) stands over Abby's hospital bed during Tuesday's episode of 'NCIS.' (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  Finally, the agents tracked down their man, former Marine Corps Sgt. Major Robert King (Peter Jason), who had tricked Abby into developing a bioweapon until she stopped him in 2009's ""Toxic.""  In the meantime, Abby's healing abilities appeared to be even more amazing than her scientific skills: She was out of her coma and back in her cool, Goth-inspired apartment ‚Äî the first time it had been seen on the show ‚Äî before the fourth commercial break, ready to help the investigation.  Abby, now working from a computer in her kitchen, figured out that last week's mysterious restaurant invitation, which she shared with Reeves, was planned by her assailant. She tracked King's computer to a public wi-fi system, but pulled a fast one on Gibbs & Co., sending them to the wrong address.  In one of TV's longest-running cliches, which finds the hero refusing backup to face a killer alone, Abby ‚Äî who had locked special agent Nick Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) in her coffin ‚Äî went to the real address and confronted King, who had put a hit on her after escaping prison. She told him she was tired of her heroes dying, listing former colleagues Caitlin Todd, Jenny Shepard, Ned Dorneget, Ziva David and Reeves, while villains survived.  A recuperating Abby (Pauley Perrette), left, wearing cool skull-and-crossbones pajamas, and NCIS agent Nick Torres (Wilmer Valderrama) search for the man behind a colleague's death in Abby's very Abby-like apartment. (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  As King prepared to leave, Abby told him she put cyanide in his coffee, offering an antidote if he confessed. It wasn't exactly a move that would stand up in court, but it worked. (It also wasn't cyanide, as Abby gave King crushed Caf-Pow pills to trigger a caffeine jolt.) Gibbs and Torres arrested King.  Later, Abby returned to her lab and surprised her colleagues ‚Äî minus Gibbs ‚Äî with news that she was leaving NCIS immediately to oversee the charity that Reeves planned to start in honor of his late mother.  They reluctantly accepted her decision, although Palmer, speaking for his colleagues and many fans, said: ""The thought of you not being here, I just can't imagine it.""  ""You guys are my family and this is my home, but you have to go with your gut and my gut is telling me I have to go,"" she explained. (Perrette announced she was leaving in October.)  Tearful hugs followed, with especially long embraces for McGee and Ducky. She left the tiniest hint of a return but may have been humoring McGee when she said, ""It's not goodbye for good. It's goodbye for now.""  Abby (Pauley Perrette), facing the camera, shares a goodbye hug with NCIS agent Ellie Bishop (Emily Wickersham) in Abby's and Perrette's final 'NCIS' episode. (Photo: Patrick McElhenney, CBS)  The episode featured flashbacks focusing on the almost father-daughter bond between Gibbs and Abby, but Harmon and Perrette never appeared together in Abby's finale.  Gibbs was seen solo and from behind in Abby's hospital room, but never face to face , and Abby said a heartfelt goodbye via a letter left at his door. The NCIS leader eventually spotted her from his window standing across the street and the two shared virtual hugs and spoke in sign language as the camera cut back and forth between them. It was an odd and unsatisfying goodbye after such a long, deep relationship.  Abby ended the episode in her true NCIS home, her lab, packing up some dolls and leaving a copy of Abby's Lab for Dummies for the next forensics specialist. Those will be some huge boots to fill.

"Satan is a misunderstood guy who has been judged on his outward appearance rather than by ‚Äúwhat he has to offer us as human beings‚Äù according to Miley Cyrus, who detailed her relationship with the devil in a Swedish radio interview.  Going as far as to claim that Satan is a ‚Äúreally nice guy‚Äú, the singer described Satan‚Äôs relationship with her as ‚Äúfatherly and nurturing‚Äù before stopping abruptly and asking the radio hosts, ‚ÄúYou guys are liberal, right? Uber liberal, right?‚Äú  After the hosts laughed and one of them said ‚ÄúErr, yeah, I guess you can call us that,‚Äù Cyrus laughed too and then admitted that ‚Äúsometimes he [Satan] can be a bit naughty too. He can be pervy. But that is natural. It‚Äôs only religious maniacs who see a problem with natural things.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI have reached the point where my relationship with him is stronger than my relationship with my earthly father,‚Äù Cyrus said, making reference to her biological father, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Asked how Billy Ray feels about ‚Äútaking a back seat to the devil‚Äú, Miley Cyrus said, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt feel anything, I don‚Äôt think so anyway. I haven‚Äôt asked. But it‚Äôs not like my relationship with anyone else takes away anything from my relationship with Dad. It‚Äôs just different.‚Äù  Cyrus also claimed that she receives guidance from Satan ‚Äúon a fairly regular basis.‚Äù Asked what kind of guidance, Cyrus said, ‚ÄúEveryday stuff. Normal stuff,‚Äù before explaining that Satan‚Äôs guidance is ‚Äúbetter than Jesus‚Äô guidance.‚Äú  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there, done that. Jesus is ok. He‚Äôs boring, you know? He gave Satan a bad rap. Jesus is the goody two shoes with no life. I prayed to Satan last Friday. I was in a foreign city, I barely knew anyone. He spoke to me quietly, prompting me to dress like a boy.  ‚ÄúI went out into the street dressed like a boy and I just walked and walked, following his whispers. I found myself in a dark alley by some kind of industrial area. Two big guys, rough guys you know, they suddenly appeared and I don‚Äôt know, I guess you‚Äôd call it rape. They took me forcefully. Yeah, it was painful. But to be totally honest, the whole experience was transcendental.  ‚ÄúIt was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When they were both finished, I started straight into their eyes and said ‚ÄúHail Satan‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure they understood but they appeared calmed by my words.‚Äù  Miley Cyrus‚Äôs Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. After starting her career with Disney, the pop star reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.  Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, the singer has attempted to tame her dark image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the Swedish radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly sold her soul to Satan.  The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting Satanism as a viable religious choice for those seeking spiritual guidance."

"Rihanna is killing the game right now. The pop star just launched her first makeup line, Fenty Beauty , her song with DJ Khaled, ""Wild Thoughts,"" is rocking the Billboard charts, and she's still hanging out with that Saudi billionaire she was first spotted kissing over the summer . (RiRi tried to hide him under an umbrella-ella last month , but the Internet wasn't fooled!) All of Rihanna's body-shamers need to sit down, because she's on top of the world.  But even though Rihanna is ubiquitous, there's still a lot we don't know about her‚Äîas this new interview with Elle proves. The singer covers several topics during her recent chat with the magazine‚Äîincluding why lipstick is her ""secret weapon""‚Äîbut the most interesting tidbit involves time travel.  One of Rihanna's friends, magician David Copperfield, asked her where she'd go if she was magically zapped anywhere in the world, and her answer was pretty surprising.  ""Ten minutes before I lost my virginity,"" Rihanna told Copperfield, who said that he actually can make her disappear and reappear any place on Earth. (Not sure if he was kidding or not.)  Interesting, right? There was no follow-up to this question. Rihanna didn't explain why she'd transport back to the day she lost her virginity or when exactly this was. It's a curious thought, though. Losing your virginity is typically a very awkward and vulnerable experience. I certainly wouldn't want to repeat that day‚Äîit seems like Rihanna might want to prevent it from happening altogether.  Leave it to Rihanna to give the most mysterious and intriguing answer to this question. Most people would've just said the Bahamas. OK, I would've said the Bahamas.

"CLOSE Barbara Pierce Bush, the former first lady, died at her Houston home Tuesday after a long struggle with congestive heart failure and pulmonary disease. The down-to-earth matriarch who saw both her husband and son win the White House, was 92. USA TODAY  Former first lady Barbara Bush (Photo: Tom Pennington, Getty Images)  Former first lady Barbara Bush, the wife of one president and mother of another, died Tuesday after deciding to discontinue medical treatment for her declining health.  Family spokesman Jim McGrath announced her death on Twitter at 6:37 p.m. CT: ""A former first lady of the United States of America and relentless proponent of family literacy, Barbara Pierce Bush passed away Tuesday, April 17, 2018 at the age of 92.""  Bush had made the decision to discontinue medical treatment for congestive heart failure and lung disease after consulting with her family and friends, McGrath announced Sunday. ""It will not surprise those who know her that Barbara Bush has been a rock in the face off her failing health, worrying not for herself ‚Äì thanks to her abiding faith ‚Äì but for others,"" he said.  With her iconic gray hair, quick wit and devotion to her husband of more than 70 years, she became the matriarch of one of the most influential political families of modern times.  Her husband George H.W. Bush, the nation‚Äôs 41st president from 1989-93, is now 93 years old and struggling with a Parkinson‚Äôs-like disease that forces him to use a wheelchair and has made it difficult for him to speak.  Her eldest son George W. Bush, now 71 and the nation's 43rd president, served two terms from 2001-09 and retired to Texas. His election made Barbara Bush the second woman in history to be both a wife and mother of presidents ‚Äî and the only one who lived to see both of them serve.  ""My dear mother has passed on at age 92,"" her president-son said in a statement. ""Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was.""  ""Barbara Bush was a fabulous first lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions. To us, she was so much more. Mom kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end. I‚Äôm a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother,"" he said.  Obituary: Barbara Bush, former first lady and matriarch of Bush family, dies at 92  As recently as 2014, Bush was tied with Hillary Clinton as the most popular first lady of the past 25 years, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found.  The Clintons remembered Bush Tuesday as a woman of ""grit and grace, brains and beauty.""  ""She was fierce and feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes,"" former president Bill Clinton said in a statement. ""She showed us what an honest, vibrant, full life looks like. Hillary and I mourn her passing and bless her memory.""  Throughout a long life in the public eye, Bush was a fierce advocate for her husband and sons, including former Florida governor and presidential candidate Jeb Bush.  She also defended them against detractors, from those who criticized her husband's decision to raise taxes in 1990 to those who opposed her son's decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003.  Bush championed the issue of literacy before, during and after her White House years. She formed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to fund programs that teach parents in low-income families to read and pass on a love of reading to their children.  ""If everyone could read and write, all the problems I worried about could be solved,"" she told USA TODAY in 2014. ""If you can't read, you can't do anything.""  President Trump called her ""an advocate for the American family.""  ""Amongst her greatest achievements was recognizing the importance of literacy as a fundamental family value that requires nurturing and protection,"" Trump said in a statement through the White House press office. ""She will be long remembered for her strong devotion to country and family, both of which she served unfailingly well ""  He ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff in her honor Saturday when Bush is to be buried at her husband's presidential library in College Station, Texas.  Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen sent their ""deepest sympathies,"" calling Bush ""a woman of unique strength and grace whose devotion to her family was an inspiration to every American.""  In her own words: Barbara Bush, from political prognostication to 'rhymes with rich'  Her nickname, ""the Silver Fox,"" hinted at both her grandmotherly image but also her behind-the-scenes power as an enforcer of family discipline.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clich√©, but not an exaggeration, to say Barbara Bush was the bulwark and foundation for the whole family,"" said Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University. ""She was the emotional core and the moral core. The family centered around her. The family may have worked through the achievements of the two President Bushes, but in a real sense it was built around her.""  She was 63 years old when her husband became president ‚Äî the second-oldest first lady in history.  In recent years, her health deteriorated along with her husband's. Both were hospitalized simultaneously ‚Äì Mrs. Bush with ""fatigue and coughing"" ‚Äì in the days leading up to President Trump's inauguration last year and were unable to attend.  Just this month, the former first lady wrote about her husband in a note for the spring edition of Smith College's alumnae magazine.  ""I am still old and still in love with the man I married 72 years ago,"" she wrote in the life updates section for the magazine.  A love story: Barbara Bush was 'still in love with the man I married 72 years ago'  Bush also revealed her secret for a long life: medical attention.  ""I have had great medical care and more operations than you would believe,"" she told the magazine. ""I'm not sure God will recognize me; I have so many new body parts!""  She continued: ""Also, George Bush has given me the world. He is the best ‚Äî thoughtful and loving.""  The couple met at a Christmas dance in 1941, when Barbara Pierce was 16 and George Bush was 17. They got engaged right before he left to fight in World War II as a Navy pilot. After he returned on leave, she dropped out of Smith College, and the two married in January 1945.  Smith College awarded Barbara Bush with an honorary degree in 1989.  More: Barbara Bush dies: President Trump and wife Melania praise former first lady  More: George W.

"Well, maybe I‚Äôm not into Bethenny this week, but I‚Äôm obviously into hard boiled eggs! Just make sure they don‚Äôt touch my two-egg scramble. I seem crazy, no? Clearly I‚Äôm not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it‚Äôs not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you‚Ä¶  Bethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn‚Äôt express any interest in going because she didn‚Äôt express any interest in having me go? I didn‚Äôt know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I‚Äôm saying how proud I am of her. Wow‚Ä¶at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It‚Äôs strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I‚Äôd asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.  On the other hand, I really don‚Äôt give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won‚Äôt bore you here recounting the endless places I‚Äôve been to or the stories I‚Äôve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people‚Äôs sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I‚Äôm not bragging ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt my prize ‚Äî but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it‚Äôs something.  I am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large ‚Äúget out the vote‚Äù campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know ‚Äî I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn‚Äôt end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs fully committed this season to talking about me as though I‚Äôm a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.  Maybe we‚Äôll find out next week. Pass the popcorn!"

"Jennifer Garner confronted Ben Affleck‚Äòs girlfriend Lindsay Shookus in person after she found out about their affair in 2015, sources tell PEOPLE.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today program, Prince Harry talked about spending the holidays with Markle and his family.  ""I think we've got one of the biggest families that I know of and every family is complex as well. She's done an absolutely amazing job, she's getting in there and it's the family that I suppose she never had.""  Hours after that interview aired, Markle's estranged half sister, Samantha Grant, took to twitter to respond to that particular comment.  Grant tweeted in part ""actually she has a large family who were always there with her and for her.""  Actually she has a large family who were always there with her and for her.

"Explosive US claims reveal that the 42 year old actress is getting serious with the mystery British millionaire she was linked to last year.    ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs a millionaire British philanthropist who she‚Äôs been quietly seeing for over a year now,‚Äù a friend of Ange‚Äôs spilled to Life & Style.    ‚ÄúGradually, their romance blossomed into real love.‚Äù    And they‚Äôre wasting no time taking their relationship to the next level, with the publication reporting that Ange is set to say ‚ÄòI do‚Äô to husband number four in London later this year.    So it comes as no surprise that the Maleficent star is pushing to finalise her divorce to Brad and moving their six kids ‚Äì Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine ‚Äì to the U.K in time for the wedding.      Life & Style  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs decided to marry her wealthy beau as soon as the ink is dry on the divorce from Brad.    ‚ÄúIn fact, Angie‚Äôs so in love that she was the one to propose.‚Äù    The British ceremony fits in perfectly with the busy actresses work schedule.    Maleficent 2 is set to start filming in London from April to August, and then Ange will be fulfilling her duties as a visiting professor at the London School of Economics.    And the kids couldn‚Äôt be happier to see their mum walk down the aisle again.    While Ange is no stranger to weddings ‚Äì she was married to Brit actor Jonny Lee Miller from 1995 ‚Äì 1997, Hollywood bad boy Billy Bob Thornton for two years in the early 2000‚Äôs, before tying the know with Brad in 2014 ‚Äì this time she‚Äôs convinced she‚Äôs found ‚ÄòThe One‚Äô.    ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs described her beau to friends as handsome, distinguished, bold, witty and one of the kindest souls she‚Äôs ever met,‚Äù continues the source.    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most unexpected relationship of Angelina‚Äôs life, but she thinks he‚Äôs the one person who was truly meant for her.‚Äù"
"Abby Lee Miller.  Almost a year after pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud, Dance Moms‚Äô Abby Lee Miller was sentenced Tuesday to a year and a day in prison by a federal judge in Pittsburgh, according to Deadline. She‚Äôll also have to pay a fine of $40,000, along with an additional $120,000 for a currency-reporting violation she was investigated for last summer. Miller filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and was first indicted in 2015 on 20 charges of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets, and false bankruptcy declarations. Her legal woes came to a head after federal agencies found evidence that she tried to hide $775,000 in income from Dance Moms, the spinoff Abby‚Äôs Ultimate Dance Competition, and other Dance Moms‚Äìrelated appearances and merchandise.  In Tuesday‚Äôs hearing, character witnesses said Miller isn‚Äôt anything like the combative and demanding dance instructor she was portrayed as on the Lifetime show. Afterward, Miller took the stand to defend herself, saying, ‚ÄúDance Moms became a hit and I became the laughingstock of reality TV.‚Äù Miller will likely serve nine months in a facility close to Los Angeles, and have an additional two years of supervised release. Miller‚Äôs charges carried up to $5 million in fines and possibly five years in jail, but the Feds initially pushed for a two-and-half-year prison sentence. Miller has 45 days to report to prison."
"It‚Äôs become difficult to listen to that hard-charging ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù theme without hearing Michael Bolton strain-crooning about Captain Jack Sparrow (‚Äúthe jester of Tartuga!‚Äù) for the Lonely Island guys in that memorable ‚ÄúSNL‚Äù digital short. Then again, the ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù franchise itself has always seemed like an unlikely mash-up of outlaw posture and pop silliness, eschewing any real sense of seagoing adventure for the more readily achievable goals of brand management and CGI swash and buckle.  The good news, though, is that the fifth entry, ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,‚Äù is the most divertingly enjoyable since the first. A professionally crafted brew of action, slapstick and supernatural mumbo-jumbo, it‚Äôs less likely to spur timepiece glances than did the last few bloated installments.  You can‚Äôt escape the sense that the whole thing, newly steered by the Norwegian directing team of Joachim R√∏nning and Espen Sandberg (Oscar nominees for 2012‚Äôs ‚ÄúKon-Tiki‚Äù), is a cheeky corrective. Though not as resolutely tipped toward weirdness as Gore Verbinski‚Äôs sequels were, it‚Äôs neither as overstuffed with the nonsense that sunk ‚ÄúDead Man‚Äôs Chest‚Äù and ‚ÄúAt World‚Äôs End.‚Äù It‚Äôs also not as zipless and personality-free as the last one, the Rob Marshall-helmed ‚ÄúOn Stranger Tides,‚Äù which couldn‚Äôt justify its existence, stumbling around as much as the series‚Äô anti-hero, Captain Jack.  Watch Video: Keira Knightley Returns in New 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales' Trailer  And speaking of Johnny Depp‚Äôs scoundrel of self-preservation, his tipsy-turvy antics may no longer be the freshly perfumed brine that subversively pickled what we all assumed was a craven theme-park movie (‚ÄúThe Curse of the Black Pearl‚Äù), turning it into a surprise hit. But with the popcorn ethos that animates ‚ÄúDead Men Tell No Tales,‚Äù he‚Äôs at least treated like a reliably wiggly wind-up toy again, good for batting about, arranging into crazy positions, and countless batted-eyes double takes mixed with sloshy, cynical one-liners.  When Jack opines on ‚Äúthe unscratchable itch‚Äù to his young sailor companion Henry (Brenton Thwaites, ‚ÄúGods of Egypt‚Äù), newly smitten by a beautiful astronomer named Carina (a plucky Kaya Scodelario, ‚ÄúThe Maze Runner‚Äù), Henry knowingly agrees: love, right? Jack, confused, corrects him: ‚ÄúScabies.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt searing wit, obviously, but coming amidst a thrillingly crazy ghost-shark attack and a beach siege by rotting pirates, it‚Äôs all just off-kilter enough to feel like a disreputably fun carnival ride.  Also Read: Why 'Pirates of the Caribbean 5' Could Break $1 Billion Despite Flat US Debut  The plot, such as it is in the screenplay by Jeff Nathanson (who wrote the story with franchise stalwart Terry Rossio), follows the pattern of the others: intersecting quests that allow for narrow escapes, odd alliances, and parental reunions. Henry wants to lift the curse on his father Will Turner (Orlando Bloom, back briefly), trapped at the bottom of the ocean in the Flying Dutchman, by finding the all-powerful Trident of Poseidon.  Carina, deemed a witch due to her intelligence, says she can find the Trident using ‚Äúthe map no man can read,‚Äù a reference to the use of stars to guide ships. They team with Jack, smarting from having lost the trust of his crew after a foiled bank robbery (an impressive opening action sequence in which a bank building is hauled through St. Martin).  Jack‚Äôs reasons for locating the Trident are personal, however: he‚Äôs become the target of a ghost captain named Salazar (a digitally decayed Javier Bardem), recently unleashed from the Devil‚Äôs Triangle and hellbent on securing revenge on the then-newbie buccaneer who vanquished him. Salazar‚Äôs murderous rampage against pirates ‚Äî his risen, rotted ship forming jaws that chomp other vessels ‚Äî even spurs the return of Geoffrey Rush‚Äôs peg-legged scalawag Barbossa to help defend against this newest threat.  READ MORE See Johnny Depp's latest POWER MOVE. PowerRank: 432  The appeal of any ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù movie is in the aggregate gleam of its many working parts, and this time around, thanks to the energetic direction of R√∏nning and Sandberg, the shine feels freshly buffed. There‚Äôs a dual guillotine/hanging rescue that‚Äôs as humorously staged as any in the series‚Äô history; it calls to mind the inventive dash of silent comedy. The elaborate location trappings (ships at sea, island shores, bustling cities) veer between baroquely beautiful and picturesquely lush thanks to Paul Cameron‚Äôs colorful cinematography, and unlike the relentlessly dreary night in ‚ÄúOn Stranger Tides,‚Äù it‚Äôs all mostly daytime-set this time around.  The regular houseguests ‚Äî from Depp and Rush to utility pirate players like Stephen Graham ‚Äî look game again, while a newcomer like Bardem seems hungry to make his mark and scare the bejesus out of any kids in tow. (Between the sword deaths and the Oscar-winner‚Äôs terrifying countenance, this is most decidedly a hard PG-13, parents.) We even get a suitable rock-world replacement for Keith Richards this time around: a delightfully funny Paul McCartney as Jack‚Äôs cheerily philosophical, imprisoned pirate uncle.  If you have ‚ÄúPirates‚Äù PTSD, though, discovering the Trident is likely to give you endless-climax hives, and ‚ÄúDead Men‚Äù doesn‚Äôt disappoint, devolving into the usual over-the-top CGI operatics. (For starters, the ocean parts.) Afterward, a human-sized surprise is revealed, and it‚Äôs easily guessable who‚Äôs going to show up, considering Henry‚Äôs lineage.  And yet the best thing one can say about ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales‚Äù is that it needs no referential callbacks to be its own admirably playful splash in the summer tentpole waters."
"Although the leading causes of chronic kidney disease are mainly diabetes or high blood pressure, other related conditions, such as Lupus, can also impact the kidneys. Kidneys play a critical role in the body‚Äîacting as the body's filtering system, removing wastes, and controlling blood pressure--and once they fail dialysis or a kidney transplant are needed just to stay alive.NKF CEO, Kevin Longino, said, ‚ÄúKidney disease has been part of my own life for as long as I can remember, affecting three generations of my family. I am alive today because of the kidney transplant I received 13 years ago from an anonymous deceased donor‚Äîand there isn‚Äôt a day that goes by when I do not give thanks to the family who, despite their tragic loss, allowed me to live.I would like to extend my heartfelt support to Selena as she continues her journey towards kidney health. Finding a match is not easy; and I am sure she feels immensely blessed and grateful to her dear friend, Francia Raisa for the gift of life. To all of us, she is nothing short of a hero.‚ÄùThere are currently more than 100,000 people on the kidney transplant wait list ‚Äìand the average wait time is long, three to five years or longer. But many kidney patients never get a transplant because they are afraid to ask their family members and friends for help. National Kidney Foundation can help people start the conversation through a special free program called The Big Ask: The Big Give . Our goal is to get as many people off the waiting list as possible and help all of them find a second chance at life.Ms. Gomez‚Äôs brave public acknowledgement of the battle she‚Äôs been privately facing, and the gift of life she received, will give strength to others to do the same."
"Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy ‚Äî especially male hypocrisy.  [ Read Louis C.K.‚Äôs statement: ‚ÄúThese stories are true‚Äù ]  After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct ‚Äî encounters that took place over a decade ago ‚Äî Louis C.K.‚Äôs publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. ‚ÄúLouis is not going to answer any questions,‚Äù Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.  Neither Louis C.K. nor Mr. Kay replied to follow-up emails in which the accusations were laid out in detail, or to voice messages or texts. On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.‚Äôs new movie ‚ÄúI Love You, Daddy,‚Äù was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on ‚ÄúThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.‚Äù  The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act ‚Äî an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In ‚ÄúI Love You, Daddy,‚Äù which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.  At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.‚Äôs manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.‚Äôs manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he ‚Äúnever threatened anyone.‚Äù"

"Selena On Going To Rehab For Psychiatric Treatment: ‚ÄúYou have no idea how incredible it felt to just be with six girls, real people who couldn‚Äôt give two s**ts about who I was, who were fighting for their lives.

I grew up around adults, but in terms of getting out, having friends. At times I really didn‚Äôt know anything but my job‚Ä¶ My mom gave up her whole life for me.

Maybe two are famous‚Ä¶ As soon as I became the most followed person on Instagram, I sort of freaked out. It had become so consuming to me. It‚Äôs what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict, and it felt like I was seeing things I didn‚Äôt want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn‚Äôt want to care about. I always end up feeling like shit when I look at Instagram.

"Jennifer Aniston has confessed she still loves Brad Pitt and was 'shocked' and 'hurt' to see pictures of him with new love Angelina Jolie.  ""Am I lonely? Yes,"" she told Vanity Fair magazine. ""Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I've thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely. But I'm also doing really well.""  The 36-year-old talks openly about her pain over the split for the first time and shed tears when confronted with the possibility that Pitt and his Mr and Mrs Smith co-star might start their own family.  ""I'd be a robot if I said I didn't feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,"" she said.  Aniston freely admits that when pictures surfaced of the couple on holiday together with Jolie's young son, Maddox, it was ""not one of the highlights"" of her year.  But she added: ""You joke and say, 'What doesn't kill you makes you stronger'.""  It only got worse when the two posed as man and wife for a magazine spread, a decision Aniston described as 'odd timing'.  ""There's a sensitivity chip that's missing (from Pitt),"" she said. ""But it's not my life. He makes his choices. He can do - whatever. We're (soon to be) divorced and you can see why.""  'Lonely and confused'  Although the estranged pair no longer talk, Aniston said she had chosen to believe Pitt, 41, when he said he did not sleep with Jolie before their marriage fell apart in January.  ""I just don't know what happened,"" she said. ""There's a lot I don't understand, a lot I don't know, and probably never will know, really.  ""I choose to believe my husband. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised by anything, but I would much rather choose to believe him.""  Her best friend and Friends co-star, Courteney Cox, joined in to reveal that although there was no affair, ""there was a connection"" between Jolie and Pitt, ""and he was honest about that with Jen.""  Aniston said the rumours that the couple had split because she did not want children had made her fume.  ""I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children,"" she raged. ""I did, and I do, and I will!""  Despite her pain, Aniston cannot switch off her feelings.  ""I love Brad,"" she told the September edition of the magazine. ""I will love him for the rest of my life. I really do hope that someday we can be friends again."""

"(CNN) The biggest misconception surrounding the special counsel probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election is that it will likely end in some sort of legal proceeding involving President Donald Trump. It won't -- for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn't seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.  The much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall ‚Äî and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means ‚Äî and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months ‚Äî that, ultimately, this isn't a legal fight, it's a public relations one.  Giuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN's Alisyn Camerota. ""I'll be here with my version of the report and they'll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it,"" Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.  ""My version"" vs. ""their version."" What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the ""versions"" will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other ""version"" will be Giuliani's cable TV appearances and President Trump's tweets.  That is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion -- particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump's side."
"What happens when a prince interviews a president? Well, if this teaser of Britain‚Äôs Prince Harry interviewing former US president Barack Obama is anything to go by, the answer is a lot of fun.  On Prince Harry‚Äôs request, Barack Obama agreed to star in a guest edition of BBC Radio 4‚Äôs Today programme. Kensington Palace shared the trailer on Sunday,where Harry can be seen joking with Obama.  In the preview, Obama asks Harry if he has to speak quickly, since he is a slow speaker. ‚ÄúDo I need a British accent?‚Äù jokes Obama.  In turn, Harry tells the former president that if he takes long pauses between answers, he will get ‚Äúthe face‚Äù.  ‚ÄúLet me see the face‚Äù, asks Obama, leading Prince Harry to pull an exaggerated mock-grimace. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see that face,‚Äù the former president says.

Listen to the full interview on 27th December on @BBCr4today. pic.twitter.com/p5I1dUdyhx ‚Äî Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) December 17, 2017  The trailer also shows Prince Harry saying that while Obama is excited, he is feeling nervous. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll interview you if you want,‚Äù says Obama. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep it this way, I‚Äôd much prefer that,‚Äù replies Harry.  Harry and Obama are known for their rapport and their very public exchanges of sassy banter.

Invictus Games is a Paralympic sporting event for injured or sick armed forces personnel, that was found by Prince Harry in 2014.

"Slow Hands is a song recorded by Irish singer and songwriter Niall Horan, released as a single on 4 May 2017 by Capitol Records.[2] The song was written by Horan, Alexander Izquierdo, John Ryan, Julian Bunetta, Ruth Anne Cunningham and Tobias Jesso Jr., while the production was handled by Bunetta.[3] It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 9 May 2017[4] as the second single from Horan's debut solo album Flicker (2017).  ""Slow Hands"" peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Horan's highest-charting single in those countries.  Background and composition [ edit ]  Prior to its release, Horan discussed the song in an interview with Mikey Piff on Sirius XM. The singer said that after listening to some of the material he had recorded for his debut album, he wanted to add ""a bit more grit, funk and heavier bass."" At the time he was listening to late 1970s and early 1980s music. ""When Don Henley went solo in the early eighties, he just kinda had this funky kind of feel to it ‚Äì heavy bass, heavy guitar ‚Äì so I just thought, 'Let's give this a crack,'"" Horan said of making the track. ""I wanted it to be a little bit cheeky with the lyric."" About the concept, he explained it is set in a bar and the song's theme changes up stereotypical roles. ""The first line is...'we should take this back to my place' ‚Äì and usually that's what the guy would say, but we flipped it that the girl would say that, and that's what she said right to my face.""[5][6]  ""Slow Hands"" is a bass-heavy funk-pop song, with Horan singing in a lower register.[5][7] A Billboard writer described it as an ""R&B-inflected rock tune.""[8]  Critical reception [ edit ]  In Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted ""Slow Hands"" focuses on a ""funkier guitar vibe"", compared to Horan's previous single ""This Town."" She also opined ""the subtly-sexy song"" shows an ""edgier side of Niall.""[9] Colin Stutz from the publication, added, ""The combination of a thumping beat and Horan's raspy vocals makes the song hardly even sound like the same guy who sang [""This Town""]. But what ""Slow Hands"" shows is that Horan definitely won't just be sticking to the sweet singer-songwriter sound on his solo debut.""[6] Rolling Stone's Althea Legaspi also noted Horan ""goes for a more muted sound. Above a stomp-and-clap beat and muted guitar, Horan allows his lower register to showcase his more seductive side on the track.""[5]  In The Irish Times, Jennifer Gannon wrote that ""it‚Äôs no radical departure, Niall hasn‚Äôt decided to go Gaga but it‚Äôs a step in a more Sheeran-style, crowd-pleasing direction. A gentle, foot-stomper about a lady with a magic touch, a lady who knows what she wants, she wants to get her hands all over Niall's ""dirty laundry"" and not in a bringing your washing home on a Sunday way. This isn‚Äôt Timberlake‚Äôs Sexy Back, it‚Äôs Horan‚Äôs Sweaty Back.""[10]  Billboard's critics' list placed it second on ""Every One Direction Solo Single, Ranked"" in May 2017, stating that the ""secret"" highlight ""[is] the way Niall's vocal on the first verse is ever so discretely chopped on the recording to a clipped staccato, a mysterious move that forces the singer into a less-is-more delivery that ends up being much more indeed.""[11]  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Slow Hands"" charted within the top 10 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single became his second top 20 entry as a solo artist on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 11 and surpassing his preceding single ""This Town"", which reached number 20. On 15 September 2017, the single was certified Platinum for combined sales and streaming equivalent units of over a million units in the United States. On the chart dated 7 October 2017, the single reached number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[12] As of December 2017, it has sold one million copies in the US.[13]  Live performances [ edit ]  Horan has performed ""Slow Hands"" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[14][15] On 29 May 2017, the singer performed ""Slow Hands"", ""This Town"" and premiered the track ""On the Loose"" on The Today Show.[16] On 4 June 2017, Horan performed the song during the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.[17] On 5 June he performed on BBC One's The One Show.[18] The singer also performed ""Slow Hands"" at the Capital FM's Summertime Ball 2017.[19]  On 22 June 2018, Horan performed the song with American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, at the first London show of her Reputation Stadium Tour at Wembley Stadium, as a surprise guest.

"Actor tells Stephen Colbert on The Late Show he ‚Äòcouldn‚Äôt be happier‚Äô to resume 007 role despite previous comments  He once said he would rather take his own life than reprise his role as 007. But Daniel Craig may now be regretting his words, as he has confirmed he will, for one final time, play James Bond.  Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on US TV on Tuesday night, the actor finally put an end to the long-running saga of will he/won‚Äôt he play the character for a fifth time.  ‚ÄúI have been quite cagey about it. I have been doing interviews all day and people have been asking me and I think I‚Äôve been rather coy. But kind of felt like if I was going to speak the truth I should speak truth to you.‚Äù  Asked by Colbert directly whether he could deliver some ‚Äúgood news‚Äù about returning as Bond, Craig finally replied: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  He revealed he had known for a ‚Äúcouple of months‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been discussing it, we‚Äôve just been trying to figure things out. I always wanted to, I needed a break.‚Äù  However, he was keen to reiterate it would indeed be his last outing as the lothario spy. ‚ÄúI think this is it. I just want to go out on a high note and I can‚Äôt wait,‚Äù he said.  It is not surprising news, as his return was first reported in July. However, Craig‚Äôs renewed enthusiasm for the role marks a change of mind after comments he made in 2015, following the release of Spectre.  Edan Clay (@EdanClay) Thank f*cking GAWD! Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!  Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather ‚Äúslit my wrists‚Äù than reprise the role.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm over it at the moment. We‚Äôre done. All I want to do is move on,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúIf I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.‚Äù  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. ‚ÄúInstead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,‚Äù he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (¬£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.  Say never again: why Daniel Craig should quit while he's ahead as Bond Read more  Neither ‚Äì should they both happen ‚Äì will be directed by Sam Mendes, who, despite the critical and commercial success of Spectre and its predecessor, Skyfall, has ruled himself out of returning. Directors rumoured to be in the running include Christopher Nolan.  Thanks to Craig‚Äôs reticence to return to the franchise, speculation over who could replace him has raged for two years, with figures such as Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner and even Gillian Anderson all put forward as suggestions. Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I‚Äôve not even played the role,‚Äù he said in 2015. ‚ÄúEnough is enough. I can‚Äôt talk about it any more.‚Äù  Craig succeeded Pierce Brosnan as Bond and made his debut in Casino Royale in 2006. While initially seen as a divisive choice, he was soon praised for his darker, more brooding take on the martini-sipping spy, which proved a massive hit at the box office, with the Observer film critic Mark Kermode describing him as the ‚Äúbest screen Bond to date‚Äù.  Skyfall was one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 2012, and was the first Bond film to gross over $1bn at the box office. 2015‚Äôs Spectre, which was described by the Guardian‚Äôs Peter Bradshaw as ‚Äúterrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure‚Äù cost $245m to make ‚Äì the most expensive Bond film to date ‚Äì but was also box office gold, taking in $880m worldwide.  Craig has not been solely negative about the impact playing Bond has had on his life, and said he did not worry about being typecast because the role had ‚Äúchanged my working life in an incredible way‚Äù.  dani ‚ú® (@boldlygaying) DANIEL CRAIG CONFIRMED HES BACK AS BOND FOR 2 MORE MOVIES!!!! pic.twitter.com/IbxevPJLZd  He added: ‚ÄúThere are more opportunities. I could do many, many things. But it takes an awful amount of time. If anything, the restriction is that it is incredibly time-consuming. That‚Äôs the restriction.‚Äù  The producers are also rumoured to be determined to bring back Adele to record the theme tune, after her song written for Skyfall became the first 007 theme to win a Grammy and a Golden Globe award.  The next Bond film, the 25th in the series, is scheduled for release in November 2019."
"As has become a tradition for Ryan Murphy programming, the day has finally come ‚Äî FX promotional materials aside ‚Äî that we can gaze upon the actors he‚Äôs hired to portray historical figures for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. Since the world can only handle so much suspense in being exposed to Pen√©lope Cruz‚Äôs bleach-blonde Donatella, we put together side-by-side comparisons of Versace‚Äôs actors and their real-life counterparts to give you a taste of what‚Äôs to come, as well as some historical information to appraise you on who‚Äôs who. Knowledge is power, readers!  Darren Criss as Andrew Cunanan  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  Cunanan, a gay gigolo with a genius-level IQ who lived his formative years in California, is known to have murdered at least five people throughout his 1997 killing spree, which began with his murder of an acquaintance in Minneapolis. Cunanan is believed to have suffered from antisocial personality disorder, which in turn made him ‚Äúcrave the limelight and aspire to the top, whether through charm or falsehood,‚Äù according to Vanity Fair‚Äôs Maureen Orth. Eight days after killing Versace, he committed suicide on a houseboat in Miami.  Edgar Ram√≠rez as Gianni Versace  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  At the time of his death, the Versace empire had amassed a reputation as one of the most innovative and popular fashion houses in the world, during which time Gianni also absorbed a devoted celebrity clientele. (‚ÄúA good designer must cultivate himself. Read, absorb everything,‚Äù he once told Charlie Rose in an interview. ‚ÄúTo be superficial, you have to be profound.‚Äù) He was also open about his sexuality, becoming one of the first prominent celebrities to reveal he was gay in the ‚Äô80s. He was 50 years old when murdered by Cunanan.  Pen√©lope Cruz as Donatella Versace  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  While Donatella is now known as the spunky HBIC and artistic director of Versace, things were different back in 1997. At the time of her brother‚Äôs murder, she was running her own diffusion label of the brand, Versus Versace, which was created specifically for her by Gianni. Upon his death ‚Äî which she did not witness ‚Äî Donatella was given full creative control of the Versace brand, eventually guiding it through numerous iconic and memorable collections throughout her continuing tenure. She‚Äôs rarely spoken about Gianni, though she spoke to the Guardian about him on the 20th anniversary of his death. ‚ÄúWhen my brother was murdered, I had the eyes of the whole world on me and 99 percent of them thought I wasn‚Äôt going to make it,‚Äù she said in part. ‚ÄúAnd maybe I thought the same, at first. My brother was the king, and my whole world had crashed around me.‚Äù In the days following his murder, Donatella and most of the Versace family retreated to a private Caribbean resort due to safety concerns.  Ricky Martin as Antonio D‚ÄôAmico  Photo: FX Networks/Getty  D‚ÄôAmico, an Italian model and fashion designer for Versace Sport, was Gianni‚Äôs companion for 15 years. He was eating breakfast inside the Miami mansion when the murder occurred, later describing how he fell into a deep depressive state in the subsequent years. ‚ÄúI had never been through a depression and never saw a therapist as I was advised to: why did I need to tell someone else what had happened when I knew I was this way because Gianni‚Äôs death had torn me in two?‚Äù he recently told the Guardian in a rare interview. ‚ÄúI was in a nightmare, I felt nothing and gave no importance to anything ‚Ä¶ the house, the money ‚Ä¶ because it felt false to have expectations of life.‚Äù D‚ÄôAmico has been living a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù life in the Italian countryside with his new long-term partner for several years now.  Mike Farrell as Lee Miglin  Photo: Getty Images  Miglin ‚Äî a real-estate mogul based in Chicago, who rose from a poor background to achieve his success ‚Äî was the third victim of Cunanan‚Äôs murder spree prior to Versace‚Äôs murder. The extremely gruesome May 1997 crime scene, which was widely covered at the time by the Chicago Tribune, was described as a murder ‚Äúthat would be considered vicious in any Chicago neighborhood, let alone the city‚Äôs most expensive.‚Äù The Miglin family has repeatedly denied that Lee, or anyone else in the extended family circle, ever had a personal connection to Cunanan.  Judith Light as Marilyn Miglin  Photo: FX Networks/HSN  A former dancer who built a beauty empire at the Home Shopping Network, Miglin was married to her husband, Lee, for nearly 40 years. She has rarely spoken about her husband in the years since his murder, with her only substantial interview appearing in the Chicago Tribune a year after Lee‚Äôs death. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you heal ‚Äî you never close up that gaping wound ‚Äî but you adjust,‚Äù she said at the time. ‚ÄúI lived the life of a fairy princess and I had a prince for 38 years, and then one day my prince went to war and didn‚Äôt come back.‚Äù Miglin‚Äôs products on HSN continue to be wildly popular."

"The concert, part of ‚ÄúThe Joshua Tree Tour,‚Äù was slated to take place at The Dome at America‚Äôs Center. But this morning, the band and the concert promoter ‚Äúregrettably‚Äù released a joint statement saying, ‚ÄúWe have been informed by the St. Louis Police Department that they are not in a position to provide the standard protection for our audience as would be expected for an event of this size. We have also been informed that local crowd security personnel would not be at full capacity. In light of this information, we cannot in good conscience risk our fans‚Äô safety by proceeding with tonight‚Äôs concert. As much as we regret having to cancel, we feel it is the only acceptable course of action in the current environment.‚Äù  Fans are reacting after U2 canceled its St. Louis concert amid protests in the city. On Friday, activists began demonstrating after Jason Stockley, a white police officer, was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, who is black. While people are protesting both the verdict and police use of deadly force, cops are on the streets monitoring the demonstrations. Consequently, U2 and Live Nation says there is not enough security to hold their Saturday night show as scheduled.  {""position1"": {""artist"": {""bio"": """", ""id"": 970, ""name"": ""U2""}, ""catalog_type"": ""artist"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 970, ""name"": ""U2"", ""related"": [{""bio"": """", ""id"": 1648, ""name"": ""Coldplay""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 26291, ""name"": ""Simple Minds""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 4829, ""name"": ""INXS""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 39703, ""name"": ""The Cranberries""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 6765, ""name"": ""Pearl Jam""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 4688, ""name"": ""The Police""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 32153, ""name"": ""The Cure""}], ""tagged"": false, ""type"": ""catalog""}}  Nothing was said about rescheduling the show, and fans will be able to get refunds. The protests, which are ongoing, have so far led to more than 20 arrests, and 10 police officers were reportedly injured on Friday night, though many, of course, are also demonstrating peacefully. And on Twitter, a number of people are sounding off on the decision to cancel the concert. A user with the handle @DrunkRedbirdFan, for instance, posted, ‚ÄúU2 canceling? They could have used the platform to bring unity and hope to a city and country that needs it. #U2 #STLVerdict.‚Äù  @Mina_UK said, ‚ÄúBono‚Äôs a social activist. I hope @U2 comes out to support those in the STL community hurting from the decision. #onelove #carryeachother.‚Äù @yrofcreation posted, ‚ÄúU2 concert canceled in #STL tonight. The #STLVerdict just got real for a bunch of white people. #Stockley #resist.‚Äù @charlesjaco1 observed, ‚ÄúU2 cancels tonight‚Äôs St Louis concert b/c not enough cops to provide proper security. The same cops whose actions sparked the protests.‚Äù  @RachWhittBarnes tweeted to the group, ‚Äú@U2 Since you‚Äôre free tonight, I hope you‚Äôll join in the protest at 5pm downtown. I‚Äôm sad to miss a show, but this is more important.‚Äù @isk9 argued, ‚ÄúPeople in St. Louis are b**ching because U2 canceled their show tonight? Get over yourselves, a cop got away with murder. Be pissed at that.‚Äù Still, others were dealing with logistical issues. @sparks4kids told the band, ‚ÄúWe never received an email from Ticketmaster saying show was canceled but did receive an email about which entrance to use. #u2Stlouis.‚Äù @atu2comSherry also pointed out, ‚Äú@Ticketmaster needs to catch up w/U2‚Äôs cancellation announcement ‚Äì it seems tix holders haven‚Äôt been directly notified.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFeel just awful for all the #u2fam missing out on the gig In StLouis. Especially ones that this was only show. But #u2 had no choice,‚Äù commented @thedoorsdf71. @MeganClontz17 shared, ‚ÄúSorry that this had to happen for those of you planning on going. I was gonna see @HunterHayes in 2014 but he canceled because of Ferguson.‚Äù And @theHorizon74 stated, ‚ÄúI understand the decision totally! I‚Äôm so sorry for all the fans‚Ä¶.but safety first! Be careful.‚Äù U2 is pictured above at a Detroit concert earlier this month.  See the tweets below."
"Eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Ryan Gosling closed out his gig as host for the season 43 premiere of Saturday Night Live wearing a graphic shirt bearing the image of his dog, George. As it turns out, there was quite a sentimental reason before the sartorial statement. Appearing on Ellen yesterday, Gosling confirmed that the beloved canine had recently passed away at the age of seventeen. ""He was a good friend to me,"" Gosling told Ellen Degeneres during the sit-down. ""There was something about George where he always‚ÄîI think he felt being a dog was beneath him. He would not do tricks. if you wanted him to sit down you would have to convince him that it was in his best interest.""  Fans of the actor will be familiar with just how close the pair were‚ÄîGeorge even appeared alongside Gosling during an appearance on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few years back. Gosling took Friday's stint on Ellen to share some of his other favorite memories of the canine.

"In Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot found the role model she'd always wanted to play.  The DC superhero movie star was presented the second ever #SeeHer Award at the Critics' Choice Awards on Thursday, which honors more accurate portrayals of women in film. Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins presented Gadot with the award, who went on to address Time's Up and the current movement of women speaking out with their stories of sexual harassment and called for more women leading films -- and in the director's chair.  ""Throughout my career, I was asked to describe my dream role, and it was clear to me that I wanted to play a strong and independent woman. A real one,"" the Israeli actress shared. ""When I started acting, there were very few female-led movies and even fewer female directors.""  ""In the past weeks and months, we've been witnessing a movement within our industry and society,"" Gadot continued. ""We will band together to make strides, uniting for equality.""  Gadot follows in the footsteps of Viola Davis, who won the first award at last year's show.  Watch the video below for more of what Gadot has said about the Time's Up initiative.

"Ivanka Trump revealed in a new interview that she was caught off guard by the ‚Äúlevel of viciousness‚Äù that she and her family have faced in Washington, D.C., since her father, Donald Trump, was elected president.  ‚ÄúIt is hard and there is a level of viciousness that I was not expecting,‚Äù the first daughter, 35, said on Fox News‚Äô Fox & Friends on Monday, June 12. ‚ÄúI was not expecting the intensity of this experience. But this isn‚Äôt supposed to be easy. My father, and this administration, expects to be transformative.‚Äù  Ivanka continued, ‚ÄúI think some of the distraction and some of the ferocity I was a little blindsided by on a personal level. But for me, I‚Äôm trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise and just work really hard to make a positive impact in the lives of many people.‚Äù  The businesswoman was asked how the president, 70, felt after watching former FBI Director James Comey‚Äòs Senate testimony last week. ‚ÄúMy father felt very vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels incredibly optimistic,‚Äù Ivanka said. (Trump abruptly fired Comey in May amid the FBI‚Äôs investigation into whether Russia interfered with the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.)  ‚ÄúWe are really focused on why the American people elected Donald Trump as their president,‚Äù the fashion designer added.  During Monday‚Äôs interview, Ivanka also shut down reports that her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, was involved in palace intrigue. ‚ÄúThere is a 24-hour news cycle that gets fed by and is encouraged by lots of salacious details,‚Äù Ivanka said. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, we are all focused on the work, and that‚Äôs very true for Jared. He is somebody who just likes to get things done. So, he doesn‚Äôt get involved in all that.‚Äù  An Ivanka source recently told Us Weekly that the former model and Kushner, 36, often go toe-to-toe with the commander in chief. ‚Äú[They] are a big influence on Donald and sometimes he takes other opinions into account and does something they disagree with,‚Äù the insider exclusively told Us.

"Talk about a True transformation! Khlo√© Kardashian says she has lost 33 lbs in the three months since she gave birth to daughter True, her first child, on April 12.  In a post on her official app, the 34-year-old reality star credited a ‚Äúcombination of breastfeeding and being very active‚Äù for the impressive weight loss.

"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor ‚Äî and two-time People‚Äôs Sexiest Man Alive cover model ‚Äî George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life ‚Äî actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see myself ever having kids.‚Äù  But it was a long road to get there. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have that gene that people have to replicate,‚Äù he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn‚Äôt married with kids, he replied, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had aspirations in that way, ever.‚Äù And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? ‚ÄúWhat do you do? Should I go, ‚ÄòI got to get me some kids right now!‚Äô and rush out and impregnate someone?‚Äù  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm also not running for president, but I played that role in ‚ÄòIdes of March.‚Äô I wasn‚Äôt an actual lawyer when I did ‚ÄòMichael Clayton,‚Äô and I don‚Äôt fire people for a living like I did in ‚ÄòUp in the Air.‚Äô ‚Äù  ‚ÄúI keep saying I‚Äôll never get married again or have children but people just don‚Äôt want to believe me,‚Äù Clooney told Britain‚Äôs Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it‚Äôs the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  ‚ÄúElla, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,‚Äù the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. ‚ÄúGeorge is sedated and should recover in a few days.‚Äù"
"Kendall Jenner is taking a cue from Jamie Foxx and blaming it on the alcohol.  Ellen DeGeneres grilled Jenner when the reality star appeared on her talk show, asking her about her discreet tattoos. Turns out, she wasn‚Äôt exactly clearheaded while deciding to get inked on her inner lip back in July 2016.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Before carefully exposing the hidden tattoo (Jenner took pains not smudge her statement lipstick), the model told DeGeneres, ‚ÄúI was drunk! I was not thinking clearly.‚Äù  The host also inquired about the 22-year-old‚Äôs choice of phrase: the word ‚Äúmeow.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt was literally the first thing that came to my mind,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, just my drunk thoughts.‚Äù  Despite DeGeneres‚Äô hesitation, Jenner noted that the location of her tattoo minimalized the pain. The body art done on her fingers where there‚Äôs bone, however, hurt a bit, Jenner said.  The talk show star examined the tattoos on Jenner‚Äôs fingers, a heart and a dot, done in white ink to be inconspicuous.  ‚ÄúI just wanted to know what it felt like,‚Äù Jenner explained when asked why she would elect to have barely visible artwork done. ‚ÄúAll my friends have them. I was like, ‚ÄòI just want to know what it feels like.‚Äô ‚Äú  Kendall Jenner JonBoy Tattoo/Instagram  Unlike many who get tattoos with special significance, the model previously wrote on her website that her inner lip ink was just for fun ‚Äî despite older sister Kim Kardashian West‚Äôs advice to never ‚Äúput a bumper sticker on a Bentley.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Kendall Jenner Opens Up About Her Golden Globes Acne: ‚ÄòNever Let That S‚Äî Stop You!‚Äô  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no real meaning behind it, I just wanted to be able to say that I have a tattoo ‚Äòon my face,‚Äô ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have two others also: a broken heart on one hand and a full heart on the other.‚Äù  Jenner continued, ‚ÄúI definitely want more and even though I used to say I‚Äôd only get one if it meant something to me, now I have even more possibilities!‚Äù"
"And it‚Äôs beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country‚Äôs problems. (Republicans: ‚ÄúThis President is breaking the law!‚Äù Democrats: ‚ÄúThey want to impeach the president!‚Äù) And what‚Äôs particularly jarring is that this isn‚Äôt taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It‚Äôs beneath the White House, and it‚Äôs beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren‚Äôt taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American‚Äôs embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that‚Äôs on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn‚Äôt afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that‚Äôs maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn‚Äôt). In the case of the border, there just isn‚Äôt a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP‚Äôs $659 million border bill, NBC‚Äôs Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are ‚Äúcautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‚Äòbrick wall‚Äô in the House.‚Äù Then again, it‚Äôs truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here‚Äôs the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: ‚ÄúThe Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,‚Äù Roll Call reports. ‚ÄúAfter the Senate‚Äôs version of the bill passed 79 to 18 ‚Äî Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‚Äòfree vote‚Ä¶because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out ‚Äî after they‚Äôve left‚Äô for the August recess.‚Äù So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund ‚Äúcliff‚Äù of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: ‚ÄúAfter a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,‚Äù the AP says. ‚ÄúThe Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.‚ÄùTom Steyer‚Äôs TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate‚Äôs multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it‚Äôs a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer‚Äôs involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‚Äòdeniers,‚Äô elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer‚Äôs group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.Poll: Kasich still leading in OhioA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio‚Äôs gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it‚Äôs mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He‚Äôs still not out of the woods, but he‚Äôs stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.Dueling coal ads in West VirginiaDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia‚Äôs Senate race hitting her party‚Äôs own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn‚Äôt seem to be taking any chances hereThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trialIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell‚Äôs rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: ‚ÄúLawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‚Äòfavorite playmate.‚Äô The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,‚Äù NBC Washington‚Äôs Julie Carey reported. More: ‚ÄúThe couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‚ÄòYou'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,‚Äô Burck said.‚Äù Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it‚Äôs the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

"Losing Arizona Robbins is a huge blow to the very fabric of Grey's Anatomy. The Season 14 finale will be Jessica Capshaw's last episode, and her iconic character that has withstood the test of time. Arizona's story definitely feels like it's been cut much too short of its true potential, but that just means Capshaw will be ready to take on even more new and exciting roles. So what is Jessica Capshaw doing after Grey's Anatomy?  While it doesn't appear that she has any projects on the horizon just yet ‚Äî at least as far as her IMDB page will divulge ‚Äî she's already joking with some of TV's biggest names about what her next role will be. Capshaw tweeted to Jane The Virgin creator Jennie Urman in March, praising her work on that show, and Urman responded asking if she could write something for Capshaw next. ""From camp BFF's to comedy wranglers on television,"" Capshaw replied. ""YES PLEASE!""  So, she's apparently open to new possibilities, and Capshaw's fans are eagerly awaiting whatever that next endeavor will be. ""I hope she finds something that makes her as happy and sunshine-y as [Grey's Anatomy] made her,"" Reddit user cattagatta wrote.  Twitter is similarly buzzing with people calling for Arizona spinoffs and Capshaw leading roles.  Capshaw hasn't really made a habit of juggling Grey's Anatomy with any other projects ‚Äî she only has two other TV credits since joining the Grey's cast in 2009. But now that her schedule is less consumed by Grey's, she'll have time to take a look at what else the industry has to offer.  She's also got four children and a husband, whom she frequently features on her Instagram accounts, and she's proven that she's accustomed to having a lot on her plate. ""A lot of people, especially who are working moms, say it‚Äôs all about balance and trying to create a balance, and I respectfully disagree. I don‚Äôt know that any part of my day is ever balanced,"" Capshaw told Yahoo late last year. ""I don‚Äôt spend equal parts being mom or being a worker, being a wife, being an advocate, being a humanitarian, whatever it is that I am endeavoring to be.""  As she mentioned, Capshaw is definitely an advocate ‚Äî she's always sharing causes that are important to her, like ending gun violence and achieving pay equity. No matter where she goes from here, something tells me she'll be busy with something. And regardless of where her career goes, it's clear that her role as Arizona will always stay with her.  ""I never would have imagined that I would be able to play a character that would feel like it does so much good, whether it‚Äôs people who feel like the character resonates with them and it makes their day a little easier to see themselves represented,"" she said in the same Yahoo interview. ""Or if it‚Äôs someone watching it who has someone in their life who is gay and they might have not understood it before and all of a sudden, they have another person or another thing to point to and say, ‚ÄòOh that‚Äôs a different context.‚Äô Being able to play a lesbian as a series regular on television has been enormously rewarding.""  There's no denying Arizona has been a hugely inspiring figure on Grey's ‚Äî she's wowed viewers with her passion for the tiny humans she's healed over the years, she remained resilient in the face of unimaginable hardship, and she was always a friend to those around her. The loss of both her and April will be hard, but it's far from the last we'll see of the actors behind them."
"CLOSE Let's forget about the Brangelina divorce for a bit and talk about their six children.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie attend the New York premiere of 'Changeling' in October 2008. (Photo: Andrew H. Walker, Getty Images)  Brad Pitt is being investigated after being accused of verbal and physical abuse against his children.  Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services spokesman Armand Montiel told USA TODAY by law the agency cannot confirm or deny investigations.

Pitt and Jolie have six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8.  The Los Angeles Police Department is so far not investigating.

"Ben Affleck is keeping life with his three kids and his relationship with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus separate, if Jennifer Garner has anything to say about it.  ‚ÄúJen doesn‚Äôt want the kids around Lindsay or having her in their lives. She has many reasons,‚Äù a source exclusively reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly.  Garner, 46, and Affleck, 45, who called it quits in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children: Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  Though the Batman star officially got together with Shookus, 38, after Garner and Affleck‚Äôs filing, a confidant previously confirmed to Us that their relationship started as early as 2014. As a result, the source notes that one of reasons the Love, Simon actress does not want the Saturday Night Live producer around her kids is ‚Äúthe fact that Ben had an affair with her.‚Äù  However, the exes are keeping the peace. According to the insider, ‚ÄúBen understands and has honored her request.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre good friends,‚Äù the source adds. ‚ÄúShe wants him to be honest and he usually is.

They both want what‚Äôs best for the kids and have made a commitment to see that through.‚Äù  While the estranged couple filed for divorce in 2017, the paperwork has yet to be finalized, partially due to Affleck‚Äôs past struggles with alcohol abuse.  ‚ÄúThe one thing she‚Äôs not flexible on is sobriety,‚Äù the source tells Us. ‚ÄúJen is hesitant to sign off until she‚Äôs certain that the kids will be in the best hands at all time.

"In the course of the email review, State Department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified. In the 3,000 pages that were released, for example, portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to ‚Äúclassified status.‚Äù But none of those were marked as classified at the time Mrs. Clinton handled them.In a second memo to Mr. Kennedy, sent on July 17, the inspectors general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information. The inspectors general did not identify the email or reveal its substance.The memos were provided to The New York Times by a senior government official.The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified, and for not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.In March, Mrs. Clinton insisted that she was careful in her handling of information on her private account. ‚ÄúI did not email any classified material to anyone on my email,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere is no classified material. So I‚Äôm certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.‚ÄùIn May, the F.B.I. asked the State Department to classify a section of Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs emails that related to suspects who may have been arrested in connection with the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills songstress was gifted a mini-Mirrorball Trophy adorned with a unicorn figurine during her interview with Lara Spencer on Good Morning America Tuesday. The figure is an homage to the unicorn that Erika entered on during her debut DWTS dance.

"Pearl Street Films, the production company co-founded by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, will adopt inclusion riders for their projects going forward, following in the footsteps of Outlier Society, the production company started by Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan.  ‚ÄúThank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry,‚Äù Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni, head of strategic outreach at Pearl Street Films tweeted in response to Jordan on Monday night. ‚ÄúOn behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton, & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward.‚Äù  .@michaelb4jordan Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry.

An inclusion rider is a way for actors and actresses to guarantee projects they work on have a level of diversity, onscreen and off-camera, that matches the location setting of the project. Stacy L. Smith, the director of USC Annenberg‚Äôs Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, first discussed the idea of an ‚Äúequity rider‚Äù in a 2014 column for The Hollywood Reporter as a way to reverse Hollywood‚Äôs profound gender imbalance.  In a statement to Variety, Smith and Kalpana Kotagal, one of the lawyers working on the inclusion riders, said of the Pearl Street Films announcement, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to see Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and the Pearl Street Films team using their influence to create opportunities for people from underrepresented groups to enter the industry. The Inclusion Rider is an important tool for Hollywood, and other industries, to create workplaces that truly reflect our diverse world.‚Äù  Under their Pearl Street Films banner, Affleck and Damon have produced films such as Manchester By the Sea, Jason Bourne, and Live By Night, among other features and television series, and are currently working on Matt Reeves‚Äô The Batman (with Affleck still set to star as the Caped Crusader) and Affleck‚Äôs remake of Witness for the Prosecution."
"Perez Hilton has fired back at Jennifer Lawrence‚Äòs Vanity Fair comments in which she took the gossip blogger to task for publishing hacked nude photos of her.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to be Oprah. I am just a better version of me than I was 10 years ago,‚Äù Hilton said in a video posted on his website Monday. ‚ÄúDo I still have work to do? Can I still be even better? Fuck yeah, but I am not that person in the past. And if you‚Äôre trying to keep me in the prison that is the past, then fuck you!‚Äù  Hilton then said, ‚ÄúSo, actually this video is for Jennifer Lawrence, to say ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô! And I‚Äôm going to get in trouble for that, but I don‚Äôt give a shit.‚Äù  See photos: Party Report in Pictures: Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon, Jon Stewart and SNL‚Äôs Week Off  As TheWrap previously reported, the Oscar-winning actress scolded Hilton in the November issue of Vanity Fair for posting ‚Äî and then removing ‚Äî nude photos of her that emerged in August as part of the massive celebrity photo hack. Kate Upton, Kaley Cuoco and Meagan Good were also targeted.  ‚ÄúHe took it down because people got pissed, and that‚Äôs the only reason why,‚Äù Lawrence said. ‚ÄúAnd then I had to watch his apology. And what he basically said was ‚ÄòI just didn‚Äôt think about it‚Äô ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòI just didn‚Äôt think about it‚Äô is not an excuse. That is the exact issue itself.‚Äù  But Hilton, whose real name is Mario Lavandeira, wasn‚Äôt happy with her characterization of his previous apology.  Also read: Jennifer Lawrence Slams Gossip Blogger Perez Hilton for Posting Her Nude Photos  ‚ÄúShe mentions how she was forced to watch the video I made right after her naked photos surfaced online.

And I was tempted to apologize to her again, but you know what ‚Ä¶ No. Fuck that. Life isn‚Äôt always what you want. And you don‚Äôt always get what you ask for,‚Äù Hilton said.  ‚ÄúThat video that I made and me explaining my thought process was real, it was sincere, and it wasn‚Äôt some bullshit made up excuse.‚Äù  He wasn‚Äôt finished.

"Travis Scott wanted Kylie Jenner to celebrate Thanksgiving with him in Houston but she said now. Now, we‚Äôve EXCLUSIVELY learned these two fought over her decision to hide her alleged pregnancy from the public!  Travis Scott, 25, nearly had the perfect Thanksgiving. He was missing just one ingredient: Kylie Jenner! The 20-year-old Keeping up with the Kardashians star was invited to join Travis in his hometown of Houston, but she decided to kick it with her family at home (where she would be far from the public eye.) This, needless to say, left Travis with a bad taste in his mouth. ‚ÄúTravis is super supportive of Kylie and obviously wants her to do whatever she needs to do to take the best care of herself but he does wish she‚Äôd come out of hiding,‚Äù a source close to Travis EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard for him because he wants them to do normal stuff together, instead of just hiding out at her house,‚Äù the source tells HollywoodLife.com. The insider brought up that Travis and Cactus Jack Records hosted a turkey drive for Hurricane Harvey relief in downtown Houston on Nov. 23. ‚ÄúHe was begging her to come out and do it with him, but she said no. She doesn‚Äôt want to be photographed at all right now. They had a bit of a fight over it. He‚Äôs proud of her and wanted her there by his side. He was disappointed she wouldn‚Äôt come.‚Äù  Oh no! Does this mean that Kylie and her alleged baby daddy are on the rocks? Thankfully, this was just a bump in the road, as the insider told HollywoodLife.com that ‚Äúthey made up‚Äù afterward. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt ever stay mad at her for long but this whole thing of her wanting to say in hiding is an issue for him. He‚Äôs trying his best to be understanding but he does question this whole need for her to stay in hiding,‚Äù the insider added. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt really get it.  Travis may need to ‚Äúget it‚Äù soon, because Kylie reportedly doesn‚Äôt want to go out in public until her alleged baby is born. She wants to ‚Äúdisappear‚Äù and focus on her health and happiness during this reported pregnancy, and she reportedly won‚Äôt even address it until she gives birth. Kylie is also reportedly ‚Äúhorrified‚Äù with how her body has changed with pregnancy, and the last thing she wants to do is leave the house. Well, it seems Travis better not expect Ky to join him if he celebrates Christmas in Clutch City. Maybe next year?  What do you think Travis and Kylie should do, HollywoodLifers? Do you think he should be more understanding?"
"If you always wanted to go shoe shopping with Sarah Jessica Parker (and who doesn‚Äôt?), you‚Äôre out of luck. The Sex & the City star launched a shopping excursion with Airbnb on Monday, September 25, and it already sold out in just two hours.  The $400 price tag for the ‚ÄúSole in the City with SJP‚Äù experience scores you a chance to have the shoe designer help you handpick a pair of shoes from her SJP Collection at Bloomingdale‚Äôs, a post-shopping snack of fro yo and a ticket to the New York City Ballet show, along with facetime with SJP herself.  ‚ÄúWhat better way to meet than at Bloomingdale‚Äôs 59th Street, an iconic NYC landmark, for what I hope is an unforgettable shoe-shopping experience,‚Äù Parker, 52, explains on the Airbnb site. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll help you find the perfect pair of shoes from the SJP Collection to complete your look. As we peruse the shoe department, I‚Äôll tell you about the line and how the city that never sleeps helped inspire it.

"The Emmys red carpet took a page from ‚ÄúThe Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.‚Äù  While television‚Äôs brightest stars sashayed in a Technicolor parade on Sunday, red and white - a la the crimson cloaks and snowy bonnets worn by the enslaved women on the Hulu series based on Margaret Atwood‚Äôs book - emerged as the night‚Äôs biggest winners. (Which was fitting, considering ""The Handmaid's Tale"" won Best Drama, along with Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.) And everything shimmered with sequins and beading.  Nicole Kidman was among the best dressed of the night in a red halter Calvin Klein Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. ‚ÄúHandmaid‚Äôs‚Äù Yvonne Strahovski also worked the red hot shade in a custom Julien MacDonald silk number, as did Sarah Hyland in a fiery cutout Zac Posen, Heidi Klum in plunging Peter Dundas, and Issa Rae in an asymmetrical Vera Wang. (""The Handmaid's Tale"" author Margaret Atwood was also notably in red.)  ‚ÄúA red dress is fiery, it‚Äôs sexy, it‚Äôs a universal power color,‚Äù celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. ‚ÄúAnd it also says ‚Äòresistance‚Äô in my opinion, so it makes a strong statement.‚Äù  Viola Davis wore Zac Posen. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  The white haute women included Evan Rachel Wood in a Moschino gown with cropped tuxedo jacket, Priyanka Chopra in long-sleeved Balmain, Sofia Vergara in a strapless figure-hugging Mark Zunino mermaid gown, and ‚ÄúStranger Things‚Äô‚Äù adorable Millie Bobby Brown in a ballerina-inspired Calvin Klein gown with full tulle princess skirt.  Priyanka Chopra wore Balmain. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  ‚ÄúWhite always emerges when people are desperate for change in our culture,‚Äù mused Verdi, ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs a blank canvas for new beginnings.‚Äù  And the summer‚Äôs glitter trend was on full display, with sequins and beads dusted across almost everyone, including Lea Michele‚Äôs belted purple Elie Saab gown, Tracee Ellis Ross‚Äôs silver Chanel disco ball, Leslie Jones‚Äô black sparkling Christian Siriano, and Ellie Kemper‚Äôs midnight blue capsleeve Jenny Packham gown.  ‚ÄúGlitter is so hot right now, and it was sparkle, sparkle, sparkle everywhere, and lots of sequin sand silver,‚Äù Tom Fitzgerald, co-creator of the fashion and pop culture blog TomandLorenzo.com with Lorenzo Marquez, told Moneyish.  Other standouts included Viola Davis in juicy orange Zac Posen, Jane Fonda in long-sleeved hot pink Brandon Maxwell (with long, sleek ponytail to match), and both Tessa Thompson and Zoe Kravitz chasing the rainbow; the former in a pleated metallic Rosie Assoulin, and the latter in a feathery cascading Dior.  Tessa Thompson wore Rosie Assoui. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  ‚ÄúThere were a lot of movie stars on the red carpet this year, so there was a heightened sense of glamour. If you know Nicole Kidman is going to be there, you‚Äôre gonna bring your A game,‚Äù said Fitzgerald. ‚ÄúAnd we are at peak TV with all of the incredible programming now, so it‚Äôs become more much competitive, and the Emmys are closer in tone to the Oscars than it used to be.‚Äù  While the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, more than 11 million people tuned into last year‚Äôs awards show - and the glamorous gowns worn by the nominees and presenters on any awards show red carpet influence what the $15.6 billion dress industry will put on the rack next spring. Remember when Amal Clooney wore white opera gloves to the 2015 Golden Globes? Long gloves appeared on the fall/winter runways of Marc Jacobs and Prada later that year.  Millie Bobby Brown wore Calvin Klein. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see silhouettes shift now, thanks to the classic and demure 1950s and 60s looks on Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown, that kind of princess-style dress,‚Äù said Verdi. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see these popular colors (red, white, silver, the pops of orange and green) trickle down into ready-to-wear fashion. And you‚Äôll see the fabrics - like the sparkle and lace we saw on the carpet - be used to embellish affordable versions of these gowns.‚Äù  And you may even be able to snap up at least one of Sunday‚Äôs red carpet looks yourself. While many movie and TV stories are loaned their designer gowns for these award shows - or are sometimes paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to wear a label for all of the free publicity it will bring the brand - singer and presenter Rachel Bloom revealed to E! that she had to pay for her $3,500 Gucci gown out of pocket.  ‚ÄúA lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren‚Äôt in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it‚Äôs getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the whole problem with the fashion industry: My body size is literally normal and healthy but when you put me next to a model I look obese.‚Äù  Rachel Bloom bought her Gucci gown. ""It's hard to get places to lend me dresses b/c I'm not a size 0, but I can afford it so it's OK"" #Emmys pic.twitter.com/pevV8HgfWj ‚Äî Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) September 17, 2017  Verdi noted this is an issue because the competition for these couture gowns is fierce.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only a few great dresses in any given collection every season, and every stylist is trying to pull them for the celebrities that they are dressing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo when the fashion houses are assessing who these should go to, they want it to go to a nominee over a presenter; to a global star versus a national star; to someone younger over someone older - those are what the ‚Äòrules‚Äô would be.‚Äù  And, often, to someone slimmer over someone curvier, as stars like Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones (both nominated Sunday night) have been public about their struggles to find designers to dress them.  But Bloom noted that she‚Äôs fortunate to be in a financial position where she can buy her dress. And she might get some money back for the gently-used gown, anyway.  ‚ÄúI can always resell it,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI do have an account on [the resell/consignment site] The RealReal.

"Kathryn C. Dennis knows how tough a reunion taping can be. And the Southern Charm mom was certainly feeling the pressure of having to relive every moment viewers watched of her life during last season's sit-down. So when it came time to film the Season 4 reunion, she went into the event with a very different mind frame.  ""I‚Äôm hoping to express a little less than I did last year, but you know.

Part 1 of the Season 4 reunion put Kathryn in the hot seat, with the Charleston native having to open up about why she went to rehab as well as her life as a mom (she has two kids with ex, Thomas Ravenel) and her former friendship with Jennifer Snowden. And she knew that when it came to having to face the tough questions and issues, she wanted to deal with it in a different way than she's done in the past. ""So, they‚Äôre probably expecting ‚Äî or not knowing what to expect when they see me, but that‚Äôs a good thing 'cause I‚Äôm gonna surprise them I think,"" she said.  As for last year's outfit, well, Kathryn doesn't look to fondly on that. ""Fashion, what is it? Flop. Ugh, it was bad, but I mean it was cute but all in a different outfit,"" she reflected. ""Like the top with something else, the bottom with something else. I don‚Äôt know. But this year I love my dress. It‚Äôs like badass basically is what I‚Äôm trying to get at.""

"Princess Eugenie kept her bridal look under wraps in the weeks leading up to her royal wedding to fianc√© Jack Brooksbank. But the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson‚Äòs dress was finally revealed on Friday as she walked down the aisle of St. George‚Äôs Chapel at Windsor Castle wearing a custom Peter Pilotto gown.  So how does her Peter Pilotto dress compare to her cousins‚Äô Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle‚Äòs gowns?  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Getty; AP (2)  Press Association via AP Images  The 28-year-old royal cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry chose a long-sleeve, low-back design from the London-based label, which was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.  YUI MOK/AFP/Getty Images  The dress features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing full length train. The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.  Press Association via AP Images  ‚ÄúI think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it‚Äôs really special to stand up for that,‚Äù she told the U.K.‚Äôs This Morning.  Pilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock  The fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack‚Äôs fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple‚Äôs home.  The only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. ‚Äú[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,‚Äù she told British Vogue. ‚ÄúAs soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I‚Äôd be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I‚Äôve been pretty on top of it.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie‚Äôs Wedding  Unlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.  For Kate‚Äôs 2011 wedding to Prince William, she stuck with a British-based designer too, wearing a custom Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen lace long-sleeve, V-neck gown.  Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images  But it was Meghan‚Äôs long-sleeved, unembellished gown that switched-up the British designer trend.

Princess Eugenie wore the Greville Emerald Kokoshnik Tiara, lent to her by the Queen. The tiara is made of brilliant and rose cut diamonds pav√© set in platinum, with six emeralds on either side and was bequeathed by Mrs. Greville to Queen Elizabeth in 1942.

"CLOSE 'American Idol' winner Scotty McCreery talks about his 'up and down' journey to the top of the country charts. (March 14) AP  Scotty McCreery and Gaby Dugal arrive for the 53rd annual Academy of Country Music Awards at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on April 15. (Photo: NINA PROMMER/EPA-EFE)  Scotty McCreery married his longtime girlfriend Gabi Dugal on Saturday in North Carolina in front of more than 200 guests.  The couple met when they were in kindergarten.  The 24-year-old winner of ""American Idol"" Season 10 and Dugal got engaged in September at their favorite spot near Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been planning this moment for so long that it feels surreal for it to have finally happened,‚Äù McCreery said in a statement announcing their engagement. ‚ÄúGabi is the perfect girl and my true love, and I cannot wait to begin building our life together as husband and wife.‚Äù  The country singer got down on one knee and proposed with a ring he helped design.  People has the first photo from the wedding, which shows Dugal in a sleeveless, V-neck white gown by Morilee and carrying a white bouquet, with McCreery wearing a basic black tuxedo. The site reports that the couple chose Elvis Presley's ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" for their first dance.  Dugal, a pediatric cardiac nurse at Duke University Hospital, was smitten with McCreery even in kindergarten, writing ‚ÄúMrs. Gabi McCreery‚Äù surrounded by hearts in her diary.  The song ""This Is It"" from McCreery's album ""Seasons Change"" is about their engagement.  Contributing: Kim Willis  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2MwpSkJ"

"HARRY POTTER AT KING'S CROSS  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS When you arrive at King's Cross. Northern Line Station go through the ticket barrier, walk up the steps directly ahead and turn left at the top. Turn immediately right following the sign and arrow pointing to ""St Pancras International. "" Keep ahead through the passage and, just before you arrive at the ticket machines on the left, go up the stairs where the arrow and sign point to ""stairs to street level. Turn left at the top of those stairs, and go left again at the ""Way Out and Euston Road"" sign. Once on Euston Road turn right and follow the red brick wall then pause on the right just before the phone box.  ST PANCRAS STATION - KING'S CROSS EXTERIOR  The interior of St Pancras has recently undergone a major refurbishment and looks every bit as grand as it did in its Victorian heyday.  Although Harry Potter and his schoolmates board the Hogwarts Express at King's Cross Station, the exterior used in the films was in fact the one that now looms over you, St Pancras Station.  It was on the corner of the courtyard to your left that Harry and Ron park the Ford Anglia in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  Later in the film, when they find themselves unable to pass through the wall on to Platform nine-and-three-quarters, they return to the Ford Anglia and fly off over the station. The clock that towers over you to your right is shown in this flight scene.  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS Backtrack and keep going past the exit via which you came out of the station. Keep ahead to cross Pancras Road via the traffic light crossing (heading towards King's Cross Station). On the other side of the crossing veer left and pass to the right of the large circular silver structure on which there is a white on blue sign pointing to ""King's Cross."" Keep ahead to enter King's Cross Station. Once inside the station keep straight ahead, following the sign that points to Platforms 9 to 11 Keep ahead past the ticket office and then pass to the right of the Disabled Meeting Point sign. Keep ahead past the Cash machines and on the right, directly under the footbridge, is Platform 9 3/4.  PLATFORM NINE-AND-THREE-QUARTERS  Although not an actual film location this brown brick wall has become a magnet to Harry Potter fans from all over the world.  They come to photograph the sign, which the station authorities have obligingly put up in honour of the station's most famous passenger.  Even more obliging is the fact that the station staff have also taken the trouble to place a luggage cart against the wall which looks as though it is half way in to the wall, as though some young witch or wizard is proceeding on their way to board the Hogwarts Express!  You can take photographs of yourself and the children, or just yourself, or, if you can enlist the services of a passing passenger, of all of you, pushing at the cart as though you too are on your way to wizard land!  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS Continue past Platform 9 3/4 and, a little further along on the right is the Harry Potter Shop.  THE HARRY POTTER SHOP  Styled to resemble Ollivander's wand shop, complete with wooden panelling and lots of draws, the Harry Potter Shop has something for everyone.  You can, if you wish, splash out and purchase exact replicas of the wands used in the films by Harry, Ron or Hermione; there is a selection of jumpers in the various House colours; or you can marvel at a display of Horcruxes.  If your tastes incline more towards the discreet and understated, then you can choose from a selection of hoodies in a variety of colours, all with Platform 9 ¬æ emblazoned on them.  And, if you‚Äôre seeking a more modestly priced souvenir then you can plum for a selection of board games. Key rings, mugs, soft toys or action figures.  HARRY POTTER LONDON LOCATIONS - DIRECTIONS Backtrack and, just before the entrance you came in by, turn left passing beneath the white on blue sign for Platforms 0 to 8. Keep ahead, passing to the left of the Ticket Machines and, once past the glass and silver gate go left and keep ahead to the grey shutter by Platform 5. Unfortunately you can‚Äôt actually go onto the platform itself without a ticket, so you‚Äôll have to look along the platforms from this side of the barrier.  THE ENTRANCE TO  PLATFORM NINE-AND-THREE-QUARTERS  King‚Äôs Cross has appeared in every Harry Potter film because the journey to Hogwarts aboard the Hogwarts Express starts from King's Cross Platform 9¬æ, which is invisible to the eyes of muggles, and which is reached by walking through the wall between platforms 9 and 10.  However, King‚Äôs Cross Station posed a slight problem for the film makers in that Platforms 9 and 10 aren‚Äôt actually adjacent to one another.  The problem was overcome by re-numbering Platforms 4 and 5. Thus Platform 9¬æ is in fact situated between these two platforms ahead of you, which are separated by picturesque brick arches.  In the Harry Potter films the Hogwarts Express pulls into the far end of the platform.  In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Mr and Mrs Weasley pass through the portal but when Harry and Ron try to do so they just hit the wall and fall to the ground. A nearby porter eyes them suspiciously and asks what they think they're doing, to which Harry replies ""sorry lost control of trolley.""  Realising that they can't get on to the platform they hurry back to the forecourt (St Pancras which you visited earlier) and take off in the Ford Anglia.  HARRY MEETS DUMBELDORE‚ÄôS SPIRIT  In the Deathly Hallows Part Two Harry is hit with a killing curse by Lord Voldemort, and he enters a Limbo state in which his spirit meets with that of Albus Dumbledore at a location that Harry identifies as King's Cross Station ‚Äúonly cleaner.""  OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE  It is on the platforms ahead that we catch our last glimpse of Harry, Ron and Hermione in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two when they bring their children here to pass through the wall and onto Platform 9¬æ to begin their first journey to Hogwarts.  WHY J. K. ROWLING CHOSE KING‚ÄôS CROSS  The reason J. K. Rowling chose King‚Äôs Cross Station as the place from which the Hogwarts Express departs was because her parents actually met at King‚Äôs Cross which is why the station had special significance to her."

"When members of the royal family tie the knot, there‚Äôs a lot at stake‚Äîincluding a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This is not a celebrity marriage, it‚Äôs a royal marriage.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,‚Äù says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it‚Äôs a royal marriage.‚Äù Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry‚Äôs parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen‚Äôs four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.  Yes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn‚Äôt be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it‚Äôs not Harry‚Äôs,‚Äù says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.  Larcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.  If Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they‚Äôre not legally enforceable.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII‚Äôs habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. ‚ÄúIn the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,‚Äù Larcombe says, ‚Äúand the person who is departing the royal family, they‚Äôre just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they‚Äôre done behind closed doors.‚Äù"
"Maddox Jolie-Pitt is not happy with his mom, Angelina Jolie, after she visited the grave of Pol Pot ‚Äì the murderous dictator responsible for killing 3 million Cambodians ‚Äì and now he has defiantly demanded to live with his dad, Brad Pitt. Sources say that after he found out about his mother‚Äôs visit, the Cambodian-born Jolie Pitt immediately called his dad and begged to live with him.  Pol Pot‚Äôs Khmer Rouge party ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979 and slaughtered millions through starvation, work camps, and mass executions on the notorious ‚Äúkilling fields.‚Äù Locals say that Jolie has visited the grave multiple times, the first being in 1998, and then again in 2001 during the trip where she adopted Maddox.

Jolie claimed this was evidence of Pitt‚Äôs abusive behavior towards their six children.  But now, according to Radar Online, the 16-year-old understands that his mom‚Äôs behavior ignited problems in their family, and it is the 42-year-old actress who is the instigator of many of their family woes.  The fact that Jolie visits the warlord‚Äôs resting place is ‚Äúgalling‚Äù to Maddox, according to insiders, and he doesn‚Äôt understand how she could save him from such an evil place and then return to it like it is a shrine. But, whether Maddox winds up with Pitt is still in question.  Pitt and Jolie are still in the middle of hashing out a custody agreement and divorce settlement, but a year and a half after their split, Pitt is happy again and in ‚Äúhigh spirits.‚Äù After taking time to focus on himself, the 54-year-old has slowly made his way back into the spotlight and is currently dating Neri Oxman, who is a professor of media arts and sciences at the MIT Media Lab.

"The budding romance between Josh Duhamel and Eiza Gonz√°lez is heating up!  The Love, Simon star and the Baby Driver actress were spotted getting incredibly cozy on a romantic getaway near Muyil on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico over the weekend. Photos of the two show them kissing and holding one another as they took a trip on the Muyil Lagoon. Gonz√°lez, 28, was seen sporting a skimpy, sharkskin bikini, while Duhamel, 45, wore white board shorts during their aquatic romp.  It's unclear how long the two have been an item. It's been less than a month since the couple decided to go public, but they reportedly kept their relationship under wraps out of respect for Fergie, whom Duhamel separated with in September after eight years of marriage. The two have a 4-year-old son together, Axl.

"At this point in time, the whole ‚Äúteaser for the trailer‚Äù thing is so normalized that it is no longer surprising. But there are two interesting bits right off the bat about this Fifty Shades Freed teaser. First, at 66 seconds, it‚Äôs damn well long enough to be the full trailer. At this point, you‚Äôre either in or you‚Äôre out concerning this third film in E.L. James‚Äô bondage-flavored romantic drama. Aside from maybe Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I can‚Äôt think of a movie that needs less of an actual marketing campaign, at least in terms of spoiler-y footage.  Second, it teases the actual theatrical trailer for November, meaning this is a two-months‚Äô early sneak peak of said trailer. That may be a something of a record. Sony dropped a Ghostbusters trailer teaser on Feb. 14, 2016 in advance of its March 3, 2016 trailer launch, but I can‚Äôt think of any movie that debuted their trailer teaser two months in advance. I can only assume we‚Äôll see the trailer attached to STX Entertainment‚Äôs A Bad Moms Christmas unless Universal/Comcast Corp. feels like being funny and attaching it to Sony‚Äôs The Star. As for the actual teaser, the footage is at least somewhat promising a bit kinky sex than we had the last time out. So at least this time fans might get what they paid for.  Fifty Shades Darker was essentially about how Anastasia Steele (still a great name for a 007 villain) molded Mr. Grey into ‚Äúhusband material,‚Äù which meant a lot more conventional sex but a lot less kink. Also of note, we get more conventional violence this time out, including a guy who I presume is Steele‚Äôs former boss holding a knife to her throat. So for those who want rescue fantasies with their BDSM, there you go.  Twenty dollars says we‚Äôll get far more thinkpieces about Steele‚Äôs consensual sexual activities than about the violence directed upon her sans her consent, but that‚Äôs a conversation for another day. At this point, the Fifty Shades trilogy is a lot like The Hobbit trilogy, in that the first film made so much money ($571 million worldwide) that the next two are essentially paid for. Sam Taylor-Johnson‚Äôs Fifty Shades of Grey cost $40 million and James Foley‚Äôs Fifty Shades Darker cost $55m. Assuming Fifty Shades Freed cost around the same (let‚Äôs say $65m to potentially over exaggerate just in case), we‚Äôre looking at a trilogy that cost Universal and friends $160m.  So the first film alone made back 3.5x the budget of the entire series. And since the sequel made $379 million worldwide, we‚Äôre already at $950m worldwide with one more to go. Even if this installment takes another dive and makes (spitballing it here) $250m worldwide, we‚Äôre still looking at a $1.2 billion total gross for these R-rated, female-targeted erotic dramas. Even if it pulls a Divergent, it's still all gravy (and the franchise is over after this one anyway). It‚Äôs almost like Universal made a non-tentpole movie into an event by creating an A-level release out of something entirely unlike anything else in the marketplace and targeted at an underserved demographic. Hmm‚Ä¶  Fifty Shades Freed, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, opens Feb. 9, 2018."

"The actress wore a gown designed by Lela Rose.  First comes co-starring in a TV show, then comes marriage.  Revenge star Emily VanCamp, 32, revealed on Instagram she tied the knot to her former co-star Josh Bowman, 30, over the weekend in the Bahamas.  The actress posted a couple of black-and-white photos of her and Bowman in their wedding attire on her account. The first caption simply revealed the date of the ceremony, ""12.15.18,' she wrote.

"There's a chance for another Brad and Jen, but this time it isn't Jennifer Aniston. Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week‚Äôs issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that ‚ÄúBrad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together.

The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn‚Äôt seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin ‚Äî Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old ‚ÄúX-Men‚Äù co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.  The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together."

"Tracee Ellis Ross was one of the brave few to show up on the Met Gala red carpet actually wearing one of Rei Kawakubo's Commes Des Gar√ßons designs , becoming part of an exclusive group that included Rihanna and Caroline Kennedy . The Black-ish actress chose a sculptural blue outfit from CDG's Spring 2016 ""Blue Witch"" collection. While it may not have been as constricting as Helen Lasichanh's arm-encumbering red CDG outfit, the runway piece wasn't exactly designed with practicality in mind, as is the case with much Commes Des Gar√ßons.  Still, as Ross explained last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , she felt it was an honor to wear it. Should it be such a surprise that the daughter of one of pop's greatest fashion risk takers, Diana Ross , would be completely fine with exchanging her full range of arm movement for a once-in-a-lifetime red carpet moment?  Kimmel, of course, is not exactly enamored by the world of fashion and is often bemused at its excesses (see his feud with Kanye West over the idea of leather jogging pants, in particularly). So naturally he had to have Ross walk him through why she chose to wear the look.  Ross explained she was attending as a guest of online retailer Farfetched, which just happens to carry Comme Des Gar√ßons, so she actually got to wear a piece from the label (many other celebs attended as the guests of other fashion labels, and as per tradition and common courtesy, wore their host's creations, and thus explaining why so few celebs seemed to go full-out with the theme).  ""The designer who was the cochair was Comme Des Gar√ßons, Rei Kawakubo. So she's a very avant-garde designer. Very arts meet fashion,"" explained an excited Ross. ""So I got to wear a Commes Des Gar√ßons dress""  ""It was such a big deal in fashion, and it was a huge deal for me,"" continued Ross. ""I feel like my mom taught me about glamour, and growing up I was a big fashion girl. I had magazines and loved that world, and so it was a big deal. It was a very big deal to wear that designer.""  After a picture of Ross in the outfit popped up behind the host, Ross had to convince him for a second that it was actually a big fashion moment, but did admit its particularly drawbacks.  ""As you can tell, there's not a lot of movement I could do in the dress,"" she explained. ""So it was a little bit like...couldn't lift me arms up, couldn't hug people because if I lift my arms up too high the dress would come up.""  Kimmel's take away: he thought about the idea of teaming up with Kawakubo to get celebrities to wear the most ridiculous things possible in the name of fashion.  ""I'm going to contact Rei, and Rei and I are going to work out a scheme where we come up with the most ridiculous things and try to get famous people to wear them.  ""I'm going to put somebody in a big Sprite bottle.""  Actually, dressing someone in a Sprite bottle sounds more like Jeremy Scott for Moschino than Rei Kawakubo to us, but point taken.

"CBS‚Äô new top programming executives addressed the network‚Äôs struggles with onscreen diversity Tuesday ‚Äî including the recent controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from ‚ÄúHawaii Five-0.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe love both those actors and did not want to lose them,‚Äù CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around.‚Äù  In June, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park exited ‚ÄúHawaii Five-O.‚Äù As Variety reported at the time, the actors had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O‚ÄôLoughlin and Scott Caan, but failed to reach deals with CBS Television Studios, which produces the series.  The departure of the show‚Äôs only two series regulars of Asian descent over a salary dispute involving the pay scale of their white co-stars sparked criticism of CBS on social media and in the press.  Kahl did not go into details of the negotiation, saying, ‚ÄúIn my mind it was purely a business transaction.‚Äù He characterized the departure of veteran actors as natural for a show entering its eighth season. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs happened on ‚ÄòCSI,‚Äô it‚Äôs happened on ‚ÄòGrey‚Äôs Anatomy,‚Äô it‚Äôs happened on ‚ÄòLaw and Order: SVU.'‚Äù  Related Erinn Hayes‚Äô Character to Be Killed Off ‚ÄòKevin Can Wait‚Äô to Make Room for Leah Remini  Kahl appeared at TCA alongside senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. The two fielded multiple questions about the network‚Äôs poor record with diversity in front of and behind the camera, with one reporter noting that CBS has failed to put a new series with a female lead on the air for two seasons running.  ‚ÄúWe had six pilots with female leads and the way things turned out those pilots were not deemed to be as good as the pilots that were picked up,‚Äù Sherman said.  Sherman and Kahl did not handle the development slate that led to the upcoming season‚Äôs crop of new shows. Kahl, a 21-year veteran of the network and its longtime scheduling chief, was named CBS entertainment president in May. His promotion came with the departure of Glenn Geller, who stepped down as the network‚Äôs top programming executive following a mild heart attack suffered in March. As part of the restructuring, Sherman was recruited from sister network the CW to head programming under Kahl.  Reporters also grilled Kahl and Sherman on CBS‚Äô casting department, which is staffed entirely by white casting directors, and how it has affected the onscreen diversity or lack thereof in CBS‚Äô series.  ‚ÄúI personally don‚Äôt think that has anything to do with it,‚Äù Kahl said, adding of the casting department, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre fantastic at what they do,‚Äù and noting that it has ‚Äúcast many diverse roles in the past.‚Äù  Pressed on why the department is staffed entirely by white casting directors, Sherman said, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been together for a long time. That‚Äôs the department as its been. But we are cognizant of the issue. We hear you, and we will be looking to expand the casting department.‚Äù  As his predecessors have, Kahl defended CBS‚Äô diversity record and promised it would continue to improve.  ‚ÄúWe can debate the pace of the change, but there is change happening at CBS,‚Äù Kahl said, noting an overall uptick in diverse series regulars in recent years. ‚ÄúEvery single drama on our air has at least one diverse regular character.‚Äù  He added, ‚ÄúWe said in the past that we‚Äôre going to do better, and we are doing better.‚Äù"

"The Bumble Bee tuna processing plant in Santa Fe Springs, Calif., on Oct. 15, 2012. (Photo: Nick Ut, AP)Bumble Bee Foods and two managers were charged by Los Angeles prosecutors Monday with violating safety regulations in the death of a worker who was cooked in an industrial oven with tons of tuna.Jose Melena was performing maintenance in a 35-foot-long oven at the company's Santa Fe Springs plant before dawn Oct. 11, 2012, when a co-worker, who mistakenly believed Melena was in the bathroom, filled the pressure cooker with 12,000 pounds of canned tuna and it was turned on.When a supervisor noticed Melena, 62, was missing, an announcement was made on the intercom and employees searched for him in the facility and parking lot, according to a report by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. His body was found two hours later after the pressure cooker, which reached a temperature of 270 degrees, was turned off and opened.The company, its plant Operations Director Angel Rodriguez and former safety manager Saul Florez were each charged with three counts of violating Occupational Safety & Health Administration rules that caused a death.The charges specify that the company and the two men willfully violated rules that require implementing a safety plan, rules for workers entering confined spaces, and a procedure to keep machinery or equipment turned off if someone's working on it.Rodriguez, 63, of Riverside, and Florez, 42, of Whittier, could face up to three years in prison and fines up to $250,000 if convicted of all charges, prosecutors said. Bumble Bee Foods faces a maximum fine of $1.5 million. Prosecutions of workplace violations are uncommon ‚Äî even in fatalities.San Diego-based Bumble Bee said in a statement that ""we remain devastated by the loss of our colleague Jose Melena in the tragic accident."" It said it disagreed with the charges filed by the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office and that it was ""exploring all options with respect to those charges.""Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.

"Maxine Waters (D-CA) is one of the most unpleasant people to ever hold be a public servant. She is always, angry, something that she wears as a badge of honor. She has pushed the lie about President Trump having Russian connections and has even had to admit that no facts exists to condemn the White House for.Now the demented Democrat is looking even more foolish since an observant Reddit user known as 1tch has taken the time to gather the facts together showing that ‚ÄúOver Her 35 Years In Congress Maxine Waters Has Missed 90% Of Congressional Meetings.‚ÄùKnown in some circles as ‚Äúthe Poverty Pimp,‚Äù Waters has been peddling race baiting, socialist agenda‚Äôs, and a hatred for President that borders is obsessive, she has accomplished very little in her career.Even today, she finds herself above impeachment and was so terribly rude to one of her own constituents that watching the video of it is cringe worthy, to say the least.On top of that, she seems to imply that as a woman of color, she can not be thrown out of office.While the word ‚Äúcolor‚Äù may have been been ‚ÄúCongress‚Äù since she mumbles more than speaks, it is clear that race over substance matters is the Waters credo.Then again, when one attends only 10% of the meetings that are expected of them, there is not much other than skin color for her to drivel on about. She has not real record to run on, only that she is a minority.Thankfully, even other minorities are running against her and some of them have gathered outside her million dollar estate to show her their displeasure with her service.Still, America was well aware that Waters is nothing but a loud but unproductive member of the swamp, we just never knew how little time she spent there.Come to think of it, considering her views, it may, in fact, be better if she spent even less time there!Sources: Teddy Stick ‚Äì 1tch"

"CLOSE They took their Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan fandom to a whole new level. USA TODAY Sports  Former Olympian Tonya Harding  Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.  Harding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about ""taking somebody out"" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.  ""It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),"" Harding said in part of the interview that didn't run until the two-hour special Thursday night.  MORE: Tonya Harding threatens to end interview with Piers Morgan  The special comes as I, Tonya, a sympathetic look at Harding's life that is in theaters, has received critical acclaim.  But Harding's mother isn't fan.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a (expletive) about the movie,"" said LaVona ""Sandy"" Golden, who was played by Allison Janney in the movie. ""I don‚Äôt care how it portrays me. I could care less about that movie than the dirt outside.‚Äù  MORE: Harding, mother give differing accounts of abuse, drinking  Janney, who won the best supporting actress in a motion picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday, portrayed Golden as a physically and mentally abusive mother.  Golden admitted to using a hairbrush to ""spank"" Harding at a competition, but denied she was habitually abusive toward Harding. Golden also denied she ever threw a steak knife that struck Harding in the arm during an argument.  ‚ÄúTake a lie detector (expletive),"" Harding said in response to her mother's denials.  MORE: 5 things we learned on the set of the crazy Tonya Harding biopic 'I, Tonya'  Kerrigan bristled during her short segment on the special when asked if her popularity is owed to the attack in Detroit.  ""I have two Olympics medals,"" Kerrigan said. ""They didn‚Äôt just give them to me. I worked hard for it. Who in their right mind would ask to be attacked? I would never wish that anyone. If I could change that, would I? Of course I would.‚Äù  Harding didn't deny the incident helped create more of a buzz around U.S. women's figure skating.  ""Sure. Why not?"" Harding said. ""I mean, I was there. I skated.‚Äù  Harding was convicted of hindering the prosecution in the aftermath of the attack on Kerrigan. She was spared prison time, unlike Gillooly, Eckardt and two men who carried out the attack (Shane Stant and getaway driver Derrick Smith).  ""Enough apologizing,"" Harding said. ""She has her life. I have my life. We both have wonderful lives. That should be all that matters.""  PHOTOS: Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan"

"Here's some drama that's aged well.  To start, we just want to iterate that we don't condone violence of any kind.  Now that we've got that out of the way, we also weren't terribly upset to hear this story about how Jason Priestley once punched Harvey Weinstein in the face at a Miramax Golden Globes afterparty in 1995.  The actor tweeted that at the height of his Beverly Hills 90210 stardom, he got into a bit of a scrum with the now-disgraced movie mogul. The tiff escalated and ended with Priestley being hauled out of the party by security after he hurled a jab Weinstein's way.  The drama was dragged into the spotlight on Monday after Mira Sorvino tweeted her reaction to the confirmation that Weinstein had blacklisted her for rebuffing his advances, telling director Peter Jackson not to hire her or fellow actress Ashley Judd. ""There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure,"" she wrote.  In response to her tweet, actress Tara Strong speculated that perhaps Priestley had been blacklisted by the producer as well after he punched him in the face. Priestley replied that it probably was not true, as he did not work with Weinstein, but, for our reading pleasure, he recounted the details of their encounter 22 years ago.  ""Harvey told me I had to leave... I was leaving when he grabbed me by the arm and said 'what are you doing?'"" tweeted Priestley. ""I said 'you told me leave, I‚Äôm leaving.'""  Priestley continued that there was a bit more back-and-forth drama about whether or not Weinstein had told the actor to leave, and then things got heated and Weinstein got punched.  Some drama is truly timeless.  Read the full exchange below.  Just seeing this after I awoke, I burst out crying. There it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure. Thank you Peter Jackson for being honest. I‚Äôm just heartsick https://t.co/ljK9NqICbm ‚Äî Mira Sorvino (@MiraSorvino) December 15, 2017  IDK about that @tarastrong...

"The dragged-out divorce talks between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have hit yet another snag ‚Äî since Jolie wants to take their six kids with her to London to film the blockbuster sequel ‚ÄúMaleficent 2.‚Äù  Hollywood sources familiar with the film tell Page Six that Jolie is furious since she wants to bring the couple‚Äôs brood with her while the film shoots, at the same time their custody battle continues to brew since their 2016 split.  ‚ÄúThey are figuring out how it would work, but she is not happy,‚Äù said a source. The source explained, ‚ÄúShe wants to take the kids to London with her while she‚Äôs shooting ‚Äî and she‚Äôs frustrated with the process. They‚Äôre talking about how it would work.‚Äù  A source said that Jolie‚Äôs been so miffed by the situation, ‚ÄúEven the people around her are getting tired of it.‚Äù  The celebrity couple is privately still hammering out their split, including custody of their kids, Maddox, Pax, Zahara, Shiloh and twins Vivienne and Knox.  Page Six reported in February that talks were cordial, but they are still ongoing.  At the same time, Jolie‚Äôs next project, ‚ÄúMaleficent 2‚Äù ‚Äî the sequel to the 2014 original that made $759 million ‚Äî is gearing up.

She said Pitt ‚Äútold me exactly what he said‚Äù to Weinstein.  ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòIf you ever make her feel uncomfortable again, I‚Äôll kill you.‚Äô ‚Äù She told Stern the move was ‚Äúlike the equivalent of throwing him against the wall, energetically . . . he leveraged his fame and power to protect me at a time when I didn‚Äôt have fame or power yet.‚Äù  Related Video 1:30 Angelina Jolie went grocery shopping with the common folk"
"And while Kim and Kanye ""don't care"" about the song and think that it's ""pathetic"", the rapper is reportedly outraged that Tay has mocked the incident in her music video.  Vevo  ‚ÄúHe was upset that Taylor exploited Kim‚Äôs robbery,‚Äù a source close to the rapper told HollywoodLife.com.  ‚ÄúKanye feels like that was not cool because the incident was a very serious and dangerous situation.‚Äù  Ultimately, he ""just feels as though it‚Äôs something that Taylor shouldn‚Äôt have mocked.‚Äù  Kanye isn't the only one to have said this as many critics and fans have slammed Tay for making light of the robbery.  But at the end of the day, Tay hasn't *actually* confirmed that the scene is about the Paris attack.  It could have been a reference to her sexual assault trial as a single dollar bill can be seen in the tub which is all Taylor wanted from winning the case.  It could also be a nod to that time when Taylor made the following statement about the media:  ""Every single article had these descriptions of my personality that were very different from the actual personality and my first reaction was like, that's a bummer, this isn't fun for me. But then my second reaction ended up being like, hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about. 'She jetsets around the world collecting men and she can get any of them but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries and she gets another one in her web and she traps them and locks them in her mansion and she's crying in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls.' So I was like, I could use this...""  Vevo  So in summary: have a seat Kanye."

"A Married at First Sight star whose wife verbally abused him when they were off camera has revealed that they were getting a divorce following their latest blowup.  Jonathan Francetic, 29, watched his wife Molly Duff, 25, move out of their shared apartment immediately after he showed one of the show's relationship experts a recording of her calling him 'f*****g disgusting' during an argument.  On Tuesday night's episode of the Lifetime reality series, Jonathan and Molly both told their family and friends that they were getting a divorce after less than two months together.  Scroll down for video  Not-so-shocking: Jonathan Francetic, 29, and his wife Molly Duff, 25, told their family and friends that they were getting a divorce on Tuesday night's episode of the reality show  Drama: Jonathan recounted to his friend Blake how he and Molly had moved out after he showed one of the show's relationship experts a recording of her verbally abusing him  'It feels like failure,' Jonathan told the camera before meeting his friend Blake to share the bad news.  The former financial associate, who lost his job when he agreed to appear on the reality series, recounted how he and Molly had gotten into a fight during their recent trip to Florida.  Jonathan explained that he recorded her belittling him to show the experts because she was a completely different person when the cameras weren't rolling.  'We have already determined that we were getting divorced,' he told his friend.  'I've put so much into this marriage that I'm devastated,' he admitted in his testimonial.  Dunzo: 'We have already determined that we were getting divorced,' he told his friend  Awkward: The former financial associate, who lost his job when he agreed to appear on the reality series, also had to tell the other male participants about the divorce  Harsh words: Meanwhile, Ryan Buckley (left), 29, claimed that he wouldn't be heartbroken at all if he and his wife Jaclyn Schwartzberg, 29, got a divorce  Molly, meanwhile, failed to mention the recording when she told her sister Jenny that she had moved out of their apartment.  'It's very obvious at this point that we both want a divorce,' she said. 'He's made it very clear.'  Both Jonathan and Molly were dreading their separate get-togethers with the show's other participants because they knew they would have to admit that they were getting a divorce.  'I have to tell them my marriage is just over,' Jonathan said. 'I feel like a loser.'  He was once again forced to recount how he recorded Molly berating him and showed it to Dr. Jessica Griffin, who pointed out that it was verbal and emotional abuse.  Uncomfortable: Molly also felt awkward telling Jaclyn (right) and Shawniece Jackson, 29, that she was getting a divorce  Playing innocent: Molly once again glossed over specifics when she explained why she and Jonathan were giving up on their marriage  'Molly and I have already decided that it's a no,' he said. 'We both know that we are walking into decision day saying no.'  Although Jonathan and Molly were the only couple who didn't consummate their marriage, the other guys were understandably shocked by the revelation.  Meanwhile, Molly once again glossed over specifics when she told the girls that she had moved out and was getting a divorce.  She claimed their marriage couldn't work if their physical chemistry didn't increase, noting that Jonathan was unable to be patient with her without constantly blowing up over their lack of intimacy.  Towards the end of the episode, Jonathan had to tell his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were calling it quits.  Stressed: Jonathan was understandably nervous before telling his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were getting a divorce  Family ties: However, they were nothing but supportive after he shared his news  He explained that the visit was even more awkward because his mother had expected Molly to be with him. Cheryl was invested in their marriage and had already exchanged phone numbers with Molly's mom.  However, when Jonathan told them that he was getting a divorce, they were nothing but supportive. His stepfather even told him that he admired him for taking a chance on love.  Jonathan was the only person on the show who gave up his apartment for good, and now he was trying to figure out where to live.  'I don't have a job, so I can pick any place,' he joked. '[It is the] silver lining of being homeless and unemployed.'  While Jonathan was away, Jaclyn Schwartzberg, 29, went over their apartment to help Molly pack. Molly said she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could part amicably and leave the show in a good place, but he never responded.  Tough luck: When Jaclyn helped Molly pack her things, Molly revealed that she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could party amicably, but he didn't respond  Blindsided: Jaclyn was shocked when Ryan told her that he hadn't decided what he was going to say on decision day  The couple's breakup was weighing on the rest of the newlyweds, who were also unsure if they were on the verge of getting a divorce.  When he had the guys over to his apartment, Jaclyn's husband Ryan Buckley, 29, confessed that he was having trouble talking to his wife, explaining that she shuts down whenever he shares his concerns that their constant fighting was unhealthy.  Not only did he admit that he didn't feel close to her anymore, he claimed he didn't even care about her.  'If I were to cut ties, I honestly wouldn't be heartbroken at all,' he said, pointing out that it was a warning sign that he didn't feel anything when he thought about divorcing his wife.  Both Jonathan and Jephte Pierre, 26, thought Ryan was all over the place with his feelings and was likely acting out of fear.  Stunned: 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us,' she said  Back on? Just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day  Giving it another go: Ryan and Jaclyn shared a kiss after making up yet again  When Jaclyn returned home from her girls' night, he made it clear that he was on the fence about their marriage, which left her feeling blindsided.  'I am completely caught off guard,' she said in her testimonial. 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us.  'I know we've had our battles and our wounds, but I thought we were on the same page, so I am feeling very blindsided.'  Ironically, just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day as an apology for how he had been treating her.  And Ryan wasn't the only one going to extremes. Jephte also ended up picking a silly fight with his wife Shawniece Jackson, 29, after they had a disagreement over who would drive that day.  Trouble in paradise: Shawniece and Jephte go into a fight about who was going to drive  Confused: 'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she said in her testimonial  'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she asked, while her husband confessed to the cameras that her behavior had left him questioning whether or not she was the person he really wanted to be with forever.  Although Shawniece didn't believe it was a big deal that she decided she didn't want to take her car that day, Jephte thought it was a warning sign that she wasn't a woman of her word.  'I am still figuring out who she is, and I don't like when you say something and then do something different,' he admitted in his testimonial.  'I'm not sure if that's the person I want to be spending the rest of my life with,' he added.  Shawniece, on the other hand, seemed more confident in her own decision, but noted that the stress of the show's finale may have had a negative impact on her husband as he attempted to figure out his future.  Tense: Jephte admitted that he was not sure Shawniece was the type of person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, while she was nervous that he was going to ask for a divorce  Bouncing back: Although Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her  'Maybe he is just stressed out ‚Äî I guess about final decision ‚Äî so who knows?' she said of his behavior.  With decision day right around the corner, Shawniece was worried that their latest squabble could be a sign that they are headed for divorce.  'When he gets super annoyed with me, it just makes me really nervous and really scared for the future 'cause we only have a few days before final decision,' she says in her testimonial.  Although Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her.  'I am just proud that we are able to come back from the situation and be at the place where I know we can be,' Shawniece told the camera."
