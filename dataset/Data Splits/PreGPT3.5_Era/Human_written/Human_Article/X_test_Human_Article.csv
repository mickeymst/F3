"For those aspiring fairy-tale brides unable to shell out $180,000‚Äîwhich is what Disney‚Äôs ultimate fairy tale will set you back‚Äîthere are other, cheaper ways to feel like a princess. After their weddings, according to Otnes, Princess Diana and Kate Middleton each transformed the wedding-dress industry. ‚ÄúDiana got married in a big, poofy dress with puffed sleeves, Kate in a lacy, fitted gown. The dresses became immediate sources of emulation. There is a reason everyone is waiting with bated breath to find out what Meghan will wear,‚Äù said Otnes (who will be celebrating the wedding with her colleagues, wearing fascinator hats and enjoying a British high tea).  The fairy-tale wedding dates back to 15th-century Venice, when a writer named Giovanni Francesco Straparola invented what is now recognized as the standard happy ending. ‚ÄúBefore this point, at the end of fairy tales, you had the prince and princess living as hermits, not getting married, waiting to receive their ultimate rewards in heaven,‚Äù said Ruth Bottigheimer, a professor at Stony Brook University who specializes in fairy tales. ‚ÄúThe new happy ending takes place here on earth, and it takes the shape of a wedding.‚Äù Classic fairy-tale weddings involve at least one royal, Bottigheimer said, ‚Äúbecause that‚Äôs where the money is‚Äîthe power.‚Äù In mid-19th-century Germany, the era of the Brothers Grimm, fairy tales were widely taught in schools. At that point, Bottigheimer said, ‚Äúthe happily-ever-after plot gets injected into the whole European population.‚Äù  The fairy-tale wedding‚Äîas a consumable good, not a fictional happy ending‚Äîarrived in the United States in the 1950s, says Stephanie Coontz, a professor of marriage and family history at Evergreen State College. When World War II ended, marriage rates skyrocketed. Women, employed during the war while the men were away, left the workplace in droves and got married. In 1950, the average age of marriage for women was 20. ‚ÄúIf you waited four or five years after that, you‚Äôd be labeled a spinster,‚Äù Coontz said. In the midst of that pressure, the wedding industry identified an enormous opportunity, using ads to convince women that their wedding would be the biggest day of their lives. At the same time, Disney debuted its rendition of the world‚Äôs most famous fictional princess: When it came out in 1950, Cinderella‚Äîwhich ends, of course, in a gilded royal wedding‚Äîwas, by one count, the highest-grossing film of the year. And so began what Coontz calls ‚Äúthe relentless pursuit of the princess.‚Äù  There was something special about Cinderella. In the sweet girl next door who talks to birds and sleeps in the kitchen, Coontz told me, women saw themselves. ‚ÄúThis idea that someone who can support you at that level of opulence chooses you, instead of a blue blood ‚Ä¶ that is a very attractive fantasy,‚Äù Coontz says. Particularly after Grace Kelly‚Äîanother ‚Äúcommoner‚Äù (who, yes, happened to be a wildly famous actress)‚Äîmarried Prince Rainier of Monaco in 1956, the fairy-tale wedding suddenly felt, well, if not within reach, then at least something worth fantasizing about. The most recent royal marriages, according to Coontz, have been so popular because they play out the same storyline: Rich, royal dude swoops in to save a regular girl from a lifetime of oppressive normality. (Both Middleton and Markle were considered ‚Äúcommoners‚Äù at the time of their engagements, though genealogists have since claimed distant royal ties.) ‚ÄúIn the past, kings and princes couldn‚Äôt marry commoners, so there was no point in fantasizing about it much,‚Äù Coontz said. ‚ÄúNow we‚Äôve seen the idea of a ‚Äòlove match‚Äô become a reality.‚Äù"

"Karlie Kloss just announced she married Joshua Kushner on October 18 with a surprise wedding portrait on Instagram. The news arrives about three months after the model revealed she and and her longtime boyfriend became engaged.  The model has kept her relationship with Kushner fairly private since the pair began dating. While most people are aware of Kushner's famous White House connection, Kloss' husband is still a bit of an enigma. Here's everything you need to know about Joshua Kushner:  1. His brother is Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband‚Äîbut he doesn't share their politics.  Despite keeping a relatively low profile himself, Joshua's older brother, Jared, has been making a name for himself in the Trump administration as a senior advisor. However, Joshua doesn't share Jared's political views.  ""It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values,"" the 33-year-old revealed in a 2017 Forbes interview. ""But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.""  Forbes also reported that the Democrat did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election. According to The Daily Mail, ""Josh and Jared‚Äôs parents were Democratic donors until 2016.""  It seems as though Joshua shares his wife's political views‚ÄîKloss was vocal about voting for Hillary Clinton. She regularly gets involved in political campaigns, with Joshua supporting her at political marches including March for Our Lives in 2018.  2. He's been dating Kloss since 2012.  According to Bustle, Kloss and Kushner first met in June 8, 2012, with the model revealing on the same date in 2016, ""Four years ago today I met my best friend. I love you more everyday.""  Rumors about their relationship initially started when Kushner attended a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show afterparty in November 2012, with Us Weekly reporting via a source that, ""They are really cute together. [Kushner] seemed nervous and shy around everyone but handled it well. Karlie is stunning and the sweetest girl ever. She stuck close to him.""  Of keeping her relationship private, Kloss told Porter in April 2018, ""I know in my life what really matters to me. I'm not trying to hide that from the world; I just really like having a more private, private life. I've got nothing to hide, though!""  The couple recently made a rare public appearance together at the 2018 Met Gala.  3. The Kushner family's net worth is estimated at $1.8 billion.  Forbes estimated in 2016 that the Kushners were worth $1.8 billion, with their main sources of income being real estate ($1.15 billion) and venture capital investments ($420 million). $240 million of that share comes from Oscar, a millennial-focused health insurance company Josh founded in 2012. However, CNBC reported in March that the start-up is now valued at $3.2 billion.  According to Celebrity Net Worth, Josh Kushner's net worth is $800 million, although the accuracy of that exact figure is unclear.  Kloss' new husband also co-founded investment firm Thrive Capital, which has ties to Instagram. He's also a graduate of Harvard Business School.  Of his business ventures, Kushner told Ariana Huffington in 2015, ""It's incredibly difficult to build a business... I think it's important to kind of ignore when people say good things about you especially in this industry... Just be incredibly focused.""  4. Kloss converted to Judaism for Kushner.  A source revealed to People that in June 2018, Kloss converted to Judaism, a step which Ivanka Trump also took before marrying Jared. It's clear that the Victoria's Secret model is extremely serious about her husband.  5. He's not into fashion.  Way back in March 2013, Kloss told People that she was ecstatic that Kushner wasn't a part of the fashion world. She described her then-boyfriend as, ‚Äúso not in fashion. It‚Äôs really refreshing to leave all the fashion shows and shoots and chaos totally behind.‚Äù From the start of their relationship, it sounds like Kloss has been enjoying the quiet life with her new beau.  6. Kushner secretly proposed a few weeks ago.  People reports that Kushner actually proposed a few weeks ago in upstate New York. As insider told the publication, ""They‚Äôre both overjoyed and happily celebrating. Their hearts are full and they‚Äôre excited to build their future together.""  Both Karlie and Joshua revealed the news on their respective Instagram accounts in July 2018. Karlie wrote, ""I love you more than I have words to express. Josh, you‚Äôre my best friend and my soulmate. I can‚Äôt wait for forever together. Yes a million times over üíç,"" while Joshua simply captioned his photo, ""fianc√©e ‚ù§Ô∏è."" Karlie also shared photos of the ring on her Instagram Stories.  Since announcing the news, the couple has vacationed with David Geffen and Sir Paul McCartney in Italy, and are reportedly ""happily celebrating"" their engagement."

"Tom Petty, known for hits such as ""Free Fallin',"" ""American Girl"" and ""Into the Great Wide Open,"" died Monday. He was 66.

Petty died Monday after going into cardiac arrest. The singer-songwriter was 66 years old. As Cyrus said on ""The Howard Stern Show"" Wednesday, ""It's just really hard for me, watching those people that I grew up with leaving."" She sang a cover of ""Wildflowers,"" telling Howard Stern, ""The reason why I chose this song is because it's hopeful ‚Äî it's hopeful rather than mourning.""  Cyrus performed the song again on Jimmy Fallon's late-night show, this time backed by her father, Billy Ray Cyrus. ""You ready, dad?"" Cyrus asked her father before singing the final refrain.

""Blake‚Äôs through with Gwen‚Äôs neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,"" a source told In Touch Weekly .  ‚ÄúShe told him she didn‚Äôt want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.""

"Caitlyn Jenner thinks Ellen DeGeneres 'alienated' her from the LGBTQ community.  The 67-year-old American television personality, who was pictured out in Malibu on Thursday, appeared on the talk show host's popular show in 2015 after transitioning.  She admitted to Ellen that she had been hesitant to accept gay marriage in the past, prompting the blonde star to describe her guest's views as 'confusing' in a later interview with radio presenter Howard Stern.  In her memoir, The Secrets of My Life, which has been obtained by Radar Online, Caitlyn says Ellen, 59, asked in a 'friendly voice' to discuss how her views on marriage equality has 'progressed over the years.'  Scroll down for video  'Alienated': Caitlyn Jenner, pictured in Malibu on Thursday, has called out Ellen DeGeneres in her new memoir, The Secrets Of My Life  Blame: The 67-year-old accuses the talk show host of taking her stance on gay marriage out of context  Caitlyn wrote: 'I believed, as anyone would, that that was exactly what she wanted to talk about my progression in terms of changing attitude over the years.  'I am for it. I did not initially understand why marriage was so important, influenced no doubt by my own personal experience. Now I do, and it's a wonderful thing to see.'  'This discussion further alienated me from members of the LGBTQ community. Ellen's appearance on The Howard Stern Show, where in my mind she even more emphatically took what I said out of context, made it go viral.'  Start of it all: The 67-year-old reality star previously spoke on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in September of 2015 about gay marriage  The I Am Cait star - who has six children and has been married three times in the past - had admitted during her interview with Ellen that she was a 'traditionalist' who never used to approve of same-sex marriage, but her attitude had changed in recent years.  She said: 'I have to admit that I remember 15 years ago, 20 years ago, whenever it was that the whole gay marriage issue came up, I was not for it.  'I am a traditionalist. I mean, I'm older than most people in the audience. I like tradition and it's always been between a man and a woman and I'm thinking I don't' quite get it.  'But as time goes on, like a lot of people on this issue I've really changed thinking here, to I don't ever want to stand in front of anybody's happiness.'  She added: 'That's not my job. OK. If that word marriage is really, really that important to you I can go with it.'  When Ellen then accused her of being 'still a little not on board' with the idea, Caitlyn replied: 'No I'm on board. It's going to be pretty much the law of the land. So I still feel like yeah, I'm OK with it. I don't want to stand in front of somebody's happiness.'  DeGeneres later discussesd Caitlyn's comments in a radio interview.  'She still has a judgment about gay marriage,' DeGeneres told Howard Stern.  'I said, ""You're wanting people to understand and accept you, this is like really confusing to people. And you want us to understand, and that you still have a judgment about gay people and marriage."""

"Robert Pattinson surprisingly reunited with old flame Kristen Stewart on Feb. 11 and his ex FKA Twigs is weighing in on the meet up. Find out how she feels here.  Robert Pattinson, 31, and Kristen Stewart, 27, made headlines when they were seen hanging out together at a bar in Los Angeles on Feb. 11 and although their reunion shocked many people, it hasn‚Äôt seemed to do so for Robert‚Äôs ex-fiancee FKA Twigs, 30! ‚Äú(FKA) Twigs isn‚Äôt at all concerned about what Robert is doing,‚Äù a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. ‚ÄúShe basically doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge his existence or the fact that they were to together for three years. She was really hurt when they decided to split up, and she carried that with her for a couple months before she eventually got over it.‚Äù Woah! It‚Äôs hard to think that a couple who was once so close and adorable together is now seemingly strangers, but we can definitely understand Twigs‚Äô pain.  Although she‚Äôs trying to move on without Robert, it seems Twigs did really care for him when they were together. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to her feelings about him, she can admit that she did love him at one point, but all of her emotions towards Rob have fizzled,‚Äù the source continued. ‚ÄúWhat they had for each other ran its course and she couldn‚Äôt care less if Robert is linking up with Kristen, Katy (Perry) or whomever. Twigs is focused on her music and her career and she has no time for the negative energy.‚Äù  Twigs and Robert broke things off last Oct. after being together for more than two years and getting engaged in early 2015. Since then, the Twilight actor has been seen with pal Katy and a mystery blonde woman. We‚Äôre not sure who he‚Äôll end up with next, but like Twigs, it seems Robert‚Äôs trying to move on as best he can and we wish him nothing but the best!

"Update, 12:45 p.m.: Royal reporter Rebecca English clarified that the empty chair at the wedding wasn't a tribute to Princess Diana. Instead, it's protocol to leave the seat in front of the Queen empty.  Btw - I‚Äôve seen some reports about the spare seat by Prince William in the chapel as having being left in memory of Princess Diana. It wasn‚Äôt empty for that reason. The seat in front of the Queen is always left empty, I am told by BP #royalwedding ‚Äî Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) May 19, 2018  But even with the vacant chair aside, there were plenty of tributes to Princess Diana at the nuptials, including Meghan Markle's veil, her bridal bouquet, the floral arrangements, and the reading from Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana's sister.  Original post, 11:38 a.m.: About 600 guests filled St. George's Chapel for the royal wedding today, but one seat was apparently left vacant‚Äîand it's believed to be for Princess Diana. While following along with the nuptials, viewers noticed there was an empty seat next to Prince William on the royal family's side of the congregation. The supposed explanation? It was reserved for Prince Harry's late mother.    Getty Images  Royal fans got emotional over the tribute.  There‚Äôll be a lot of things said & written about Harry & Meghan‚Äôs wedding (and rightly so) but one of the stand outs - for me - was the empty seat right next to William ... for Princess Diana üò¢üíñ #RoyalWedding #HarryAndMegan #PrincessDiana pic.twitter.com/BuWbWRr9Rx ‚Äî Jason Reeves (@JaseReeves) May 19, 2018  As if we weren't fragile enough already, the empty seat next to Wills and all of the flowers were for Diana. #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/X1gesINDMK ‚Äî Cash√© Kidd (@CasheKidd) May 19, 2018  is the seat next to william empty because it‚Äôs meant for diana? #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/JmsoI0vpfC ‚Äî Snober Abbasi (@snobers) May 19, 2018  Someone else spotted an empty chair near William.

All three of her siblings were present at today's ceremony, and her sister Lady Jane Fellowes gave a reading.  The white roses in the floral arrangements were also included in honor of Harry's mom. He reportedly hand-picked Meghan's bouquet of forget-me-nots, his mother's favorite flower. Markle gave a sweet shoutout with her veil, which was reminiscent of Diana's insanely long ""monarch-length"" headpiece for her 1981 wedding to Prince Charles in 1981.  To top it off, Sir Elton John, a longtime friend of Diana, performed at the lunchtime reception  There was also apparently an empty chair left at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in Westminster Abbey seven years ago. Viewers at the time also speculated on Twitter that it was a nod to the groom's late mother.  Who's sitting in that empty chair to Camilla's left?

First and foremost, the Duke gave his bride his mother's engagement ring. They also visited her grave before their wedding day. The address was given by the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres, who knew Diana and spoke at her 10th anniversary memorial, Reuters reports. Finally, the hymn ""Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer,"" which was sung at the late princess' funeral, was also included in her son's royal wedding."
"Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards  Drake stole the show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in more ways than one, taking home 13 honors, surpassing Adele's mark as the artist with the most BBMA wins in one night, delivering a fiery performance in the middle of the famous Bellagio fountain and, maybe, getting himself a date after hitting on co-host Vanessa Hudgens during his acceptance speech for winning Top Billboard 200 Album for Views.  Watch  ""It's crazy that we're all here on earth for a limited amount of time, and we gotta show love while we're here,"" he said on stage midway through the telecast, before getting straight to the point: ""Vanessa Hudgens, you look incredible tonight."" (Hudgens acknowledged that shortly afterward by asking if she was on the invite list for Drake's afterparty.)  By then, Drake had already racked up 12 BBMAs -- 10 in the pre-telecast categories, and one earlier in the show for Top Male Artist -- on his way to a record-breaking 13 victories, which he achieved with the evening's final honor, Top Artist, to overtake Adele's previous record of 12 in 2012. It's an impressive number for an artist who utterly dominated 2016, shattering streaming records over and over again with the success of his album Views and its monster single ""One Dance"" featuring WizKid and Kyla.  ""Life is like toilet paper,"" he said while accepting his final award. ""Either you're on a roll, or taking sh-t from assholes.""  Cher was presented with the prestigious Icon Award and rolled back the years with a high-powered performance of her iconic songs ""Believe"" and ""If I Could Turn Back Time"" -- sporting, fittingly, completely different looks for each performance -- a day after her 71st birthday. ""I've wanted to do what I do since I was four years old, and I've been doing it for 53 years,"" she said with a humble air during her acceptance speech. ""I think luck has so much to do with with my success... I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in.""  Drake also won Top Hot 100 Artist, Top Billboard 200 Artist and Top Rap Artist, and took home awards for song sales, song streams and several rap and R&B categories on his way to lucky 13. Beyonc√© earned Top Female Artist, Zayn was awarded Top New Artist and Blake Shelton (Country), Beyonc√© (R&B), Twenty One Pilots (Rock), Juan Gabriel (Latin), The Chainsmokers (Dance/Electronic) and Lauren Daigle (Christian) and Kirk Franklin (Gospel) won top artist honors in their respective genres. Twenty One Pilots and Beyonc√© were also big winners on the night, with five BBMAs apiece, while The Chainsmokers earned four.  The show spent most of its three hours, fittingly, on performances and awards rather than hosting gimmicks, with 15 performances that ran the gamut of genres from hip-hop to pop to dance to rock to country. Nicki Minaj opened the show with a star-studded medley that included her Remy Ma diss track ""No Frauds,"" which she performed with Lil Wayne, David Guetta's ""Light My Body Up,"" Jason Derulo's ""Swalla"" and her own ""Regret In Your Tears,"" bringing out each superstar in turn. Camila Cabello and Miley Cyrus both delivered the live debuts of their new singles -- Cabello's first solo songs since leaving Fifth Harmony, an emotional-yet-brief ""I Have Questions"" and a heated-up ""Crying In the Club,"" and Cyrus' country-tinged comeback release ""Malibu"" -- while Lorde (""Green Light,"" performed as if at a goofy and awkward karaoke night), Sam Hunt (""Body Like a Back Road"") and John Legend (""Surefire""), who was then joined by Florida Georgia Line for a surprise joint rendition of FGL's ""H.O.L.Y.,"" all chipped in with memorable performances.  Hudgens was a natural in her first year as co-host alongside veteran BBMAs host Ludacris, and their monologue would have had her in the headlines regardless of Drake's unabashed flirting. In hyping the performances to come, Hudgens showed off both her pipes and rapping skills with a cappella versions of Celine Dion's ""Power of Love"" and Nicki Minaj's verse from ""Monster,"" impressing both Luda and the crowd in the process.  Speaking of Dion, the diva performed her iconic song ""My Heart Will Go On"" 20 years after its initial prominence as the main song from the blockbuster Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet film Titanic, navigating the challenging track effortlessly and earning an extended standing ovation. (Read Billboard's oral history of the song right here.) It was easily one of the standout moments of the night, and impressive in its emotion and vocal dexterity.  Diddy also took the stage to pay tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. on what would have been the rapper's 45th birthday and debuted the trailer for his upcoming Bad Boy Records documentary Can't Stop, Won't Stop. ""It all started with the Notorious B.I.G.,"" Diddy said, referencing Bad Boy's creation and the 500 million albums it sold over the past 20-plus years. ""Big sold over 25 million records worldwide; his Ready to Die album, his Life After Death album, classics... Biggie was the best rapper I ever had the chance to work with. Watching him and seeing him work is something that words can't explain.""  Bruno Mars, whose recent awards show performances have leaned more towards glitzy funk showstoppers like ""24K Magic"" and his excellent tribute to Prince alongside The Time during the Grammys earlier this year, took a different route for this one, getting passionate with his latest single ""Versace On the Floor"" as the show wound towards its conclusion.  But there was only one way it would end: with Drake complete his record-breaking evening with the top award to go with his new place in BBMA history. His huge night catapulted him into the top 10 of artists who have won the most Billboard Music Awards over the years, though he still has a way to go to catch Taylor Swift at 21. But with the March release of his playlist-album More Life already shattering records he'd set last year with Views, it's hard to imagine he won't be gracing BBMA stages for years to come."

The British actor, who was living in New York, had erased all trace of Steve from his Instagram recently.

"For other people with the same name, see Charles Murphy  Charles Quinton Murphy (July 12, 1959 ‚Äì April 12, 2017) was an American actor, comedian, and writer. Murphy is best known as a writer and cast member of the Comedy Central sketch-comedy series Chappelle's Show. He was the older brother of comedian Eddie Murphy and the older half-brother of Vernon Lynch Jr.  Early life [ edit ]  Murphy was born on July 12, 1959, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[3] His mother, Lillian, was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy, was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian.  As an adolescent, Murphy spent 10 months in jail.[4] In 1978, on the day he was released from jail,[5] he enlisted in the United States Navy and served for six years as a Boiler Technician.[6] In 1983, shortly before being discharged from the Navy, Murphy witnessed a mushroom cloud over Beirut. He later learned that it was the aftermath of the Beirut barracks bombing in which 307 people were killed.[7]  Career [ edit ]  Murphy had minor roles in several films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and worked behind the scenes with the hip hop group K-9 Posse, a duo composed of his half-brother Vernon Lynch Jr. and Wardell Mahone. On their 1988 self-titled debut, Murphy was credited as the album's executive producer as well as songwriter on the songs ""Somebody's Brother"" and ""Say Who Say What"".[8] He also made an appearance in the video for the duo's first single ""This Beat Is Military"".[9] Murphy's first major role in a motion picture was in the 1993 film CB4, where he portrayed the antagonist, Gusto.  Murphy achieved fame as a recurring performer on Chappelle's Show, particularly in the Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories sketches. In these, Murphy recounts his misadventures as part of his brother Eddie's entourage, including encounters with various celebrities such as Rick James and Prince.[10] After Chappelle's Show host Dave Chappelle left the show, Murphy and Donnell Rawlings hosted the ""lost episodes"" compiled from sketches produced before Chappelle's departure.  In 2005, he appeared in King's Ransom (alongside Anthony Anderson and Jay Mohr). In the film, Murphy portrayed ""Herb"", a gay ex-con who is hired by King (Anderson) to kidnap him in a fake kidnapping.[11] Murphy has done voiceovers for Budweiser radio commercials, provided the voice for Iraq War veteran/criminal Ed Wuncler III on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim series The Boondocks, and the voice for a pimp named Jizzy-B in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas video game. Murphy provided the voice for Spock on the G4TV's Star Trek 2.0 shorts, and the dog in his younger brother Eddie's 2007 film, Norbit.[12]  On March 20, 2009, his own sketch comedy series Charlie Murphy's Crash Comedy began on Crackle.[13] A stand-up special, Charlie Murphy: I Will Not Apologize premiered on Comedy Central in late February 2010.[14] Murphy also made special appearances in 1000 Ways to Die and the TBS sitcom Are We There Yet? as Frank Kingston. In 2014‚Äì15, Murphy played Vic on the Adult Swim live action show Black Jesus.[15]  Personal life [ edit ]  Murphy was a resident of Tewksbury Township, New Jersey.[16] He was married to Tisha Taylor Murphy from 1997 until her death from cervical cancer in December 2009.[1] The couple had two children together, and Murphy had another child from a previous relationship.[1] He was a karate practitioner.[17][18]  Death [ edit ]  Murphy died from leukemia on April 12, 2017, at the age of 57.[19][20]  Filmography [ edit ]  Films [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Video games [ edit ]"

"Christopher ""Big Black"" Boykin (January 13, 1972 ‚Äì May 9, 2017) was an American television personality and musician best known for his role on the MTV reality television series Rob & Big, in which he co-starred with professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek from 2006 to 2008.  Early life [ edit ]  Boykin was born on January 13, 1972 in the Southern US town of Raleigh, Mississippi.[1] He served in the United States Navy.[2]  Television career [ edit ]  In a skit for DC Shoes, professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek hired Boykin to be his bodyguard and to protect him from security guards.[3] From November 2006 to April 2008, he and Dyrdek starred in the reality television series Rob & Big on MTV.  In a 2006 episode of Rob & Big, Dyrdek and Boykin visit the studios of game developer EA Black Box in Vancouver to do motion capture for a video game in which they were to become characters. The game, Skate, was published in 2007. Boykin and Dyrdek also appeared in the 2009 sequel, Skate 2.

"All eyes were on Meghan Markle Saturday as she walked down the aisle ‚Äî and finally revealed her dress ‚Äî at her internationally anticipated wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor, England.  The 36-year-old American actress paired a Givenchy gown with a tiara from Queen Elizabeth and a 16-foot veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British Commonwealth.  Prince Harry looks at Meghan Markle, as she arrives accompanied by the Prince of Wales in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, May 19, 2018. Jonathan Brady‚ÄîPA Wire  While using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle‚Äôs wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy‚Äôs first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.  Markle‚Äôs dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.  Samantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.  ‚ÄúThe gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhile it isn‚Äôt beaded or embellished, two components that always signify ‚Äòexpensive,‚Äô the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.‚Äù  Dawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle‚Äôs wedding dress has an ‚Äúabsolutely American princess feel.‚Äù ‚ÄúHaute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,‚Äù she adds. ‚ÄúSafe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.‚Äù  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys‚ÄîPool/Reuters  The ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle‚Äôs wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.  Similarly, the wedding dress Markle‚Äôs sister-in-law ‚Äî Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge ‚Äî wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge‚Äôs wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate‚Äôs parents paid ¬£150,000 ‚Äî about $203,000 ‚Äî for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost ¬£250,000 ‚Äî about $338,000.  However, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.  ‚ÄúI think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,‚Äù she told ET.  But Markle didn‚Äôt have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana‚Äôs dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons."

Channing was seemingly trying to keep a low profile after hopping off a flight at Heathrow Airport, clad in a white Harvard Business School hoodie with maroon lettering. He shaded his face with a black baseball cap and appeared to be on the phone.  Backgrid  One day earlier, Jenna -- who was photographed without her ring two weekends ago in Los Angeles -- shared a sexy, lingerie-clad pic to Instagram. The snap garnered over 212,000 likes, including one from Channing!  ""A little R&R in my favorite @danskinapparel intimates,"" Jenna captioned it.  The professional dancer, also 37, shared an equally seductive shot to her Instagram Stories, accompanied with four pink heart emojis.  Instagram  As for the couple's actual separation, multiple sources have told ET that it was a long time coming.  ""They have been fighting the last couple of years -- quite a bit,"" one source claimed. ""There is a sense of relief on both of their parts. They have tried working on things and had therapy, but nothing changed.""  For more on what led to the Step Up stars' split, watch the video below.

"Matt Lauer may no longer be a part of the Today show family, but he still stays in touch with his former colleagues on the morning news program.  ‚ÄúYeah, we keep in touch with him,‚Äù Hoda Kotb, who replaced Lauer as co-anchor alongside Savannah Guthrie, told The Hollywood Reporter for its 35 Most Powerful People in New York Media 2018 issue.  Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire/Getty  ‚ÄúI mean look, this is one of those complex situations,‚Äù admitted Kotb, 53, who received a congratulatory text from Lauer when she was named co-anchor in early January. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known him since I started working at NBC [in 1998]. When I was sick with breast cancer, he was the first to call. He helps and helped in ways that ‚Ä¶ you know, he was incredible in that way.‚Äù  Though Kotb has fond memories of Lauer, 60, she isn‚Äôt discounting the stories of the women who came forward and accused the previous NBC anchor of sexual misconduct.  ‚ÄúThere is that Matt and then there‚Äôs the Matt that the accusers speak of. And those accusers‚Äô voices matter and that story matters and it‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ (to Savannah Guthrie) It‚Äôs still tough, right?‚Äù Kotb said in the THR interview to Guthrie, who affirmed: ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù  It‚Äôs been five months since Lauer parted ways with the show at the end of November after the network received a ‚Äúdetailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,‚Äù with reason to believe ‚Äúthis may not have been an isolated incident.‚Äù Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Guthrie and Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  ‚ÄúThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,‚Äù he said, in part. ‚ÄúTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.‚Äù  Speaking with PEOPLE following Lauer‚Äôs exit, Guthrie, 46, and Kotb opened up about sharing the sobering news with the world.  ‚ÄúI think you could see from the moment that the news happened that our hearts were broken, and in lots of ways, they still are,‚Äù Guthrie said. ‚ÄúThat feeling was shared through our whole newsroom and our whole Today show staff, because it sounds like clich√© or a promo line, but it happens to be true: We are family, and we do love each other, and families do go through hard times, and when that happens in good families, you just get closer. You pull together and you focus on the foundation and what keeps you together. I think that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve all been trying to do. And for me, I just am trying to get comfortable with how complicated the feelings around all of it are, and it is complicated. And just trying to have love and compassion for everyone concerned.‚Äù  Tyler Essary/Getty  The duo also spoke about Lauer, whom they are continuing to support and only want the best for.  ‚ÄúWe know he‚Äôs working on his family, we know that for sure. Of course our hearts go out to the brave women who have told their stories,‚Äù Guthrie said.  ‚ÄúWhat we are experiencing and processing now is how to honor and remain a true friend to someone even in spite of learning things that are deeply disturbing,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúAnd we are trying to navigate that path with integrity.‚Äù"
"Southern Charm star Kathryn Dennis dropped a bombshell on this season of the Bravo series, when she revealed she and her castmate Shep Rose had been secretly hooking up through the years.  So, during an appearance on Bravo‚Äôs Watch What Happens Live on Monday night, host Andy Cohen grilled Shep about his ‚Äòsexy times‚Äô with Kathryn. Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob‚Äôs behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show.  If you recall, Kathryn, 24, and Shep, 38, had a one night stand during season one of Southern Charm before Kathryn started dating Thomas Ravenel. Many fans of the show had thought it was a one and done deal until Kathryn revealed on this season that they had hooked up a few more times over the years.  First, Andy asked Shep who initiated their hookups again.  ‚ÄúWell, we met at one of my bars. And we had a couple of drinks and it was just like on fire again,‚Äù said Shep.  The question then turned to the number of times Shep and Kathryn have hooked up over the years.  ‚ÄúTotal? Probably like six or seven,‚Äù he revealed. ‚ÄúOriginally, I was [her booty call]. We were each other‚Äôs booty calls. Then she fell back with Whitney [Sudler-Smith] and Thomas, and I was like ‚Äòno, no, no.'‚Äù  Andy also wanted to know if the two go out on dates first before hooking up. ‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù laughed Shep, adding: ‚ÄúBut I would go on a date with her!‚Äù  Shep was then asked if anyone on the cast was aware of his secret hookups with Kathryn before it was revealed on the show this year.  ‚ÄúWell, yeah because I kind of stole her from Craig. Craig was courting her but he slept in her bed two nights in a row and didn‚Äôt try anything. And I was like ‚Äòwhat are you doing?‚Äô so I was like I‚Äôll try some things,‚Äù he stated , giving female fans of the show once more reason to love Craig !  Finally, Shep was questioned about Thomas‚Äôs girlfriend Ashley, who has received a TON of backlash this season due to the way she has treated Kathryn, which includes calling her an ‚Äúegg donor.‚Äù According to Shep, what viewers saw on the show is actually tame in comparison to what actually went down during the cast‚Äôs drama-filled vacation.  ‚ÄúShe was so emboldened and walking around like she owned the place, when what she should have been doing is ‚Äòhey, I‚Äôm really sorry about last night‚Äô because we were having a good time on Daufuskie Island,‚Äù said Shep. ‚ÄúWe were eating well and drinking well, and she said some things that were so inappropriate.‚Äù  He added, ‚Äúthe audience doesn‚Äôt even know the half of what she actually said.‚Äù  Shep also wondered why Thomas has yet to break up with Ashley, stating Thomas ‚Äúwould have all the support in the world if he said no thank you‚Äù to his relationship.

"Tom D‚ÄôAgostino isn‚Äôt having a lot of luck when it comes to managing to get away from drama. Following the divorce from his ex-wife, Luann De Lesseps, the Real Housewives Of New York City alum has found himself at the front of headlines once again.  In a report from Page Six, the publication claims the police are investigating him after a confrontation inside of a restaurant in Palm Beach.  However, another source stated neither Tom or his lawyers have spoken to police about such an inquiry. The source claimed, ‚Äúthere were a lot of people who saw what happened,‚Äù and the man who got into a fight with him is known around the town.  The perpetrator allegedly put his hands on Tom‚Äôs girlfriend, and after he got involved, there were drinks thrown at each other. The insider claims him, and his girlfriend left Cucina ‚Äì the restaurant they were eating at ‚Äì without problems or confrontations with the police.  The insider alleged that the reality star said he only regrets spilling his martini. It was a matter of protecting his girlfriend, so there‚Äôs no remorse.  As most fans know, Palm Beach is a special place in the heart of Tom and Luann. It‚Äôs the place where they got married during a New Years Eve party, an extravagant one at that.  Unfortunately, Luann and Tom separated just seven months later, and since then, Lesseps has found herself in serious trouble with the law. Celebrity Insider reported last year that Luann fought the police during a drunken endeavor on Christmas Eve morning.  Advertisement  As for their relationship, Tom said to E! News they ‚Äúfell in love,‚Äù but it ended quickly, and he was ‚Äúsad‚Äù that two people who loved each other are not an item anymore. He stated the stories perpetrated by the media make for good headlines and wishes Lesseps a happy future filled with love."
"How much did you spend on your actual home? Well, Miranda Kerr has already spent that much on the nursery for her unborn child, according to a new report.  Kento Nara/Future Image/WENN.com  A source told Life & Style that the model and her husband, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, have already dropped $250,000 on the nursery.  The insider tells the mag that the couple is ""super excited"" about welcoming a child into their lives, adding that the baby's nursery contains a custom-made crib and a walk-in closet filled with designer baby clothes from Dior, Stella McCartney, and Ralph Lauren.  ""She isn't holding back when it comes to giving her newborn the best of the best!,"" the source said.  Rex USA  On Nov. 15, the model's rep confirmed that she and her husband of 7 months are expecting. Some media outlets have reported that Miranda is pregnant with a girl, but the couple has not commented on the gender.  Miranda already shares 6-year-old son, Flynn, with her ex-husband Orlando Bloom. The exes have long said that parenting Flynn is their top priority. The former couple, who have remained friendly, have their parenting down to a science.  This will be Evan's first child. Thus far, Miranda and Evan have been able to successfully find a balance of career and marriage.  In speaking to Net-a-Porter's digital magazine The Edit in September, Miranda said, ""At work, I'm like, 'We need to do this!' and, 'This needs to happen!' But at home, I slip into my feminine and empower Evan to be in his masculine."""

"Following the deadliest mass shooting in American history, in which at least 58 people were killed and 500 wounded at a musical festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night, artists, actors and other celebrities from around the country are now using their platform in the hopes of advancing the conversation about gun control.  Since identified as Stephen Paddock, the shooter opened fire on a crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, stationed across the street from the outdoor venue where country singer Jason Aldean was performing at the time. The police uncovered at least 10 rifles in Paddock‚Äôs room, including hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Eric Paddock, the brother of the suspect, told reporters on Monday that Stephen Paddock legally owned ‚Äúa couple‚Äù of handguns and may have owned one long gun, ‚Äúbut he had them in a safe.‚Äù It‚Äôs still unclear how Paddock came into possession of so many rifles.  In a ten-tweet-long thread, John Mayer laid out a passionate argument for immediate change with regards to gun control. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to state my thoughts without the words ‚Äògun control‚Äô ‚Äòassault rifles‚Äô and others that stoke reflexive debate,‚Äù he began. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a logic and reason guy.

Lawmakers and influencers: if you‚Äôre not doing everything in your power to at least *reassess* the threat of mass murder, why can‚Äôt you come out and tell us that this is the life we‚Äôre going to have to accept? That these are the new terms? That it‚Äôs a fact of modern day life that from time to time we‚Äôll lose dozens of people in seconds? That daily life is a lottery system? And if you can‚Äôt say that, if it‚Äôs just too cold and brutal a thought to bear, then isn‚Äôt that proof you haven‚Äôt solved the problem yet?  He continue: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not at least trying to fix this, you‚Äôre effectively telling the country in your (in)actions that this somehow acceptable. There‚Äôs two moralities: morality identity and morality-in-action. Our greater moral identity doesn‚Äôt match our actions so far.9) If you‚Äôre not open minded to solving this, you‚Äôre morally surrendering us all to a very certain fate.

"For the Iraqi minister, see Mohammed Hadid  Mohamed Anwar Hadid (Arabic: ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿØ‚Äé; born 6 November[5] 1948)[6] is a Jordanian-American real estate developer of Palestinian origin. He is known for building luxury hotels and mansions, mainly in the Bel Air neighborhood of the city of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills in Los Angeles County, California.  Early life  Mohamed Anwar Hadid is a Palestinian[7][8][9][10][11] born in Nazareth[1] in November 1948, to a Muslim family. He is the son of Anwar Hadid (c. 1908 ‚Äì 1979) and his wife Khairiah.[12] Through his mother he claims descent from Daher Al Omer, Prince of Nazareth and the Sheik of Galilee.[13][14] Hadid has two brothers and five sisters.[12]  His father, Anwar Hadid studied at a Jerusalem teachers' college and attended a university[which?] in Syria to study law, before working in land settlement for the British authorities and teaching English at a teachers' college in Mandatory Palestine. In 1948, he moved to Syria and joined the United States Information Agency and the Voice of America. He and his family lived in Damascus, Tunisia, and Greece before moving to Washington D.C., as Anwar had a job at the VOA headquarters there, when Mohamed was 14, and spent the rest of his career there with VOA and USIA as a writer, editor and translator.[12][13][15]  Hadid attended North Carolina State University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.[1]  Career  Among his early ventures was a company that exported equipment to the Middle East.[6][16] He started his career restoring and reselling classic cars in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., before moving to Greece where he opened a nightclub on an island, and with the profits, started developing real estate back in the United States.[17]  In the 1980s, much of his financial clout came from the SAAR Foundation, a Herndon-based foundation with Saudi roots. The foundation was a 50-50 partner in many of Hadid's ventures.[16] In the late 1980s, he faced at least 30 lawsuits from creditors and banks claiming he had not fulfilled various financial obligations.[18] He paid $150 million for the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and New York. He also converted a Houston hotel into a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and developed a Ritz-Carlton resort in Scottsdale, Arizona. He outmaneuvered Donald Trump, paid $42.9 million for several choice parcels in Aspen and announced plans for a 292-room Ritz resort.[16][18]  In 1992, a settlement was reached in a lawsuit by Riggs Bank against Columbia First Bank Chairman Melvin Lenkin, a Hadid partner in a Washington, D.C., construction project that involved a loan on which Hadid defaulted. Following the settlement Hadid closed his local office, lost his McLean home to foreclosure, and left the Washington area.[19]  He developed Le Belvedere, a mansion in Bel Air, Los Angeles,[20] that sold for $50 million in 2010. In 2012, he developed The Crescent Palace, a 48,000-square-foot home on an acre plot next door to the Beverly Hills Hotel, which he listed for sale at $58 million.[21]  Shortly after Hadid received approval for the construction of a mansion in Bel Air, the Bel Air Homeowners Alliance, chaired by Fred Rosen, was formed to oppose it.[20] In January 2015, Nancy Walton Laurie, an heiress to the Walmart fortune and a Bel Air resident, filed a lawsuit through her company, LW Partnership, against Hadid.[22] Laurie accused Hadid of damaging the roots of a eucalyptus tree on her property with a retaining wall he built next to her house.[22]  In December 2015, the Los Angeles city council voted to pursue criminal charges over a claim that Hadid violated local zoning laws. The council alleged he built his house contrary to multiple planning orders and made it twice the permitted size.[23][24] In May 2017, Hadid pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges stemming from mansion-construction issues for which he did not receive city approval, and was sentenced that July to community service and fines.[25][26]  In July 2017, he was sentenced to 200 hours of community service, summoned to return $14,191 to the City of Los Angeles in damages, and fined $3,000.[27] He was also given a three-year probation period to ensure the property would comply with existing regulations, or he would face a 180-day jail sentence.[27]  Athletic career  Hadid competed in the demonstration sport of speed skiing at the 1992 Winter Olympics, representing Jordan. He was 43 years old at the time. Hadid was encouraged to participate by his friend, Austrian Olympic skier Franz Weber. Hadid was the only member of the Jordanian delegation,[1] and remains the only person to have represented Jordan in the Winter Olympics.[28][29]  Television appearances  Hadid has appeared on the TV show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, as the ex-husband of Yolanda Hadid.[21] He has also appeared on Shahs of Sunset.,[20] and Second Wives Club on E! with his fianc√©e Shiva Safai in 2017[30].  Personal life  His first wife was Mary Butler, with whom he had two daughters, Alana Hadid and Marielle Hadid. He and Butler ended their marriage in 1992.[31][32]  From 1994 until their divorce in 2000, he was married to the Dutch model Yolanda Hadid, n√©e Van den Herik.[33] They had three children, who all became models: Gigi (born 1995), Bella (born 1996),[32] and Anwar (born 1999).[34]  As of 2014, Hadid is engaged to Shiva Safai, a model and businesswoman. She was born in Iran and raised in Norway, and at age 19, moved to Los Angeles with her family.[35]  Hadid is a dual Jordanian-American citizen.[1] He does not consider himself a devout Muslim,[14] but has never drunk alcohol, although he does have a 5,000-bottle wine cellar, including some from his own Beverly Hills winery.[17]  In 2017, his fianc√©e, Shiva Safai, who is 33 years his junior, began to appear in E! reality show, Second Wives Club.[36][37]  References  Official website"

"Bonnie and Clyde pair get second chance after announcing La La Land instead of Moonlight at the 2017 Academy Awards  At the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are getting a mulligan: the Bonnie and Clyde pair will present the Oscar for best picture again, one year after they infamously announced La La Land, instead of the actual winner, Moonlight.  After Weinstein: why this year‚Äôs Oscars are make or break Read more  Last year Beatty and Dunaway presented the night‚Äôs top honor to mark the 50th anniversary of Bonnie and Clyde. When Beatty hesitated to announce the winner, visibly confused by the contents on the card, Dunaway read off La La Land as best picture. The mistake was attributed to the accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who mixed up the envelope for best actress, won by La La Land‚Äôs Emma Stone, with that of best picture.  For several minutes the mistake went unaccounted for, as the cast of La La Land gave speeches on the stage. Then, producer Jordan Horowitz corrected the record, telling the the audience there had been a mistake and that Moonlight had won the award.  This year, the Academy has streamlined its processes to prevent another mistake. But Beatty and Dunaway, evidently, will get a second chance to announce the prestigious award. On Thursday evening, TMZ learned that the two were spotted rehearsing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, where Dunaway said ‚Äúpresenting is better the second time around‚Äù. Beatty replied: ‚ÄúThe winner is Gone with the Wind.‚Äù  Other confirmed presenters during this year‚Äôs telecast include Sandra Bullock, Lupita Nyong‚Äôo, Emily Blunt, Armie Hammer, Tiffany Haddish, Jodie Foster and Gal Gadot, while the ceremony will again be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.

"It's a good time to be a '90s television fan, if only because the world has finally realized how much we miss our long-dead sitcoms. Full House is getting a spinoff series, Boy Meets World has a reincarnation in Disney Channel's Girl Meets World, and even the Magic School Bus is chugging back onto TV. So why not bring back Clarissa Explains It All? After all, the series launched Melissa Joan Hart's career AND provided us with endless hours of family-friendly entertainment, all told through the perspective of a savvy, colorfully dressed tween. We know where Hart is today ‚Äî she's back polishing off yet another sitcom with Melissa & Joey and will probably make a plethora of ABC Family TV movies in the near future ‚Äî but she's not the only person I want to keep track of post- Clarissa Explains It All . Whatever happened to Sam, aka actor Sean O'Neal?  I always wanted a BFF like Sam, if only because his mode of transportation (a ladder into Clarissa's bedroom window) always seemed pretty rad. The actor who played him, O'Neal, was in his early teens while on the show, and now is a full-fledged adult. So what has O'Neal been up to in his post-Clarissa years? There's not much out there about O'Neal's later years, but here's what I could find.  Noir  In 2001, O'Neal provided additional voices for an English dub of this anime series, as well as portraying the character Vint.  RahXephon  O'Neal also provided character voices for this anime series, which he worked on in 2002.  Development Hell  O'Neal appeared as a background actor on this 2013 web series about a production company.  Today  That's unfortunately all we know about O'Neal's post-Clarissa ventures in acting, but there are certain other things we do know about him. For example, we know that he is NOT the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club, though I'm sure it's been a struggle for the other Sean O'Neal to constantly explain to people that he was never on Clarissa Explains It All.  (You can see why we'd all believe it, though.)  Screencrush reported that when it was active, O'Neal's website said that after Clarissa Explains It All, ""he was approached to be the lead of a new boy band in Orlando in the vein of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync."" It would appear that such a band never happened, because I'm pretty sure all of Sam's many fans would've gladly bought his album ‚Äî and there's no record of it ever existing. Here's what appears to a recent photo of O'Neal, or at least, more recent than old Clarissa episodes.  So where'd you go, O'Neal? Are you secretly lying to the world and really ARE the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club? Have you gone into hiding because too many '90s girls want you to climb into their windows? Or are you just leading a perfectly happy, normal life somewhere out of the public eye? If you want to talk, feel free to drop me a line ‚Äî or better yet, just climb in through the window.

"Our not-so-secret secret is that we expect most, if not all, of our products to work double-duty. Cheek stain doubles as lip pigment, and brown eyeshadow helps fill in our brows. But, there's one tube in our makeup bags that could do so much more: concealer.  What we normally slather onto zits and undereye circles has many other applications. We tapped makeup artist Tina Turnbow to show us five techniques that turn our old cover-up into a highlighter, brow accent, lip definer, and more.  Ahead, find her step-by-step instructions for using concealer to get a gorgeous face. Don't you just love a good multitasker?  Hello, Highlighter  If you haven't plunked down the cash for a contour kit with a shadow powder and highlighter, your concealer could sub in a pinch. ""Make sure you're using one that's about two shades lighter than your skin tone,"" Turnbow says.    Start with your contour powder. Find your cheekbones, and slide the pigment just below them in a downward motion. ""It should end a couple of inches away from the corner of your mouth,"" Turnbow says.  Product used: Kevyn Aucoin The Sculpting Powder ($44; sephora.com)    Next, apply your concealer. ""It should create a halo effect around your eyes,"" Turnbow says. Use your fingers to pat it on along the tops of your cheekbones. Then, bring it up until it reaches just above the tip of your eyebrows. ""Look for a concealer with a radiant aspect to it,"" she says. ""This will help attract the light.""  Product used: NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, ($29; nars.com)    For your nose contour, use the same shadow you swept under your cheekbones. Focus it along the two edges of the bone. ""Start right under the ends of your brows, and bring it down to the tips,"" Turnbow says.    Your concealer should sit in the center of your nose. Swipe it in a downward motion, to the tip. Then, blend your three lines together. ""When you blend, make sure you're still able to see the product,"" Turnbow says. ""People tend to over-blend and erase the work they just did. Instead, just blur the edges so that they're less noticeable, but still there.""    The result is bright, beautiful, and so easy to do. It's contouring that works in real life‚Äînot the crazy sculpting you see on the red carpet all the time. [Read the full story on Refinery29!]"

Brad Pitt is one of Hollywood's most famous and well-loved actors, so it comes as no surprise that he has earned an incredible fortune throughout his successful career. With accolades ranging from an Oscar to the title of Sexiest Man Alive, the 54-year-old star is a true all-rounder in Tinseltown. According to The Richest, Brad is worth more than fellow Hollywood heavyweights Johnny Depp, Morgan Freeman, Robert De Niro, Bruce Willis, Mark Wahlberg and Harrison Ford.  So, exactly how much has the father-of-six amassed so far in his career? We take a look at his ventures in acting, producing, and brand endorsements, all of which have contributed to his fortune.

But weeks before graduating, Brad dropped out to pursue acting in L.A. His first gig in Hollywood was dressing up in a chicken suit at El Pollo Loco restaurant on Sunset Boulevard!  Brad kicked off his acting career in 1987 with appearances in the primetime US soap opera Dallas, as well as police drama 21 Jump Street. A year later, at the age of 24, Brad landed his first lead role in a film, starring as Rick, a young man with a rare skin condition, in The Dark Side of the Sun.  But it wasn't until 1991, when Brad landed his breakout role in adventure movie Thelma and Louise, that he became a recognisable face on the Hollywood scene.  On his way to becoming the acting icon he is today, Brad has starred in countless blockbuster movies, including The Ocean's Trilogy, Fight Club, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Troy.  Throughout his long-standing career, Brad has worked on some incredibly high-earning films. The Ocean's trilogy offered a reported salary of ¬£7.6million to its stars, who also included George Clooney and Matt Damon. The third instalment, Ocean's Thirteen, grossed ¬£237million.  Brad starred in Ocean's Eleven alongside Matt Damon and George Clooney  Brad's highest grossing film was World War Z (2013), which earned him an estimated ¬£10.6million and made a total of ¬£383million at the box office.

He co-founded the business with Jennifer Aniston, his wife at the time, and the late producer Brad Grey. Plan B Entertainment produced three Oscar-winning films: The Departed, 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight, as well as other popular flicks: Eat, Pray, Love, Kick-Ass and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. When Brad and Jennifer divorced in 2005, Brad became the sole owner of the company, and Brad Grey became the CEO of Paramount Pictures.  As of 2017, Plan B is thought to have a net worth of ¬£77,846.  Marriage and divorce from Jennifer Aniston  Brad and Friends star Jennifer Aniston met in 1998 after being set up by their agents, and made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 1999 Emmy Awards. The pair married in 2000, but five years later, Jennifer filed for divorce in 2005. It was reported that the couple reached a ¬£45million settlement, with Jen claiming ¬£22million, and Brad taking ¬£23.6million.

The pair soon became Hollywood's power couple and married in 2014 at Chateau Miraval the ¬£45million French mansion Brad had bought with Angelina in 2008.  'Brangelina', as they became known, had a combined net worth of ¬£304million ($400million) according to reports.  Brad and Angelina married in 2014  However, the pair split in 2016 after a reported incident on a private plane, which was thought to have involved their eldest son, Maddox. At the time, Angelina, 43, released a statement confirming that they had split for the ""health of the family"". Angelina reportedly did not request spousal support.  Despite their split, the pair have kept Chateau Miraval as an investment. The mansion is complete with a vineyard which produces Miraval Ros√© ‚Äì another source of income for the Jolie-Pitts.  Last year, Brad opened up about his split in an interview with GQ Style, saying: ""You've got a clich√©: 'If you love someone, set them free.' Now I know what it means, by feeling it. It means to love without ownership. It means expecting nothing in return.""

In 2012, he became the first man to represent the women's perfume brand Chanel No. 5. The luxurious label reportedly paid him ¬£5.3million.  He also raked in ¬£2.9million for starring in one TV advert for beer brand Heineken, which aired during the 2005 Super Bowl final.

"Photo by Steve Granitz via Getty Images  This Week in 2007 is a weekly column looking back on Lindsay Lohan, the first iPhone, George W. Bush, and everything else we loved about the year 2007.  Today, it's easy to forget how much America detested Spencer and Heidi, a.k.a. Speidi. Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad.  Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! ‚Ä¶ But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship‚Ä¶you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me ‚Ä¶ when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person‚Ä¶she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports. ""Actually, [Lauren] told MTV if they didn't stop filming with me she would quit and they told her then quit,"" he tells Broadly in a direct message. (Lauren's representative did not immediately respond to Broadly's request for comment.)  In the third season premiere, fans watched a similar party scene. At a club called Les Deux, Heidi hands Lauren a letter lamenting their dilapidated friendship. It does not mention the rumors. ""She won't fucking admit it,"" Lauren complains. She refuses to see her.  ""It's her problem,"" Heidi tells herself. But when Lauren flees the club, Heidi follows her.  ""You're not my friend anymore,"" Lauren tells her. ""I always feel bad for you,"" Heidi cries. She wants to know why Lauren hates her. ""You know what you did!"" Lauren cries in a scene that has become as memorable as the ""Nancy Jo, this is Alexis Neiers calling"" video.  It was one of the few moments of real drama on a show that mostly consisted of plotless scenes and beautiful shots of Sunset Boulevard. Speidi come across as manipulative villains, while Lauren seems genuine. But during her promotional tour, Lauren went on Regis and Kelly to discuss the ""big split."" The feud was the best thing to happen to The Hills: The episode premiered to a record-setting 3.6 million viewers. Speidi later admitted to ""producing"" drama behind the scenes to boost ratings. There's a reason Spencer and Heidi have become the media's go-to experts on reality TV."

"Taylor Swift has hit the road! The pop star kicked off her highly anticipated ‚ÄúReputation‚Äù world tour last night in Glendale, Ariz.  Taylor kept to her true self during the opening show and had a little real-talk moment with her fans about bullying and her reptile theme ‚Äî there were a lot of snakes at the concert. The singer explained she hit a low point when ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù called her a snake on social media. She even considered giving up music altogether, but she turned the scandal into a teachable moment with her fans.      Though Taylor didn‚Äôt use any names, it‚Äôs easy to assume who she‚Äôs talking about in the video. During the height of the great Taylor Swift-Kanye West feud of 2016, Kim Kardashian dissed the singer on Snapchat in a series of videos, and she did it on National Snake Day.

"We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico‚Äôs border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration‚Äôs National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA‚Äôs term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.Smugglers‚Äô creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.Our rulingPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico.

"Strip That Down is the debut solo single by English singer and songwriter Liam Payne, featuring guest vocals from American rapper Quavo. It was released as the lead single for his forthcoming debut studio album on 19 May 2017, via Capitol Records in the UK and Republic Records in the US.[3] The song was written by Payne, Ed Sheeran‚Äîwho contributes uncredited vocals to the song, Steve Mac and Quavo. It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 23 May 2017.[4] The song's accompanying music video was released on 2 June 2017. The lyrical content is supposed to reflect Payne's freedom to venture into raunchy musical elements after departing from the British-Irish boy band One Direction.  Background [ edit ]  ""Strip That Down"" features a guest appearance from Quavo (pictured), from the Atlanta-based hip hop group, Migos  After One Direction went on a hiatus, Payne, who co-wrote songs on each of the group's five albums, intended to focus only on songwriting. He told Billboard:  To be honest with you, I wasn't going to do a solo venture. I was just going to go into songwriting and carry on and do that. But then I was like, 'You've been trying to do this since you were 14 years old. You would be ridiculously stupid to turn down the option to have a deal.' Coming out of the band, we had some pretty good opportunities around us. I had to do something.[5]  The singer met Ed Sheeran in London in late summer of 2016, ""We went in, sat around and discussed a bunch of things about life, and [the song] basically just came together,"" said Payne. After working with Sheeran and producer Steve Mac, Payne decided to add Migos member Quavo into the mix as the song's featured artist.[5] While talking about how that collaboration came together in an interview with iHeartRadio, Payne said; ""I was thinking, like rapper time, it was going to take two or three weeks. But, we got it, played it straight away, and we were like, 'We absolutely love it.' He's a great man to have on the team.""[6]  Composition [ edit ]  Ed Sheeran (pictured) co-wrote the song and provided uncredited vocals to it. ) co-wrote the song and provided uncredited vocals to it.  ""Strip That Down"" is a trap and hip hop-influenced[7][8] pop and R&B track. Payne croons over ""pulsating"" synth-bass and chants with minimalist production style. Lyrically, the song contains themes of wealth, celebrity appeal and newfound career independence.[9] While talking about the song, Payne said; ""It just sets a few things straight, but then also the chorus is more about stripping back the music. I like to hear it loud sometimes, but sometimes you got to strip it back.""[6] For the concept of the song, Payne stated that they contemplated what Justin Timberlake would release as his debut solo single in 2017.[10]  ""Strip That Down"" contains an interpolation of 2000 single ""It Wasn't Me"",[11] written by Orville Burrell ""Shaggy"", Rikrok, Shaun Pizzonia, and Brian Thompson. ""It Wasn't Me"" interpolates War's ""Smile Happy"", composed by Sylvester Allen, Harold Ray Brown, Morris Dickerson, Lonnie Jordan, Charles William Miller, Lee Oskar, and Howard E. Scott. Therefore, they are also credited as songwriters.[12]  Critical reception [ edit ]  Rolling Stone staff called it a ""summer club banger"".[13] Writers from Billboard thought Payne ""seems to be aiming for a DJ Mustard/Tyga vibe,"" and concluded that ""the song's fun: The swaggering, Directioner-baiting pre-chorus especially, which is probably the JT-est thing any of the five members have done since going solo.""[14] Comparing it to One Direction's catalogue, Jordan Harris from Express and Star opined it ""is a lot more danceable, incredibly fun to listen to"" and added, ""Another similarity, and one which Liam would do well to use as a benchmark going forward, is the vocal style of Justin Timberlake.""[15] In Digital Spy, Laurence Mozafari wrote ""the song screams of trying to be grown up.""[16] Time magazine listed ""Strip That Down"" as one of the worst songs of 2017.[17]  Music video [ edit ]  On 18 May 2017, the lyric video for ""Strip That Down"" was uploaded to Payne's Vevo channel. The music video for the song was released on the same channel on 2 June 2017. The video was directed by Emil Nava.[18] It starts with a female dancer performing, followed by a black-and-white scene with Payne. As the video transitions from black and white to colour, it shows Payne in a neon world of bright lights, dancing, and an appearance from featured artist Quavo.[19]  Reviewing the ""sleek, colorful"" clip, Rolling Stone staff wrote: ""Payne rocks gently in what appears to be the inside of tanning bed.""[13] In Digital Spy, Justin Harp opined Payne ""sheds One Direction's wholesome image in the sexy music video,"" and added, ""The promo clip does exactly what it says on the tin, as the former boybander demonstrates his newfound hip-hop vibe while slinking around with twerking back-up dancers.""[20] Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that the video is ""as awkward as the song"", saying: ""The Migos rapper appears completely at ease in his surroundings, while Liam looks like he accidentally wandered on to the set.""[21]  As of November 2018, the video has over 280 million views on YouTube, becoming Payne's first Vevo-certified music video outside of One Direction.  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Strip That Down"" charted within the top 5 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single reached number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated 16 September 2017, becoming Payne's first top ten as a solo artist and Quavo's fourth. With his top ten, Payne became the third member of One Direction to achieve a solo top 10 single on the Hot 100, following Zayn and Harry Styles. In addition, One Direction joined The Beatles, Fleetwood Mac, and New Edition to have at least 3 members with solo Hot 100 songs reach the top 10.[22]  On Billboard's Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart, ""Strip That Down"" reached number one in its 4 November 2017 issue for both artists, marking a first for Payne as he became the first solo artist from an all-male vocal group to top this chart (as he has charted as a member of One Direction, whose ""What Makes You Beautiful"" peaked at number 13 in May 2012); he also eclipsed his fellow members, three of whom also had top tens on this chart (two from Zayn, one each from Horan and Tomlinson respectively; Styles' debut ""Sign of the Times"" peaked at 37 in June 2017). In the case of Quavo, it surpassed his featured collaboration (with Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper and Lil Wayne) on DJ Khaled's ""I'm the One"", which peaked at number two in July 2017.[23]  Live performances [ edit ]  On 26 May 2017, Payne performed the song for the first time on The Graham Norton Show.[24] The singer also performed ""Strip That Down"" at the Capital FM's Summertime Ball on 10 June,[25] on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on 22 June[26] and at the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards on 12 November 2017.[27]  Track listing [ edit ]  Digital download[28]  ""Strip That Down"" ‚Äì 3:24  Digital download ‚Äì Acoustic[29]  ""Strip That Down"" (Acoustic) ‚Äì 3:04  Digital download ‚Äì Nevada Remix[30]  ""Strip That Down"" (Nevada Remix) ‚Äì 3:44  Charts [ edit ]  Certifications [ edit ]  Release history [ edit ]"

"It took them two years, a superhero franchise and a countless trips to the Brentwood farmer‚Äôs market, but Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck have officially filed for divorce.  The couple apparently coordinated their filing sans lawyers, according to TMZ, which was first to break the news, with Garner sending her court papers in Thursday and Affleck responding shortly after.

"Amy Schumer is now married! According to Us Weekly, the comedian tied the knot in a secret ceremony with her boyfriend, Chris Fischer, this week.  The star-studded wedding apparently took place on February 13, right before Valentine's Day, at a rented house in Malibu. Us Weekly says that a ""comedian officiated the nuptials,"" and a slew of celebrity guests attended, including Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Lawrence and Judd Apatow.  Schumer shared several photos on Instagram, including this cute snap with Lawrence:  Instagram  According to The Blast, Jake Gyllenhaal was also there, and the reception apparently ""featured a huge seafood bar where guests dined on oysters."" There was a strict no-photos policy, though, so we're unlikely to see any snaps on social media.

"Thomas Markle Sr will miss Saturday‚Äôs ceremony in Windsor in order to focus on his health  Meghan Markle has ended the intense speculation over the royal wedding by confirming that her father will not walk her down the aisle when she marries Prince Harry on Saturday.    In a public statement the American actor spoke of her sadness that Thomas Markle Snr, 73, who is said to have undergone heart surgery on Wednesday, would miss her wedding on medical advice.    Within hours, however, the wedding show was back on track, with the royal couple seen arriving at Windsor Castle to have tea with the Queen.    Markle‚Äôs mother, Doria Ragland, 61, who is now favourite to walk her daughter to the altar at St George‚Äôs chapel, is expected to meet the Queen on Friday and is understood to have had a private meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall on Wednesday after flying in from Los Angeles.

I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.    ‚ÄúI would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.‚Äù    Planning for the wedding is entering its final day. Markle and the prince arrived in Windsor hours after a full dress rehearsal, watched by thousands who lined the route of the planned carriage procession around the town.  Markle is said to be distressed that her father, a retired award-winning TV lighting director who lives in Mexico, has found himself under intense pressure from the media. The impact on him personally is said to be her main concern, rather than the impact of his absence at the meticulously planned event.    Both she and the prince, who has yet to meet his future father-in-law, are understood to have been in contact with him in recent days.    Kensington Palace has faced criticism over perceptions it has not sufficiently protected both parents from media intrusion. Markle‚Äôs estranged half-sister, Samantha Markle, 53, has claimed their father has been terrorised by paparazzi.    Sources said extensive private security and media advice had been given to the parents from the moment Markle‚Äôs relationship with Harry became public. Markle‚Äôs comment that she has always ‚Äúcared‚Äù for her father may be interpreted by some as alluding to this private support the couple are said to have been giving him.    The developments began on Sunday when her father was accused of staging paparazzi photographs of himself.

It quoted him as saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm OK. It will take a long time to heal. Staying in the hospital a few more days. Not allowed to get excited.‚Äù    Kensington Palace has refused to give a rolling commentary on the slew of reports emanating from TMZ. But by Thursday Markle felt she owed it to the public to clarify the situation.    Neither she nor Harry have responded to criticism aired by other members of her family, which has recently dominated the media, and it is clear they have no intention of doing so."

"At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites ‚Äî including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. ‚ÄúGwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,‚Äù a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. ‚ÄúBlake sang a lot in her direction.‚Äù At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: ‚ÄúTheir dog was having puppies and they couldn‚Äôt wait to get home!‚Äù  For now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. ‚ÄúBlake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,‚Äù an insider shares in the new issue. ‚ÄúTheir feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they‚Äôve decided to not focus on it for the time being.‚Äù  Stefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it‚Äôs made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is ‚Äúabsolutely devoted‚Äù to Gwen‚Äôs sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: ‚ÄúBlake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.‚Äù  Shelton‚Äôs devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. ‚ÄúBlake has always wanted children,‚Äù explains a friend. ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs great with Gwen‚Äôs kids, which prompted them wanting their own.‚Äù  The No Doubt singer was all in ‚Äî but not anymore. ‚ÄúNot because of a change in her love for Blake,‚Äù explains the source, ‚Äúbut because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.‚Äù The country star is on board with her thoughts. ‚ÄúHe is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,‚Äù shares the insider.  With no baby, they‚Äôve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, ‚ÄúGwen is very traditional and wouldn‚Äôt want to be pregnant without being married.‚Äù  Still, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. ‚ÄúTheir relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,‚Äù explains the source. ‚ÄúThe need to get married and have kids isn‚Äôt the priority it once was.‚Äù  When the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.  Now, the pair have settled in to an ‚Äúeasy, effortless love‚Äù together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton‚Äôs Oklahoma ranch ‚Äî something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? ‚ÄúGwen loves hanging out with Blake‚Äôs friends and wives,‚Äù says the source. The low-key loves enjoyed a couples‚Äô trip with pals in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, this January.

"Amal Clooney has given birth to twins, Ella and Alexander, Clooney‚Äôs publicist to the Associated Press. The boy and girl are the first children for the attorney and her husband, George Clooney.  Clooney's rep has also already weighed in with some humor:  Julie Chen, a friend of the couple, first announced the Clooney‚Äôs pregnancy news on her CBS show, The Talk, in February. Since then, Amal Clooney has been spotted with her husband at the Cesar Awards in February and at the United Nations in March; she has been continuing her work as a human-rights lawyer, which she has done since the early 2000s.  George Clooney, who was one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors before marrying Amal in September 2014 at the age of 53, told People in February that his friends, whose children are all grown and in college, had taken to jokingly ribbing him about his late-in-life fatherhood. Despite the quips from his pals, Clooney was ready to take on the challenge.  ‚ÄúLook, it‚Äôs exciting,‚Äù Clooney said. ‚ÄúAnd we‚Äôre really happy and really excited, and it‚Äôs going to be an adventure.

"The Washington, D.C. region boasts some of the best golf experiences on the east coast.  The D.M.V is home to some best country clubs in the world including Congressional C.C., who was recently awarded eight PGA of America Championships.  But let‚Äôs remember there‚Äôs a strong presence of public courses as well, especially north of the beltway and west of Baltimore.  We‚Äôve selected five categories for the best of public courses in that specific region and recently did a segment on DC Sports Live detailing these: 1) Best 18th hole, 2) Best View, 3) Best Value, 4) Best 19th Hole, and 5) Best Par 3.  Ranking Maryland's best public golf experiences  Best 18th Hole:  No. 18, Par 5, 547 yards. Whiskey Creek Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md.  As golfers, let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôre greedy. We always want to end with a birdie. The 18th at Ernie Els and J. Michael Poellot-designed Whiskey Creek in Ijamsville, Md. gives that possibility.  There‚Äôs no other finish quite like it in the region. A picturesque tee shot with a view of the clubhouse is only slightly interrupted by a memorable obstacle sitting smack in the middle of the downhill par 5‚Äôs fairway: an old stone house.  It‚Äôs the remains of a Prohibition-era farm that used to distill whiskey and float the barrels down the creek to load in wagons (hence the name Whiskey Creek).  But enough of the history lesson, let‚Äôs remember that the house is part of the course. You read that right. You‚Äôre free to play it where the ball lies, even up against the stone wall should your drive land there. But you can also take an unplayable drop.  ‚ÄúYou can opt for the safe (tee) shot and hit it to the right of the house which gives you a longer shot in or forces a layup,‚Äù Head Golf Professional Michael Jerolamon says. ‚ÄúYou could also go left of the house which gives you a good opportunity to go for the green in two.‚Äù  What if you can‚Äôt make up your mind?  ‚ÄúI always jokingly tell guests to just aim at the house and swing as hard as you can so you miss it just right or left.‚Äù  The green is protected by a small pond with bunkers front, back, and left that come into play even more the further out you are on your approach.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great finishing hole because there‚Äôs a huge risk/reward,‚Äù Jerolamon says.  More info: Whiskeycreekgolf.com    Best View: Honorable Mention  From the elevated clubhouse at P.B. Dye Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md.  ""The view from the clubhouse overlooking pretty much the entire course is probably the best view, looking into Sugarloaf Mountain,"" says Head PGA Pro and General Manager Jon LeSage.  ""You can see 16 holes, kind of like at Oakmont C.C., you can see the majority of the course.""  The most scenic hole is the downhill par 3 11th with its island green and the surrounding hills behind it.  The course also boasts a nice practice facility with three simulators.  Upcoming events include the 10th Annual Turkey Day Shootout November 10, benefitting Toys for Tots, and the 1st Annual P.B. Dye Cup which launches on November 9, an 11 a.m. shotgun start.  More Info: pbdyegolf.com    Best View:  From the clubhouse, looking in any direction. Musket Ridge Golf Club, Myersville, Md.  I don‚Äôt know about you, but my favorite part of every golf course is the views. Musket Ridge has no shortage of those, from the 200-foot elevation drop on the first to the vast panoramic views from the clubhouse looking over the foothills of the Catocin Mountains.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre unquestioned,‚Äù Head Golf Professional Josh Ricketts says of the views. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the finest piece of property in Frederick County for sure.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to be the best view and setting in most of Maryland public golf, if not the best.‚Äù  And it‚Äôs not just about the golf as there are numerous events and weddings held at the course‚Äôs Catoctin Hall, also perched near the clubhouse.  ‚ÄúBut the setting is not only for the golfer, but for the general public who want a nice, relaxing spot to come out and take in the view,‚Äù Ricketts said.  A full-service bar and restaurant are available there as well with a strong food and libations selection.  Upcoming events include Annual Turkey Shoot November 18 and Toys for Tots on December 1.  More info: Musketridge.com    Best Value: Honorable Mention  Northwest Golf Course, Silver Spring, Md.  Hosted 2017 US Open Local Qualifying, a couple Nike Tour and Buy.com Tour events in previous years.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great championship course that the public has access to,‚Äù General Manager Billy Cullum says.  Weekday rates: $37-$50 to ride, $22-$35 to walk  Weekend rates: $37-$85 to ride, $22-$60 to walk  More info: Mcggolf.com  Little Bennett Golf Course in Clarksburg, Md.  Big doglegs, Elevation drops, risk-reward, forced carries off tee ... Little Bennett brings the heat.  And the view from the clubhouse deck overlooking the ninth and eighteenth greens is pretty sweet.  ‚ÄúWe have a really good deal on weekdays that can‚Äôt really be beat anywhere else,‚Äù says General Manager Jeff Blake. ‚ÄúYou get green free, cart, fee, range balls, lunch included, and free replays if it‚Äôs available, all included for $41.  So I think that right there is one of the better deals in the area if not the best deal for public golf courses up here.‚Äù  More info: Mcggolf.com  Best Value:  Compass Pointe Golf Course in Pasadena, Md.  Variety, nice views, good course conditions and layout for the price. It‚Äôs hard to beat Compass Pointe Golf Course. It‚Äôs got 36 holes and prices vary between $38-$50 for 18 on weekdays. $44-$68 for 18 on weekends.  One of the major factors for value here is the large grass driving range. You‚Äôd be surprised how many of the public courses in the region that don‚Äôt have this option.  It‚Äôs huge, especially for those of us who want as real a pre-round warmup as possible. The Two courses are the North (6,709 yards from the blue tees, 133 Slope) and West Course (6,590 from the blues, 128 Slope).  ‚ÄúThe North course is the most popular side,‚Äù says General Manager Michael Senneca. ‚ÄúThe first five holes are set up like a links-style golf course.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Westside is more of a shot makers course. Most golfers have to hit less than a driver on many tees.‚Äù    The courses are run by Billy Casper Golf.  More info: Compasspointegolf.com  Best 19th Hole:  Whiskey Creek Golf Club, Ijamsville, Md.  The best hole in golf is always the 19th. Doesn‚Äôt everyone want the end of their personal emails to say ‚ÄúSent from the 19th hole‚Äù? I know I do.  One of my favorite parts of the game is the people and the story-telling and camaraderie that comes during and after the round.  Whiskey Creek has a sweet spot for this. They‚Äôve got a large deck that veers around three sides of the clubhouse to see the finishing holes on each side.  When you‚Äôre called Whisky Creek, you‚Äôd expect a generous selection of whiskey.  But this place takes it to another level with $13 Scotch Whiskeys, $12 Bourbon Whiskeys, and $9 Rye Whiskeys, and a full-service restaurant as well that feels like you‚Äôre in a ski lodge.  More info: Whiskeycreek.com  Best Par 3:  No. 17 188 yards (blue tee). Worthington Manor Golf Club, Urbana, Md.  A gorgeous, severely downhill par 3 set in the only densely wooded area on the course. 223 yards from the back tees, this hole is a brute. Most of the course is open so if it‚Äôs a windy day then you‚Äôve got some math to do on this tee box.  Not only do you factor in the major elevation drop, but how much the tall trees are likely to keep the wind down.    A big bunker guards the left side and thick rough surrounds the rest.  ""The green is very narrow, and when the pin‚Äôs in the back it‚Äôs a very difficult hole,"" Head Pro Ed Coyle says. ""You don‚Äôt have much room for error.""  ""Short is your only real bailout. If it‚Äôs a calm day, it‚Äôs usually a club less down the hill.""  It‚Äôs one of the prettiest settings in this region. And the course is phenomenal as well with a 19th century Manor turned-clubhouse and a rustic barn turned-cartbarn.  Worthington Manor is proud to have hosted U.S. Open qualifying for ten years and will be only the third public course in 98 years to host next summer‚Äôs Maryland Open.

But it came through in a way of like, taking accountability to some extent for her actions,‚Äù Henry informed the American Drifter author. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm thinking that it might have been even her way of kinda trying to come through and say, ‚ÄòHey, this is something that I‚Äôm putting more on myself.‚Äô So, I don‚Äôt think he killed your grandmother.‚Äù  E!

"Advertisement  The royal family gathered this morning for a traditional Easter Sunday Service - at the chapel where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will marry on May 19th.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, expecting their third child within weeks, broke usual protocol by arriving after the Queen at the Easter Mattins Service at St George's Chapel in Windsor.  The couple eschewed the downhill walk and took a royal car to the entrance, arriving several minutes after the Queen, who also arrived by car and was travelling without the Duke of Edinburgh, 96, who did not attend the service.  Although Meghan and Harry also chose not to appear at the chapel where they'll tie the knot next month; the Queen, dressed in cerise, was joined by Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward, with Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall all also in attendance for the seasonal service.  Arriving without husband Mike Tindall and daughter Mia Grace, Zara did take the short downhill walk, showing off her blossoming bump in a blue bespoke S√©raphine coat and hat by Jane Taylor as she chatted with Princess Beatrice, her sister Eugenie and husband-to-be Jack Brooksbank at the chapel's entrance.

Despite being eight months' pregnant, the Duchess has yet to park her favourite heels and finished off her smart look with a pair of towering caramel-hued shoes and matching clutch purse.

"Margot Tenenbaum, now 21 weeks pregnant. (Photograph by Katherine Wolkoff)  Manhattan, of course, has long been proudly gaunt, inhabited as it is by legions of celebrities, socialites, fashionistas, and those who would be them (remember Edith Wharton‚Äôs ethereal creatures, Lily Bart of the ¬ìlong, light step¬î and the ¬ìslender pink nails¬î? Slender nails?). Only in the past few years, however, have the ¬ìbump,¬î the ¬ìbasketball,¬î and the ¬ìbelly on two sticks¬î entered the local lexicon. Blooming stars now strut the red carpet at the Oscars and pregnant supermodels flaunt their exposed bellies, while Us Weekly, People, and the Star intrepidly report on who has stayed admirably attenuated (Gwyneth Paltrow, Sarah Jessica Parker) and who has not (Debra Messing, Kate Hudson). In late spring, the hot gossip swirled around paparazzi shots of Paltrow emerging smilingly (triumphantly?) svelte from a London hospital. The conspiracy theory was that she hid out in the hospital for a few weeks after giving birth¬óthere‚Äôs just no way she could‚Äôve lost so much weight so quickly. The pregnant-celeb watch is about to reach a new peak this fall, as Julia Roberts waddles¬óshe‚Äôs having twins; she can‚Äôt help it¬ótoward a January due date. Toss into this roiling mix the Atkins and South Beach diets¬óthe latest devotionals in New York‚Äôs Church of Divine Diminishment¬óand you‚Äôve got a freshly minted group neurosis. You‚Äôve also got an unnerving question: Are women starving their babies by starving themselves?  W ay back when, in the late fifties, a woman as tortured as Sylvia Plath could be at her sunniest when she was ¬ìcow-heavy and floral.¬î Today, the prevailing attitude toward the extra flesh of maternity verges on disgust. A sampling of what women tell me they do not want to be while pregnant: ¬ìa fat slob,¬î ¬ìa huge blob,¬î ¬ìsloppy,¬î ¬ìhorrible like Kate Hudson,¬î ¬ìfucking gross.¬î Tenenbaum‚Äôs language is less harsh (¬ìmushy¬î is her preferred pejorative), but she has the same fear of becoming almost offensive, of not measuring up. She keeps worrying, she says, about an upcoming vacation with her husband‚Äôs family. There‚Äôs no way she wants to expose her girth in a bathing suit, but then she wonders if they‚Äôll think she‚Äôs ¬ìashamed¬î of her body if she swims in shorts and a shirt. ¬ìAnd maybe I am ashamed,¬î she says.  Berger sympathizes. ¬ìThe last time I got weighed [at the OB‚Äôs], I was really pleased the nurse just wrote the number in my chart and didn‚Äôt say it out loud, because it was so . . . If you knew how much I weighed, you‚Äôd be like, ¬ëOh, my God!‚Äô ¬î  In conversations with several dozen more pregnant women and new mothers, I was repeatedly struck by how fixated they are on the new pregnancy ideal, how much they lap up the praise if they ¬ìachieve¬î it, how anxious they are if they don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs a jungle out there, and only the scrawniest survive.  Beth Dorfman, a second-trimester periodontist, was so concerned about blowing up, and about eating healthy in general, that she consulted nutritionist Tanya Zuckerbrot early in her pregnancy (Zuckerbrot says she‚Äôs seen a significant increase in the number of women who come to her for weight-related reasons). ¬ìI remember shopping with my mother and I thought, ¬ëThese random people walking past me on the street, I wonder if they think ¬ìHmm, that girl might be pregnant,¬î or ¬ìThat girl might just have eaten seventeen cupcakes an hour ago,¬î ‚Äô ¬î Dorfman says.  Zuckerbrot advised Dorfman to eat more protein and fiber (pregnant women can go Atkins, by the way, as long as they eat some carbs) and turned her onto the miracle that is Scandinavian fiber crisps. ¬ìThey‚Äôre like sixteen calories a cracker,¬î Dorfman says. ¬ìThey‚Äôre not the tastiest¬óa nice bagel or bread would taste better¬óbut they satisfy some of the craving and fill me up.¬î Dorfman promptly began eating three of the Scandinavian crisps topped with peanut butter and jelly for breakfast. Even her peanut butter is diet, she says. ¬ìIt‚Äôs not Skippy Reduced Fat; it‚Äôs even lower fat than that, like 2.5 grams per serving.¬î All the calorie counting is a necessary evil, says Dorfman. ¬ìWhen you‚Äôre pregnant, you‚Äôre only supposed to eat 300 more calories per day,¬î she says, citing a common recommendation. ¬ìThat‚Äôs not much. One of those Dannon Light ‚Äôn Fit yogurts, that‚Äôs 100 calories right there.¬î  When it comes to exercise, so many women rhapsodized to me about spotting a sublimely trim pregnant woman exercising her butt off at the local Equinox that I began to wonder whether clever health-club marketers were fitting trainers with fat pads. Meredith Paley, a vice-president at Kenneth Cole whose daughter, Ava, was born in July, is one of those who attracted gawkers. Her pregnancy-workout schedule: spinning on Tuesdays, body sculpting Wednesdays, one or two other random gym visits a week, and five-mile Central Park runs on Wednesdays, Fridays, and both weekend days. Because Paley knows that doctors recommend that pregnant women keep their heart rates under 140 beats per minute (to keep sufficient oxygen flowing to the baby), she says she always wore a monitor and walked when the number got close. A serious runner, Paley volunteers several times that intense exercise is natural for her, what makes her feel good. Still, she says, ¬ìI‚Äôm the first to admit that I didn‚Äôt see pregnancy as an excuse to sit on my ass and let the pounds come.¬î  One maternity researcher says she Ô¨Ånds her subjects‚Äô weight-restrictive behaviors unnerving. ¬ìThe pregnancy and delivery is all about them. If you can‚Äôt invest in your baby by gaining weight, I think it‚Äôs a harbinger for lack of investment in the child.¬î  Dorfman, also an avid exerciser, is frustrated by the heart-rate cutoff. ¬ìIf the doctor says 140, I want to go to 137¬óthat‚Äôs just the type of person I am. I‚Äôm not going to jeopardize the health of my child, but I‚Äôm on the treadmill like, God, I‚Äôm not even sweating. I feel like it‚Äôs not doing anything.¬î  This kind of superfit patient has become increasingly common, says Upper East Side obstetrician Shari Brasner, during the ten years she‚Äôs been in practice. She mentions a third-trimester patient who blew by her running in the park recently (¬ìIt was unbelievable¬î), and one who, after developing a painful nerve cluster in her foot, cut a hole in her sneaker rather than step off the treadmill. The doctor says it‚Äôs not hard to spot which patients are tormented by their expansion: ¬ìThey take ten minutes to remove every last bit of clothing, down to the rubber band on their ponytail, before getting on the scale.¬î  Julie Tupler disavows the idea that women should be skinny or diet during pregnancy, but there‚Äôs no denying that her classes attract those who are serious about flab. ¬ìYou‚Äôre not supposed to gain ten pounds in the first trimester,¬î says Patty Surak, who was eight months along, ¬ìbut I did.¬î On a recent Tuesday afternoon, Surak and five other very pregnant women were assembled for a Tupler session, outfitted in oversize T-shirts and black exercise pants. One staple of Tupler‚Äôs class is a sort of pregnancy-safe sit-up. The group‚Äôs homework is 500 a day.  ¬ìWhat‚Äôs the magic word for next week?¬î Tupler asked.  ¬ìOne thousand,¬î the group replied in unison.  ¬ìYou can start doing these again right after the placenta comes out,¬î Tupler said. ¬ìI had one student who even did it before!¬î  A s is probably obvious by now, it‚Äôs not just how much weight women gain but where they gain it. Like Dante‚Äôs levels of hell, there‚Äôs a hierarchy of bad to worse. Level 1: All extra adipose tissue is smartly confined to the stomach. (¬ìThat‚Äôs the baby‚Äôs body, not yours,¬î says mother and academic body watcher Susan Bordo, author of the recently rereleased Unbearable Weight: Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body.) Level 2: Your breasts get big, too, but nothing else. (¬ìI know a lot of women who get pregnant who are very flat-chested, and it‚Äôs like heaven to them,¬î says Tenenbaum, who‚Äôs already well endowed and hasn‚Äôt felt the thrill, though her husband apparently can‚Äôt get enough: ¬ìHe‚Äôs like, ¬ëYour boobs! They‚Äôre so big! It‚Äôs great!‚Äô ¬î) Level 3: Your butt and thighs puff up, or become ¬ìrumply¬î (one UrbanBaby mother‚Äôs lament). And finally, Level 4: Your face and ankles swell, a fate that befell 34-year-old publicist Katie Pottinger. ¬ìMy entire body widened. My face, I wouldn‚Äôt even say it was puffy; I mean, it really blew out. There was a thickening,¬î she says, ¬ìthat happened all over.¬î  The skinny-pregnancy set also lives to be told they‚Äôre having a boy. Under the old anti-feminist canard straight out of Grimm‚Äôs, girls ¬ìsteal¬î their mother‚Äôs looks. ¬ìI was like a preening peacock when people told me ¬ëYou must be having a boy,‚Äô ¬î says Kate Walsh, an associate editor for Metropolitan Home and the new mother of a very female Evelyn. Diana Becker, a soft-spoken 28-year-old legal secretary, got the other end of the deal: ¬ìYou must be having a girl,¬î a neighbor lady informed her. ¬ìWhy?¬î Becker na√Øvely asked. ¬ìBecause people get fat all over when it‚Äôs a girl.¬î"

The ‚ÄúNo Tears Left to Cry‚Äù singer is known for using black hearts on social media, especially in the wake of her split. After a fan asked Grande if the symbol had a hidden meaning, the pop star simply stated that it was because she was feeling ‚Äúempty.‚Äù  ‚Äújk i‚Äôm empty and my heart is black now so,‚Äù she tweeted on Nov. 15.

"Left, by Victor Chavez/Getty Images; right, courtesy of FilmMagic/Getty Images  Hot on the heels of the engagement betwen long-time Game of Thrones couple Kit Harington and Rose Leslie comes news that their 21 year-old cast mate, Sophie Turner, is also engaged to her boyfriend of just under a year, singer Joe Jonas. While Harington and Leslie announced their news in a very old-fashioned and traditional way (a notice in The Times!), the social media-savvy Jonas and Turner revealed their news Sunday via carefully coordinated Instagram posts.  Loading View on Instagram  Loading View on Instagram  Jonas and Turner have been dating since at least last November and went public just this past January. Playing coy about her relationship at the Golden Globes that month, Turner flashed a bejeweled finger for the camera and joked: ‚ÄúAnd my engagement ring that isn‚Äôt really an engagement ring.‚Äù The very famous couple have kept their relationship low key ever since; Jonas attended the Los Angeles premiere of Game of Thrones this past summer with Turner but didn‚Äôt walk the red carpet by her side.

"A lot of the cast and I have discussed that we think it should be a girl, says star Dacre Montgomery of Tommy possibly showing up in the next film.  [Warning: This story contains spoilers for Power Rangers.]  Want to know if a film might be having a sequel? Then stay seated! Just because the movie's over and your popcorn is finished doesn't mean that's all that's in store for you.  Power Rangers, which hit theaters Friday, is following the Marvel Studios trend by featuring a little something extra.  ""There's a post-credits scene, so people should stay,"" the film's director, Dean Israelite, tells The Hollywood Reporter, adding, ""It teased up the direction of what the next movie could be. For people that know the brand, it‚Äôs super exciting. There are so many ideas we‚Äôre kicking around in the direction of where the film leads you.""  And it looks like the film is hoping to morph toward a sequel by introducing a key character in the story about the Rangers. In the post-credits scene, the teacher in detention does roll call. And there's one person he can't find on the list: Tommy Oliver. The teacher repeatedly announces the name Tommy Oliver, and the camera cuts to a green coat sitting on an empty chair in detention.  Oliver is no stranger to Power Rangers fanatics. In the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV series, the character was introduced as the Green Ranger, who is actually, at first, an enemy to the other Rangers while he's a new student at Angel Grove High School. In the franchise, the character has also had a varied amount of story development, including being elevated to being the White Ranger and becoming a love interest for the Pink Ranger. In fact, in the new film, the actor Jason David Frank (who played Oliver) appeared alongside original Pink Ranger actress Amy Jo Johnson in a cameo during the final battle.  As for the new Tommy, with the green coat in the scene, he will likely be the Green Ranger at the start. But wait a minute: The character doesn't necessarily need to be a he. And according to Dacre Montgomery, aka the new Red Ranger, the cast is campaigning for Oliver to be female.  Montgomery tells THR, ""A lot of the cast and I have discussed that we think it should be a girl. It makes it even: three girls, three boys.""  He adds that the scene is ambiguous and actually leaves the door open for this to happen.  ""It‚Äôs left blank. It‚Äôs a cliff-hanger. Whoever you‚Äôre going to drop into that position ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs a girl ‚Äî it‚Äôs inevitably going to create drama. It‚Äôll be interesting to drop that drama into it and see how we all relate to it and work with it,"" says the star.  So what do you think? Should the new Tommy Oliver be female? And who should play her? Chat about it in the comments section below, and stay tuned to Heat Vision for more Power Rangers coverage."

"In Beyond The Wall, the latest episode of Game of Thrones, viewers were given an exciting new revelation about the deadly White Walkers. Kill one of the icy villains, it transpired, and all of the wights created by that particular Walker will instantly drop dead. (Well, permanently dead.)  Regenerating resistance leader-turned-wight hunter Beric Dondarrion was quick to take things a step further, speculating that if the Night King himself were to be eliminated, all of his creations ‚Äì the entire army of the dead and possibly the Walkers too ‚Äì would disappear too. ‚ÄúKill him. He turned them all,‚Äù he urged Jon Snow.  As theories go, Dondarrion‚Äôs is a fairly tempting one, that hints at a neat resolution to the series and a climactic final battle between the Night King and one of our heroes (most likely Jon). It also seems unlikely that the episode would have included this line, or allowed the character to voice the thought, if it wouldn‚Äôt later prove significant. But would the showrunners, not to mention George RR Martin, who wrote the famously brutal source material novel series, really make things quite so easy for us?  Our own (joyously, unashamedly crackpot) interpretation of the scene is that, while the ‚Äúkill the Night King, kill his army‚Äù theory may indeed prove to be the case, it‚Äôll come complete with its own tragic catch."
"I, at least, struggle to understand her career. Her performance as a junkie in ‚ÄúThe Town‚Äù features the ‚ÄúBride Wars‚Äù of Boston accents. Her performance in ‚ÄúThe Age of Adaline‚Äù ‚Äî as a woman ‚Äúcursed‚Äù to stay 30 forever ‚Äî was like watching a mermaid ride a bike. She tries. But her acting hasn‚Äôt yet caught up to her algorithm-generated beauty. Alas, there may be no algorithmic solution for that.  So I was less than psyched at the prospect of seeing her shiver on a buoy, stitch her own wounds, talk to animals or play a Nancy. And, as refreshing as it is watching her stand on a surfboard, it‚Äôs refreshment that provides some perspective. While some actors make sense on movie screens, there are others who might make better sense on a can of something ‚Äî beer, beans, air. I can hear you, Hudson skeptics. And all I can say is that the heart wants what the heart wants. I‚Äôd actually buy whatever Ms. Hudson was on the can of.  There might be no appreciable industrial difference between what a Kate Hudson can do versus your Blake Livelys. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre interchangeable, but sometimes the movies beg to differ, and the market corrects itself. Don‚Äôt fall in love with Mark Harmon, because here comes Kevin Costner. And sell your Brad Rowe stock, because he‚Äôs just going to be replaced by Brad Pitt. (In the late 1990s, that pretty much happened.) But there are continuums, too. Channing Tatum, for instance, is a more elastic, hip-hop-era Brendan Fraser upgrade.  Lots of parts that have gone to Ms. Lively feel as if Ms. Hudson could have played them. But something happened, and suddenly it was someone else‚Äôs turn to be ‚Äúit.‚Äù (It‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs turn.) And part of what annoys me about the lack of Kate Hudson in my life and the surfeit of Ms. Lively is the same thing that makes me angry when a perfectly good piece of software gets a superfluous update, or a zealous waiter takes my plate at a restaurant: I wasn‚Äôt done with that."

According to a press release for Diana, 7 Days, Prince William and Prince Harry will share their first reactions to the news of their mother‚Äôs death, memories of the public mourning period, their reactions on the day of the funeral, personal memories of their mother, and what she meant to them both then and now.  ‚ÄúWhen she died there was such an outpour of emotion and love which was quite shocking,‚Äù Prince Harry says in the documentary. ‚ÄúIt was beautiful at the same time, and it was amazing now looking back at it. It was amazing that our mother had such a huge effect on so many people. When you‚Äôre that young and something like that happens to you, I think it‚Äôs lodged in here, there, wherever ‚Äî in your heart, in your head, and it stays there for a very, very long time. I think it‚Äôs never going to be easy for the two of us to talk about our mother, but 20 years on seems like a good time to remind people of the difference that she made, not just to the Royal Family but also to the world.‚Äù  Diana, 7 Days is executive-produced by Alison Kirkham and Peter Dale for the BBC, and produced by Singer, Jenny Saunders, and Jessica Ludgrove."
"George Soros‚Äîthe Billionaire investment banker who has admitted to manipulating the financial markets in Asia, the UK, Greece, and Russia has finally gone too far.You see Mr. Soros has become persona non grata across the globe for his role in destabilizing country‚Äôs economy‚Äôs and financial markets. He does so for the sole intent of lining his own pockets at the expense of others.George Soros now lives in the United States and has been involved in many of the anti-Trump protests around the country. He has paid salaries and housing for many of the leaders of Black Lives Matters group, in addition to paying young people to protest Donald Trump in multiple big cities across the U.S.He has done this before in different countries throughout Europe and Asia. Basically, he causes massive financial chaos in a country, cashes in on it, and moves to the next one.Russia was once a victim of his demented financial upheaval. Back in the ‚Äò90‚Äôs he wrote a letter that besmirched the Russian currency and said it was overvalued. Investors immediately panicked and dumped the Russian currency. The results of which pushed Russia into a financial depression which ultimately benefitted the billionaire in his deep, greedy pockets.Ever since then Russia has held a grudge against Soros. Although it took years, Russia‚Äôs president Vladimir Putin officially issued an international arrest warrant for George Soros for his role in collapsing Russia‚Äôs currency and the resulting financial meltdown.Now, as an American citizen, it is a bit tricky to remove him, but when Trump takes office, it may completely change. We‚Äôll have to see. To learn more, check out the provided video below."

"(WENN) -- Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have reportedly agreed on a settlement in their divorce.    According to editors at TMZ, the estranged couple has been locked in a complicated and time-consuming battle over their property, which has prevented their divorce from becoming final.  Ben and Jennifer did not have a pre-nuptial agreement in place, so all their earnings during their marriage had to split equally.  The superstar couple, who split in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children - Violet, 12, Seraphina, nine, and Samuel, six.  Sources told the gossip site that the final settlement will be filed with the court once Gone Girl star has finished his stay in rehab.    The 46-year-old actress showed up at Ben's Pacific Palisades home in California on Wednesday afternoon and allegedly begged him to get help for his ongoing alcohol abuse issues. She told waiting photographers to give the couple privacy, and said ""it was not a good time"".  Jennifer was then spotted leaving with the actor/director and a person believed to be a sober coach and drove Ben to an unnamed rehab facility.  Friends of the star tell Page Six Ben has been ""struggling"" with sobriety since breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus, and it was photographs obtained by The Blast showing him taking a delivery of alcohol that reportedly forced his ex to take action.  In recent days, the Justice League star has been linked to 22-year-old Playboy playmate Shauna Sexton.  Despite the fact they split in 2015, Jennifer and Ben have remained close, but the double Oscar winner was noticeably absent from his estranged wife's Hollywood Walk of Fame star unveiling ceremony on Monday."

"The Dutch King Has Been Living A Secret Double Life As An Airline Pilot  Breaking news today implicates the leader of one of the world‚Äôs most respected democracies in a scandal involving years of deception right underneath the noses of the very people he‚Äôs meant to serve.  No ‚Äî I‚Äôm not talking about the orange-skinned man living in the White House, I‚Äôm talking about the leader of the House of Orange, King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands. And as far as ‚Äúscandals‚Äù go, it‚Äôs downright adorable.  You see, King Willem-Alexander has been piloting KLM aircraft incognito for the last 21 years. Really. Per Sky News:  The king of the Netherlands has revealed he has been living a secret double life as a co-pilot for a commercial airline.  For 21 years, King Willem-Alexander has taken to the skies twice a month to ferry passengers around on short-haul services for the Dutch airline KLM. Although travellers may have recognised the monarch‚Äôs voice as he updated them on weather conditions and their time of arrival, the royal‚Äôs presence was never revealed. This is your captain (and your King) speaking‚Ä¶  The BBC adds that, prior to ascending to the throne in 2013, it was an open secret that the then-Prince would appear as a so-called ‚Äúguest pilot‚Äù on KLM in order to maintain his pilot‚Äôs license, but:  What was not clear was that he was co-piloting passenger flights incognito, twice a month as king, often with KLM Captain Maarten Putman. The Dutch government said last month that he had flown Fokker 70 aircraft for both the government and KLM Cityhopper service, and that the plane was being replaced this year with a 737. Cityhopper flights are aimed mainly at business travellers in dozens of European destinations, particularly in the UK, Germany and Norway.  Well, if I didn‚Äôt love KLM and the Netherlands enough as it is already, this is the cherry on top. How charming, thoughtful, quirky and so thoroughly Dutch of the King, and KLM, to ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù fly passengers on short hops around Europe. Best of all, few seem to have been the wiser despite his PA announcements!  I‚Äôve flown with royalty before (well‚Ä¶ Motown royalty), but never by royalty!  If you regularly fly on KLM, do you think you might have been flown by the King of the Netherlands before?"

"After six seasons, Miami‚Äôs Raul Esparza has left NBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit‚Äù where he played assistant district attorney Rafael Barba.  During Wednesday night‚Äôs episode, Barba found himself as the defendant after committing a mercy killing or what he called ‚Äúa justified homicide‚Äù of a brain dead toddler. Although the character (spoiler alert) was found not guilty, he decided to leave his job as an ADA.  In a Tweet to the show‚Äôs fans and his co-star Mariska Hargitay, Esparza wrote, ‚ÄúGoodbye Barba. Thank you. You changed my life. My squad. And you, you always, my Liv, my friend Mariska. I will always treasure my time with all of you.‚Äù  Barba was a popular character on the long-running procedural where he was a by-the-book, no-nonsense attorney. In the role, Esparza, who is Cuban-American, also used his Spanish in some scenes. Many of his scenes were with Hargitay discussing the details of a case in his office and in court. Wednesday night, the hashtag barbaontrial was trending about the episode as fans and cast members were sad about the actor‚Äôs departure from the show.  What‚Äôs next for Esparza, who graduated from Belen Jesuit Prepatory School in Miami in 1988?  After playing the same role on NBC, he‚Äôs returning to his theatre roots for a ‚ÄúChess‚Äù revival at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C., according to Entertainment Weekly.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a theater guy, so it‚Äôs like having a script in front of you that keeps changing every time you go to do it,‚Äù said Esparza, who has had roles in the 2000 ‚ÄúThe Rocky Horror Show‚Äù revival on Broadway as well as ‚ÄúCabaret,‚Äù ‚ÄúTaboo,‚Äù ‚ÄúChitty Chitty Bang Bang‚Äù and ‚ÄúCompany.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe learning process of how roles grow over a period of time with a series has been kind of fascinating, and I just felt I had reached the end of what I wanted to explore where they were writing.‚Äù  Esparza‚Äôs departure from ‚ÄúLaw and Order: SVU‚Äù followed that of another Miami native, Danny Pino, who played detective Nick Amaro from 2011 to 2015.  The Miami Coral Park Senior High graduate and Florida International University alumnus is joining the ‚ÄúSons of Anarchy‚Äô‚Äô spinoff called ‚ÄúMayans MC‚Äù on the FX network."
"Seven years of good luck! Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Sunday, April 29, and Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with an adorable photo of the couple from their wedding day.  ‚ÄúSeven years ago today ‚Äì thank you for all the lovely messages on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge‚Äôs wedding anniversary!,‚Äù the Palace captioned an Instagram pic, which shows the then-newlyweds driving away from Buckingham Palace in a convertible.  The royal couple, who tied the knot in 2011, left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom‚Äôs father, Prince Charles.

'They are aiming for an August ceremony and reception at George Clooney's villa in Lake Como, Italy,' a source spills to In Touch.  Brad's longtime friend George, who let John Krasinski and Emily Blunt marry at his 18th-century estate in 2010, 'would be more than happy to host the nuptials.'  Unlike their 2000 wedding, which reportedly cost $1million, this second wedding joy will be 'smaller and more intimate,' according to friends.

Brad's mother Jane will also reportedly be in attendance.  'Jane always loved Jen,' a friend told In Touch.

Pattinson told Stern he prefers to keep his personal life private in order to protect both twigs and their relationship.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the most frustrating things in the world, you want to be able to [be more open], but it‚Äôs literally like, you get stuck in this position but you have to make this decision whether you want to let the crazy people in,‚Äù said the actor. ‚ÄúI mean basically, for whatever reason with Twilight ‚Äì I don‚Äôt know whether it is a specific thing with the audience ‚Äì there‚Äôs like a crack group of crazies that think every single decision you‚Äôre making is either creating some kind of conspiracy‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúSo you kind of think, like, to protect it, I want to create a big boundary,‚Äù said Pattinson.

"I was expecting to be talking about X major character‚Äôs death after last night‚Äôs Game of Thrones premiere.  I was not expecting to be talking about Ed Sheeran.  In truth, this was one of the least bloody episodes of the entire series (overlooking Arya‚Äôs little poisonous dinner party), and mostly served as set up for the conflicts to come. But the one moment that seems to have stuck with everyone was a certain less-than-subtle cameo from world-famous musician, Ed Sheeran.  If you don‚Äôt know who Ed Sheeran is or what he looks like, you probably didn‚Äôt think anything was amiss. But if you do, and millions will recognize him on sight, it was a very bizarre moment in a show that seems like it would avoid these kinds of ‚Äúcelebrity guest star‚Äù cameos.  Sheeran plays a young Lannister soldier, part of a detachment that Arya encounters after dispatching the Freys. He sings a tune that Arya hears from a ways off (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new one‚Äù he says, when Arya asks what the song is. Thankfully it‚Äôs not one of his own). And I believe he has one other line about how King‚Äôs Landing is the worst. Most of the talking is left to two other members of the party during the scene.  And still, his appearance was jarring. I say this not as someone who dislikes Ed Sheeran, but it was handled completely wrong. If you knew who he was, it was all you could focus on in the scene, and especially for the type of show Game of Thrones is, this kind of front-and-center cameo of someone this famous seemed out of place, like Miley Cyrus showing up on The Walking Dead as a survivor or watching The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale with special musical guest Drake. Sheeran‚Äôs cameo actually reminded me a lot of when Rihanna showed up to play Marion Crane on the last season of Bates Motel, where it was impossible to see anyone but Rihanna during her stint (though she didn‚Äôt sing).  This also isn‚Äôt to say that Game of Thrones shouldn‚Äôt have musical cameos, as it has done so many, many times in the past. Throughout the last six seasons, members of the bands Snow Patrol, Coldplay, Sigur Ros, Mastadon and Of Monsters and Men all showed up on Game of Thrones at one point, but if you didn‚Äôt know that, I wouldn‚Äôt blame you. That‚Äôs because A) a lot less people would know what these band members look like and B) they were often dressed up so you probably wouldn‚Äôt recognize them anyway. Ed Sheeran was just Ed Sheeran‚Ä¶in armor, and he certainly wasn‚Äôt hiding in the background.  Anyway, it didn‚Äôt ruin the evening or anything, but it was pretty distracting in what was a key scene where Arya gets to see that the Lannister army isn‚Äôt some faceless mass of evil, but contains some sweet young boys as well. Knowing Game of Thrones, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see these lads show up as corpses later, teaching Arya another valuable lesson. And I know there were plenty of people last night rooting for Arya to stick Ed Sheeran, but that seems a bit extreme to me.  So yes, this was a misstep from Game of Thrones, to be sure. They‚Äôve done plenty of non-distracting cameos before, but this one was painfully unsubtle to the point where it probably shouldn‚Äôt have happened at all.  Follow me on Twitter and on Facebook. Pick up my sci-fi novel series, The Earthborn Trilogy, which is now in print, online and on audiobook."

"Congresswoman Maxine Waters has reignited her political career as one of the most outspoken leaders of the Trump ‚ÄúResistance.‚Äù She regularly and often beats the drum of impeachment for the president. However, in August of 2010, it was Waters who was under legal scrutiny for her behavior as a government official. Waters was charged with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code.According to The Hill‚Äôs report from 2010:The House ethics committee on Monday outlined its charges against Rep. Maxine Waters, who is accused of helping a bank in which her husband owned stock secure federal bailout funds. The committee charged the 10-term California Democrat with three counts of violating House rules and the federal ethics code in connection with her effort to arrange a 2008 meeting between Treasury officials and representatives with OneUnited bank. The panel said Waters, who sits on the Financial Services Committee, broke a House rule requiring members to behave in a way that reflects ‚Äúcreditably‚Äù on the chamber. The committee said that by trying to assist OneUnited, she stood to benefit directly, because her husband owned a sizable amount of stock that would have been ‚Äúworthless‚Äù if the bank failed. The committee also accused Waters of violating the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù of a House rule prohibiting lawmakers from using their positions for financial gain, as well as a government ethics statute banning the dispensing of ‚Äúspecial favors.‚ÄùThe charges were delayed and stalled by members of the committee, and multiple attorneys in the case were fired. Ultimately, Waters was absolved of the charges.According to National Review:[Waters] walked away with a slap on the wrist from the toothless House Ethics Committee in 2012 after being charged with multiple ethics violations related to her meddling in minority-owned OneUnited Bank ‚Ä¶ As stockholders, they profited handsomely from their relationship with the bank. It was a mutually beneficial relationship. After Waters‚Äôs office personally intervened and lobbied the Treasury Department in 2008, OneUnited received $12 million in federal TARP bailout money ‚Äî despite another government agency concluding that the bank operated ‚Äúwithout effective underwriting standards‚Äù and engaged ‚Äúin speculative investment practices. After the federal bailout of Fannie/Freddie, OneUnited‚Äôs stock in the government-sponsored enterprises plunged to a value estimated at less than $5 million. Only through Waters‚Äôs intervention was OneUnited able to secure an emergency meeting with the Treasury and then-Secretary Henry Paulson. Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch president, reported that Waters‚Äôs friend and fellow California Democratic congresswoman Zoe Lofgren helped delay Waters‚Äôs scheduled 2010 House ethics trial on the matter by stalling subpoenas and improperly firing two attorneys working on the investigation. Six of ten House Ethics panel members quit the case in 2012 over questions about their partiality. An outside investigator absolved Waters of any wrongdoing. In spite of getting off on the charges, Waters carries with her a terrible reputation for corruption. Please see this list for a rundown of all the numerous scandals and charges which have been brought against her. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has listed her as one of the most corrupt members of Congress five times. Resist."

"Brass at the cable giant hope a cross-portfolio push will bring an optimistic finish to an inarguably rough year for televised kudos.  Awards shows may still be among TV‚Äôs surest bets to lure a live audience, but fraught licensing negotiations and flagging ratings are dulling the sheen. A unique solution to those problems, however, is to skip the middleman altogether and buy one at a fire sale.  That‚Äôs what E! did in April of 2017, when Proctor & Gamble unloaded the People‚Äôs Choice Awards with the last of its TV properties. The 43-year-old populist celebration debuts at its new network with a new owner (NBCUniversal) on Nov. 11. Brass at the cable giant hope the unconventional move (and a cross-portfolio push) will bring an optimistic finish to an inarguably rough year for televised kudos.  ‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt a year that went by that someone didn‚Äôt come in with a pitch for an original awards show,‚Äù says E! president Adam Stotsky, who long sought a tentpole event for his brand synonymous with red carpet coverage. ‚ÄúAnd when the rights for some of the smaller shows came up, it never made sense.‚Äù  NBCUniversal‚Äôs purchase, which is said to have set the company back a modest $8 million to $10 million, gives E! freedom to change the show to suit the celebrity-centric outlet without losing any of the built-in brand recognition. This year's event will be produced by Wilshire Studios and Den of Thieves with exec producers Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Prager. (For its final five years on CBS, the show averaged 8.2 million viewers and a 1.9 rating among adults 18-49 ‚Äî numbers any cable network would salivate over.)  ‚ÄúThis show fits in perfectly with what [NBCUniversal CEO] Steve Burke says about owning not renting,‚Äù says network EP of live events Jen Neal. Also E!'s executive vp marketing, Neal points to the social footprint of nominees as a major assist in getting the word out. Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds, The Avengers‚Äô Chris Hemsworth and resident E! shills the Kardashians have been among the more vocal promoters thus far.  To be sure, 2018 has not been pretty for glitzy Hollywood telecasts. The main shows (the Emmys, Oscars, Globes and Grammys) lost a combined 15 million viewers from their year-ago telecasts. Concerns over that downward trajectory stalled deal renewals for both the Globes at NBC and the Emmys with the Big Four. NBCUniversal anticipates a calendar shift for People‚Äôs Choice, which traditionally aired in the middle of awards season, might help buck that trend ‚Äî as could the decision to air it simultaneously on sister networks Syfy, USA, Bravo and NBC Universo, in addition to E!'s 160 international territories.  At least four marquee advertisers have been secured since the parent company's decision to make the show a point of emphasis during its Rockefeller Center pitch to media buyers in May. And, even if it's a flop, the fact that NBCUniversal now owns People's Choice in perpetuity offers a rare cushion in the awards space.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve built a huge business out of filming people walking through a parking lot, but we‚Äôve never gone in the building,‚Äù adds Stotsky. ‚ÄúThis is already a win for us.‚Äù  This story appears in the Oct. 30 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

"When Taylor Swift transformed into a reigning pop princess on 2014's 1989, Jack Antonoff was there. He was there again to help co-write her bad girl turn on Reputation in 2017. As a producer, he‚Äôs worked with St. Vincent‚Äôs Annie Clark on the minimalist piano pop for her 2017 record Masseduction, with Lorde on her larger-than-life album Melodrama, and is partly responsible for Sara Bareilles‚Äôs commercial-perfect earworm ‚ÄúBrave.‚Äù He‚Äôs reportedly working with Carly Rae Jepsen (again), the Dixie Chicks, and now Lana Del Rey.    Antonoff rose to fame as a member of the largely forgotten band Fun., whose biggest hit was 2011's ‚ÄúWe Are Young,‚Äù but now he‚Äôs often positioned as the reason why the music of many women artists is so great. He‚Äôs been dubbed your favorite pop star‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret weapon‚Äù by Pitchfork, and a ‚Äúmillennial pop svengali‚Äù by Vanity Fair. His rise is especially inspiring, GQ once suggested, because he doesn‚Äôt physically and sonically resemble typical pop producers. ‚ÄúThe very nature of pop music has changed: people who look and think and sound like Jack Antonoff are allowed to participate in its making at the very highest levels,‚Äù a profile from earlier this year read, which seemed to imply that Antonoff‚Äôs geeky style and indie sincerity was in direct opposition to slicker pop makers who came up through the industry solely as writers and producers.  Despite his rising prominence, though, there‚Äôs something admittedly irritating about his ubiquity. It‚Äôs enough to warrant articles like this Noisey post: ‚ÄúJACK ANTONOFF YOU STAY AWAY FROM THE DIXIE CHICKS,‚Äù in which the entire body is ‚Äúno no no no nope.‚Äù Because while Antonoff might be highly favored among artists we love, promoted (often via music critics) as a fresh new pop-maker and ally with a unique respect for women, he inevitably winds up consuming a lot of their spotlight. In late October, he appeared alongside Lana Del Rey for her performance of ‚ÄúHow to Disappear‚Äù at an Apple event in Brooklyn. After GQ interviewed him, their profile included the line, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs still writing Jack Antonoff songs‚Äîthey just happen to be sung by people like Lorde now.‚Äù Lorde took issue with the characterization: ‚ÄúKnew there was a way to describe the personal and skillful work that I do turns out it‚Äôs ‚Äòsinging jack antonoff songs‚Äô‚Äù she wrote in a now-deleted tweet.  The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure.  That‚Äôs traditionally how it‚Äôs worked. The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure. Women may be the stars of their music, their names alone listed on their songs, but the men who write, produce, or mix for them, even as a collaboration, are seen as the puppeteers who guide them (and, in the worst cases, svengalis); Phil Spector to The Ronettes, Max Martin to Britney Spears, Timbaland to Aaliyah, Dr. Luke to Kesha.  There‚Äôs the long baked-in assumption, particularly in pop, that women are not responsible for their hits and have a team of pop songwriters behind them. Women artists, from Taylor Swift to Bj√∂rk to Missy Elliott, have had to fight for their role in their own music-making, as listeners and critics choose to attribute the bulk of the creative process to the men in the room. ‚ÄúHow can one be a ‚Äòvocal muse‚Äô to their own melodies, story telling and words they wrote?‚Äù Solange wrote in response to a 2013 review of her album True, co-produced and co-written largely by Dev Hynes, which likened Solange to a muse for Hynes (Solange is credited as a writer and producer on every track). And while Antonoff is far from the most egregious offender, he is still a male producer working primarily with women artists, and it‚Äôs his touch as a producer that inevitably blankets the work of the women he works with.  Advertisement  Lorde ‚ÄúGreen Light‚Äù music video  A fair share of Antonoff‚Äôs productions are great. Taylor Swift‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Wish You Would‚Äù is supremely underrated, Fifth Harmony‚Äôs ‚ÄúDope‚Äù should have been on the album rather than a B-side, and I still get excited when I hear ‚ÄúGreen Light‚Äù out in public. But I‚Äôd argue that the unchanged nature of his production style leaves a lot of his music stuck, dated, in the glittering ‚Äô80s nostalgia-wave of pop music several years ago. He tends, as well, to have a squeaky clean, piano-ballad approach, like he‚Äôs willingly applying motion-smoothing technology to artists who might not need it. When Melodrama was set to come out, I steeled myself for a record built in the shadow of 1989, an erasure of Lorde, and was pleasantly surprised to find I could still hear her.    I steeled myself for Lorde‚Äôs erasure not because I thought she could easily disappear, but because it‚Äôs happened so many times before with women artists. Antonoff has largely been pitched to the masses as a producer who cuts through that stereotype. He‚Äôs a pop music ‚ÄúNice Guy‚Äù (someone your mother would love, New York Magazine once pointed out) in an industry just barely beginning to reckon publicly with how much misogyny is embedded into pop music-making. It‚Äôs hard not to connect the recent infatuation with Antonoff‚Äôs celebrity with Dr. Luke‚Äôs fall and see him as a shred of male decency in a dark industry. More than being a nice guy, he‚Äôs made it clear that he cares about women‚Äôs artistry. ‚ÄúI always want to hear women sing my songs. I just want to be around women,‚Äù Antonoff told Pitchfork. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a sex thing‚ÄîI‚Äôm heterosexual, but it‚Äôs not coming from any place like that. It‚Äôs just a comfort thing.‚Äù  Last year, he told The Guardian, ‚ÄúIn no way do I feel like a woman. I feel very male. But when I‚Äôm writing I don‚Äôt think about Lou Reed or Bowie. I think about Kate Bush, Bj√∂rk, Fiona Apple. I‚Äôve always been extremely drawn to female artists who are being brutally honest. That is so much more attractive to me than a lot of the weird paths certain male songwriters lead you down, that hide and mask emotions.‚Äù  In an interview with the New York Times promoting Melodrama, Lorde told the reporter that when she played ‚ÄúGreen Light‚Äù to producer Max Martin, who has an almost Renaissance-flare for technical perfection, Martin told her it was ‚Äúincorrect songwriting.‚Äù Not an insult exactly for Lorde, but one that only underscored how much she perceived Antonoff as a looser musical partner who wasn‚Äôt like the other guys.  Or is he really not like the others? As much as I feel constantly pitched on the idea that Antonoff isn‚Äôt a typical pop producer, the way music media treats him feels like just another fetishization of the old-school producer dynamic. You couldn‚Äôt confidently write off Melodrama as a collection of Antonoff songs, just as you can‚Äôt write off his collaborations with Lana Del Rey, St. Vincent, or other artists as women simply singing ‚Äúhis songs‚Äù‚Äîbut it‚Äôs these kinds of assumptions that happen when a male producer chooses to be a celebrity. And when you consider the fact that successful women in this industry still struggle to establish their genius in the same ways men do (because, frankly, they‚Äôre quickly rewarded the distinction in spades), you wonder if Antonoff‚Äôs collaborators would benefit from him taking a bigger, less vocal step back.  Advertisement  No matter how nice he is, or respectful, or a good #ally‚Äîand as much as he may be unaware‚ÄîAntonoff is assuming a historically authoritative position in pop music. Even if Antonoff is an unwitting participant, he exists in a system that will always inherently award him the position of being a pop mastermind when it comes to the collaborations he creates with women, who are ultimately the authors of their work but often treated as subjects. And the giddiness with which Antonoff speaks of his collaborations with Taylor Swift or Lorde or St. Vincent to a fawning press might come with the best of intentions, but his female collaborators ultimately have to work overtime to claim authorship."

"  Rashida Jones, pictured Oct. 14 at the Los Angeles premiere of the play ""Sell/Buy/Date,"" will executive produce a potential new television series for AMC. (Rachel Luna/Getty Images)  It‚Äôs been a little over a year since ‚ÄúKevin Can Wait‚Äù killed off Erinn Hayes‚Äôs character after just one season, a very weird move, given that she played a lead character ‚Äî Donna Gable, Kevin‚Äôs wife of 20 years. To add fuel to the fire burning inside upset viewers' hearts, the CBS sitcom replaced Hayes with Leah Remini, Kevin James‚Äôs former co-star from ‚ÄúKing of Queens.‚Äù Ratings took a dip, and the network eventually axed the show in May.  Donna, while a high-profile case, wasn‚Äôt the only mistreated wife in sitcom history, and this hasn‚Äôt gone unnoticed. AMC Networks announced Friday that it has a project in development called ‚ÄúKevin Can F*** Himself,‚Äù from creator Valerie Armstrong and executive producers Rashida Jones and Will McCormack.  The series aims to expose ‚Äúthe secret life of a woman we all grew up watching: the sitcom wife,‚Äù the network said in a statement. ‚ÄúA beauty paired with a less attractive, dismissive, caveman-like husband who gets to be a jerk because she‚Äôs a nag and he‚Äôs ‚Äòfunny.'"" The show aims to illuminate said secret life by switching between ‚Äúsingle-camera realism and multi-camera zaniness.‚Äù  Hayes even tweeted about it:  This project is the second buzzed about this week that directly challenges long-established Hollywood tropes. The first? ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt It Romantic,‚Äù an upcoming movie that centers on a cynical woman (Rebel Wilson) who faces her worst nightmare when she gets trapped in a cheesy romantic comedy. (Yes, the same movie Wilson was promoting when she incorrectly claimed to be the ‚Äúfirst-ever plus-sized girl‚Äù to lead a rom-com.)  AMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom ‚Äî as well as workplace drama ‚ÄúRainy Day People‚Äù ‚Äî under its ‚Äúscript-to-series‚Äù development model, used for projects with promising pilot scripts.  ‚ÄúUnder the approach, AMC foregoes the traditional pilot process and instead opens writers' rooms to develop scripts for several episodes and a detailed look at a potential first season before deciding whether to move to a straight-to-series order,‚Äù Deadline reported last year.  So while there‚Äôs no guarantee ‚ÄúKevin Can F*** Himself‚Äù will make it to the finish line, AMC programming president David Madden did note that the network has had ‚Äúgreat experiences‚Äù with the creative team behind it. Things are looking up. We (Kevin) Can‚Äôt Wait!  Read more:  Wondering how ‚ÄòKevin Can Wait‚Äô will get rid of Erinn Hayes? Well, they‚Äôre killing her off.  ‚ÄòKevin Can Wait‚Äô isn‚Äôt the first sitcom to have a character death. Here‚Äôs how 8 other shows handled it.  Kevin James explains ‚ÄòKevin Can Wait‚Äô death: ‚ÄòWe were literally running out of ideas‚Äô"

"She has been a busy bee this New York Fashion Week.  And Paris Jackson's schedule included a red carpet stroll at the Daily Front Row Fashion Media Awards this Thursday.  The 20-year-old daughter of the late Michael Jackson dressed down for the event at the Hyatt Park New York, wearing a low-key ensemble from sponsor Zadig & Voltaire, which featured a pair high-waisted olive green pants.  Stepping out: Paris Jackson's chockablock schedule included a red carpet stroll at the Daily Front Row Fashion Media Awards this Thursday  Her Parole Mili pant hems were pulled up slightly, nearly to knee level, and she flashed her trim midriff beneath the a tie-dye tee from the brand, which Paris tied up in order to expose her stomach.  Paris, who has an elder brother known as Prince and a younger half-brother nicknamed Blanket, modeled Zadig & Voltaire's High Buckle shoes.  Playing up her features with heavy makeup, Paris let her wavy hair down and strung on a tangle of necklaces including one with a purple tassel.  Her Thursday itinerary included a stop-off at Gallery 1 at Spring Studios for the Jeremy Scott show, which attracted quite a collection of stars.  Keeping it simple: The 20-year-old daughter of the late Michael Jackson dressed down for the event, wearing Parole Mili olive green sweats to the Hyatt Park New York  And the winner is... The beauty was on hand to present an award at the star-studded ceremony  Girl's best friend! Paris even brought her dog Koa along to the event, with the model sharing a cute hug with her pooch upon arrival  Paris found herself seated on the front row between rapping sensation Cardi B, who rose to international fame last year, and globetrotting supermodel Gigi Hadid.  On Gigi's left was Tiffany Haddish, whose turn in the 2017 comedy Girls Trip made her a star, and on Cardi's right was her sister Hennessy Carolina.  For that event, Paris was in a plunging, colorfully striped V-neck crop top and a pair of bright scarlet pants, plus a double-circlet round her head.  VI-Pooch: Paris even gave Koa a taste of the red carpet action as they posed for snaps together  Boho babe: Paris flashed her toned midriff in a crop top that was emblazoned with a tie-dye print, a trend that has become the beauty's signature  Confident: The star showed off her charisma as she spoke to guests and presented an award at the event, which was attended by the likes of Gigi Hadid and Priyanka Chopra  The flowing bell bottoms of her pants spread across the floor as she posed standing up, showing off her chiseled midsection to advantage.  She slid stacks of bracelets onto both her wrists and wore what appeared to be the same necklaces she had put on for the Daily Front Row event.  Paris got to mingle with the designer himself, who wore a statement tank top opposing the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.  Mingling: Her Thursday itinerary included a stop-off at Gallery 1 at Spring Studios for the Jeremy Scott show, which attracted quite a collection of stars such as Cardi B (left)  Place to be: Paris found herself seated on the front row between rapping sensation Cardi B (left), who rose to international fame last year, and globetrotting supermodel Gigi Hadid (right)  What a lineup: On Gigi's left was Tiffany Haddish (right), whose turn in the 2017 comedy Girls Trip made her a star, and on Cardi's right was her sister Hennessy Carolina (left)  She looks fabulous: Cardi flashed her cleavage in an off-the-shoulder black top that clashed fashionably against her eye-popping leopard-print leggings  Hand at the hip: For that event, Paris was in a plunging, colorfully striped V-neck crop top and a pair of bright scarlet pants, plus a double-circlet round her head  Showing her assets: The flowing bell bottoms of her pants spread across the floor as she posed standing up, showing off her chiseled midsection to advantage  Meanwhile, Cardi flashed her cleavage in an off-the-shoulder black top that clashed fashionably against her eye-popping leopard-print leggings.  Gigi had slid into a full-sleeved LBD that allowed her to flash her statuesque crossed legs as she sat observing the progress of the models down the catwalk.  Tiffany was also in a black ensemble, though hers was bustier than Gigi's and she contrasted it against a white clutch that sat on her lap.

"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  ‚ÄúI do believe in marriage,‚Äù the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper‚Äôs Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. ‚ÄúAnd I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I‚Äôm not forcing anything right now.‚Äù  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other‚Äôs lives in a way that most other people couldn‚Äôt.‚Äù  She added: ‚ÄúWe both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.‚Äù  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single ‚ÄúUs‚Äù written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been together for one year today. I don‚Äôt want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song‚Äôs for you. I love you,‚Äù she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: ‚ÄúThey played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‚ÄòOh, this is relevant!‚Äô Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‚ÄòOh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?‚Äô‚Äù  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the ‚ÄúDance Again‚Äù songstress‚Äô life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. ‚ÄúWhen I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,‚Äù she told the publication. ‚ÄúI know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I‚Äôm glad I can do that now.‚Äù  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. ‚ÄúBaseball is just like life,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAll you want to do is hit a home run.‚Äù  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"

"Philippa Charlotte Matthews[4] (n√©e Middleton; born 6 September 1983)[5][6] is an English socialite, author, and columnist. The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, she began receiving media attention with her appearance as the maid of honour at her sister's wedding to Prince William.  Early life [ edit ]  Pippa Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, England. She is the second of three children born to Michael Middleton (born 1949), a former British Airways flight dispatcher, and Carole Middleton (n√©e Goldsmith; born 1955), a former flight attendant.[7][8] She was christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire.[9]  Education [ edit ]  In 1995, her family moved to Bucklebury, Berkshire.[10][11] Like her sister, Middleton was first educated at St Andrew's School, a private boarding school in Pangbourne and then Downe House School, a girls' day and boarding school in Cold Ash. She was a boarder at Marlborough College, where she held a sports/all-rounder scholarship.[12][13] Middleton then graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an English literature degree,[14] where she shared a house with Lord Edward Innes-Ker, a son of the Duke of Roxburghe, and with Earl Percy, heir apparent of the Duke of Northumberland.[14]  Career [ edit ]  Following her graduation, Middleton briefly worked in 2008 at a public relations firm promoting luxury products. She then had an events management job with Table Talk, a company based in London that organises corporate events and parties.[12][15] Also in 2008, Tatler magazine named Middleton ""the Number 1 Society Singleton"", ahead of singer-songwriter James Blunt and Princess Eugenie of York,[16] although in the same Tatler article she was described as someone who ""goes to a lot of parties, but mainly as the caterer."" Since then, she has often been described as a socialite.[17] As part of a duo with her elder sister, Middleton has received wide press coverage, focusing on her social life and her lifestyle. In April 2012, Time magazine listed Middleton as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[18]  Middleton has worked part-time for her parents' company Party Pieces, editing the web magazine Party Times.[12][19]  Penguin Books paid Middleton a ¬£400,000 advance for a book on party planning. The book, entitled Celebrate, was published in autumn 2012, and had lower than anticipated sales as many reviewers mocked it for the obviousness of its content.[20][21] In March 2013, Middleton parted from her literary agent.[22]  The 2016 ITV documentary, Our Queen At 90, revealed that a recipe which featured in Middleton's Celebrate book ‚Äì Granny's Marrow Chutney ‚Äì had been made by her sister, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who gave a jar of it as a Christmas gift to her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2011.[23]  Middleton is also a regular columnist for several publications. She has contributed articles to The Spectator magazine since December 2012[24] and began having a food column in the supermarket magazine Waitrose Kitchen beginning in spring 2013.[25] In June 2013 she was named a contributing editor of Vanity Fair writing a series of columns for the magazine.[26] Beginning in September 2013, Middleton also wrote a fortnightly sports and social column for The Sunday Telegraph.[27] She parted ways from The Telegraph in May 2014.  In May 2013, she became the sole director and shareholder of PXM Enterprises Limited.[28] The company is headquartered at 19 Portland Place in London.[28]  In September 2016, Middleton's iPhone was hacked. The Sun reported it had been approached by a hacker who claimed to have 3,000 images from Middleton's iCloud account and demanded ¬£50,000 for them. The hacker was arrested that same month.[29]  Royal wedding [ edit ]  Middleton stands with the Royal Family as maid of honour at the wedding of her sister and Prince William, as Prince Phillip looks on  The official announcement of her sister's engagement came on 16 November 2010. Middleton served as the maid of honour.[30] At the wedding, Middleton's white figure-hugging dress, which, like the bride's, was created by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, was highly praised in the media. Made of ivory cr√™pe fabric, it was styled with a cowl at the front and organza-covered buttons at the back. Copies of the dress were soon available on the High Street[31][32] where there was a great demand for them.[33][34][35]  Philanthropy [ edit ]  In April 2013, Middleton became an ambassador to the Mary Hare School for deaf children in Berkshire.  In June 2014, Middleton became an ambassador to the British Heart Foundation (BHF).[36] That month, she took part in the Race Across America, a 3,000 mile cycling race across the United States, followed by the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swimming Race, a 6.5 km swimming competition in Istanbul, as two fundraising opportunities for the BHF.[36] Her bicycle was also auctioned on eBay for the BHF.[36] She then attended the BHF's Roll out the Red Ball at the Park Lane Hotel on 10 February 2015.[37] She auctioned one of her L.K.Bennett dresses at the ball. She took part in the London to Brighton Bike Ride for the BHF on 21 June 2015. In September 2015, Middleton participated in a 47-mile swim-run competition in Sweden alongside her brother and James Matthews to raise money for the Michael Matthews Foundation, a charity found in honour of James Matthew's brother who lost his life on a mountain climbing trek.[38]  In September 2016, Middleton released her second book, Heartfelt, whose proceeds go to the British Heart Foundation.[39]  Personal life [ edit ]  In July 2016, Middleton became engaged to James Matthews, a former professional racing driver, now hedge fund manager. The couple married on 20 May 2017 at St Mark's Church, at Englefield Estate, Berkshire, near Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family home.[40]  Matthews is the eldest son and heir of David Matthews, the Laird of Glen Affric. If Matthews inherits his father's lairdship, then Middleton may be accorded the courtesy title of Lady Glen Affric.[41][42][43][44]  In June 2018, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child.[45][46][47] Their son, Arthur Michael William Matthews, was born on 15 October 2018 at St Mary's Hospital, London.[48][49][50]  Arms [ edit ]  Coat of arms of Pippa Middleton Notes Middleton bears her father's arms on a lozenge.

"Hmmmk. Farrah Abraham took to Instagram to reveal that she had a procedure done that would make most women cringe.  The Teen Mom OG star documented her experience undergoing vaginal rejuvenation at the Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center in Los Angeles on Saturday, August 26.  Loving my lady parts! #vaginalrejuvenation ? @beverlyhillsrejuvenationcenter @la_laser_lady @sarafowler_ Schedule your noninvasive appointment today ??? #Lasvegas #beverlyhills A post shared by Farrah Abraham (@farrah__abraham) on Aug 26, 2017 at 2:43pm PDT  One photo showed the reality star standing alongside a doctor in front of a lobby desk, wearing a pretty lace top with a black skirt. She captioned it, ‚ÄúLoving my lady parts!‚Äù with the hashtag #vaginalrejuvenation.  The reality star, 26, also tagged the clinic before encouraging her followers to ‚ÄúSchedule your noninvasive appointment today.‚Äù Another photo showed the sex tape star wearing a shiny silver bra and lying on an examination table with a sheet over her legs while she underwent the procedure.  In a video Abraham uploaded, her doctor explained the process of vaginal rejuvenation, saying, ‚ÄúWhat this does is distributes little wounds through radio frequency which kind of breaks up the collagen and forces it to restore during that healing process, so everything becomes tighter and you actually experience ‚Ä¶‚Äù  ‚ÄúLike I‚Äôm 16 again?‚Äù the My Teenage Dream Ended author interrupted.  ‚ÄúThere you go, like you‚Äôre 16 again!‚Äù the doctor answered with a laugh.  Abraham‚Äôs followers quickly slammed the single mom for sharing the private procedure. One person wrote, ‚ÄúMy god‚Ä¶poor little Sophia. A mother who ‚Äòloves‚Äô her body so much she altered every bit of it. Great example. I hope Sophia will grow into a strong and independent woman who does not need her ‚Äòmother‚Äô to be around.‚Äù  Another commented, ‚ÄúFarrah why? I understand you‚Äôre a mom and need the procedure for personal reasons but why make it public? Have respect as a mother for your child and for others.‚Äù  A third follower simply asked, ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you like 25? Why do you need this?‚Äù  The MTV star has previously undergone plastic surgery to alter her nose and chin, and has breast implants. She also shared pics on Twitter in 2015 of an allergic reaction she had to lip implants. Abraham also met with a surgeon in 2016, in a segment shown on The Doctors, to look into getting a butt lift.

"Former Dance Moms mentor Abby Lee Miller, who is currently serving her yearlong sentence at FCI Victorville, is reportedly celebrating this year‚Äôs holiday in a totally different way.  In an exclusive report by Radar Online, it has been alleged that the 51-year-old choreographer will not participate in the traditional Thanksgiving meal organized for the inmates.  According to the webloid, Abby Lee Miller is going to skip the holiday dinner because of a special visitor that will drop by to discuss something important to her. Apparently, the inmates will gather for the Thanksgiving dinner around 11:00 ‚Äî the same time when the former Dance Moms star will be in visitation.  An insider revealed to the outlet that their Thanksgiving meal will consist of ‚Äúdried up turkey, canned cranberry juice, canned corn, green beans, mashed potatoes, one roll with a small pad of butter, one slice of pumpkin pie, and one slice of pecan pie.‚Äù  Despite missing out on the meal, Abby Lee Miller will still be allowed to get her share of food once her visitor leaves, it has been claimed.  ‚ÄúUnfortunately, by the time Abby gets her meal, it will be cold,‚Äù a source told the gossip site.  Previously, it has been reported that the controversial choreographer has not received any visits at the FCI Victorville in California. According to reports, the ALDC founder has been lonely in the past months, especially with no visitors.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BX_lHnhF8vV/?hl=en&taken-by=therealabbylee  However, the webloid alleged that Abby Lee Miller has been ‚Äúlooking forward to her Thanksgiving visitor for weeks.‚Äù There were even claims that the former Dance Moms star has been ‚Äúprimping‚Äù herself just for the special visit.  ‚ÄúShe had her hair cut and colored for the visitor using commissary-bought hair dye,‚Äù the source added. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs even paid an inmate to style her hair for her.‚Äù  So who is the special visitor? Radar Online claimed that Abby Lee Miller is meeting a book publisher who was approved by the BOP to visit her. Apparently, the Pittsburgh native may have landed a book deal despite being locked up in jail.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BbcrNF_lx8J/?hl=en&taken-by=therealabbylee  The outlet also noted that the celebrity dance instructor already has a ghostwriter that will help pen her book.  ‚ÄúIt appears that Abby Lee has a book deal in place,‚Äù an insider told the webloid, ‚ÄúBut she has not written anything since she‚Äôs been locked up and has a ghostwriter penning the book.‚Äù  Aside from a ghostwriter, the former Dance Moms star reportedly has someone who manages her social media accounts as evident in her regular posts and updates online. In fact, Abby Lee Miller‚Äôs presence is still very much felt on social media despite being in jail for four months now.  [Featured Image by Rich Fury/Invision/AP Images]"

"Don‚Äôt get us wrong: There‚Äôs no truth to those rumors that Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton's relationship is rocky. The two, who are set to be sisters-in-law when Markle marries Prince Harry in May, are certainly amicable. But there‚Äôs a difference between being friendly and being inseparable.  ‚ÄúI think they are certainly friendly and they are spending more time with each other. You know they‚Äôre neighbors in Kensington Palace and I know that Meghan enjoys going over to see Kate and the children, and she does enjoy that. I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs always an open invitation for her to be with Kate ever when she wants,‚Äù royal expert and author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love told InStyle. ‚ÄúI think that any animosity is probably a fabrication in the press. I‚Äôve never heard to suggest that they don‚Äôt get along.‚Äù  CHRIS JACKSON/AFP/Getty Images  You‚Äôre right if you could hear the ‚Äúbut‚Äù coming, though.  ‚ÄúI do hear plenty to suggest that they‚Äôre quite different people and that have quite different interests and that Meghan is quite independent and very confident and very keen to I think establish her own network of friends over here in London,‚Äù Nicholl added.  ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs certainly not to say she‚Äôs snubbed Kate in any way. I think they do spend time together. But I think Meghan‚Äôs keen not to rely too much on Kate and to have her own friends as well.‚Äù  It seems that Markle certainly already has a group of good friends in London, as they were quick to throw her a lavish spa-themed bridal shower earlier in March. Middleton wasn‚Äôt present at the three-day event, but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything in terms of their relationship.  Chris Jackson/Chris Jackson/Getty Images  When the two stepped out for Markle‚Äôs first official event with Queen Elizabeth on March 12, the two exchanged very authentic-looking smiles outside of Westminster Abbey and even seemingly color-coordinated their looks.  PAUL GROVER/AFP/Getty Images  We have no doubt that they will continue to get closer over time‚Äîespecially if Meghan and Harry start a family of their own. The prince said in a November interview with the BBC that they hope to start one ""in the near future."""

"Mila Kunis gushes over husband Ashton Kutcher: 'I got a man that has got a lot of patience'  The 34-year-old actress has been married to Ashton Kutcher - with whom she has three-year-old daughter Wyatt and 16-month-old son Dimitri - since 2015, and has heaped the praise on her spouse, saying she is ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to have found him.  Speaking to E! News, she said: ""I have the world's greatest husband. I swear, I got very lucky, man. I got a man that has got a lot of patience and is incredibly supportive of our family.""  Despite only marrying three years ago, Mila and 40-year-old Ashton have known each other since the late 90s, when they starred together on ‚ÄòThat 70s Show‚Äô.  Ashton Kutcher and wife Mila Kunis have become parents for the second time (AP)  They began dating in 2012, three years before tying the knot, when ‚ÄòJobs‚Äô actor Ashton was undergoing a divorce from first wife Demi Moore, whom he married in 2005.  Mila‚Äôs comments come after she previously gushed over her brood, saying she and Ashton are ‚Äúgrateful‚Äù to have two tots of their own, as they were desperate to start a family.  She said in November: ""I have an 11-month-old and a three-year-old - I have tiny little humans. Ashton and I wanted kids so bad; we were so ready to be parents.  ""We were able to have this little family the way we wanted, and I'm so grateful for it and it's the one thing that I can't control.  (L-R) Actors Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are not shy of public displays of affection  ""That's where my vulnerability is. My job, it comes and goes. You don't get a job, you get a job, you don't get a job. Your kids, you just want one thing.‚Äù  Previously, the ‚ÄòBlack Swan‚Äô star also credited Ashton with helping her learn about the ‚Äúbusiness side‚Äù of their shared profession.  She said: ""Honestly, full disclosure, when I started dating Ashton, I was like, 'I don't want to know [about the] business side, it makes me so uncomfortable.' And he said, 'Right, stop, get on the call.'  ""And then I started educating myself, getting the language right. I would ask him questions, Googled lots of things, and now I know what everybody's doing, I know what I can do, I know what I can ask for. I am way more involved than I was five years ago.

"Cheerio!  Royal Inquiries is your comprehensive guide to everything you ever wanted to know about life under the crown.  As a world-famous royal expert ‚Äî who happens to be the exact same height as Queen Elizabeth, not to brag ‚Äî I‚Äôm aware that all British royals absolutely love two things: (1) fancy hats, and (2) social media.  Even though Meghan Markle had to cleanse her personal social-media accounts ‚Äî and delete her lifestyle blog ‚Äî before her upcoming May 19 wedding to Prince Harry, it‚Äôs known that many royals have social-media presences. Some accounts are public; others are super secretive, but by god, they exist.  So, which royals have secret accounts? Why, I‚Äôm so glad you asked! Here, let‚Äôs go through the list of my favorite British royal adults and I‚Äôll break it all down for you.  Queen Elizabeth II. Photo: Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images  Royal: Queen Elizabeth II  Public social-media account?: Yes, @RoyalFamily  Secret social-media account?: Yes!!!!!! Reportedly  What‚Äôs the deal?: Queen Elizabeth, my sister in height, apparently has a super-secret Facebook account, can you believe it? According to the British tabloids, the queen has a personal iPad and laptop, loves to text, and even has a clandestine Facebook.  Kate Middleton. Photo: Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Royal: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (Kate Middleton)  Public social-media account?: Yes, @KensingtonRoyal  Secret social-media account?: Supposedly  What‚Äôs the deal: Kate reportedly has an account on the British website, Mumsnet. She‚Äôs been on the mommy forum swapping parenting tips ever since the birth of her second child, Charlotte. That counts as social media, right?  Prince William. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images  Royal: Prince William  Public social-media account?: Yes, @KensingtonRoyal  Secret social-media account?: No  What‚Äôs the deal?: Other than his occasional tendency to dance like a dad at a club, Prince William seems like a pretty boring guy. I haven‚Äôt seen any evidence of him having a secret social-media account, and I don‚Äôt really suspect he has one. In 2007 there was a fake Prince William Facebook account that everyone freaked out over, however.  Prince Harry. Photo: Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Royal: Prince Harry  Public social-media account?: Yes, @KensingtonRoyal  Secret social-media account?: You better believe it!!!  What‚Äôs the deal?: Prince Harry may seem mature now, but let‚Äôs not forget that he was very recently a wild child who wore inappropriate costumes, had far too much fun in Vegas, and loved social media. In fact, after the pictures of his Vegas misadventures emerged, Prince Harry was reportedly forced to shut down his beloved Facebook account ‚Ä¶ in which he used the name ‚Ä¶ wait for it ‚Ä¶. are you ready? ‚Ä¶ Spike Wells. !!!! Prince Harry/Spike reportedly had that Facebook account for four years. While he was courting Meghan, who was still on social media at that time, the prince reportedly had a secret Instagram account (that he used to follow her, close friends, and charities). It‚Äôs unclear whether Prince Harry still has that account, but if Meghan had to get rid of hers, I should hope he‚Äôd have been polite and done the same.  Meghan Markle. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images  Royal: Meghan Markle  Public social-media account?: None at the moment, but I assume she will also be joining @KensingtonRoyal  Secret social-media account?: No  What‚Äôs the deal?: There‚Äôs no proof Meghan has a private Instagram or Twitter account, but don‚Äôt you get the feeling she does? I mean, she was so into Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook for so long, had her lifestyle website the Tig, and she reportedly had an anonymous and very honest blog about being a working actress. BuzzFeed even recently uncovered a (now-deleted) Instagram pic she posted of someone who was potentially Prince Harry back in October 2016 (in which he was wearing a Golden Girls sweatshirt and his face was partially obscured!). So, this woman clearly loves social media. I figure she must have some accounts now, or at the very least is just lurking around on her phone.  Princess Beatrice. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images  Royal: Princess Beatrice  Public social-media account?: Yes, @yorkiebea  Secret social-media account?: Instagram, baby!  What‚Äôs the deal?: According to Guest of a Guest, Princess Beatrice likely has a secret Instagram account. In February, the royal attended a party for David Geffen, of all people. There, Vanity Fair‚Äôs Derek Blasberg, friend of all celebrities, tagged her in a pic on Instagram. The account he tagged is private, but I assume it‚Äôs actually hers, especially because Prince Harry‚Äôs ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy (who has a public Instagram account) follows it. Princess Beatrice does have a public Twitter, though.  Princess Eugenie. Photo: Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Royal: Princess Eugenie  Public social-media account?: Yes, @PrincessEugenie  Secret social-media account?: She doesn‚Äôt need one!  What‚Äôs the deal?: Princess Eugenie is the only royal who officially has her own public Instagram account. Isn‚Äôt that nice? She posts cute pictures of herself and her sister Princess Beatrice when they were young, and some sweet current photos that include her mother Sarah Ferguson. She also posted an outtake from the official photoshoot in which she announced her engagement to her longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank. Can I get a #followback, Eugenie?  Think Jack said something funny! A post shared by Princess Eugenie (@princesseugenie) on Mar 9, 2018 at 10:42am PST  So there you have it for secret social accounts: Queen, yes; Kate, kind of; Will, ehhhh no; Harry, YESSS!; Meghan, probably?; Beatrice, yes; and Eugenie, she doesn‚Äôt even need one! If you‚Äôre wondering why I didn‚Äôt include Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles on this list, it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt forgiven them for their affair and the pain they caused Princess Diana, sorry."
"It's been nearly a year since Christina and Tarek El Moussa's explosive fight that resulted in the two splitting up, but it appears the Flip or Flop stars are not completely over it.  On Thursday, Tarek posted a photo to his Instagram story of himself posing in front of a sign at BJ's Cabana Bar in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The sign read, ""No guns, weapons of any type."" Tarek added text to the snap, writing ""or helicopters,"" tagging his estranged wife and topping it off with a middle finger emoji.    WATCH: 'Flip or Flop' Exes Tarek v. Christina El Moussa: It's a Battle of the Revenge Bods!  The reality star has since deleted the pic, but judging by what Christina posted to her Instagram on Friday, we imagine she wasn't too happy when she saw it.  The blond beauty shared a photo of the Empire State Building with the quote, ""No time for bullshit when you're building an empire.""  ""True that,"" she captioned it. Only surround yourself with the best ‚ù§""  But that's not all! Tarek even gave the post a ""like.""  A source close to Tarek later told TMZ that his post was supposed to be a joke, and he tagged Christina thinking she would find it funny. The middle finger emoji was reportedly directed at the incident, not his co-star.  On Friday, Tarek tried to clear the air with an Instagram post that read, ""#life is about having #fun and enjoying every #moment....people shouldn't take things so seriously especially JOKES that are meant to be playful and fun...""  Many of Tarek's fans took to social media to express their support, writing things like, ""Reading the comments people leave you makes me realize how many sadly have no sense of humor,"" ""The fact that you're able to joke about your past means that you've already moved on... I admire your personality,"" and ""The only way to get through life is with a little humor!! Keep doing great things!!""    WATCH: Tarek and Christina El Moussa's Shocking Split: Everything We Know About the 'Flip or Flop' Couple  Last December, the couple confirmed they were taking a step back from their marriage following an incident on May, 23 2016 that led to the police being called to their Orange County, California, home. At the time, Tarek allegedly had a handgun and the Sherriff's Department responded to a report of a ""suicidal male"" with a helicopter.  More on that in the video below."

"In a statement on Tuesday, his spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, said: ‚ÄúAny allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.‚Äù  Even in an industry in which sexual harassment has long persisted, Mr. Weinstein stands out, according to the actresses and current and former employees of the film companies he ran, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. He had an elaborate system reliant on the cooperation of others: Assistants often booked the meetings, arranged the hotel rooms and sometimes even delivered the talent, then disappeared, the actresses and employees recounted. They described how some of Mr. Weinstein‚Äôs executives and assistants then found them agents and jobs or hushed actresses who were upset.  His alleged behavior became something of a Hollywood open secret: When the comedian Seth MacFarlane announced Oscar nominees in 2013, he joked, ‚ÄúCongratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.‚Äù The audience laughed. According to a 2015 memo by a former Weinstein Company executive that The Times previously disclosed, the misconduct continued.  More established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. ‚ÄúThis is Harvey Weinstein,‚Äù Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film ‚ÄúSwingers‚Äù and television roles, remembers telling herself after an encounter in which she said Mr. Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room.

"Justin Theroux and Selena Gomez have not been exchanging flirty texts with each other following his split from Jennifer Aniston, despite a made-up report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this story. A rep for the actor tells us there's no truth to it.  John Lamparski / Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows  An alleged insider, however, tells RadarOnline that Theroux ""was sweet on Selena when he and Jen hung out with her,"" and now the newly-single actor is pursuing the singer via text. The questionable source adds, ""He's asking for major trouble by trying to hang out with her so soon after his and Jen's split.""  The supposed tipster goes on to say that Gomez has been receptive to the actor's advances, before further speculating that Aniston will be infuriated when she finds out. The seemingly phony insider says the actress believed the pop star was ""very much her friend, not Justin's,"" so she'll likely see their communications as a betrayal.  None of this is remotely true. While the blog hides behind an anonymous and untraceable source, Theroux's rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that he hasn't been exchanging flirty texts with Gomez. Although the actor and singer became friendly after meeting through Aniston, there's nothing ""flirty"" about their dynamic.  It's possible this scenario was created because Theroux gave Gomez a shoutout on Instagram last month while visiting a animal shelter in the singer's hometown of Texas. However, the actor simple suggested she adopt a rescue dog. He certainly wasn't flirting.  Unfortunately, this phony narrative has cropped up before. Gossip Cop called out NW last month for making up a similar story about Theroux hitting on Gomez in the wake of his separation. The pop star was also dragged into the exes' marriage back when they were still together. Last April, Gossip Cop busted a bogus In Touch story alleging that Aniston was jealous of Gomez and her so-called ""flirty friendship"" with Theroux.  It's worth noting, Gomez has revealed in interviews that she looks up to Aniston, who gives her ""maternal advice."" The pop star further noted that she's been a lifelong fan of the actress, so she's particularly grateful that they now ""have real conversations with such a real heart."" The idea that Gomez would start flirting with her close friend and mentor's estranged husband is simply absurd. Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm there's no truth to the blog's account of events.

cdc recommends that you wear masks in public settings when around people who do nt live in your household especially when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain. masks with at least 2 layers of fabric are most likely to reduce spread of covid-19 when they are widely used by people in public settings. simple masks can be made at home using washable breathable fabric and may help prevent spread of covid-19. 
"'One Kardashian is enough!' How Anna Wintour 'banned' Kim's mom Kris Jenner from the Met Ball (and the Real Housewives weren't welcome either)    Anna Wintour may have welcomed Kim Kardashian to the Met Gala last week, but she apparently banned the pregnant star's mother from attending as well.  Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner was apparently 'desperate' to go to the punk-themed event, according to a Radaronline.com source, but the U.S. Vogue editor-in-chief is said to have issued a strict ban on any further reality stars.    She apparently told staff that 'one Kardashian is enough!'    'Banned': Anna Wintour (left) apparently refused to allow Kris Jenner (right) to attend the Met Gala  The source explained to the site: 'Anna approves every star who enters and although she finally relented on Kim, she drew the line at Kris, who was desperate to attend.  'Anna wants a parade of stars at the gala, not a parade of reality stars!'  According to Radar, Ms Wintour, 63, also refused to let the Real Housewives of New York buy a $250,000 table at the high fashion event.  'One Kardashian is enough!' Kris's pregnant daughter Kim attended the punk-themed event for the first time last week on the arm of boyfriend Kanye West  Though it seems Ramona Singer, Carole Radziwill, LuAnn de Lesseps, Heather Thomson, Sonja Morgan and Aviva Drescher would have been contributing to funds raised for the Met's Costume Institute, they apparently remain personae non gratae.  'Anna would never, ever allow a group of Real Housewives to rub shoulders with fashion‚Äôs elite,' the source said.  This is not the first rumor surrounding Ms Wintour's refusal to allow a Kardashian to attend the Met Gala.  Not welcome? Ms Wintour also apparently refused to let the Real Housewives of New York buy a $250,000 table at the high fashion event  Last year it was reported that Kim Kardashian had been banned from the guest list, and so beau Kanye West was seen walking the red carpet alone.  Now that Ms Kardashian is seven months' pregnant with her first child however, it appears that Ms Wintour's alleged dislike of the reality star has softened."

"On Sunday morning, Trump returned to the topic on Twitter. He wrote, ‚ÄúNFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.‚Äù Following some players locking arms, while other knelt during the National Anthem, the president again tweeted, ‚ÄúGreat solidarity for our National Anthem and for our Country. Standing with locked arms is good, kneeling is not acceptable. Bad ratings!‚Äù  Now celebrities are reacting. Ellen DeGeneres tweeted, ‚ÄúAs a football fan, I am proud of the NFL players today. Nothing is more American than the right to peacefully protest.‚Äù Brooklyn Decker asked, ‚ÄúHow did 1 person get us to a place where if you stand during the anthem you support white supremacy & if you kneel you are unpatriotic?‚Äù And George Lopez wrote, ‚ÄúStanding in Unity, locked arms and standing proud (its suppose to be #takingaknee).‚Äù  In a long instagram post, Elisabeth Hasselbeck offered, ‚ÄúNotes on today, the @NFL and our #NationalAnthem -We have a leader that used bombastic hurtful language and that is not helpful.

"Getty Images  Let's start this off with a reminder that frizz is natural and beautiful. But my guess is you've come to this article because you're looking to try a particular frizz-free style. It's your prerogative to embrace frizz and flyaways on a day-to-day basis and still want to try a slicked look every now and then. So here's what to know.  You might be familiar with frizz and what it looks like, but understanding what exactly causes it is key when trying to work with it. Allow me to explain: When the outermost layer of your hair (called the cuticle) is raised, moisture enters the strand and causes it to swell and create the frizzy effect you're familiar with seeing. So, what can you do to maintain smooth cuticles? Celebrity hairstylist Mark Townsend, New York-based stylist Mark Garrison, and Ursula Stephen, who works with Ciara and Kerry Washington, offer up their expert tricks for fighting frizz.    While you're washing your hair...  1. Choose a sulfate-free, glycerin-packed shampoo.  Shampoos with sulfates strip and dehydrate your strands, which is the opposite of you want when looking to maintain moisture. Instead, look for one with glycerin high up in the ingredient list (the closer ingredients are to the top of the list, the more concentrated they are), since it helps combat frizz by penetrating the hair shaft and hydrating it from the inside out. It also creates a protective coating over the outside of the hair shaft, so it doesn't break, says Townsend. Try Honest Deeply Nourishing Hypoallergenic Shampoo and Body Wash.    2. Don't skip conditioner.  It's all about depositing moisture in your hair, or else the cuticle will open up to let moisture from the air in, turning your hair from smooth to frizzy. Look for a conditioner that contains glycerin as well as other hydrating ingredients (like coconut oil and shea butter), and apply it from midshaft down to your ends, keeping it away from your roots if you're worried about it weighing down your hair. Try Carol's Daughter Sacred Tiare Anti-Breakage & Anti-Frizz Fortifying Conditioner.  3. But do skip shampoo.  You might think your hair needs to be shampooed several times a week but it doesn't. Every two days, rinse your hair with only conditioner. Conditioner contains a small amount of surfactants (what shampoo uses to cleanse your hair), so it will clean it without stripping your hair of its natural oils. Garrison suggests using a lightweight conditioner if you have fine hair, like Nexxus Hydra-Light Weightless Moisture Conditioner. If you have thick and coarse hair, you can use a rich formula, like Redken Genius Wash for Coarse Hair.  4. Mask weekly.  Doing a special treatment at least once a week, especially in colder months, will help fill any holes in your hair shaft that soak up outside moisture and contribute to frizz. Leonor Greyl Masque √† L'Orchid√©e contains glycerin, strengthening silk proteins, and smoothing vegetal ceramides to fight frizz.  Getty  When you‚Äôre styling your hair‚Ä¶  5. Don't blow-dry soaking wet hair.  Too much hot air focused directly on your strands dehydrates it, making it frizzy. If you have straight-to-slightly-wavy hair, let your hair air-dry 90 percent of the way, Garrison says, and then use a dryer on it for the last 10 percent.    6. Use dry oil.  While your hair is still wet, apply a moisture-locking dry oil, like Dove Hair Therapy Nourishing Oil Care, from your ends to midway up your hair shaft; oil acts as a barrier, keeping liquids from penetrating. Once your hair is 90 percent dry, use a round brush with mixed bristles (the plastic ones pick up the hair and pull it into the boar bristles for added tension, which makes the hair super straight) to seal the cuticle for a smooth finish. You can also flat-iron your hair after it's dry ‚Äî nothing will seal the cuticle like intense heat, Garrison advises.  7. Get frizz-free waves with buns.  Although hot tools are ideal for sealing a cuticle, if you want waves but want to limit the amount of heat styling, twist your hair into a bun while it dries (the frizz-fighting happens as your hair cools, when your cuticle locks into place).  8. Use a cream hydrator and a diffuser for thick, coarse, and curly hair.  After you've shampooed and conditioned your hair, while it's still wet, apply a cream-based product (Stephen uses Motions Natural Textures Hydrate My Curls Pudding on her clients) from root to tip. When you apply the product, instead of rubbing it in, warm the product between your palms and fingers, and squeeze it onto your hair. Then, wrap your curls around your fingers to shape them exactly how you want, and let your strands air dry. You can also use a diffuser on low speed, high heat (aiming it downward to keep it from ruffling the cuticle) to dry it.    Getty  To maintain your style‚Ä¶  9. Caught in the rain? Try a dry conditioning spray.  No matter how good your blowout is, once rain or crazy humidity hits your hair, frizz is bound to set in. Thankfully, the five-oil blend in the quick-drying Living Proof No Frizz Instant De-Frizzer was created for this very scenario and works to bring your hair back to its original state.  10. Use hand or body lotion to tame a frizzy ponytail.  If your hair is in a ponytail and the sides start to frizz up, smooth them down with hairspray. But if the back of your pony turns into a frizz ball, squeeze some lotion into your palms, rub them together, and gently run your fingers through your hair to make it look polished, Garrison suggests.  11. Use pins and hairspray (not serum) for flyaways.  According to Garrison, serums aren't ideal or strong enough for smoothing flyaways. So if your updo tends to get frizzy, stick to bobby pins and hairspray to help slick down those bad boys.  Getty  12. Apply a leave-in conditioner before you workout.  The sodium in your perspiration can dehydrate your hair so it's always a good idea to apply a leave-in conditioner to your strands before working out. Try Vernon Francois Leave~In Conditioner. Also, if you have textured hair and normally work out in a silk scarf, swap it out for a cotton handkerchief, since cotton absorbs moisture and you want the fabric to soak up the sweat, not trap it in, Stephen says.  13. Brush your hair upside down to distribute its natural oils.  Regularly brushing your hair is great, yes, but try flipping it over and brushing it upside down with a boar bristle brush, like Spornette's, to distribute the oils from your scalp/roots onto the rest of your hair. This key step will keep your hair hydrated and block out humidity, Garrison says.  14. Wrap your hair in a silk scarf before going to sleep.  If you haven't switched your moisture-sucking cotton pillowcase to silk, Stephen says to sleep with your hair wrapped up in a bun, then tie on a silk scarf to help your hair retain its moisture.

"If you're the type that sits indoors for an entire weekend till you've finished a whole season of your favorite show, then it's been over a year since you last saw the finale of Orange Is the New Black. Even if you have an excellent memory, there's been a lot of television since then ‚Äî an entire season of Game of Thrones, Westworld, etc. ‚Äî plus more actual news than any one human can keep up with day to day. Here, a quick refresher on season five to catch you up before season six debuts on July 27.  Where the Season Started  Season five picked up immediately where season four left off, so just for a minute, think back to 2016. Poussey died during a protest in the cafeteria, when CO Bayley restrained her with a chokehold. After Caputo refused to fire Bayley, the inmates decided to riot; season five began with Daya shooting CO Humphrey in the leg. In the first episode, the inmates gained pretty much full control over the prison, and Taystee eventually got Caputo to read a statement about Poussey's death that was then posted to Twitter.  After that initial statement about Poussey, reports about the riot continued to leak out. Remember celebrity chef Judy King? She was still an inmate at Litchfield when the riot started, and after a news camera caught her tied up on the roof (some of the other inmates were trying to find her stash of food), some outlets mistakenly reported that there had been anti-Christian attacks within the prison. Meanwhile, most of the guards were held captive in an office in the sleeping area, and various inmates took turns making sure they didn't escape.  Frieda in her bunker. Netflix  While most of the prisoners stayed within their usual confines, Frieda retreated to a ""bunker"" she built in an abandoned swimming pool that was supposed to have been filled in by Figueroa. Eventually, Gina, Yoga Jones, and Anita joined her there, with later appearances by Piper, Alex, Red, and several others.  Where the Season Ended  As the riot gained outside media attention, MCC tried to negotiate with the inmates for the release of the COs, with Taystee acting as an advocate for the rights of the prisoners. Gloria also wanted to end the standoff so she could get out and see her son in the hospital, and smuggled the guards out. The guards then escaped via a hole in the fence, meaning Taystee's negotiations were all for nothing. An emergency team then swarmed the prison in riot gear, and many of the inmates, including Flaca and Maritza, were led outside in handcuffs.  Netflix  The team then realized that they were still 10 inmates short, but these inmates were the ones inside the pool bunker: Piper, Red, Alex, Taystee, Cindy, Suzanne, Blanca, Gloria, Nicky, and Frieda. Before the riot team broke into the bunker, though, one major thing happened. Piscatella, who'd been tied up by Frieda and then set free by Red, died after another officer shot him by accident. Though a superior officer knew that it was a response team member who did it, it's not yet clear whether one of the inmates will be blamed for the death.  Lingering Questions  1. Where is Alex? Though Alex was with the bunker crew in the finale, she's not visible in the season six trailer and Piper wonders aloud where she is. Does this mean she didn't end up in maximum security with the rest of the inmates? Or is she just being held in solitary where they can't see her?  2. Are all of the inmates in the same place? The finale saw the inmates being loaded onto different buses, with Flaca and Maritza getting separated. Were those buses headed to different prisons, or did they all end up at Litchfield Max?  Netflix  3. Will Morello have her baby? Morello found out in season five that she was expecting a child with her husband Vincent, but we don't really know how far along she is or how much time will pass in season six, so it's possible she could have the baby in one of the coming episodes.  4. How did Pennsatucky get caught? Though Pennsatucky was last seen in the CO cabins, she's definitely back in prison in the trailer for season six. Who put her back?  5. Did Chang escape? Chang also ran away during the riot, but unlike Pennsatucky, she's not in the trailer. Does this mean she escaped Litchfield for good?  Chang contemplates her escape. Netflix  6. Who will take the fall for the riot? Almost everyone in the prison participated in the riot in some way or another, but there are a couple of major crimes that investigators will be looking to solve; those are also the ones that could end with certain inmates having years added to their sentences. Based on the trailer for season six, it's anyone's guess who'll end up in trouble, but for now, no one is safe.

"Late night TV was slammed by social media and news outlets for not addressing the sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last week, but late night let loose on Monday.  ABC's Jimmy Kimmel opened his Monday night show explaining how he got into a Twitter spat with Donald Trump Jr., who asked him on Twitter about his thoughts on Weinstein.  ""He's speaking, I don't know if you know about this, but there was an expose in the New York Times about decades of sexual harassment accusations made against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who is not the President, and isn't particularly well-known outside of L.A. and New York,"" Kimmel said. ""But the insinuation was that we, as part of the biased left-wing media propaganda machine, wouldn't say anything about him because he's a Democrat. Never mind the thousands of jokes about Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton and all the other Bills of that ilk.""  The host also said that people pointed out that Weinstein was a Hillary Clinton supporter.  ""I'm not defending Hillary Clinton. The fact is, her campaign did take money from what turned out to be a high-profile man who has been accused of sexual harassment multiple times, and not just one of them, by the way. She took money from two of them!"" Kimmel said. ""Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump, who donated to Hillary's campaign in 2008.""  Hillary Clinton has, so far, not spoken publicly about the controversy.  Kimmel then ended his story with a joke about the producer, which he said he promised he would do.  ""What's the difference between Harvey Weinstein and the Pillsbury Doughboy?"" he said. ""When the Pillsbury Doughboy offers you a roll, he doesn't ask you to watch him take a shower for it.""  Stephen Colbert commented on the scandal during Monday night's episode of CBS' ""The Late Show,"" explaining that the producer was fired from his own production company -- The Weinstein Company. This, Colbert joked, forced them to change their name to something more positive: ""Asbestos Child Slappers, Inc.""  Colbert then rattled off a few jokes about the reported allegations against Weinstein, calling the producer's alleged behavior ""monstrous"" and ""indefensible.""  ""Weinstein's lawyers called him 'a dinosaur learning new ways,'"" Colbert said. ""Okay, A) that's no excuse, B) dinosaurs did not touch themselves in front of the employees. The T-Rex's arms were way too short.""  Related: Late night TV slammed for overlooking Harvey Weinstein scandal  Jimmy Fallon also made a joke about the subject during his opening monologue on Monday's ""Tonight Show.""  ""Harvey Weinstein was fired by his company yesterday for being accused of sexual harassment,"" the NBC host said. ""They said if he keeps it up, he'll end up with his own show on Fox News.""  Seth Meyers, host of NBC's ""Late Night,"" brought out three female writers on the show to talk about the allegations.  Here's what the women of #LNSM have to say about Harvey Weinstein. pic.twitter.com/r4oGo8yFAj ‚Äî Late Night (@LateNightSeth) October 10, 2017  The bit showed the women on the ""Late Night"" staff reacting around the office to Weinstein's apology by pantomiming shock by spitting out their coffee in each other's faces, and having what appeared to be their eyes literally pop out of their heads."

Our cousin site Gossip Cop, who has been busting bad dish for years writes, ‚ÄúThis is a blatant manipulation.

Instead, the tabloid put together ‚Äúwords from a series of interviews‚Äù that he gave long before he died.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will officially be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel in...  Deal or No Deal  ...and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  While there was plenty of royal news that flooded our inboxes this week, we were most excited about getting an update on Meghan's wedding dress! We already knew that she had selected a dress designer (thanks to her stylist-turned-pal, Jessica Mulroney), but now we know what she'll be wearing on her special day is officially in the design process!  A source told ET earlier this week that Meghan has already met with the dress designer, and is busy adding unique touches to the couple's big day.  We also found out that the Los Angeles native has been appointed a secretary to handle her increasingly busy royal schedule and duties. Amy Pickerill, a former Kensington Palace press officer, was announced on Monday as the new assistant private secretary in the office of Prince Harry.  As for Meghan and Prince Harry's actual wedding day, expect a lot of security. Ken Wharfe, the late Princess Diana's former bodyguard, told ET on Thursday that police will make sure nothing is overlooked for the massive occasion, and no expense will be spared.  ""From my own experiences -- and speaking to colleagues within the last few weeks -- Scotland Yard and neighboring police forces that will be part of this operation will be only too aware of how important it is to make sure that no stone is left unturned, and you know, one talks in this day of austerity of finance,"" he said. ""Trust me on this occasion, finance has nothing to do with this. Scotland Yard, together with Thames Valley Police -- which will be policing this event -- money is not an object, and they make sure that the very best of security is put on display to make sure that security is not compromised.""  And after the soon-to-be-married couple's anthrax scare last Monday, we wouldn't be surprised if there's even more heightened security as they continue their royal duties ahead of their nuptials.  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  Looks like Megan and Kate Middleton have been spending even more quality time together! The former Suits star often goes from her Nottingham Cottage to Kate's humble abode to have tea or exchange advice, according to US Weekly.  ‚Äú[Meghan] shares tips she‚Äôs read about healthy eating,"" a source told the publication.  And while it's not a rumor, it seems as if people are comparing Meghan to Princess Diana more and more frequently. According to multiple reports, the bride-to-be has been making secret visits to comfort victims of the Grenfell Tower, much like when Diana would also sneak away from Kensington Palace to visit hospital patients.  ""Meghan's visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts,"" one community member, who met the soon-to-be-royal, told E!  OUT AND ABOUT  After making a trip to Scotland, Meghan and Harry took a break from the spotlight this week -- but did have time for a fun date night.  The engaged couple attended a Hamilton show at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London's West End last Friday night. One of the show's cast members, Leslie Garcia Bowman, even took to Twitter to express his excitement over having the couple in attendance.  Was an honour to have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in to watch @HamiltonWestEnd last night! ‚Äî Leslie Garcia Bowman (@lesliegbowman) February 17, 2018  SERVIN' UP SUITS  If you've been following along with our royals countdown each week, then you're well aware that we've been binge-watching Meghan's show, Suits, since the beginning. This week, we were super happy to see Meghan, who plays aspiring lawyer Rachel Zane, try on an Anne Barge wedding gown during the ""Cold Feet"" episode of season 5.  When the episode originally aired on the USA network last year, Meghan spoke with Glamour, revealing some of her personal favorite bridal styles.  ""Delphine Manivet and Christos Costarellos are faves of mine for their uniqueness and beauty,"" she gushed at the time. ""I will always be a fan of Ellie Saab. J. Mendel is spectacular as well, especially for more structural designs.""  Watch Meghan model her character's wedding dress in the video below:  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Because our muscles are still kinda hating us from trying Meghan's favorite Pilates class last week (more on that HERE), we decided to take it easy this time by having a ""treat yourself"" night. We sat back, relaxed and drank like Meghan. Yes, turns out, girl loves a good wine!  ""God, do I love wine; a beautiful full red or a crisp white,"" she revealed in an interview with The New Potato in 2013.

"The high stakes on Dancing with the Stars: Athletes has led show host Tom Bergeron to equate this season's competition to a ""bloodbath.""  Season 26 of the ABC series is a four-week affair, which is much shorter than the 10-11 week run the competition generally goes for. Athletes are subsequently given less time to master the skills needed to impress the judges and fans. This has led the 10 participating athletes to strive harder to bring their A-game week after week.  ""In the context of doing the show, you don't get the sense of who these people are [in four weeks]. Or as we say in the reality biz, 'the journey,'"" Bergeron, 63, told Access Wednesday. ""It's pretty much a ballroom bloodbath. I have a feeling that come June 1, I'll be going: 'Did that even happen?""  Each week, the contestant's fate is determined by combining the judge's grades with the number of votes they accumulated from viewers. In its first two weeks, the long-running reality competition series eliminated two couples with the lowest combined scores. Viewers tuning in to week three Monday will see the remaining six couples battle it out to survive a triple elimination round. Therefore, only three competing partners will have a shot at winning the competition.  Ahead of the Season 26 premiere, showrunner Andrew Llinares discussed the competitive nature of the show's all-athletes edition. ""It's going to be super-competitive,"" Llinares told E! News in April. ""I think the fact that it's four weeks and 10 couples, we're going to see things change very quickly right way through the season. And the other thing about athletes, of course, is these are people who compete for a living, who train for a living, so I think what we're going to see potentially is the most competitive season ever.""  Early predictions from Goldderby.com pegged Adam Rippon as the winner, whereas oddsmakers at SportsBettingDime.com suggested fellow figure skater Mirai Nagasu would win it all. However, NBA legend and former DWTS contestant Kareem Abdul-Jabbar‚Äîwho was eliminated alongside partner Lindsay Arnold Monday‚Äîshared his predictions as to who will win Season 26.  ""I think it's probably going to be one of the dancers, Adam or Mirai, because they do it every day,"" Abdul-Jabbar, 71, said on Good Morning America on Tuesday. ""That's what they do for a living, so I expect them to be able to execute. They've got great presence on the dance floor, and their execution of all the moves was impeccable.""  ABC/Kelsey McNeal"
"New York [USA], August 25 : When it comes to being a Wonder Woman on-screen or off-screen, there is no one better than Gal Gadot.  In an interview with Rolling Stone about her title role in the blockbuster 'Wonder Woman', the 32-year-old actress shared how she responded to body shamers who said she wasn't curvy enough to play the iconic heroine.  When her body was criticised, the actress said, ""Listen, if you want to be for real, then the Amazons, they had only one boob. Exactly one boob,"" said the former Miss Israel, alluding to a theory in Greek mythology.  Continuing, ""So what are you talking about here? Me having small boobs and small ass? That will make all the difference.""  Gadot also revealed that she and Jenkins wanted Wonder Woman to be strong but feminine.  ""I didn't want to play the cold-hearted warrior. We didn't want to fall into the cliche¬¥s,"" noted Gadot.  She also shared that she gets really surprised when people come and ask her ""Are you a feminist?""  Gadot shared, ""People always ask me, 'Are you a feminist?' And I find the question surprising, because I think, 'Yes, of course. Every woman, every man, everyone should be a feminist. Because whoever is not a feminist is a sexist. Me and my younger sister were taught to value ourselves.""  Adding, ""I had a very sheltered kind of life. There was no TV-watching. It was always 'Take a ball and go play.' In general, I was a good girl, a good student, a pleaser and I was a tomboy, always with wounds and scratches on my knees.""  The 2017 remake just reached the USD 800 million-dollar mark in earnings, a fact that doesn't seem to surprise the leading lady.  ""It just shows that the world was ready for a female-driven action movie,"" Gadot said."

"The casting couldn't be more perfect: quintessential Hollywood good guy Tom Hanks will play beloved children's television star Fred Rogers in a new biopic about the television pioneer.  Tom Hanks is Mister Rogers, coming to a neighborhood near you October 2019. pic.twitter.com/2TP3eiPUCx ‚Äî Sony Pictures (@SonyPictures) September 27, 2018  Loosely based on journalist Tom Junod's 1998 Esquire profile of Rogers, You Are My Friend will reportedly center around how ""a cynical journalist begrudgingly accepts an assignment to write a profile piece on the beloved icon and finds his perspective on life transformed,"" according to Variety, which broke the news this afternoon.  Junod, now a senior writer at ESPN, is a fan of Hanks playing Rogers.  ""The really cool thing about Tom Hanks playing Fred is that Fred and Tom Hanks are similar in a really essential way in that they are gentle people, they are soft spoken people, but they are powerful people,"" he told Esquire. ""I think that Tom Hanks can really bring that aspect of Fred out.""  The script for the film was written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster. Marielle Heller, who is perhaps best known for Diary of a Teenage Girl, will direct.    ""As a mother, I am so inspired by the teachings of Fred Rogers and as a human I am in awe of his life‚Äôs work,"" Heller said. ""I can‚Äôt wait to bring his story to the public and be a part of such a thoughtful, smart group of people who are all coming together to make this film, which truly feels to me like an antidote to our very fractured culture.""

You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumors all the time.

There‚Äôs no winners in that, it‚Äôs just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that.‚Äù  Allen, who has similarly faced allegations of sexual abuse ‚Äì including accusations levied by his son Ronan Farrow, who penned the New Yorker‚Äòs expose into Weinstein ‚Äì also voiced concern that the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal would result in ‚Äúa witch hunt atmosphere‚Äù in Hollywood and beyond.  ‚ÄúYou also don‚Äôt want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself.

How much could one read into reports that they spent New Year‚Äôs together, and he was buying her at least one of the rocks that she got? And how did this all end so that she could embark on a new relationship with fellow New York City treasure Alex Rodriguez?  Loading View on Instagram  Now, there are some answers: Drake dropped his album More Life on Saturday night, and E.W. reports that Lopez is all over it, but not on it exactly. ‚ÄúGet It Together,‚Äù which first ‚Äúleaked‚Äù to the public when TMZ published videos of J.Lo and Drake at a prom-themed party, dancing to the song, sounded as though it featured Lopez‚Äôs vocals. British singer Jorja Smith is the one singing on the final version, though.  More pointedly still, ‚ÄúTeenage Fever‚Äù samples the entire hook from ‚ÄúIf You Had My Love,‚Äù Lopez‚Äôs 1999 hit from her first album, On the 6, but slows it down so it‚Äôs more somber. Is that a dig? Or is that the collaboration part that they were hinting at all along?  The most pointed reference to Jenny from the Block arrived on the opening track ‚ÄúFree Smoke,‚Äù in which he raps, ‚ÄúMiraval to the face‚Äù (i.e., Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie‚Äôs shared wine label that specializes in ros√©), followed by, ‚ÄúI drunk text J. Lo / Old number so it bounce back.‚Äù How perfectly Drake that he learns he‚Äôs been rejected by Lopez via a passive number change while tipsy on ros√©. Almost too Drake, really.  This was the problem all along. The stories circling these two were on the nose, a little too convenient for drumming up album excitement. Their matching intimate Instagrams arrived too suddenly with not enough confirmed clarity from either camp.  Loading View on Instagram  Drake‚Äôs feelings could be genuinely hurt, leading to him cutting Lopez out of the album. He also could have pivoted to fit the public narrative when nobody bought that they were together. Or the amount of J.Lo on the album now could have been the plan all along. We don‚Äôt know. But what we do know is that Lopez officially denied the relationship almost two weeks before More Life landed. During her Shades of Blue media blitz in early March, she told The Daily Show‚Äôs Trevor Noah, ‚ÄúLet me clear this up. I am not with Drake. Maybe that‚Äôs all I need to say.‚Äù  The next day was the Instagram double-tap heard round the world, and Page Six confirmed that Alex Rodriguez and Lopez were dating.  The tone of this relationship is more fitting and authentic. Lopez is neither hiding their time spent together‚Äîthey‚Äôve been seen out at dinner around Miami and in the Bahamas‚Äînor is she promoting the new coupling on her own feeds.  On Saturday, right before More Life dropped, she arrived at the Yankee training camp in Florida to reportedly watch the retired Bronx bomber from a private box. By now, it‚Äôs very much, ‚ÄúDrake who?‚Äù  Vanity Fair has reached out to Lopez for comment on the album."

"Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA‚Äôs surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.‚ÄúI have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA‚Äôs payroll,‚Äù claims Edward Snowden. ‚ÄúHe is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.‚ÄùMr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.‚ÄúOsama Bin Laden was one of the CIA‚Äôs most efficient operatives for a long time,‚Äù claims the famous whistleblower. ‚ÄúWhat kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody‚Äôs looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.‚ÄùMr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him."
"It‚Äôs no secret that Kanye West is causing a swarm of media speculation about his strange behavior. From calling slavery ‚Äúa choice‚Äù to openly supporting President Trump, West has sparked just as much outrage as there is intrigue surrounding his celebrity. Basically, it‚Äôs been two weeks of wild behavior and lots of questions. And now there‚Äôs even more of that to contemplate. So, what‚Äôs happened now? Well, Kanye West got rid of his phone, so he‚Äôs not answering anyone‚Äôs text messages.  The news of West‚Äôs phone abandonment comes from West himself via is Twitter account. West took to the social media platform to explain his lack of communication to friends, family, and business associates:  For anyone who‚Äôs tried to text or call me in the past 2 weeks I got rid of that phone so I could focus on these albums  West is currently in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, trying to focus all his energy on his upcoming album. So, basically, he has ditched mobile communication in favor of cultivating his inherent talent and musical genius. Can‚Äôt blame him for drowning out the noise to focus on the music. He‚Äôs clearly committed to his craft.  Here‚Äôs a look at what West tweeted about getting rid of his cell phone:  West‚Äôs wife, Kim Kardashian, reportedly joined the 40-year-old rapper in Wyoming in early May 2018. At the time, a source close to the family told People that Kardashian was content to join him as he worked:  Kim happily joined Kanye in Jackson Hole. She wants to be supportive so he can finish his album. The album has caused Kanye a lot of stress. He is a perfectionist and wants the music to be amazing.  West‚Äôs dedication to his music is truly admirable and it‚Äôs great that Kardashian is there to support him in this effort. A lot of fantastic and interesting music is sure to come out of it.  In addition to supporting West‚Äôs creative pursuits, Kardashian is also reportedly worried about his health, especially in light of his recent erratic and scandalous behavior. According to People‚Äôs source, Kardashian headed out to Wyoming to make sure he‚Äôs in a good place:  Kim is absolutely concerned about Kanye. She likes being in Jackson Hole so she can keep an eye on his health. She wants to make sure he eats and sleeps enough. She doesn‚Äôt want him to push himself beyond his limits. She wants a healthy Kanye.  How sweet and supportive of her! It‚Äôs so obvious how much West and Kardashian love and value each other. You have to give them credit for always having each other‚Äôs backs, even in light health issues and media scandals.  Hopefully, none of that will overshadow West's music. On Tuesday, May 15, West previewed some of his new music on Twitter. The rapper posted a video of himself sitting at a keyboard while a beat plays in the background. Here‚Äôs a look at what West is working on:  In the video, you can also see what seem to be sample tracklists on whiteboards above his head and to his right. These tracklists look to be part of multiple projects that he‚Äôs working on at the moment. Among the tracks listed are ‚ÄúExtacy‚Äù, ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt Leave‚Äù, ‚ÄúReborn‚Äù, and ‚Äú4th Dimension.‚Äù  So, it‚Äôs pretty clear that West is hard at work and making all that studio magic happen. Dedicated fans of the rapper are waiting anxiously to see what types of tracks he‚Äôs going to drop. If the preview on Twitter is a hint of what‚Äôs to come, then his fans are definitely going to be happy!"

"The murder of Jason Hudson occurred on October 24, 2008, when 29-year-old Jason Hudson and his 57-year-old mother, Darnell Donerson, were discovered shot to death inside Donerson's home in Chicago, Illinois.[1] The victims were the brother and mother of singer Jennifer Hudson. Jennifer's seven-year-old nephew Julian King, the son of her elder sister Julia Hudson, was initially reported missing and an AMBER Alert was issued; Julian King's body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area, in a parked car matching the AMBER Alert description.[2] Autopsy results indicated that Julian King's death was due to ""multiple gunshot wounds.""[3] A pistol found in a West Side vacant lot was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police.[4]  Investigation [ edit ]  On the day that the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother were discovered, Chicago police took Julia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour, 57, into custody but did not file charges against him.[5] Balfour was on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking and possession of a stolen vehicle. The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered.[1]  After the Chicago police had held Balfour for the maximum 48 hours allowable without charging him with a crime, he was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation.[5] At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told by the Cook County State's Attorney's office that Balfour's current or former girlfriend told investigators she saw Balfour with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder occurred.[5] Board chairman Jorge Montes said that although Balfour may have violated other conditions of his parole, including failing to get anger management and substance abuse counseling, the gun allegation alone was sufficient to hold Balfour until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board.[5]  Montes said that the allegations from the woman included that Balfour had admitted to her that he was involved in the murders, but those allegations were not part of the parole review hearing.[6] Balfour appeared at the hearing without an assigned attorney because he had not been charged with a crime.[5]  Arrest and Conviction [ edit ]  On December 1, 2008, Balfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Donerson, Jason Hudson and King, as well as one count of felony home invasion.[7] At a December 3 court hearing in which Balfour was denied bail, a prosecutor alleged that Balfour had committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man.[8] Balfour's attorney Joshua Kutnick said that his client maintained his innocence in the crimes.[7] Balfour was indicted on December 30.[9] On January 20, 2009, he pleaded not guilty to all charges.[10] He was convicted in May, 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years.  Legacy [ edit ]  In the aftermath of the deaths, Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation ""to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to a violent crime,"" according to a statement released to the press.[11]"
"Kim Kardashian West would ‚Äúfeel safe and comfortable‚Äù having a longer stay in Paris.  The reality TV star returned to the French capital earlier this year to support her husband Kanye West at the Louis Vuitton spring/summer 2019 menswear fashion show, and it helped her overcome her fears, as it was the first time she‚Äôd been back since her hotel robbery at gunpoint in 2016.  Speaking on ‚ÄúKeeping Up With The Kardashians,‚Äù she reflected, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever really forget my experiences in Paris ‚Äî the good or the bad ‚Äî and I think that‚Äôs okay.  ‚ÄúIt all has made me who I am. Thinking about it, I think I could go back and spend more time and feel safe and comfortable.‚Äù  Kim , 37, decided to make the difficult return after her horrific ordeal two years ago following a conversation with her husband.  The 41-year-old rapper was flying to the City of Love in June to support his longtime friend Virgil Abloh , who is Louis Vuitton‚Äôs Men‚Äôs artistic director.  He said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to put any pressure on you to go to Paris. I know that was really hard the last time you were in Paris.  ‚ÄúSo I think just for the culture, for Kim K. to show up to the first black designer at [a] Louis Vuitton show who was the best man at my wedding, just the world would just love to see you there.‚Äù  While Kardashian admitted on Sunday‚Äôs, Dec. 2, 2018, episode that being in Paris brought back memories of the robbery, she was ‚Äúso glad‚Äù to have done it.  She added: ‚ÄúIt was so good. Like, honestly, I‚Äôm so glad we went. Like [Kanye] had to be there‚Ä¶  ‚ÄúFor a second, I was like, I was so stressed out over my security, just the movement of everyone. But other than that, it was fine. I didn‚Äôt really have a lot of anxiety.‚Äù"
"And now, there‚Äôs her hugely anticipated single titled ‚ÄúWork.‚Äù It‚Äôs about working for a paycheck no matter what else is going on in your life. It is also, of course, designed to get her that paycheck. You might call the way it goes about attaining this goal brazen for anyone else but Rihanna: Tempting accusations of boringness, hackiness, and crimes against art, the song offers a hook that practically parodies pop‚Äôs love of repetition‚Äîand then repeats it, a lot. But there‚Äôs something fascinating about the tune, something that elevates it beyond ringtone status. It doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere. It approximates what work feels like.  The producer Boi-1da‚Äôs bright, bubbly beat creates a see-sawing sensation out of a few sounds. A keyboard ping anchors the downbeat and then climbs up, up, down, down, returning to its starting point. Electronic notes on the low end burble out a more asymmetrical pattern recalling reggae, but they too have the general shape of ascending and descending. The percussion is subtle, rendered with a skittering sound that recalls the shaking of a kettle. When Rihanna‚Äôs voice comes in, so do some signifiers of ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s dance and rap: digital handclaps, distorted shouting. It all adds up to the feeling of a lot of bustling in one spot‚Äîactivity, but not necessarily movement.  Rihanna‚Äôs hook conjures a different kind of monotony. After a few quick notes in yet another up-and-back pattern, she gets stuck, like a needle in a groove, for ‚Äúwork work work work work.‚Äù There‚Äôs no stopping this getting in your head. ‚ÄúWork‚Äù becomes ‚Äúdirt‚Äù becomes ‚Äúlove‚Äù becomes ‚Äúturn,‚Äù but the modulations don‚Äôt matter‚ÄîRihanna has found her next great nonsense syllable, another ‚Äúooh na na‚Äù or ‚Äúella ella eh.‚Äù Her singing in the verses, where she dresses down some guy who isn‚Äôt meeting her expectations, is actually rather pretty. I‚Äôve seen a lot of commenters say she‚Äôs copying the mumbling trend that‚Äôs taken hold among younger pop vocalists like Ariana Grande, but the truth is that Rihanna helped popularize the notion of liquifying words in the name of catchiness.  As for Drake‚Äôs verse, it strikes me as pretty terrible‚Äîthe disappointed lounge singer schtick from ‚ÄúHotline Bling,‚Äù but without the silken melody or sense of surprise. ‚ÄúIf you had a twin I would still choose you‚Äù is the only real attempt at a memorable line. Whatever. Drake being as popular as he is right now will be yet another incentive for radio playlist makers to keep this song in rotation, possibly giving it the activating energy needed to become a hit.  And to be sure, it will need a good deal of exposure to reach the success levels of Rihanna‚Äôs previous smashes. The song‚Äôs undeniably catchy, but it also has a strangely unfinished quality. To me, though, that‚Äôs its charm. The verses, choruses, and bridge mostly bleed into each other, forgoing soft-to-loud explosions or exciting rhythmic changes. Boi-1da does create some sense of escalation‚Äîanother drum beat for the second chorus, flashes of flutes, autotuned harmonies, and far-off piano. But the shifts are subtle and fleeting. Unlike a lot of radio pop, ‚ÄúWork‚Äù is about small modulations, a singer and a producer and a rapper plugging along as we all must do. At the end, the song makes the unfashionable move of simply fading out. Rihanna put in her three and a half minutes of work; now pay her what you owe her.  We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com."
"Tobey Maguire did NOT pursue Emma Stone and get her phone number at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, despite a made-up tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust this claim. We‚Äôre told it ‚Äúnever happened.‚Äù  ¬© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  According to Life & Style, Maguire recently spotted the La La Land star at the swanky Hollywood hotel. A so-called ‚Äúsource‚Äù tells the magazine, ‚ÄúHe was checking her out a lot, hoping she‚Äôd notice him.‚Äù The outlet‚Äôs dubious insider goes on to say that the actor eventually approached her, and began ‚Äúshowering her with cheesy compliments, telling her how all of Hollywood was in love with her.‚Äù  The magazine‚Äôs ‚Äúsource‚Äù then purports that Stone ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt seem interested in him,‚Äù but she ‚Äúfinally gave him her number and suggested meeting up for coffee, then ran off.‚Äù The supposed insider adds, ‚ÄúIt was pretty obvious she was blowing him off.‚Äù  Gossip Cop, however, checked in with a reliable source close to the actor, who exclusively tells us the tabloid‚Äôs entire account of events is made-up and simply ‚Äúnever happened.‚Äù Unfortunately, we‚Äôre not surprised that Life & Style published this completely fictitious story. Gossip Cop previously busted the outlet for falsely alleging Eva Mendes was jealous of Stone‚Äôs friendship with Ryan Gosling. There was no truth to that claim, and the same goes for this latest one."
"The ongoing rumors about Brad Pitt and his ex-wife, Friends star Jennifer Aniston, continue to swirl regarding a supposed reconciliation between the former couple. The claims have only intensified ever since Jennifer Aniston and her husband of two years, actor Justin Theroux, called it quits recently.  While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie continue to work their way through a very challenging time, involving their own divorce and custody battle over their six children, the pair has been constantly linked to various rumored new loves. Despite Pitt having been falsely linked to a list of beauties, Jennifer Aniston has remained the most frequent female celeb to be rumored as spending time with the heartthrob.  Now the focus is on how Angelina Jolie is reacting to the rumored reconciliation between Pitt and his former wife, Aniston. Reports swirl that Angelina and Jen are gearing up for a showdown over the Allied star and that Pitt is ‚Äúfreaking out‚Äù over the drama that his and Aniston‚Äôs supposed closeness has resulted in.  New Idea shares alleged details relayed by a source on the lengthy love triangle between the three. The insider relays that Jen and Angelina have already spoken about the big night that will see the trio in the same room, along with anyone who‚Äôs anyone in Hollywood and film. The three will all attend the Oscars and the women are said to have discussed boundaries for the occasion that could result in a ‚Äúshowdown‚Äù between Jen and Angelina.  ‚ÄúWord is Jen and Angie had a major discussion about the Oscars. It‚Äôs the biggest night of the year, and they know they‚Äôll both be party-hopping,‚Äù the insider states. ‚ÄúHowever, while Jen, 49 and Ange, 42 both want to stake out their own territory, ‚Äòneither are willing to budge an inch,‚Äô resulting in both ladies agreeing to do their best to avoid each other ‚Äì something neither are very happy about,‚Äù the publication continues.  The star ex-husband to both these talented beauties is reportedly quite stressed out about the potential words that will be exchanged at one of the entertainment industry‚Äôs most formal and important events.  ‚ÄúI heard he‚Äôs frantically texting Jen and Angie to ask them to avoid being in the same room at all costs ‚Äì no good could possibly come from it,‚Äù the insider claims.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux recently announced their separation in a joint statement, within which the pair stated that they will carry on as friends and to not believe any stories that are making the rounds, reminding that what comes from them is the only truth.  This has not stopped fabrications from swirling. The rumors even now go so far as to say that Angelina Jolie and Justin Theroux have met up to find comfort and plot against Jen and Brad over their said reconciliation. This, however, has been debunked and is not to be believed, as Gossip Cop has informed readers.  Jason Merritt / Getty Images  This latest claim is yet to be verified, and if there is tension between the trio, the stars will likely keep their personal matters out of the prestigious event on Sunday."
"A shocking new report claims Kourtney Kardashian‚Äôs pregnant again ‚Äî and they have a theory as to who the father may be! Is it her ex, Younes Bendjima?    Here‚Äôs another plot twist in Kourtney Kardashian‚Äôs love life. The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with ‚Äúwhat appeared to be a bump‚Äù in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! ‚ÄúIt was strange to see because she‚Äôs usually so perfectly svelte,‚Äù a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, ‚ÄúEveryone is whispering that she‚Äôs pregnant with her fourth child.‚Äù If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it‚Äôs the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney‚Äôs boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney‚Äôs anonymous friend makes a shocking claim ‚Äî it‚Äôs more than likely Scott!  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,‚Äù the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 ‚Äì but reportedly, that was not on Scott‚Äôs mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a ‚Äúrecent‚Äù trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! ‚ÄúThey made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,‚Äù the source said before adding, ‚ÄúEveryone is buzzing that she‚Äôs carrying Scott‚Äôs baby.‚Äù As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven‚Äôt publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn‚Äôt fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because ‚Äúall of their kids came out beautifully.‚Äù  And apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren‚Äôt together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney‚Äôs alleged baby bump wasn‚Äôt just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone‚Äôs stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly ‚Äúisn‚Äôt sure how to handle this situation.‚Äù The friend added that Kourtney ‚Äúisn‚Äôt saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she‚Äôs been spending time with‚Ä¶it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner‚Äôs] management skills to straighten out this mess!‚Äù  Maybe this report isn‚Äôt so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum ‚Äì it‚Äôs her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? ‚Äú[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,‚Äù our source told us. ‚ÄúSo if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.‚Äù  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Younes Bendjima‚Äôs and Scott Disick‚Äôs reps for a comment."

"Leonardo DiCaprio was seen kissing his 20-year-old girlfriend, Camila Morrone, at the Eminem show during Coachella.  The Oscar winning actor, Leo, is famous for dating younger models. And this time it was none other than Morrone, the step-daughter of Hollywood acting legend Al Pacino.  Daughter of actors Maximo Morrone and Lucile Sola, Morrone, has been romantically linked to DiCaprio for several months now. Rumors of the two being together first started in the middle of December, when DiCaprio was seen leaving her house. They have been spotted together numerous times ever since.  Sola, 38, has been dating 77-year-old Al Pacino for over 8 years, making him Morrone‚Äôs de facto stepfather.  DiCaprio and Morrone were seen enjoying the show at Coachella together. While Morrone was dressed normally, the Titanic actor attempted to be incognito by wearing a large hoodie and baseball cap. The two cuddled and kissed throughout the show.  Afterwards, they lounged on the grass outside a tent‚Ä¶ with DiCaprio eating while Morrone was lying down with her head in his lap.  The pair were also seen at the Neon Carnival and Rihanna‚Äôs FentyxPuma party. Before Coachella, they were last seen together in late March at breakfast in West Hollywood. In February, the two were spotted at Ellen Degeneres‚Äô birthday party in LA together. And in January, the couple went to Colorado together with Tobey Maguire.  Morrone has worked as a model, appearing on the cover of Vogue Turkey and walking for Moschino‚Äôs 2017 resort collection. She is now working her way into acting. She appeared in James Franco‚Äôs Bukowski and in Death Wish, starring Bruce Willis.  Leonardo has been known to exclusively date younger women (usually supermodels) in the past: Kristen Zang, Amber Valletta, Helena Christensen, Naomi Campbell, Gisele Bundchen, Bar Rafaeli, Blake Lively and Erin Heatherton are just some of the names in Leo‚Äôs little black book."

"Could it be? Demi Lovato seemingly threw shade at Kathy Griffin on Twitter on Friday, June 2, after the comedian‚Äôs press conference about her controversial Donald Trump photo shoot.  ‚ÄúI find it funny when bullies play the victim,‚Äù the singer, 24, tweeted.

"If, on Wednesday morning, you had risen early enough and rejoined the torrid, infinite march that is Twitter, you might have first learned of NBC‚Äôs termination of its morning-news lodestar, Matt Lauer, through neutral channels. At 6:52 A.M., the Times‚Äôs media columnist, Jim Rutenberg, tweeted, ‚ÄúBREAK: NBC Matt Lauer fired, inappropriate workplace behavior . . . story to come.‚Äù But, at 7 A.M., the ‚ÄúToday in New York‚Äù warmup ended, the friendly corporate bells chimed, and the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show, as it has since 1952, started.

Stills of Lauer‚Äîbespectacled and reviewing notes in one, professorially inquisitive in another‚Äîcrossed the screen as the voice of his co-anchor, Savannah Guthrie, announced the breaking news that Lauer‚Äôs employment had been terminated overnight, after an employee had come forward on Monday ‚Äúreporting behavior in violation of our company‚Äôs standards.‚Äù Guthrie‚Äôs voice trembled as the camera captured the tableau‚ÄîGuthrie and her guest co-anchor, Hoda Kotb, palpably sombre, the Popsicle-orange ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show logo floating between them. Guthrie clasped Kotb‚Äôs hand. She read the entirety of a statement from the NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, which was composed in the corporate ‚Äúwe‚Äù: ‚Äúwe‚Äù had reason to believe that the employee‚Äôs complaint wasn‚Äôt an isolated incident; ‚Äúwe were deeply saddened by this turn of events‚Äù; ‚Äúwe will face it together as a news organization‚Äîand do it in as transparent a manner as we can.‚Äù Then Guthrie and Kotb offered their personal expressions of shock and dismay. Lauer had been loved by so many; ‚Äúwe‚Äù loved him. ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôm sure you can imagine, we are devastated,‚Äù Guthrie said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to process it and make sense of it, and it‚Äôll take some time for that,‚Äù Kotb said. Expressions of disorientation not dissimilar from expressions of mourning continued for the rest of the show. As Rebecca Traister wrote earlier this month, a ‚Äúpowerful white man losing a job is a death.‚Äù  We have witnessed a theatre of accountability insidiously refine itself, quite quickly, in the past few months. Louis C.K.‚Äôs statement, for example, following the expos√© in the Times of his sexual harassment of female comics, was not as passionate as, but was more coherent than, Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs ramblings about Jay-Z and the gun lobby. The opportunistic finesse of Kevin Spacey‚Äôs coming-out certainly tripped some social alarms, but he nonetheless garnered some sympathy. Power brokers like the Pixar animation baron John Lasseter have even scooped long-labored-over articles by pre√´mpting them altogether. (Lasseter is taking a six-month leave of absence.) No display was savvier than NBC‚Äôs orchestration on Wednesday.  The ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show‚Äôs artful transposition of grief where there would naturally be scrutiny continued into the 10 A.M. slot, in which the veteran host Kathie Lee Gifford spoke of how much she, too, loved Lauer and how sad she was. It continued on this morning‚Äôs program, with Guthrie and Kotb again at the helm. Not since Bill Cosby‚Äîor Bill O‚ÄôReilly, depending on one‚Äôs television diet‚Äîhas the scourge of sexual assault so acutely infiltrated the righteous perimeter of the American home. (President Trump, also affiliated with NBC and accused of assaulting women, never quite depended on a family-man image.) The influence of a behind-the-scenes figure like Weinstein can feel diffuse, removed from our everyday cultural consumption; Lauer was, and is, synonymous with the family feel of ‚ÄúToday.‚Äù Part of this comes from the network‚Äôs bloated investment in Lauer‚Äîhe reportedly earns between twenty million and twenty-five million dollars a year. (In 2014, a source told Page Six that the company chartered helicopter rides for Lauer from his Hamptons compound to its Rockefeller Center studios at his request.) When, in 1996, Lauer wrested the anchor chair from Bryant Gumbel, gossip magazines swooned over his geometric jaw and feathery hair; twenty years later, he was transforming comfortably into a smug but wise paternal figure. His tenure at the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù show was the longest in its history. Now instances of Lauer‚Äôs public pettiness toward women seem like the exertions of a holistically awful campaign. In 2012, he admonished the actress Anne Hathaway for photographs that the paparazzi had taken of her exiting a car. ‚ÄúSeen a lot of you lately,‚Äù he said. And, famously, Lauer was an architect of ‚ÄúOperation Bambi,‚Äù a plan that succeeded in getting his former co-anchor Ann Curry fired from the show that same year. (‚Äú ‚ÄòChemistry,‚Äô in television history, generally means the man does not want to work with the woman,‚Äù Curry said, according to Brian Stelter‚Äôs insider anatomy, ‚ÄúTop of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.‚Äù) On her final show, Curry wept and Lauer pretended to soothe her. His interview of Hillary Clinton last year was intrusive and aggressive when compared with his handling of Trump. How a man thinks of women dictates how he works with them.  The stakes with Lauer, as with Charlie Rose, who was fired from both CBS and PBS last week, for sexual harassment, threaten the geniality and social integrity that are the trade of the morning-show apparatus. And so it is no surprise that, to convey something like moral mooring to a vastly female audience, the networks rely on women anchors to break the public fall. An ether of remorse already fogs the perception of Lauer‚Äôs ousting, though Lauer waited a day to issue a statement and in it said, ‚ÄúSome of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.‚Äù It seems likely that, at least when it comes to the fact of Lauer‚Äôs firing, Guthrie had truly been caught off guard. The company, however, wasn‚Äôt; reporters at Variety and the Times had spent months investigating claims against Lauer. Guthrie‚Äôs vulnerable pose conferred an unearned armament to a company that had employed a reckless man for two decades. The woman anchor‚Äôs surprise becomes the network‚Äôs surprise; her sorrow, its sorrow. ‚ÄúHow do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they behaved badly?‚Äù Guthrie asked, her eyes glassy. For her, and for Gayle King, who asked a similar question when reporting on her co-host Rose‚Äôs transgressions last week, on CBS, the question of loyalty may be relevant. (It was Lauer who lobbied for Guthrie‚Äôs co-anchorship, in 2012, following the success of ‚ÄúOperation Bambi.‚Äù) But neither love nor loyalty nor sadness excuses NBC, the company that passed on its own employee‚Äôs reportage of Weinstein‚Äôs abuse of women. The Variety report on Lauer, published on Wednesday afternoon, included accounts of harassment from three unnamed women. It showed an emboldened player whose harmful wiles were accommodated by the network around him. The news mediates the news.  One detail from Ramin Setoodeh and Elizabeth Wagmeister‚Äôs reporting in Variety mentions a contraption, apparently common in the offices of executives of his stature, that in this context sounds like something used by a villain from a Bond film. The installation of a button under Lauer‚Äôs desk made it possible for him to lock himself, and anyone else who might have been invited into his office, inside, without getting up from his seat. The Times reported that NBC on Wednesday had received at least two more complaints from employees about Lauer‚Äôs behavior. One woman told the Times that Lauer locked her in his office in 2001: ‚ÄúShe said the anchor then stepped out from behind his desk, pulled down her pants, bent her over a chair and had intercourse with her.‚Äù She passed out and was taken to a nurse by Lauer‚Äôs assistant. Reading the article, I wondered who had seen that commotion, and I thought about the lock, an instrument of security turned into an instrument of violence."
"Not so bromantic. Charlie Hunnam revealed in a new interview that he had a hard time bonding with his Lost City of Z costar Robert Pattinson.  Speaking with Screen Daily for a Q&A published on Saturday, March 25, the Sons of Anarchy star, 36, said that he got an icy reception from the 30-year-old Twilight alum.  ‚ÄúI had a couple of rehearsal sessions with Sienna [Miller], but I didn‚Äôt spend any time with Tom [Holland] or Robert,‚Äù he told the site at the Berlin Film Festival. ‚ÄúI wanted these relationships to evolve naturally on screen, through the work. I don‚Äôt think I said more than ten words to Robert off camera.‚Äù  According to Hunnam, he wasn‚Äôt certain if Pattinson was simply focused on his role ‚Äî he plays fictional British corporal Henry Costin in the film ‚Äî or if he just didn‚Äôt care to forge a friendship.  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know if he was just ‚Äòin that zone‚Äô or if he genuinely didn‚Äôt like me,‚Äù Hunnam continued. ‚ÄúThere was a real distance between us.‚Äù  Since the movie wrapped last year, the hunky blond told Screen Daily that Pattinson has made a few attempts to connect. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs reached out to me subsequently, making overtures for us to be friends now,‚Äù Hunnam added, ‚Äúso I think it was about the work.‚Äù  Hunnam was also intent on getting into character as he and the rest of the cast shot The Lost City of Z (based on the 2009 book, which tells the story of 1920s explorers who lose their way in the jungles of Brazil) on location in the Amazon.  ‚ÄúI wanted to be away from everybody, in a scaled back version of living as much as possible. They found this tiny hotel for me that was basically like little huts in the jungle where I could be by myself,‚Äù he recalled to Screen Daily. ‚ÄúI was so engaged in this process of no emails, no phone ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt speak to the rest of the outside world during the duration of the shooting. When we started shooting the explorations, the others wanted to stay in my hotel, but I couldn‚Äôt break the [silent] spell.

"Heath Ledger‚Äôs Joker in The Dark Knight famously insisted he didn‚Äôt have a reason or plan for the mayhem he wrought on Gotham City.  ‚ÄúYou know what I am? I‚Äôm a dog chasing cars. I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just ‚Ä¶ do things,‚Äù his gruesomely made-up Joker insisted.  Plan or no plan, the role of the Joker caught fire with the late actor‚Äôs Oscar-winning performance as the agent of chaos, encouraging other serious thespians to take on Batman‚Äôs archest villain ‚Äì all while finding audiences eager to go for the wild ride.  As director Christopher Nolan‚Äôs Dark Knight turns 10 this week, the anniversary arrives at a time of peak Joker.  For actors who aren‚Äôt comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open  Robert Moses Peaslee  Jared Leto played the bad guy as a supporting character in 2016‚Äôs Suicide Squad and will have his own Joker spin-off movie with Warner Bros. (as well as a film with lover Harley Quinn). On one end of the character spectrum, Zach Galifianakis voiced the Joker for laughs in 2017‚Äôs The Lego Batman Movie , while on the other, Warner Bros. also just greenlit another Joker origin film starring Joaquin Phoenix.  ‚ÄúHeath Ledger‚Äôs role has had a huge impact on the Joker,‚Äù says Erik Davis, managing editor of the movie site Fandango.com. ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight redefined a film genre and Ledger‚Äôs Joker redefined a character, pushing it to an interest level we‚Äôre still seeing.‚Äù  The villain, created in 1940, had been a stand-out of the DC Comics universe long before Ledger, who died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription medications, posthumously earned the best supporting actor Oscar.  The Joker was famously ‚Äì and campily ‚Äì portrayed on TV‚Äôs Batman by Cesar Romero (1966 to 1968). Jack Nicholson brought a darker, still campy Joker performance to Tim Burton‚Äôs 1989 Batman, but audiences never forgot that a global superstar was playing the part.  When Ledger‚Äôs casting was announced nearly two decades later, Nolan was initially criticised for choosing an actor known for his chiselled cheekbones over contenders such as Robin Williams and Paul Bettany.  ‚ÄúThere was backlash and controversy, like, ‚ÄòHow can he be the Joker?‚Äô ‚Äù says Access Hollywood film critic Scott Mantz. ‚ÄúBut Ledger‚Äôs Joker and The Dark Knight were monumentally different from anything we had seen before, or have seen since.‚Äù  Ledger fully submerged himself in the maniacal villain who, opposite Christian Bale‚Äôs brooding Batman, was electrifying and disturbing. His matinee idol looks were unrecognisable behind garish make-up and strung-out hair.  The transformation and the latitude he was given in the role was eye-opening for re-energised fans and Oscar-calibre actors like Leto and Phoenix, says Robert Moses Peaslee, co-editor of The Joker: A Serious Study of the Clown Prince of Crime.  ‚ÄúFor actors who aren‚Äôt comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open,‚Äù says Peaslee. ‚ÄúWith this twisted interpretation, there‚Äôs so much room to play around. Ledger took it into the realm of serious project for serious actors.‚Äù  Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in video games such as Batman: Arkham Origins, believes there‚Äôs room for more unique Joker performances but worries the influx could diminish the supervillain‚Äôs mystique.  ‚ÄúNo one would be afraid of the devil if you saw him every day,‚Äù says Baker. ‚ÄúHe needs to remain in the shadows and pop out every once in a while to show that‚Äôs where he lives.‚Äù"

"CLOSE Kyle Stephens was the first victim of nearly 100 to speak Tuesday at a sentencing hearing for Larry Nassar. Stephens, whose parents were friends with the now disgraced doctor, said he repeatedly sexually abused her when she was a child. (Jan. 16) AP  Former U.S. gymnast McKayla Maroney (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)  Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who pleaded guilty in November to criminal sexual conduct, is being sentenced this week on seven sexual assault charges. The sentencing began Tuesday and is expected to conclude on Friday in Lansing, Mich. Nassar faces up to a life sentence, with a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.  Close to 90 women are slated to read victim impact statements at his hearing this week. But former gymnast and Nassar victim McKayla Maroney ‚Äî who first shared her story of abuse over Twitter ‚Äî faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks out. Maroney signed a nondisclosure agreement in December 2016, agreeing to stay quiet about the abuse she experienced as part of a $1.25 million settlement with USA Gymnastics.  Chrissy Teigen, a swimsuit model and TV host, does not want Maroney to remain silent. Teigen tweeted on Tuesday that she would ""be absolutely honored to pay"" the $100,000 fine for Maroney. Teigen called Nassar a ""serial monster"" in her tweet, while questioning the ""entire principle"" of the fine.  Maroney is suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University, claiming the nondisclosure agreement she signed was illegal.  USA Gymnastics said last month that the settlement terms from the 2016 agreement were initially not drawn up by its lawyers but rather by Maroney's attorney.

In the lawsuit filed to Los Angeles Superior Court, Maroney alleges she was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement as part of the financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment.  ""USA Gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from McKayla Maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar, nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to Larry Nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing,"" USA Gymnastics said in a statement.

"Can you believe your favorite diva Gwen Stefani is 48 years old? Time really flies. Since she rose up to the limelight, she has been quite busy making her fans happy. Her journey to fame was a long and turbulent one, and so was her love life. After one unsuccessful marriage, the artist has been dating country music artist Blake Shelton since 2015. The happy couple met on The Voice US. Although they got engaged, there have been rumors that Gwen called off the wedding because of ‚Äòcheating rumors‚Äô. But, is this even true? You are about to find out in detail.  Gwen Stafani is an iconic figure in the world of music and show business, but how did she become so famous and adored? It was actually a long journey for her.  Gwen Ren√©e Stefani was born on October 3, 1969, and she is not only a singer. Stefani is also a fashion designer, actress, and television personality!  Remember her band No Doubt? That was her first start. Gwen was the co-creator and the lead singer of the band.  The band rose to fame in the mid-90s when they released their hit album Tragic Kingdom in 1995. Their hits included Just a Girl, Don‚Äôt Speak, Hey Baby and It‚Äôs My Life!  She soon found love in 1995, when she met Gavin on tour.  They got married in 2002.  Sadly, they divorced in 2016.  The couple has three children, but after 14 years of marriage, they divorced because of ‚Äúirreconcilable differences‚Äù.  Rumor had it what Gavin cheated on her with their nanny, Australian lady Mindy Mann.  In March of 2016, Gavin opened up about the breakdown in his relationship. He added that their divorce caused him ‚Äúa lot of pain and sadness‚Äù.  Gavin said in an interview:  ‚ÄúIt really teaches you perspective on life. It‚Äôs really health, happiness, and safety. After that, I don‚Äôt know what there is other than that.‚Äù  After the divorce, Gwen found love once again.  She has been dating artist Blake Shelton since 2015.  They have been together for almost three years now. There was also a pregnancy rumor in 2017.  According to Auntyacid, a source said:  ‚ÄúThey will get married one day but right now they are hyper-focused on getting pregnant. They believe there is still a chance for Gwen [to fall pregnant]. They are incredibly hopeful. Gwen and Blake started talking quickly about having a baby, but starting a family has not been easy for them. It‚Äôs something that they really want and it‚Äôs just not working out the way they wanted it to.‚Äù  The source goes on:  ‚ÄúBlake told Gwen he does want kids of his own and Gwen was willing to try. With her, Blake has the exact relationship and family life he‚Äôd hoped to have with Miranda. Gwen‚Äôs everything he wants. They are so committed to one another.‚Äù  The pair then got engaged.  But after months of planning and thinking about having the wedding in June, Gwen allegedly called the wedding off.  The rumors said that the mother-of-three called it off after worrying that Shelton had been unfaithful.  According to a source, this confrontation caused a huge fight, and Gwen said there won‚Äôt be a wedding.  The singer allegedly started feeling insecure and was bothered by the closeness of Blake and last year‚Äôs The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski.  Chloe was on Blake‚Äôs team, and Gwen saw more than a student-teacher relationship in them.  A source went on to explain:  ‚ÄúShe started panicking about all the details ‚Äî and about her future with Blake. Gwen and Blake had a massive fight and Gwen called off the wedding.‚Äù  ‚ÄúGwen feels as if she loves Blake more than Blake loves her right now. She told Blake all about her insecurities and how she couldn‚Äôt handle another heartbreaking divorce because of trust issues she needs to face.‚Äù  Sources also claim that now they are trying to work things out.  ‚ÄúMost friends believe they will still walk down the aisle someday, but Gwen and Blake have some things to work on first. Trust is important and this isn‚Äôt the right time for a dream wedding. The last thing Gwen or Blake wants is another divorce.‚Äù  However, according to the rumor-busting website, Gossip Cop, these rumors are false!  The website claims that Stefani and Shelton are not at war over Kohanski and that Stef‚Äôs rep told them the wedding is not off.  According to the rep, the couple‚Äôs relationship is not ‚Äúon the rocks.‚Äù  The site also adds that Chloe has a boyfriend.  The outlet also claims that Gwen isn‚Äôt insecure at all.  Fans simply don‚Äôt know who to believe right now, but one thing is for sure. Gwen and Blake are still together, and the pair went on a family holiday just before the new year.  They spent some quality time together with Gwen‚Äôs kids.  Blake even taught them how to drive in a field full of mud! Moreover, they have also been spotted on a holiday in Mexico.  Gwen uploaded a photo to Instagram on the 18th of January and it all looks pretty well between these two.  Blake is also set to perform at Luke Bryan‚Äôs Crash My Playa concert series.  The event takes place at the Riviera Maya in Mexico.  It seems like these two are having the time of their lives.  Here is Gwen with her kids having a great time."

"ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Leonardo DiCaprio joins the growing list of celebrities getting involved in helping Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation has donated $1 million to the newly established United Way Harvey Recovery Fund which will go toward short and long term relief and recovery efforts.  United Way Worldwide said Wednesday that the national fund will distribute 100 percent of donations to recovery efforts for those affected by Hurricane Harvey.  Thousands forced out of their homes due to flooding  ""We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation,"" said United Way Worldwide President and CEO Brian Gallagher in a statement. ""Responding to Hurricane Harvey requires the best of all of us - and that's what this gift represents.""  United Way is the world's largest privately-funded non-profit and anticipates Harvey recovery efforts will take several years.  The $1 million from DiCaprio's foundation represents the inaugural donation to the fund. It is the latest disaster relief support from the Oscar-winner's namesake foundation. DiCaprio and his foundation have previously donated to recovery efforts following the 2004 tsunami, the Haiti earthquake and Hurricane Sandy.  ""We hope others will step up and support the United Way and other organizations,"" foundation CEO Terry Tamminen said in the press release.  Many celebrities have pulled out their pocketbooks to help Harvey victims in recent days including Sandra Bullock, who on Tuesday donated $1 million to the American Red Cross.  Beyonce also pledged to do her part on Tuesday to help her hometown of Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, and other stars, including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and DJ Khaled, are also helping out by donating to the cause after Kevin Hart ""challenged"" them to do so. Johnson, Khaled and Hart each donated $25,000 to Harvey relief. Here's how you can help."

"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Neil Diamond's concert career spanned half a century  Singer Neil Diamond has announced he will retire from touring, after a recent diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.  Diamond, who turns 77 on Wednesday, cancelled his March tour dates for Australia and New Zealand on medical advice.  The Solitary Man singer was midway through his 50th anniversary tour.  In a statement he said he took the decision ""with great reluctance and disappointment"".  ""I have been so honoured to bring my shows to the public for the past 50 years,"" he said.  ""My sincerest apologies to everyone who purchased tickets and were planning to come to the upcoming shows.""  Parkinson's is a progressive condition in which the brain becomes damaged. It can lead to tremors, difficulty moving, speech changes and eventually memory problems.  Diamond hopes to continue writing and recording for some time to come, a post on his website reads.  Image caption As well as his own hits, Diamond wrote the famous Monkees track I'm a Believer  ""My thanks goes out to my loyal and devoted audiences around the world,"" he said. ""You will always have my appreciation for your support and encouragement.""  With a nod to his hit Sweet Caroline, he added: ""This ride has been 'so good, so good, so good' thanks to you.""  Diamond, who has sold over 130 million albums worldwide, is set to receive a lifetime achievement award at Sunday's Grammy Awards.  The singer last performed in the UK and Ireland in October as part of the 50th anniversary world tour, but the the onset of Parkinson's disease ""has made it difficult to travel and perform on a large scale basis,"" his official website said.  Friends and fans sent their best wishes to the singer on social media as news of his retirement spread.  ""Keep fighting, old buddy. You've got a long way to go yet,"" tweeted singer Nancy Sinatra.  ""Endless admiration and love to you,"" wrote musician Josh Groban.  Rolling Stone contributing editor David Wild said Diamond was behind ""the kindest thing any star ever did for me""."

"‚ÄúGirl with the Dragon Tattoo‚Äù star Rooney Mara revealed something shocking during an interview with the Los Angeles Times Thursday about her new movie, ‚ÄúA Ghost Story.‚Äù At least, internet users thought her admission was shocking. So what could it be? Oh, only that she didn‚Äôt try pie until she was 31 years old. More, she doesn‚Äôt want to try it ever again.  Her character, M, plays a grieving wife. The ghost of her husband tries to reconnect with her. In the midst of her grief, M devours an entire pie. It‚Äôs something Rooney never did before and something she never wants to do again.  READ: Why Rooney Mara Will No Longer Play Lisbeth Salander In ‚ÄòThe Girl With The Dragon Tattoo‚Äô Sequel  ‚ÄúIt was certainly something that popped out at me when I read it, that was one of the things I was really excited to do. So, it doesn't surprise me that it's something that jumps out of the movie,‚Äù she told The Los Angeles Times Thursday. ‚ÄúIt was such a unique way of showing grief; we've never seen anything like that before. And I'd actually never had pie before. That was my first and last pie.‚Äù  Sounds bizarre that Mara never tried the dessert in her life, but she explained it‚Äôs because she isn‚Äôt fond of sweets and was never tantalized by pie.  Photo: Ideaman Studios, Sailor Bear, Zero Trans Fat Productions  ‚ÄúI just don't really have a sweet tooth and I was a really, really strange, geeky child. Something about pie always grossed me out and I just never tried it before,‚Äù said Mara. ‚ÄúAnd this came along and I tried making them switch it to something else, but [director David Lowery] really wanted it to be pie, so we did pie.‚Äù  Lowery was also shocked that Mara had never tried the baked good. At first they weren‚Äôt sure what the character was going to inhale, but they decided on pie.  When she finishes wolfing down the dessert, Mara‚Äôs character vomits at the end of the scene.  READ: ‚ÄòCarol‚Äô Beautifully Captures An Elegant Romance Thanks To Cate Blanchett And Rooney Mara [REVIEW]  ‚ÄúIn the script, the description was, ‚ÄòShe sits down and eats the entire thing.‚Äô It was just one line,‚Äù Lowery told USA Today Tuesday. ‚ÄúI told her, ‚ÄòTry to eat the whole thing and when you can't eat any more, get up and run to the bathroom. You don't actually need to throw up. But if you need to, go for it.‚Äô It was up to her to bring the scene to an end at the time she thought was appropriate, and she knew what the emotional intent behind the scene was, so there wasn't a lot of talking about it.‚Äù  The film is in theaters nationwide now, but fans seemed more preoccupied with Mara‚Äôs reveal.

"Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle seem to be two of the biggest fashion icons of the moment. Though they have both worn some memorable ensembles, it looks like Markle may have had a bigger year than her royal sister-in-law when it comes to influencing the latest trends.  Both duchesses made it onto global fashion search platform Lyst's new ranking of the most powerful celebrity fashion influencers of the year, with Markle landing in a higher spot on the list than Middleton.  The list was generated by tracking more than 100 million searches and using sales data, page views, and social media mentions to determine each celebrity's influence. Kylie Jenner nabbed the top spot on the list, followed by her sister Kim Kardashian West.  Markle was found to be the third most popular celebrity fashion influencer of 2018  Boat neck dresses have become one of Markle's signature styles.

Markle caused a spike in searches for tuxedo dresses. WPA Pool/Getty Images  Middleton may have landed lower on the list than her new sister-in-law, but her influence is still going strong  The data showed that the bright pink Mulberry coat she wore in January inspired over 10,000 searches that month.

It's also worth noting that Middleton was out on royal maternity leave for much of the year after giving birth to Prince Louis in April, so she debuted fewer new looks than Markle.  Either way, both duchesses seem to be providing fashion inspiration in their own way.  Visit INSIDER's homepage for more."

"Seacrest ‚Ä¶ in!  After months of talks and speculation, Ryan Seacrest will officially return to host the ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù revival on ABC. The network made the announcement after Seacrest broke the news on Thursday morning‚Äôs ‚ÄúLive With Kelly and Ryan.‚Äù  Seacrest will earn about $12 million for his role on the show this season, but will not receive credit as an executive producer. He will, however, have creative consultation and approval on judges and other production issues, Variety has confirmed. Sources say the negotiations were protracted due to questions about his complicated schedule and other commitments.  Seacrest served as host for the franchise during its 15-season run on Fox, which aired its ‚Äúfarewell season‚Äù last year. The multihyphenate will continue to co-host and executive produce ‚ÄúLive With Kelly and Ryan‚Äù from New York in addition to hosting and executive producing his iHeartRadio-syndicated morning radio show ‚ÄúOn Air With Ryan Seacrest‚Äù from Los Angeles.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs genuinely hard to put into words what ‚ÄòAmerican Idol‚Äô means to me,‚Äù Seacrest said in a statement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it‚Äôs allowed me to experience. It‚Äôs been an incredible journey from day one. To be asked to return this year, at my new home at Disney|ABC, is an honor, if not a bit surreal. I believe ABC is the perfect home for ‚ÄòIdol,‚Äô and I‚Äôve every confidence the show‚Äôs legions of fans will love it ‚Äî especially ‚ÄúIdol‚Äôs‚Äù best traditions of showcasing heartwarming stories, remarkable talent discovery, and, best of all, making dreams come true.‚Äù  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said she attributes much of ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äôs‚Äù success to Seacrest.

His talent is limitless, and I can‚Äôt think of a more appropriate person to honor the ‚ÄòIdol‚Äô legacy as it takes on new life than the man who has been there through it all.‚Äù  Variety reported in May that ABC, which beat out other networks to bring the singing competition back to the air, committed to broadcasting about 40 hours of the program ‚Äî making it likely that the show will air over two nights most weeks, like it did on Fox.

History [ edit ]  Former logo of the show, from before 2010  After the success of two one-hour specials chronicling Kate Gosselin and her then-husband Jon, Surviving Sextuplets and Twins and One Year Later, the series aired on the Discovery Health Channel for the first two seasons before being moved to The Learning Channel (TLC). During its run, the series was one of the network's highest-rated programs,[2] with the fifth-season premiere seen by a record 9.8 million viewers, the most watched show of that evening including broadcast television, twice as many viewers as the show‚Äôs previous series high.[3]  After the Gosselins' divorce in 2009, the final episode of Jon & Kate Plus 8 aired on November 23, 2009, announced by TLC three days earlier.[4][5]  The series was later renamed Kate Plus 8 on June 6, 2010,[6] focusing on Kate as a divorced mother raising the children, with Jon appearing less frequently.[7] However, filming was later suspended due to Jon's lawyers delivering letters to TLC demanding that they cease and desist production and barred production crews from the couple's Pennsylvania property on October 1, 2009.[8][9][10] This led to putting the show's revamping on hold. TLC planned for ""a series of specials"" if the series did not go into production.[11]  The second season of Kate Plus 8 premiered on April 4, 2011, though on August 15, TLC announced that the series would be cancelled after it reached 150 episodes. The last episode aired on September 12, 2011.[12]  On March 19, 2014, it was announced that Kate and her eight would return in a reunion special, scheduled to air in June.[13]  In August 2014, it was announced that Kate Plus 8 would return for another season (its third, and first after an almost three-year hiatus) on January 13, 2015 on TLC.[14]  Season 4 of Kate Plus 8 started on December 8, 2015.[15]  Season 5 of Kate Plus 8 started on November 22, 2016.[16]  Season 6, with three episodes, started July 10, 2017.[17]  Family [ edit ]  Parents  Children  # Name Date of birth 1 Cara Nicole ( 2000-10-08 ) October 8, 2000 (age 18) 2 Madelyn ""Mady"" Kate 3 Alexis Faith ( 2004-05-10 ) May 10, 2004 (age 14) 4 Hannah Joy 5 Aaden Jonathan 6 Collin Thomas 7 Leah Hope 8 Joel Kevin  Production [ edit ]  Between the specials and the series, permanent light fixtures were installed in the Gosselins' second home to make filming easier and prevent the kids from tripping over the wires and cables from temporary lighting. Jon & Kate Plus 8 filmed three days per week, with one day used for interview sessions where Jon, Kate and occasionally the children, discussed events occurring in each episode. In the family's first house, the ""interview corner"" was located in the basement, and was transformed from the playroom when needed. It was painted green, unlike the rest of the playroom. In their new house, the interview set was reproduced in an unfinished area of the basement. At season four's finale, Jon and Kate said they would make a new set for season five.  Criticisms were raised regarding Kate's intentions of continuing with the show, as well as whether or not the children were being exploited or were under emotional distress.[18] According to lawyer Gloria Allred, ""Every state does regulate to protect the health, the safety and welfare of little child performers [...] And these little ones are only eight years old and five years old, they can‚Äôt protect themselves, so the state has to be sure that they are safe in their workplace.""[18] In the case of the show, the children's workplace is their home. At this point there are no clear laws in Pennsylvania (where the Gosselins reside) regarding a child's appearance on a reality show.[19] However, Pennsylvania law permits children who are at least seven years old to work in the entertainment industry, as long as certain guidelines are followed and a permit is obtained. For example, children may not work after 11:30 p.m. under most circumstances, or perform in any location that serves alcohol.[19]  Kate and Jon Gosselin in 2008  Kate says that the children were happy and healthy and were never in any danger from doing the show. Jon stated they were ""in talks"" regarding ensuring the children's happiness,[18] and that there is no truth to any reports that the children have been hurt by the series.[20] TLC released a statement saying that the network ""fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations"" to produce the show. The statement also said that ""for an extended period of time, we have been engaged in cooperative discussions and supplied all requested information to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry"".[19]  An investigation by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Labor Law Compliance found that ""The activity being filmed was spontaneous. However, children introduced episodes of the television show and transitions. DVDs and other merchandise were sold involving the children's appearance. Lighting was placed in the home for the show and there was product placement in some episodes.""[21] Because of these reasons, the children were considered to be working on the show, and the show was required to obtain work permits for the children, which it did not do.[21] An agreement was reached that no charges would be filed immediately as long as no further violations would occur.[21]  Multimedia [ edit ]  Books [ edit ]  The Gosselins were managed by Media Motion International in Los Angeles.[22]  Kate Gosselin has written four books: Multiple Blessings (co-authored with Beth Carson and Jon), which was released November 1, 2008, Eight Little Faces in April 2009, I Just Want You to Know on April 13, 2010 and Love is in the Mix a cookbook, on September 13, 2013.

"A big mazel goes out to Lilly Ghalichi, who revealed exclusively to The Daily Dish that she's found love again and is engaged. The Shahs of Sunset alum's boyfriend, Dara, popped the question in late August, and now she's spilling all the details about their whirlwind romance.  The two started dating back in March after Lilly had to get approval from the board at her apartment building to get another parking spot for her Ferrari. Dara just so happened to be on the board. After some time passed and several email exchanges took place, they met in the lobby of their building for the first time ever despite living a floor apart. ""I did know what he looked like only because after he asked me out. I had a girlfriend that knew him and I texted her,"" the eyelash expert recalled. ""And she sent me a photo of him and her husband and I was like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm definitely going.'""  In fact, that first meeting has even been captured on security footage. ""We'll forever have literally the exact moment we met in life,"" she said.  Lilly felt something for Dara, who runs a company that makes office chairs with his parents, right from the start. ""I would say the first date I felt like I dreamed him into life,"" she said. ""I would say within two or three months of dating we were inseparable. It all moved very quickly.""  Photo courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi  Photo courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi  That brings us to the epic late-summer proposal. The engagement came as a surprise to Lilly. It all took place on the grounds of their future home in Bel-Air at a very special spot on the property. The couple will build a home from scratch on the land, but they are keeping an already-existing gazebo, which is where he asked her to marry him. ""There was chandeliers, candles, flowers, so the reason he proposed there was [because] the only part of the existing structure that will remain is that gazebo at the top of the hill,"" she said. ""The next day, unfortunately, his 36th birthday party was completely overshadowed and turned into a huge engagement party.""  And, yes, Lilly loves her ring. ""It's f***ing awesome. It's an oval cut gorgeous diamond,"" she said. ""I literally could not have asked for anything more. It's very antique and dainty set with pave diamonds for the band and has pave diamonds covering the basket and everything ‚Äî so all you see are diamonds. I don't know exactly how big it is, but it's big enough.""  Photo courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi  It's even more special since her future mother-in-law helped him pick it out. ""His mom is the most fashionable f***ing awesome woman I have ever met,"" she said. ""She is everything I aspire to be in life. She has the best fashion taste. She's a glam girl.""  Photo courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi  With the engagement behind them, the couple are now planning their wedding, slated for May 2017. After initially thinking they wanted to marry in Europe, they later settled on L.A. at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ""It's very special to be able to do it at home and have everyone you love attend,"" she said.  Photo courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi  While she doesn't keep in touch with all the Shahs, she has heard from some of the crew following her happy news. ""I ran into Reza. I talk to GG and they're both just over the moon ecstatic, congratulating me,"" she said.  Photo courtesy of Lilly Ghalichi  So, what made Lilly know that Dara was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with? Well, he's not into social media. ""He is a very private person. It's so refreshing to be with somebody that doesn't care about social media, that doesn't care about celebrities [and] is just a complete opposite from a world that I came from,"" she said. ""In that world, there's so many fake people. There's so many users. You never really know people's intentions and with him you don't even have a shred of doubt because he doesn't have these things. He doesn't care about these things.""  She also applauds ""his success and work ethic,"" adding, ""I not only found my equal. He far surpasses anything I could ever be.""

"Yes, the headline sounds extremely insane, but then again this is Teresa Giudice we‚Äôre talking about here!  According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice‚Äôs deportation proceedings.  If you recall, it was reported weeks ago that a judge had ruled that Joe should be deported upon his release from prison, where he is currently serving a 41-month-prison sentence for bank and wire fraud. Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  ‚ÄúTeresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe‚Äôs deportation and she agreed to do it,‚Äù an insider revealed. ‚ÄúHalf a million dollars to share the story on camera.‚Äù  And this story is believable because this isn‚Äôt Teresa‚Äôs first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  ‚ÄúIt is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,‚Äù added the source.  IS TERESA BEGGING PRESIDENT TRUMP TO STOP JOE‚ÄôS DEPORTATION?  Earlier this year, an Immigration official confirmed that ‚Äúrecords show that an immigration judge ordered Mr. Giudice be removed from the United States on March 14, 2018.‚Äù  A source close to Teresa adds that she needs the Bravo money as Joe tries to appeal the deportation order.  ‚ÄúTeresa will do anything for the money. She never stops thinking about taking care of her girls and she agreed to this so that they would have money for college. She is a good mom and wants to provide for her children,‚Äù the source stated.  Joe will reportedly be turned over to ICE custody upon his March 2019 release, although it is likely he could be released earlier than March which would mean an earlier deportation back to Italy.  UPDATE ‚Äì Teresa is denying this report. Her attorney, James Leonard, tells the Gossip Cop website that she has no current plans to do a spinoff show about Joe‚Äôs possible deportation.

"Is there a chance that Queen Elizabeth understands the verb troll in its 21st-century iteration? Is there such a thing as the Royal Urban Dictionary?  QEII might not be able to define troll, but it seems the 92-year-old monarch may be well-versed in executing it. And her victim might have been one Donald J. Trump.  The president, of course, paid Queen Elizabeth a visit last week at Windsor Castle during his controversial visit to London, where hundreds of thousands of Brits took to the streets to protest his presence.  Trump, who was accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, didn‚Äôt exactly endear himself to the queen when he broke protocol and walked ahead of her. Video of the breach of etiquette went viral.

"Home video released by a childhood friend shows an 8-year-old Meghan Markle playing a queen in a backyard production of ‚ÄúYour Royal Highness‚Äù at a birthday party in 1990. The actress will be an official member of a real royal family when she weds Britain‚Äôs Prince Harry on May 19th. (Published Monday, March 26, 2018)  Twenty-eight years ago, Meghan Markle was queen for a day.  And in less than two months, she will marry Prince Harry and receive a royal title of her own. Long before she took one of the world's most eligible bachelors off the market, an 8-year-old Markle crowned herself and reigned over BFF Ninaki Priddy's birthday party. Priddy's private home video shows the future (and now retired) actress starring in an unscripted backyard production of ""Your Royal Highness,"" featuring Markle as the Queen and her pals as princesses.  ""We did a lot of playing 'make-pretend' as kids,"" Priddy told NBC. ""It was a lot of fun. Meg loved to be in that world of make believe. And she would always be the lead. Being an only child, there was definitely always this thirst of attention.  When the video was filmed in 1990, no one knew Markle would one day marry a member of the royal family. And yet, in hindsight, it gives a glimpse of the woman she was destined to be.  ""Your highness, isn't there anything to do around the kingdom anymore?"" one girl asks.  ""Yes!"" Markle replies. ""Make 900,000 cookies and sew me a nice dress.""  ""Your highness, what is this all for?"" another girl asks.  Markle replies, ""It's for this meeting I'm having. I'm having people from Florida and Canada, Mississippi, Missouri."" A benevolent ruler, Markle gives ""Princess Nikki"" and ""Princess Kara"" a 10-minute break and tells them to go inside.  A Look Back at Meghan Markle's Pre-Royal Life  In the living room, Markle says, ""Princess Kara, I thought I said no eating cookies in bed.""  ""It's not a cookie, mother,"" her friend replies. ""It's a Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookie.""  ""Oh! Carry on then,"" Markle says, feigning a British accent. ""Carry on.""  Later on, Markle changes out of her red and white striped T-shirt and into a black and pink cocktail dress with polka dots and ruffles. At one point, the cameraman asks, ""Meghan, are you bored?"" She confesses that ""yes,"" she is a bit wearied. Before long, a clown arrives to entertain her--and he happily makes her a pink balloon animal.  At one point in the home movie, Markle wears a gold crown. Whether she'll get to wear one of Queen Elizabeth II's tiaras for her May 19 nuptials remains to be seen. Kate Middleton borrowed a Cartier halo tiara, which King George VI first purchased in 1936, when she married Prince William.  ¬© Copyright E! Online"
"Rihanna got herself a hunky boyfriend but her ex-lover, Drake, doesn't think she deserves the dude. After the Barbadian singer heated up the internet with her photos with Hassan Jameel, the Canadian rapper reportedly reacted and said that he is wondering why his former girlfriend fell for the Arabian business tycoon.  Drake is reportedly starting to regret letting go of RiRi  A source told Hollywood Life that the ""Thank Me Later"" artist was ""kinda jealous"" when he found out that his ex-girlfriend is already seeing a new guy. ‚ÄúDrake is kinda jealous of Rihanna‚Äôs new billionaire boyfriend. He has no idea why she likes this guy,‚Äù it said.  It added that despite their on-off relationship, the 30-year-old rapper is still affected whenever the ""What's My Name"" singer is caught up in dating rumors. ‚ÄúDrake thinks Rihanna is one of the baddest chicks‚Äôs ever and he doesn‚Äôt think this new guy deserves her at all,‚Äù the insider added.  Aside from him, rumor has it that Naomi Campbell, who previously dated Hassan, was ""furious"" when she saw her ex-boyfriend getting cozy with her former bestie. The English model reportedly said that she is still ""hotter and more successful"" than RiRi and guaranteed that her relationship with him won't last long.  This rumor has caused the fans to speculate about Campbell and Rihanna's stained friendship which was first noticed by an eagle-eyed fan who figured out that the two have stopped following each other on social media earlier this year.  Top Videos of the Day  When asked if she has a beef with her best friend, the 47-year-old model suggested that she is just pretending that everything is fine between them.  Rihanna and Hassan's Ibiza getaway  RiRi and Hassan, both 29, were first seen in public during their romantic vacation in Spain on Wednesday. Several photos of them getting all steamy in the swimming pool immediately went viral and had caused the public to start digging about the new guy. It was later revealed that he is the expected heir of a $1.5 billion business called Abdul Latif Jameel which has acquired the distribution rights to Toyota in Saudi Arabia.  Their family business has placed them in 12th spot on the list of richest Arabs in the world by Forbes. Hassan currently works as the Deputy President and Vice Chairman of the said company. Aside from that, his family also owns Saudi Professional League or Jameel League which was founded in 1976.  After spending some down time at their luxury villa, Rihanna and her billionaire beau stepped out in public on the same day, where the singer was seen holding a bouquet of flowers while her the tycoon was all smiles walking behind his girl."

"ABC‚Äôs fairytale drama series Once Upon A Time will end with the current Season 7, Deadline has confirmed.  The show, created and executive produced by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, returns for the second half of its final season on March 2, and the finale will air in May, after more than 150 episodes.  Once Upon a Time went through a creative and casting revamp at the end of Season 6 when a number of original cast members left, and also relocated from its longtime Sunday home to the lower-trafficked Friday night this season. During the TCA winter press tour in January, ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey said she was ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù about an eighth season, pending a meeting with Kitsis and Horowitz, but that was not to be.  ‚ÄúWhen we first heard Adam and Eddy‚Äôs pitch for Once Upon a Time, we knew it was something incredibly special,‚Äù Dungey said in a statement today. ‚ÄúFor seven years, they have captivated us with their creativity and passion while reimagining some of our most beloved Disney fairytales, creating an undeniable global hit. Saying goodbye will be bittersweet, but Once Upon a Time‚Äô will forever be part of the ABC legacy and we can‚Äôt wait for fans to join us in this epic final chapter.‚Äù  Once Upon a Time was a breakout hit when it premiered in fall 2011, starring Ginnifer Goodwin, Jennifer Morrison, Lana Parrilla, Josh Dallas, Robert Carlyle and Jared Gilmore, and featuring classic Disney fairytale characters. In addition to strong ratings early in its run, Once fit nicely in the Disney brand with corporate synergies and has been a solid international seller for producer ABC Studios because of the global recognition of its characters.  ‚Äú‚ÄôOnce Upon a Time has been an amazing journey for all of us at ABC Studios and for fans around the world,‚Äù said Patrick Moran, president of ABC Studios. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so proud and appreciative of the hard work and creative talent that Eddy Kitsis, Adam Horowitz and their cast and crew brought to this show for seven magical seasons.‚Äù  Once Upon a Time‚Äôs ratings had been declining for the past few seasons and further dropped when the show moved from Sunday to Friday this past fall. The series, whose Season 7 reboot was met by mixed reaction by fans, currently stars Lana Parrilla, Robert Carlyle, Colin O‚ÄôDonoghue, Andrew J. West, Gabrielle Anwar, Dania Ramirez, Alison Fernandez and Mekia Cox. Steve Pearlman and David H. Goodman also are executive producing.  ‚ÄúSeven years ago, we set out to create a show about hope, where even in the darkest of times, a happy ending would always be possible,‚Äù said Once creators/executive producers Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. ‚Äù But we never imagined the happy ending that was actually in store for all of us ‚Äî years and years of adventure, romance, magic and hope. We‚Äôre so grateful to our brilliant collaborators ‚Äì the cast, crew, and writers ‚Äî as well as our partners at the studio and network for making this journey possible. But most of all, we want to thank the fans. Their fierce loyalty and devotion was the real magic behind Once Upon A Time. We hope they join us for these last few hours as we journey to the Enchanted Forrest for one more adventure.‚Äù"

"The pop star is set to marry the model ‚Äì here‚Äôs what we know so far about their upcoming nuptials.  When rumours began at the start of July that Justin Bieber was engaged to Hailey Baldwin, we weren‚Äôt sure what to think. The couple seemed to have only been dating for a matter of weeks and there weren‚Äôt any signs pointing to an engagement that we could have foreseen. However, Bieber confirmed the engagement just days later on Instagram, calling Baldwin ‚Äúthe love of my life‚Äù. So with a Bieber and Baldwin wedding definitely on the cards, we‚Äôve put together everything we know about their upcoming nuptials.  When and where did the proposal take place?  The singer asked the model to marry him while on holidays in the Bahamas. Bieber, 24, got down on one knee and popped the question to Baldwin, 21, in front of a restaurant full of guests at their oceanside resort, who were instructed by his security guards to put their phones away as ‚Äúsomething special was about to happen.‚Äù Bieber then confirmed the news just days later on Instagram on July 10, saying: ‚ÄúWas gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast. Listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you! So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindly.‚Äù  What kind of engagement ring did Bieber propose with?  Bieber chose a large oval cut diamond ring set in 18 karat yellow gold by Jack Solow of Solow & Co. Inc. Diamond Jewelers. The jeweller has since spoken out about making the ring, confirming Bieber selected the ring himself. ‚ÄúHe had certain design elements that he wanted and he had certain expectations and I think we delivered.‚Äù The jeweller confirmed Bieber began with the diamond and worked around it, with the designer even confirming he personally delivered the ring to the singer the morning the couple left for the Bahamas. Bieber also reportedly asked Hailey Baldwin‚Äôs father, Stephen, for permission before proposing.  When is the wedding?  While we‚Äôre yet to get a set date, Bieber recently alluded the wedding would take place very soon, telling paparazzi it was the next thing on the couple's to-do list. After they were spotted meeting with a pastor, Bieber was asked what was next to which he replied ""What's next? Gettin' married!"" TMZ reports the singer won't be working on any more albums or songs, instead focusing his energy on planning the wedding which a source confirms will be taking place next year.  Where is the wedding?  A source told Us Weekly the couple is planning a ‚Äúvery small‚Äù wedding, ‚Äúsomething private, intimate,‚Äù with the location being somewhere in Canada. ‚ÄúJustin loves Canada and is at home there. It‚Äôs a special place for him and he‚Äôd love to get married there,‚Äù the source said.  Who is in the wedding party?  Hailey‚Äôs aunt, Kim Basinger, revealed to Us Weekly that Baldwin has already selected her bridal party and confirmed her own daughter, Ireland Baldwin, Hailey‚Äôs cousin, will be a bridesmaid, as will the bride‚Äôs sister Alaia. ‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôll be fun. Alaia and Ireland, they‚Äôre in the wedding. So believe me, I just ‚Äî it‚Äôs cool! I think it‚Äôs sweet. It‚Äôs a very sweet thing.‚Äù  Who is attending the wedding?  No word on this yet but we can imagine the guest list will read like a Met Gala red carpet. Between Bieber and Baldwin, we can expect Kardashians, Jenners, Hadids and anyone in the same orbit as Scooter Braun, Bieber‚Äôs manager‚Äìthink Ariana Grande, for example.  Who is performing at the wedding?  Post Malone told TMZ that he hopes to play a role in the wedding‚Äìwhether it be performing or playing a role in the bridal party. ‚ÄúI would love to perform. For free. I'll be the flower boy or is that the ring bearer? He's very happy and I love to see my boy happy.‚Äù"
"Macaulay Culkin: ‚ÄòSatanic‚Äô Hollywood Execs Ritually Murder Child Actors  Hollywood executives are ‚Äúblood-thirsty Satanists‚Äù who ‚Äúritually abuse children in the industry‚Äù, according to Macaulay Culkin, who claims he only got out alive because he was a ‚Äúsmart, suspicious kid‚Äù and he ‚Äúgot too famous to be killed like some of the other kids‚Äù.  ‚ÄúYou learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes‚Äù, Macaulay Culkin said, explaining that ‚Äúthe worst of them wear shoes made out of the skin of children that they ritually murdered.‚Äù  Speaking on radio in Paris, France, Culkin said ‚ÄúHave you seen leather products made from human skin? It has a very unusual, distinctive look. I learned at a very young age to identify it.‚Äù  The news was picked up by French media, with mainstream French newspapers reporting on the explosive interview. However, within an hour of publication all reports had been removed from the internet.  French newspaper Les Echos‚Äô headline translated into English: ‚ÄúMacaulay Culkin speaks about Hollywood ritual child abuse live on radio‚Äù. Les Echos have not responded to questions regarding why they deleted the article within an hour of publication, and if they were pressured to do so.  Les Echo‚Äôs report translated into English: ‚ÄúMacaulay Culkin claims Hollywood studio executives rape and murder child stars and use their skin to make boots, belts and wallets that they use as ‚Äòskin trophies‚Äô.‚Äù  Skin Trophies  During the interview, Culkin claimed that children in the entertainment industry ‚Äúlearn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes,‚Äù explaining that some of the Hollywood executives wear ‚Äúskin trophies‚Äù. Explaining that he was 11 the first time he saw human leather, Culkin said he was ‚Äúfilming Home Alone 2 in New York‚Äù when he was ‚Äúushered into a back room on the set. There was a guy in there, a powerful executive suit type, you know what I mean?‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe tried to make me relax. Gave me a can of Coke. Started telling me about the nature of the industry. Basically he wanted me to cut my parents out. He wanted to be my guardian. He said he would make me into the biggest teen star in history. He said I had it all. He said I had to get rid of my parents. I was like ‚ÄòDude, I‚Äôm 11!‚Äô and he said ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre a man now‚Äô.‚Äù  Culkin, who has been living in Paris, France since 2003, then explained that the man ‚Äúbegan to make his intentions clear‚Äù. ‚ÄúHe started breathing real shallow. My experience with perverts kicked in. I could tell he was interested in me.  He licked his lips and told me I was very handsome. I think I managed to say ‚Äòthank you‚Äô and started thinking about how I could get immediately out of there.  Then he reached into his case and took out a crack pipe. He put it in his lap, took out this huge lighter, and continued to gaze at me with this overpowering sexual desire.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI was just staring at him. I think I said something like ‚ÄòDude, I‚Äôm 11‚Äô again.  I remember he said to me: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a celebration, little man. To celebrate your upcoming success. Your many successes. Come. Sit back down‚Äô.  He was tapping the pipe on his crotch, smiling this total creepazoid smile. I ran out of the room, but I ran straight into this other guy who was outside the room and he grabbed me by the arm and threw me back inside.‚Äù  ‚ÄúHe lit the pipe and blew the smoke in my face. He told me to look at his shoes. He said they were made from the skin of children he and his friends had murdered. He said leather made from human skin is the finest leather known to man.‚Äù  Death of a child star  Macaulay Culkin said the Hollywood executive then dropped a heavy hint about the provenance of the skin used to make his shoes.  ‚ÄúHe asked me if I knew Heather O‚ÄôRourke. Yeah, I remembered her. I grew up watching Poltergeist. I remembered her in Happy Days. She was so cute. I vomited all over his shoes.‚Äù  Heather O‚ÄôRourke was an American child actress, discovered by director Steven Spielberg when she was visiting MGM‚Äôs studios and later cast as Carol Anne Freeling in the horror film Poltergeist. She had the movie‚Äôs most recognizable line: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here!‚Äù.  After years in the Hollywood system, Heather O‚ÄôRourke died suddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 12. The official cause of death was listed as ‚Äúheart attack and septic shock‚Äù caused by a ‚Äúmisdiagnosed intestinal stenosis‚Äù in 1988, though many people were left wondering if there was more to the tragic story.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just say I went off the rails after my experiences filming Home Alone 2. I‚Äôm 37 now and I‚Äôm still processing everything. The things I have seen‚Ä¶‚Äù Culkin said, before trailing off and abruptly changing the topic.  Culkin‚Äôs legacy  There are a fair few things Macaulay Culkin is remembered for.  People like to talk about his years of reported heroin addiction, which snowballed into rumors that he spent an obscene amount of money on drugs. Others chat about his friendship with pop star Michael Jackson, as well as him fronting a pizza-themed comedy rock band.  But Culkin no longer has the rail thin, sickly appearance of a junkie. Carrying some weight around the midriff, Culkin is looking happier now, and is filming the lead role for friend Seth Green‚Äôs vehicle Changeland.  Speaking about the future, Culkin said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come out the other side. I‚Äôm alive. That is more than can be said for many. I‚Äôm not finished yet. Hollywood is going to burn in my lifetime. You watch.‚Äù  yogaesoteric  February 25, 2018"
"Beyonce & JAY-Z Show Strength In Vulnerability At Sensational On The Run II Tour Kick-Off  There‚Äôs a point where Beyonc√© has had enough, and we know she‚Äôs close to breaking because we do not hear her make a sound.  After belting through a mash-up of ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù and ‚ÄúMe, Myself And I‚Äù at the On The Run II Tour kick-off on Wednesday night (June 6), she sauntered offstage, bathed in darkness as the titanic screens behind her unpacked the Carters‚Äô catastrophe. Suddenly, we‚Äôre watching her and JAY-Z seethe at home as a staring contest rolls into the boil of an argument. As the scene unfurls moments after ‚ÄúHe better call Becky with the good hair‚Äù echoed throughout Cardiff‚Äôs Principality Stadium, the subject of the fraught conversation is clear. Images of their growing family and the frame of a house engulfed in flames followed, with Beyonc√© kneeling before the inferno and Jay standing, stunned, as the bones of his home disintegrate.  They say nothing, but they don‚Äôt have to. We know who lit the match. Those who were hoping for generous glimpses into Beyonc√© and JAY-Z‚Äôs evolution as husband, wife and parents since the last On The Run tour in 2014 should be careful what they wish for, because On The Run II delivers on that front without compromise to exquisite and devastating degrees.  ‚ÄúSorry‚Äù is one of the many songs indicting JAY-Z‚Äôs infidelity on Lemonade, Beyonc√©‚Äôs 2016 visual album, which he would address in his own way on 2017's 4:44. Both records are rife with pain and the complications of commitment, as it‚Äôs clear the couple was -- is -- intent on working through the brutality of his betrayal and its excruciating aftermath, both at home and in their respective recording studios. They made it through the blaze and rebuilt what was destroyed, but On The Run II doesn‚Äôt discard the smoldering embers of indiscretion in favor of the shiny next chapter of a shared life and love renewed.  Beyonc√© and JAY-Z are human and have their limits like everyone else, and they‚Äôve mounted a production that pushes them to theirs in order for us to understand how deeply earned and hard won this catharsis was -- and how superhuman they were to channel this anguish into such profound work.  That extends beyond On The Run II‚Äôs emotional anchor. Both are coming to their latest joint venture with an impressive set of wins collected since On The Run‚Äôs first outing nearly four years ago -- a feat itself, as it grossed over $100 million by the time it wrapped. 4:44 and its subsequent trek gave Jay his highest-grossing solo tour to date and his fourteenth No. 1 album, while Lemonade, her sixth No. 1 album, went on to make Hot 100 history when every one of its songs charted simultaneously.  The most recent of these accolades is Beyonc√©‚Äôs staggering (and historic) Coachella set, which redefined what a headliner can achieve and imbued Lemonade and the rest of her hit-laden discography with an even bolder bombast thanks to the might of an HBCU-inspired marching band and dance corps.  A post shared by Beyonc√© (@beyonce) on Jun 6, 2018 at 1:47pm PDT  Beychella posed a challenge in and of itself -- how was Beyonc√© going to top herself after that, and so soon after the fact? -- but On The Run II succeeds in condensing the vibrant brass and percussive step team choreography of her Coachella performance into a formidable package streamlined for the road. The incredible On The Run II band boasts not one but two tubas, two bassists (with Lauren Robinson‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeja Vu‚Äù feature standing out as a highlight), two guitars (Ariel O‚ÄôNeal‚Äôs ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Care‚Äù solo was a showstopper, too) and ample strings, among other talented singers and players.  An innovative stage setup kicked the production value up with the addition of Club Carter, a 700-person nightclub taking over the area between the catwalks, and a platform that moved Bey, Jay and their dancers deep into the heart of the arena at various points throughout the night. The show leaned on their shared affinity for film as well, as the visual interludes were crucial for picking up the story the Carters left off.  The selection of Lemonade and 4:44 tracks on the setlist was surprisingly modest, which made the vignettes -- especially the ones throwing to the conflict that shaped their most recent creative output -- all the more potent. Burning houses, tropical baptisms, voyeuristic visions of a harness-clad Beyonc√© and JAY-Z in a cash-covered motel room, family footage of Blue, Sir and Rumi with their doting parents, the cartoon for ‚ÄúThe Story of O.J.‚Äù -- no image was gratuitous, each one a metaphor that packed the same punch as Jay‚Äôs bars or Bey‚Äôs verses.  A post shared by Beyonc√© (@beyonce) on Jun 6, 2018 at 2:38pm PDT  Considering the mammoth visuals of the 4:44 tour and the technical and musical prowess of Beychella and the Formation tour before it, On The Run II was the sum of exceptional parts -- and one that elevated Beyonc√© and JAY-Z's happiest and most harrowing memories in their most challenging performance yet. They spent about a quarter of the show on their collection of duets, opening with the explosive ‚ÄúMagna Carta Holy Grail‚Äù and delighting in throwbacks ‚ÄúUpgrade U‚Äù and ‚ÄúDeja Vu.‚Äù Old favorites got new makeovers, with ""Baby Boy"" seguing into a reggae-inflected meditation and ""Naughty Girl"" invoking Bob Fosse's iconic Sweet Charity choreography to a bellydance-ready beat. Noticeably absent were lighthearted standards like ""Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It),"" ""Love On Top"" and other chart-toppers of Beyonc√©'s, though the heavier cuts -- like ""Resentment"" off 2006's B'Day, or 4's stadium shredder ""I Care"" -- flowed with the thematic undercurrent of the evening.  Their commitment to social justice shone through at various points: JAY-Z hit the stage in a bulletproof vest to perform ‚Äú99 Problems‚Äù as mug shots of numerous celebrities -- Meek Mill, David Bowie, civil rights activist Angela Davis, Lisa ‚ÄúLeft Eye‚Äù Lopez and more -- towered above him, and the clip of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaking on feminism in Beyonc√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlawless‚Äù found a new, fitting home in the final measure of ‚ÄúRun the World (Girls).‚Äù  Still, the moments when they were singing solely for each other brought it all back to why On The Run II was happening in the first place: JAY-Z was at his happiest and most relaxed in Beyonc√©‚Äôs orbit, and the sheer joy emanating from them both when they came together for ‚ÄúYoung Forever‚Äù was intense, especially at the conclusion of this multi-sensory, two-hour journey. As Beyonc√© soared through her take on Ed Sheeran‚Äôs ‚ÄúPerfect‚Äù before ‚ÄúYoung Forever,‚Äù tape of a vow renewal ceremony -- featuring Blue, Sir, Rumi, JAY-Z and Beyonc√© in white -- rolled behind them. With On The Run II, Beyonc√© and JAY-Z didn‚Äôt shy away from the pain that nearly broke them. They celebrated it, as it proved that breaking points forge new beginnings."

friday april 24 2020 healthday news -- malaria drugs touted by president donald trump as potential game changers against covid-19 are actually too dangerous for general use the u.s. food and drug administration warned americans on friday. according to the fda studies have shown that the drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may trigger potentially fatal heart rhythm problems in covid-19 patients. the agency also said that it 's aware of a rise in outpatient prescriptions for the two. 
"Update: Sgt. Johnson's mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, has now spoken with The Washington Post, and she says Wilson's account is accurate. ""President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,"" Jones-Johnson said. She said she was in the car at the time but declined to elaborate on the specifics of Wilson's claim.  A Democratic congresswoman says she was in the car with the widow of a soldier killed in Niger when President Trump made comments that upset the widow. Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (Fla.) says Trump told Myeshia Johnson that her husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, ‚Äúknew what he signed up for.‚Äù Appearing on MSNBC's ‚ÄúMorning Joe‚Äù on Wednesday, Wilson added that the widow was in tears after the call and lamented that Trump ‚Äúdidn't even remember his name.‚Äù  And Trump has now hit back at the congresswoman, saying he has ‚Äúproof‚Äù that her account is wrong.  Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017  Here's what we can say:  After-the-fact accounts can be flawed, and people can hear things in the worst possible way when they come from the mouths of their political opponents. Wilson may be totally honest in what she says, but if she believes Trump is a bad person, her recollection will not be charitable. If Trump has proof that Wilson is wrong, he needs to produce it immediately. The idea that Trump said this is ‚Äî unfortunately ‚Äî completely believable, given his track record of handling sensitive situations has ranged from awkward to offensive.  This is hardly the first time we've seen Trump wrapped up in a dispute involving a Gold Star family. In fact, it's the second day in a row in which Trump's comments about the relatives of dead service members have been at issue. On Monday, he suggested that his chief of staff, retired Marine general John Kelly, had not received a phone call from President Barack Obama after his son's death. White House officials have only elaborated on the matter anonymously.  Going back to the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump showed very little compunction about attacking the Khans, a Gold Star family that criticized him, and publicly questioned the war hero status of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war for seven years in Vietnam. While most politicians treat these matters very, very delicately ‚Äî or steer clear of them altogether ‚Äî Trump has repeatedly declined to do so. He has often proactively politicized them.  And whatever you think about Trump, displaying empathy is not his strong suit. The way he talks about tragedy is routinely awkward, at best, and tasteless, at worst. Puerto Rico is dealing with the fallout of a devastating hurricane, and Trump talks about how it will pay for the relief effort, suggests the island is at fault for its poor situation, and attacks San Juan's mayor. He turned a death during a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville from a tragedy into a political football when he blamed ‚Äúboth sides.‚Äù While in Florida for the Hurricane Irma relief effort, he seemed to be more reserved, but then he asked a man to attack Obama on camera. When Navy sailors were missing after a tanker collided with a destroyer near Singapore, Trump responded, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs too bad, too bad.‚Äù There are plenty more examples.  There is a tendency to think that some of this is just Trump being provocative and trying to rile up the media by pushing the boundaries of acceptable and presidential behavior. The simpler ‚Äî and not mutually exclusive ‚Äî alternative is that he just doesn't know how a president should act in these instances.  In this case, we have alleged Trump comments that were never meant for public consumption. If accurately relayed, they were just Trump being careless, not provocative. But they completely track with everything he has done and said publicly about tragedy before. It's not even difficult to imagine Trump saying these things at a lectern in the Rose Garden.  So again, it's worth waiting to see what ‚Äúproof‚Äù Trump produces. But the benefit of the doubt went out the window a long time ago, and Trump has himself to blame."
"Millions around the world watched as Meghan Markle tied the knot with Prince Harry last Saturday, walking down the aisle of St. George's Chapel in a custom gown designed by Givenchy's first female artistic director.

Add Interest  The day also marked the big reveal for the fashion world -- after months of anticipation and speculation -- of the wedding dress and designer Clare Waight Keller. Keeping the secret of who would design the royal wedding gown under wraps was no easy task, according to ABC News' royal contributor Omid Scobie.  Reuters  Markle, who already had a stash of bridal dress ""inspo"" pictures saved on her phone from Instagram, Pinterest and elsewhere online, began her search for a designer at the urging of her best friend, Jessica Mulroney, according to Scobie, who revealed details of the dress selection process in a Harper's Bazaar article.  Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, already knew what she wanted in her wedding dress: something timeless, elegant and appropriate, Scobie added.  While many designers threw their names in the running to be picked by Markle to design her dress, Waight Keller had been a favorite since the beginning. The designer and bride to be met just before Christmas, Scobie said, and Markle immediately liked what she saw.  Andrew Matthews/AFP/Getty Images  ‚ÄúI think she had seen my work and knew what I did,‚Äù Waight Keller said in comments to the press after the wedding. ‚ÄúI think she loved the fact that I was a British designer and working in a house such as Givenchy, which has its roots in a classical, beautiful style from the time of Hubert [de Givenchy] himself.‚Äù  After Markle officially chose Waight Keller to create her dress, the designer had to keep it a secret from everyone, even her own family, until the wedding day.  Mostly through discreet texts and phone calls, Markle and Waight Keller went back and forth on designing the dress before two teams signed nondisclosure agreements and got to work on it at Givenchy's Paris headquarters and an undisclosed London warehouse, according to Scobie.  Reuters  Creating the iconic dress ""was all about keeping the secret,"" Waight Keller said.  Hundreds of hours of meticulous stitching later, the finished gown was transported to Windsor Castle for a final fitting in May and was revealed to the world last Saturday.  Andrew Matthews/AFP/Getty Images  Keller called the royal wedding a ""dream day"" in a post on Instagram.  Waight Keller also told the press that Prince Harry thanked her for designing the dress for his bride.  ""He came straight up to me and he said, 'Oh my God, thank you! She looks absolutely stunning,'"" Waight Keller recalled. ""Well, I think everybody saw on television -- he was absolutely in awe, I think. She looked just incredible and it showed."""

"Caitlyn Jenner not only slammed the Kardashians, she vented about the strain of raising Kylie and Kendall Jenner. Read her extremely controversial remarks here!

Caitlyn Jenner, 68, all but called her daughters Kendall Jenner, 22, and Kylie Jenner, 20, a burden all while essentially disowning the rest of the Kardashians. In a recent interview with Piers Morgan, 52, on the show Life Stories, Caitlyn said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt talk to the Kardashians anymore. The only ones I am concerned about are Kendall and Kylie. They are my biological kids. I spent 23 years carting them around.‚Äù Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Caitlyn just summarize her role as a parent as hauling around Kylie and Kendall for over two decades?

"Daniel Craig is returning as James Bond once again, even as he reportedly fights to save his marriage to Rachel Weisz at the same time. Craig has already announced his intent to return as 007 in the franchise‚Äôs 25th film, and according to the National Enquirer, he‚Äôs still struggling to salvage what‚Äôs left of his marriage.  The Enquirer‚Äôs source claimed at the beginning of 2017, ‚ÄúRachel and Daniel haven‚Äôt been happy for a while, and nearly called it quits last year.‚Äù The report claims that the married couple was in two separate filming locations at the beginning of the year, but continued to stay apart even after wrapping their respective films. The Enquirer then claims that they finally reunited in July after not being seen together in ‚Äò554 days‚Äô.  According to the sources, the minute the outlet attempted to lock down an exclusive on the couple‚Äôs rocky marriage, both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig were seen arriving at New York‚Äôs Public Theater the next day, prompting the source to add, ‚ÄúThe whole thing just seemed like too much of a coincidence. I don‚Äôt buy it for a minute.‚Äù  When you consider Daniel Craig‚Äôs own words, especially in the context of allegedly turning down a $150 million payday to star in two more James Bond films, he had stated, ‚ÄúBeing on your own would be sad, sick, and weird.

"It's called method acting... How very Daniel Day-Lewis!  Remember the days when Pirates of Caribbean actor Johnny Depp was Hollywood's most-desired hunk? Well, that ship has well and truly sailed. Now fans are concerned there's something seriously wrong with the 54-year-old. Over the weekend, photos emerged of Johnny posing with fans at the Four Seasons hotel in St Petersburg, Russia. And he looked VERY different.  Looking at the snaps, Amber Heard's ex-husband cuts a pale and gaunt figure. Fans were also quick to point out just how much weight he appears to have lost, with many speculating it could be a result of potential illness or stress.  Johnny Depp: Then and now  ‚Üê Slide ‚Üí  ‚Üê Slide ‚Üí  ""Is he good health wise?"" one person asked, while another guessed, ""It's either stress or he real sick. I'm praying it's for a movie."" And they could be right. Johnny, who is currently touring with his rock tribute band the Hollywood Vampires, is starring in a new film called Richard Says Goodbye.  In the film, the actor is portraying Richard - a college professor who is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Onlookers who've seen Johnny recently agree that this could be the reason behind his drastic transformation. One person took to Twitter, advising the photos that sparked concerns were actually misleading. @its_batcounty claimed they saw Johnny in concert and he looked well. The message encouraged others to share their recent Johnny Depp encounters - all sounding very positive.  There was a time when Johnny was deemed Hollywood's leading heartthrob.  Despite the seemingly reasonable explanation - some pals close to Johnny are concerned. Chatting to Globe magazine, one insider claimed: ""Johnny looks like walking death."" They alleged, ""He lost 35 pounds (15-kilos) in a brief amount of time."""

"Jim Carrey says the Illuminati is pushing Satanism through the entertainment industry  The Trueman Show star claims that a push is being made by ""dark forces that control the world"" to promote Satanism in the mainstream and turn people away from traditional values.  During an aftershow event at the Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, where his new documentary, ""Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond"" was being screened at the AFI Fest, Carrey was answering questions from a group of fans on his preparation for his acting roles.  Jim & Andy chronicles the time when Jim Carrey was filming his 1999 movie biography Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon, for which he won multiple awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.  Carrey is known for his method acting, in which he lives his life on and off the set as his character.  Jim & Andy explores his methods and details how he ""nearly lost it"" after becoming so deeply involved in his character.  Carrey joked with fans about how he drove his friends and family ""crazy"" whilst he was filming The Grinch, with one of them asking if that meant he ""wasn't looking forward to Christmas,"" to which he replied:  ""No, I love Christmas. ""I fully embrace the festivities as I know that we, as a civilization, don't have many of them left.""  Following a smattering of nervous laughter from the group, Carrey was prompted to elaborate:  ""Those dark forces who control everything - the Illuminati - the Illumi-nutty - they are working hard to eradicate tradition values. ""Satanism is being pushed through movies, TV, and pop music to brainwash young minds into following Satan. ""You must of all seen that, right? ""It's everywhere and has been for years. ""They are not trying to manifest themselves into the zeitgeist: Satan is already fully embedded in the public psyche. ""It's only now that the trigger is being engaged and the final stages of the agenda are being fulfilled. ""You keep seeing these celebrities opening up about their devotion to Lucifer, and that's not a slip of the tongue: They are preparing for the final push. ""Once Satan is the dominant force on Earth, there will be no more Christmas. ""I don't know what they will replace it with. ""Probably one of their rituals where they sacrifice children and drink their blood. ""Trust me, once you see what these guys in Hollywood really get up to, you'll think Weinstein was a boy scout.""  At this point, the atmosphere changes as the group seem confused as they nervously smile at each other, to which Carrey steers the conversation back.  ""Anyway, at least we still have this Christmas to look forward to,"" he said before raising a glass of soda water to toast saying:  ""To Satan... I mean Santa!""  Jim Carrey's concerns about a push towards a Devil-worshipping future may not actually be so far-fetched.  For generations, Illuminati symbolism has been subliminally pushed though pop culture, but more recently there has been a dramatic rise of Satanic symbols in music.  Celebrities, from Nicki Minaj to Lil Wayne to Rihanna, are accused of filling the airwaves with Illuminati imagery.  In music videos, promotional materials, video games, and paparazzi photos, the most famous guys and girls in pop culture are caught repping the All-Seeing Eye.  This eye, a singular eyeball in a pyramid-esque shape, is associated with this occult group of Satanists who have sold their souls for success.  Turn on the MTV VMAs for Illuminati symbolism, courtesy of Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus.  Scroll through old album covers and find one-eyed Jordin Sparks and Celine Dion confirming their membership in the occult organization.  Turn the pages of Parlour magazine and Esquire to see Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj use triangular mannerisms to cover one eye.  The Eye of Horus isn't even disguised as the CBS logo, nor is it disguised in scenes from the hit video game ""Grand Theft Auto V.""  Look close enough, and Illuminati Eyes sightings are all over pop culture.  Illuminati symbols in pop culture aren't uncommon, but now they are becoming more frequent and less subtle.  Jay-Z wears a Satanic slogan across his sweatshirt: 'Do What Thou Wilt'  ¬© press  Recently music stars have become far more open about their devotion to the occult and their love for their ""Lord Satan.""  Just last month, Hip Hop star Jay-Z has blasted traditional Christian values in an epic rant where he claims to be part of an exclusive club of ""smart people"" who worships ""our true lord; Satan.""  The billionaire rapper has also claimed that ""God created Lucifer to be the bearer of truth and light,"" and that ""Jesus never existed"" but was merely a ""tool created by smart people to control dumb people.""  More recently, pop star Miley Cyrus left her followers shocked and confused after advising her young fans to ""worship Satan"" if they want to become ""rich & famous"" like their heroes.  If what Carrey is saying is correct, then maybe these revelations aren't accidental slip-ups at all but are meant to be an intentional push at taking their Satanic teachings into the mainstream.  Fox has invested millions into pro-Satanic programming like TV show 'Lucifer'  ¬© press  TV network Fox has also being accused of trying to ""take the Devil mainstream"" after investing millions into pro-Satanic programming.  One of Fox's most popular shows, Lucifer, depicts a cool, good-looking incarnation of the devil who drives a Corvette and owns a nightclub.  The series makes the idea of Satan seem exciting, and clearly being aimed at teenagers and young adults, it certainly fits in with Carrey's brainwashing comments.  Fox has also heavily promoted a show that's a modern reinvention of William Peter Blatty‚Äôs bestselling 1971 book, The Exorcist.  The project is described as ""a propulsive, serialized psychological thriller following two very different men tackling one family‚Äôs case of horrifying demonic possession, and confronting the face of true evil.""  Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs media conglomerate News Corp., that owns Fox, also owns a company called Avon that publishes and promotes Anton Lavey‚Äôs book The Satanic Bible.

To mark the anniversary ‚Äî and most certainly to stir more emotions before the Oscars next month ‚Äî Universal Pictures has teamed up with AMC Theatres to offer free screenings of the film on Feb. 19.  That‚Äôs right, the horror satire will be back in select theaters on President‚Äôs Day.

"Coldplay frontman Chris Martin is planning to perform in Argentina as he takes the Global Citizen campaign against extreme poverty to another continent, sources close to the organizers said.  The advocacy movement, which rallies support for development assistance through music and other events, holds festivals in New York‚Äôs Central Park each year when world leaders are gathering for the United Nations (UN) General Assembly and has previously expanded to Canada, Germany and India.  Sources close to the organizers told AFP that Martin, who holds the title of festival curator, is planning a concert later this year in Buenos Aires as part of Global Citizen.  ADVERTISEMENT  Details are being worked out but the sources said that Global Citizen‚Äôs CEO, Hugh Evans, met Thursday with President Mauricio Macri in Buenos Aires.  Macri and Argentine first lady Juliana Awada took to the stage last year at the Global Citizen festival in Hamburg to join Colombian superstar Shakira.  Macri, who will host a summit in November of the Group of 20 major economies, said at the time that the festival sent a strong message of support for fighting poverty including by investing in education and women‚Äôs empowerment.  Global Citizen does not sell tickets for its festivals but instead admits fans who commit to taking actions such as writing to their governments to support development aid as part of the UN-backed goal of eradicating the planet‚Äôs most extreme poverty by 2030.

"[This article contains spoilers from the April 16 series finale of HBO's Girls.]  So here's how I'm looking at the series finale of Girls and you may choose to disagree or view things however you like:  Last week's episode, fittingly titled ""Goodbye Tour,"" was the true series finale of Girls. Written by Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham and directed beautifully by Nisha Ganatra, it brought the friendship between Hannah (Dunham), Marnie (Allison Williams), Shosh (Zosia Mamet) and Jessa (Jemima Kirke) to a lovely resting spot at Shosh's engagement party. Hannah looking at her friends dancing each in their own distinctive ways ‚Äî Jessa like nobody was watching, Marnie like everybody was watching and Shosh fixated on a groom-to-be introduced to audiences and Hannah just seconds earlier ‚Äî before departing New York City for a job that every think piece posted on the Internet in the past seven days has already told you doesn't exist in our current academic climate and wouldn't have gone to Hannah anyway, was a perfect end for the series.  The previous couple of episodes had also given many of the show's characters their own effective places of repose. With Shosh as accidental matchmaker, Ray (Alex Karpovsky) found love, somebody whose idiosyncrasies matched his own. Elijah (Andrew Rannells) somehow got the lead in the musical of White Men Can't Jump and maybe he and Dill Harcourt are together. And I guess Adam ends up with Jessa, at least for a while, and even if you think that mercurial relationship isn't good for the long haul, Adam Driver's scenes with Dunham/Hannah in the antepenultimate episode were as well-acted as any in the show's entire run. (I'm glad this season has helped a lot of detractors recognize how good an actress Lena Dunham has become over the six seasons of Girls. This isn't a Jerry Seinfeld situation. I don't care if you like or hate Hannah, but Dunham slayed all 10 episodes.)  If you wanted to sum up the series with Hannah's half-apology to Jessa, ""Think about it. We were all just doing our best,"" and Jessa's reply, ""Our best was awful,"" that's a pretty amusing way to do it. Or you can sum the show up in Elijah's braying laughter between sentences of the declaration, ""Hannah, you've made so many wonderful friendships here. That's not a thing!""  All season long, Girls has been sending itself off in the peak of style, delivering one top-notch episode after another. I'm not ready yet to step back and say this was the show's best season or that any individual episode was the show's best episode, but in the balance, from Hannah and Paul-Louis in the Hamptons to the Desi nightmare in Poughkeepsie to the Elijah-centric musical audition episode to Hannah's and Adam's brief dream reconciliation to the brief and triumphant return of Patrick Wilson's doctor character, the highlights have been myriad. And that's without getting to ""American Bitch,"" the two-hander with Matthew Rhys that probably would get the most Best Episode Yet votes.  Let's take the nine episodes as a build-up to last week's finale and then we don't need to stress about what our expectations were or weren't for the last installment.  Because let's be honest: There wasn't anything that Girls owed me (or you) in Sunday's finale. Most of the characters got the send-offs they deserved. There were absolutely no mysteries to be solved or outstanding questions that needed answering or anything that so many Peak TV finales have needed to accomplish when they neared the end. There was no question as to whether Hannah was going to die, whether the CIA was ever going to catch Shosh or whether Adam was going to get that out-of-the-blue phone call from Ron Howard launching his acting career into the stratosphere. Anything you really wanted or deserved from a finale came last week when the four main characters crammed themselves into a bathroom and argued about why they haven't been good friends to each other for a while.  Sunday's episode, ""Latching,"" was an epilogue. It was a postscript. It was a ""Here's what life looks like for a little bit until we get around to checking back in on these characters.""  If you wanted fireworks or epic dramatic outbursts, I'm sure you were disappointed. If you wanted an exceptional and intimate three-hander with Hannah, Marnie and Hannah's mom Loreen (Becky Ann Baker), plus occasional outbursts by an adorable baby named Grover? Well, if you wanted specifically that exact thing, I'm sure you loved it. This is close enough to what I wanted, personally.  If last week's episode did most of the things a good series finale does, ""Latching"" did probably the one thing last week's episode didn't do, specifically tying us back into the pilot.  The series began, remember, with Hannah's parents setting Hannah adrift, telling her that she wouldn't get any more financial support and that she was on her own trying to make it in the big city. It was nothing if not a forcible unlatching from the paternal teat. Sunday's finale, which Konner directed from a script she co-wrote with Dunham and Judd Apatow.... Well, you don't need me to explain. Hannah's neurotic fears that Grover wouldn't suckle related to Hannah's ongoing fears about her difficulties being maternal and then, after a marvelous Loreen lecture, Hannah wandering the streets, coming upon a high school girl fleeing from her mother's protective care and going into maternal overdrive herself. Having ranted at the girl ‚Äî ""She'll take care of you forever, even if it means endless, endless pain"" ‚Äî Hannah returned home and Grover finally latched as the show eschewed a closing credits song for the sounds of an encouraging mom, a nursing baby and the mumbling singing of a woman with ""Fast Car"" stuck in her head.  ""Fast Car"" was stuck in Hannah's head because of Marnie's dogged insistence on singing it in the car and the finale was an unexpectedly big showcase for Marnie. This is good if you're a fan of Marnie and bad if you're a Marnie hater and if you're still a Marnie hater.... Good grief! What's wrong with you? Last year's ""The Panic in Central Park"" was designed to eliminate the last people not marveling at what a singular portrait of altruistically self-absorbed exceptionalism Williams and the writers have crafted.  It's hilarious that while thematically ""Unlatched"" was one big callback to the pilot, the specific callbacks almost all related to Marnie, introduced in the series just as she was in this episode: spooning in bed with Hannah. As in the pilot, when Marnie's idea of role-playing was to suggest to Charlie that he try being somebody entirely different from himself, we got to see more of Marnie's horridness at forced raunch as her isolation in rural New York left her having FaceTime sex with a personal trainer from Weehawken, which included flight attendant/captain dirty talk at its worst (""Do you think I should use the oxygen mask on his dick?"").  Marnie's abrupt announcement that she wanted to move in with Hannah and help her raise the baby was pretty much vintage Marnie, since we already knew that Marnie lost her apartment and was facing life with her mother. It was pure kindness and pure personal desperation. And her strategy for getting Hannah to give in was also vintage Marnie, starting with, ""You think you have a lot of friends, right?"" followed by proof that Hannah's other friends were all absent, at best.  ""I'm here. I win. I'm your best friend,"" Marie squealed with glee and all Marnie has ever wanted since the pilot is to have Hannah's undivided best friend attention when she wants/needs it.  Marnie living with Hannah, if only for a few months, was exactly right and then it was also exactly right for her to start wondering about herself again at the end and also to decide that law school might be a good idea because, ""I f‚Äîing love rules.""  Yup. That's our Marnie.  This was a ideal finale for Girls because taken in the right frame of mind, it offered the heart and humor that marked the show at its best and gave all three actresses many moments to shine. But if you take it in the wrong frame of mind, if you demand that after last week's closure you get even more closure, it was probably an easy finale to hate and what could be more Girls than that?  So now let Dunham and Konner and Apatow take a few years to do other things. The Girls Think Piece Industrial Complex will either dry up or move on to The Handmaid's Tale or Kevin Can Wait or something.  Then it will be time to move this production to the big screen.  Girls on Film, anyone?"

"It's been over two years since Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton first got together, and a source close to the 41-year-old country singer tells ET that they're happier than ever!  The two were recently spotted strolling down the beach in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and even ran into Shelton's pal, Luke Bryan. Stefani wore a white bikini top that she paired with a black sarong and a tan sweater, while Shelton sported a blue trucker hat that matched his board shorts and button-down shirt.  While they may have been an unexpected pair when they first started dating, Shelton and Stefani have been going strong for some time now.  Backgrid  ""Gwen really loves Blake for who he is and has never once tried to change him or anything about him. She even loves his style!"" the source tells ET.

"The Boondock Saints moved a few inches (and a few hundred dollars) closer to resurrection with news of a fan-funded Origins TV series , though it seemed questionable stars Norman Reedus or Sean Patrick Flanery would participate. Now, The Boondock Saints: Origins addresses whether the original stars have any involvement, including on a film sequel.  It was just over a week ago that The Boondock Saints writer-director Troy Duffy launched a fan campaign to fund his new Origins series, aiming for a March 2018 premiere. Reedus and Flanery were also at one time eyed to produce alongside the original 1999 film‚Äôs producer Don Carmody. That said, with regard to current participation in either Origins or a third film, a website FAQ now downplays expectations:  Similar to how the Batman franchise has multiple versions and iterations of the caped crusader, if the 1st and 2nd film were the equivalent of Tim Burton‚Äôs version of Batman with Michael Keaton, The Boondock Saints: Origins will be its own stand-alone reboot of the franchise. The Christopher Nolan with Christian Bale version, if you will pardon the analogy. Norman and Sean absolutely will be back for the 3rd film and are aware of this television reboot of the brand. And who knows‚Ä¶ maybe they pop by from time to time in the TV Series. Sometimes, good things do come on small(er) screens.  Another section also clarified that ‚Äúwe are still going to be making the 3rd film for you too, but only after we get the tv series up and running,‚Äù while GossipCop reportedly got a bleak assessment from Reedus‚Äô representation:  Troy Duffy put out this video and did not speak or consult with us in advance.

Before that she had not made public any details of her pregnancy and had not even confirmed she was expecting.  Jenner apologised to fans for ""keeping you in the dark"" and said she kept the pregnancy private because she needed to ""prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how"".  She said: ""There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned.  ""I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.""  Image: Pic: Kylie Jenner/Youtube  The star has been in the spotlight since she was nine years old as part of the Jenner-Kardashian family on reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  She said pregnancy had been the most ""beautiful, empowering and life changing experience"" of her life and she is ""actually going to miss it"".  Jenner also shared an 11-minute video giving fans a peek into the last nine months, from the time she found out she was expecting until the baby's birth.  Image: Pic: Kylie Jenner/Youtube  During her pregnancy there were several rumours which she chose not to address, only posting pictures on social media where her stomach could not be seen.  On the same day her name was disclosed, it was revealed Stormi's father, rapper Travis Scott - real name Jacques Webster - had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct for an incident last year at a concert in Arkansas.  He was arrested after his concert and police claimed he ""encouraged people to rush the stage"" but his lawyer said video footage did not support the allegations so other charges of inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a minor were dismissed.

"Kevin Winter/Getty Images for iHeartMedia  Miley Cyrus had no filter when it came to gushing about everything from her new music to her relationship with Liam Hemsworth in Billboard's new cover story, but there was one passage that had readers stopping short and lingering on her comments on hip-hop, specifically, for her brief characterization of it as materialistic and misogynistic.  The comment came about when she name-checked Kendrick Lamar's ""Humble"" as an inspirational track, and Cyrus specified why she loved the DAMN. single ‚Äî or what she doesn't love about other rap, really. ""I love [""Humble""] because it‚Äôs not 'Come sit on my dick, suck on my cock,'"" she told Billboard. ""I can‚Äôt listen to that anymore. That‚Äôs what pushed me out of the hip-hop scene a little. It was too much 'Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock' ‚Äî I am so not that.""  Once swift, angry blowback followed the publication of the piece, Cyrus took to Instagram to share her side of the story, or her account of what didn't make it into print: She stressed that the comment was made in a broader conversation and that she's an ""artist without borders"" who was asked about her thoughts on rap for this particular conversation.  ""A lot of the time publications like to focus on the most sensationalized part of the conversation,"" she writes. ""So, to be clear I respect ALL artists who speak their truth and appreciate ALL genres of music (country, pop, alternative .... but in this particular interview I was asked about rap) I have always and will continue to love and celebrate hip hop as I've collaborated with some of the very best! At this point in my life I am expanding personally/musically and gravitating more towards uplifting, conscious rap!""  She closes by reminding her followers that she's got new music coming ‚Äî her single, ""Malibu,"" from her forthcoming album is set to drop on May 11 ‚Äî and that she hopes that her words ""encourage others to LOVE."" Her note is way closer to her mission than the comments she made in passing, that's for sure, so we'll wait and see if any ""uplifting, conscious rap"" makes it way onto the record."
"Brad Pitt smells bad. That‚Äôs the alarming claim being made in a recent article in The National Inquirer.

"Millie Bobby Brown is best known for her breakout role as telekinetic child Eleven in Netflix's 'Stranger Things.'  Who Is Millie Bobby Brown?  Born on February 19, 2004, Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress. Her family relocated to Los Angeles, where she began earning parts on shows like Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and NCIS. Her big break came with the Netflix sleeper hit Stranger Things, on which she stars as the gifted Eleven.  Early Life & Career  Millie Bobby Brown is a Spanish-born British actress who was born on February 19, 2004. Her family moved back to the U.K. when Brown was four years old and then moved to Orlando, Florida, four years later to start an entrepreneurial business. It was there that she was spotted by a talent scout who told her parents ""she has instincts you cannot teach.""  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Brown's parents sacrificed everything ‚Äî moving their family to Los Angeles ‚Äî to see Brown's acting dreams come true. Within three months of moving, Brown was given the role of Alice in ABC's Once Upon a Time in Wonderland and soon after she appeared as Madison O'Donnell in BBC America's Intruders. While Brown continued finding work in smaller roles on shows like NCIS, Modern Family and Grey‚Äôs Anatomy, she kept getting passed up for bigger roles.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  With no major jump in her career, her family had become so financially strained, they moved back to the U.K. to live with an aunt. ""I was devastated. I wasn‚Äôt getting work. I thought I was done,"" said Brown in an interview with the Daily Mail.  'Stranger Things'  However, as things were looking bleak, Brown landed an audition for Netflix's Stranger Things. ""I had to cry in the audition. My emotions were so raw, I hit it out of the park,"" she said. Weeks later, Brown was on a plane to begin filming in Atlanta.  Set in a 1980s Indiana town facing a threat from paranormal activity, Stranger Things became a hit upon its release in 2016, earning an array of awards. Meanwhile, Brown was heralded as one of its breakout performers for her role of Eleven, a girl with telekinetic powers.  The show's success was such that its primary actors all scored big raises heading into Season 3, with Brown rumored to be earning as much as its best-known star, Winona Ryder.  In April 2018, the 14-year-old Brown was the youngest person named to Time's 100 most influential list. Writing about her inclusion among the special group, actor Aaron Paul recalled how he was stunned by Brown's wisdom and perspective upon meeting her, feeling like he was talking to a future leader. ""Maybe that's why she's such an extraordinary actor,"" he wrote. ""She somehow understands the human experience as if she has lived it for a thousand years.""

(Photo: David Livingston/Getty Images)  Personal  In late 2017, rumors began swirling that Brown was dating Jacob Sartorius, an American singer who launched his career through popular clips posted to Musical.ly. The young couple confirmed their relationship with sweet messages addressed to one another via Instagram on Valentine's Day 2018 but broke up a few months later in July 2018.  Meanwhile, the unfortunate meme #takedownmilliebobbybrown was gaining steam on social media. Beginning with a user who accused Brown of pulling off her hijab and stamping on it, the thread took on a life of its own as people relayed their ""story"" of the actress attacking them while delivering expletive-filled homophobic comments. Brown ultimately deactivated her Twitter account in June 2018."

Marisha posted on her Instagram Story that if anyone sees him, to ""please let him know that many, many people care.""  The Riverside Police Department told ET on Monday that Marisha ""filed a report with our department last week on the 19th stating he was missing,"" and through friends, she spoke with someone who claimed that her brother was last seen in Riverside, California, though it hasn't been confirmed that he was actually there. Police say that he was last seen in Fontana, California, on Thursday morning.  Marisha posted a number of videos of Jesse, whose real name is Josiah, and wrote, ""If anyone has seen or heard from my brother Jesse since Saturday, please, please, please reach out to me or ask him to call home!!!"" She said she's thankful to people ""who reached out to express their concern and support after my brother Jesse went MIA.""  According to police, Jesse's sister reported that she last spoke with her brother ""around the 11th or the 12th"" of July, which she said was ""unusual."" Police also told ET that Marisha said Jesse ""may have been depressed lately.""  ""Right now we do not see anything dealing with foul play,"" a police spokesperson added to ET.

"Science and fashion came together at the LACAMA gala and it never looked more gorgeous. Kim Kardashian risked a massive wardrobe malfunction, but pulled off a shirtless look while on the red carpet!  No shirt? No problem. Kim Kardashian, 37, didn‚Äôt need anything underneath her suit coat when she walked the carpet at the Las Angeles County Museum of Art‚Äôs Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles on Nov. 4. The Keeping Up with the Kardashian seemed to defy gravity ‚Äì and dress codes ‚Äì as she left her shirt in the car. Whoever designed her double-sided tape probably deserves an award, because Kim managed to get through the event without a nip slip or another embarrassing malfunction. Technically, does she have cleavage if she‚Äôs not wearing a bra or a shirt?  This year‚Äôs event honored Star Wars creator George Lucas and artist Mark Bradford, according to Daily Mail. The event was also presented by Gucci. Kim famously met future hubby Kanye West while dressed as Princess Leia. Plus, she‚Äôs also a fashionista and a patron of the arts. That explains why she and her mother, Kris Jenner, were attending this LACMA Fundraiser ‚Äì and turning heads with Kim‚Äôs braless, shirtless fashion choice.  Kim‚Äôs bold fashion choices don‚Äôt always pay off. While she was posing in one of her sexy Halloween costumes, her nipple made a surprise cameo. While flaunting her Aaliyah-inspired outfit, she seemed to be in need of some double-sided tape, as her jewel-studded bra slipped a bit and ‚Äì out popped the nip! Considering that Kim spends most of her time half-naked (and proud of it!) this was one of her more minor ‚Äúmalfunctions.‚Äù It certainly didn‚Äôt stop her from enjoying Halloween!  Speaking of that Aaliyah tribute, Kim actually came under fire for people who accused her of being in ‚Äúpoor taste.‚Äù Some fans accused Kim of culture appropriation, since Aaliyah was an African American woman and Kim is not. ‚ÄúThe look was inspired by what she wore in her ‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù music video,‚Äù Kim said when she was explaining her choice (while clapping back at those accusing her costume of being racist.) ‚ÄúI play every kind of genre of music in my home and I like for my kids to be exposed to many different artists. For me, it‚Äôs always about love and respect.‚Äù  What do you think of Kim‚Äôs LACMA gala outfit, HollywoodLifers? Do you think it was stunning? Or do you think it‚Äôs a pass?"

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Looking back at things Meghan Markle has said and done in her life so far, it seems that she was always destined for royalty.  She's always showed thoughtfulness, grace and intelligence - from campaigning against a sexist ad when she was just 11 years old to the humanitarian work she's been passionate about long before she married Prince Harry.  There's so much talk about the Duchess of Sussex every day, but what has she actually said about herself?  As she celebrates her 37th birthday this weekend, here's what Meghan has said on some of the most important things in her life - in her own words.  On happiness and self-acceptance  On her 33rd birthday Meghan wrote on her website The Tig about the ways she struggled with the idea of fitting in - before she realised it's important to be kind and accept yourself as you are.  ""I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well‚Ä¶it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.  ""My 20s were brutal ‚Äì a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as ""whatever"" as everyone else. My teens were even worse ‚Äì grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant.  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  "" You need to know that you‚Äôre enough [is a] mantra that has now engrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head.  ""So for my birthday, here‚Äôs what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself.""  On her relationship with Harry  In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2016, Meghan spoke about her blossoming relationship with Prince Harry.  She said: ""We‚Äôre a couple... We‚Äôre in love.  ""I‚Äôm sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It‚Äôs part of what makes it so special, that it‚Äôs just ours. But we‚Äôre happy. Personally, I love a great love story.""  On the proposal  (Image: Getty)  In Meghan and Harry's first interview post-engagement, she told the BBC about how the proposal happened.  ""Just a cosy night. What were we doing? We were trying to roast a chicken. It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee. . . As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing, like, 'Can I say yes now?!'""  On feminism  In her speech at the UN in 2015, Meghan told the story of her 11-year-old self who was angry at a sexist TV ad - and how she felt compelled to do something about it:  ""I had been in school watching a TV show in elementary school and this commercial came on with the tag line for this dish washing liquid and the tag line said, ‚ÄòWomen all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans‚Äô.  ""Two boys from my class said, ‚ÄòYeah, that‚Äôs where women belong, in the kitchen‚Äô.  ""I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt; it just wasn't right, and something needed to be done. So I went home and told my dad what had happened, and he encouraged me to write letters, so I did, to the most powerful people I could think of.""  ""It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision ‚Äî because it isn't enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn't enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together.""  On her humanitarian work  (Image: PA)  In 2016, Meghan wrote on The Tig about how she feels she can't not do humanitarian work - particularly with the responsibility of someone in the entertainment industry who is looked up to.  ""I‚Äôve never wanted to be a lady who lunches ‚Äì I‚Äôve always wanted to be a woman who works. And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.""  On the Queen  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  In the royal couple's engagement interview on the BBC in November 2017, Meghan spoke about how she has the utmost respect for Harry's grandmother.  ""To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother‚Ä¶ all of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her, I had such a deep understanding and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her ‚Ä¶ She's an incredible woman."""

"She's been a model for two years with work for makeup mogul Pat McGrath, Too Faced cosmetics and South Beach already under her belt.  But there's one side of her that up-and-coming fashion star Gracie Phillips has always kept hidden: her family background.  Now, in an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the 20-year-old LA-based catwalk sensation has spoken for the first time about her actor father Lou Diamond Phillips, 56.  Phillips, whose film and TV credits include La Bamba, Young Guns, Miami Vice and The 33, has three more daughters: Gracie's twin Isabella, Lilli, 18, and Indigo, 11.  But while he admits to chatting about Gracie's achievements 'with anyone who asks', his 20-year-old daughter, whose mother is former Penthouse model Kelly Phillips, has long been more hesitant.  Model Gracie Phillips, 20, exclusively revealed to DailyMail.com that her father is La Bamba actor Lou Diamond Phillips. The LA-based model said she kept her father a secret because she wanted to make it on her own  Gracie said: 'When I started, I never wanted anyone to say to me, she did this job because of her dad, because of her last name, because of who she is'  The brunette model said she kept her father a secret because she didn't want to face the same negative Kendall Jenner, Bella and Gigi Hadid faced due to their celebrity background  Phillips said: 'I'm incredibly proud of Grace and the fact that she wanted to earn this, she wanted to make her own way - I was supportive of that from the beginning.' Pictured: The father and daughter in December 1999  'When I started, I really just wanted to try and do it by myself and say yes, I did it all by myself,' Gracie explained.  'At the time, it was kind of in the height of Hollywood royalty where everyone was kind of doing things and you'd find out this is the child of so-and-so.  'As I was looking on social media, I saw positives but I also saw the negatives ‚Äì people bashing the kids of people who were in the industry, saying they're only doing this because of this.  'When I started, I never wanted anyone to say to me, she did this job because of her dad, because of her last name, because of who she is.'  Phillips added: 'I'm incredibly proud of Grace and the fact that she wanted to earn this, she wanted to make her own way - I was supportive of that from the beginning.  'She's been booking jobs, she's been receiving praise and getting incredibly good feedback based on her own merit, without getting any qualifications.  'It's not that I don't want her to say she's my progeny but at the same time, there's no doubt it's very, very rewarding and I'm very, very pleased that she can take all the credit for this herself as she should.  'She's the one who's built her own boat in this respect.'  Like her contemporaries Kaia Gerber, Brooklyn Beckham and Gigi Hadid, Grace's childhood was one of film sets, travel and paparazzi eager to snatch a photo of her famous parents.  Gracie explained: 'When I started, I really just wanted to try and do it by myself. At the time, it was kind of in the height of Hollywood royalty where everyone was kind of doing things and you'd find out this is the child of so-and-so.' Pictured: Gracie with her sisters Isabella and Lilli and Phillips in an undated photo  She continued: 'As I was looking on social media, I saw positives but I also saw the negatives ‚Äì people bashing the kids of people who were in the industry, saying they're only doing this because of this'. Pictured: The future model in grade school  Phillips, 56, whose film and TV credits include La Bamba, Young Guns, Miami Vice and The 33, admits to chatting about Gracie's achievements 'with anyone who asks. Pictured: Phillips and his ex-wife and Gracie's mother Kelly, a former Penthouse model  Phillips says he and his former wife Kelly did their best to ensure her young life was 'normal' ‚Äì 'going shopping and cooking dinner, taking out the trash and picking up dog poop.'  He said: 'It's literally just not putting on airs and pretensions and making sure the kids see you as dad first when you're around.'  But some of Gracie's earliest memories are far from ordinary, among them the time she first saw the film La Bamba and broke down in tears thinking her father had really died, as he does in the movie.  'Growing up, I didn't know any different,' she told DailyMail.com.  'I was always on set, always around paparazzi and fans and it never really fazed me. I was just really proud of my dad.  'I do remember when I first saw La Bamba, I was taken aback ‚Äì I wasn't born when it came out but I first saw it when I was really young.  'I didn't really understand the concept of acting yet, so when I first saw it, I actually thought he died.'  Phillips added: 'I remember it very well, she came outside with tears in her eyes and went, Dad, you've died! And I was like no, I'm right here!'  'I was really upset,' Gracie recalled. 'But after that, I was able to understand, oh this is not real and I understood that it was acting.'  Gracie says modeling is where she expresses herself best ‚Äì and says hopes to follow in the Hadid sisters' footsteps and take to the catwalk as a Victoria's Secret Angel one day  Phillips thinks his daughter is smart enough to navigate industry pitfalls such as wild parties, predatory men and rejection and come through unscathed.Pictured: The actor with Gracie (center) with her sisters in 2004  She also joined her father in front of the camera early on, starring in a Hallmark film directed by the 56-year-old in which she played a cholera victim ‚Äì an 'odd, odd experience' according to Phillips.  But despite her acting pedigree and desire to try it again one day, Gracie says modeling is where she expresses herself best ‚Äì and says hopes to follow in the Hadid sisters' footsteps and take to the catwalk as a Victoria's Secret Angel one day.  'Ever since I was a little girl, when the show comes on, I put on the wings, put on a pair of high heels, a sparkly bra and underwear and pretend,' Gracie said.  'One day, if I'm not watching it from my TV, it'll be because I'm doing it, carrying on my tradition for real ‚Äì that's my hope, my biggest dream.'  For now, she 'has several jobs booked' but hopes to walk in New York Fashion Week and elsewhere for luxury brands such as Chanel, Versace and Alexander Wang this year.  Standing right behind Gracie is her father, currently busy with pilot season, who says he thinks his daughter is smart enough to navigate industry pitfalls such as wild parties, predatory men and rejection and come through unscathed.  'It's incredibly frightening and not only have I seen [predatory behavior] and I know people like this, if not some of the people involved,' he told DailyMail.com.  'It's out there and the fact that Grace and I have always been able to have candid conversations, not only about this but about drugs and all kinds of other stuff.  'I know she is armed when it comes to dealing with these things.  Gracie once joined her father in front of the camera, starring in a Hallmark film directed by the 56-year-old in which she played a cholera victim ‚Äì an 'odd, odd experience' according to Phillips. Gracie said she has the desire to try acting again one day  For now, she 'has several jobs booked' but hopes to walk in New York Fashion Week and elsewhere for luxury brands such as Chanel, Versace and Alexander Wang this year  He continued: 'It doesn't mean it's going to be any less painful and any less uncomfortable dealing with these situations but I know this sort of thing is out in the open now ‚Äì she's going to benefit from that and will not allow herself to be shamed into anything.'  One thing he would like to do is work with Gracie on camera again, and says she could make a career in acting if she chose to.  The Night Stalker star added: 'I think she's slowly claiming her own territory. She's as beautiful as the girl next door but I think she's got this edginess to her.  'It's exciting to think that certain photographers are going to find her and help her establish her own persona out there.'  Gracie, meanwhile, is hoping that people will react positively to the revelation she has a famous father and respect her for trying to make it on her own.  'What I hope is going to happen is obviously I'd like to say I'll get some bigger jobs and bigger things will happen,' she said of opening up about her famous dad.  'That's my hope. But also I feel like it is a positive that I didn't go into it that way at first.  'So I'm hoping the reaction is more, wow she decided to do this on her own before and that's really admirable. I'm hoping it's not something that's taken negatively.'"

And got divorced at 23, to my high school sweetheart,‚Äù Bella said. ‚ÄúBasically we got married by Elvis. We drove to Vegas, did it.‚Äù  The union was something Bella regretted from the beginning. ‚ÄúEven when I started walking down the aisle, I knew this was a huge mistake and how can I get out of it and I couldn‚Äôt,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúI tried to forget about it but now it‚Äôs starting to come up, and I figured you guys have to hear from me before you hear from anyone else. It‚Äôs crazy ‚Äôcause John doesn‚Äôt even know and here we talk about marriage and we never bring it up.‚Äù  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  Her family were not happy, especially Colace, who wondered why Bella didn‚Äôt think she could come to her.  But it was Garcia who showed the most anger, some of which was on behalf of Cena.  ‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs gonna be pissed. I‚Äôd be pissed for him if you hadn‚Äôt told him. ‚ÄòCause you talk about marriage all the time with him, don‚Äôt expect it to be easy,‚Äù Garcia said. ‚Äú[These things] really don‚Äôt just happen. You don‚Äôt just run off and get married and not tell your family for 10 years. That doesn‚Äôt just happen. You do what you got to do and I hope you figure it all out with John.‚Äù  It was Garcia who would accidentally spill the beans about the secret nuptial to Cena first, mentioning it at sister Brie‚Äôs 2014 wedding to her husband Daniel Bryan.  ‚ÄúI heard you‚Äôre handling everything awesome,‚Äù he told Cena. ‚ÄúFor her to tell you that she‚Äôs been married before and you had no problem with it, I have to give you kudos man.  Cena look flabbergasted but kept the conversation moving.  Later, Bella finally got the courage to say something to Cena herself.  Luckily, having gone through a divorce (to ex-wife Elizabeth Huberdeau in 2012 after three years of marriage), Cena was more understanding than anything. Still, as the two had been fighting about marriage ‚Äî with Cena reluctant to walk down the aisle again ‚Äî he encouraged Bella to be more honest with him.  ‚ÄúWhen the focus of most of our problems has to do with that particular topic, maybe I should know that stuff,‚Äù he told Bella. ‚ÄúI know how you feel. You‚Äôre a human being, so I know you want certain things. But I would especially know how you feel about it because you had a bad experience.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care,‚Äù Cena added. ‚ÄúWhat you did before you met me is what you did before you met me, I don‚Äôt need to know everything about you. It‚Äôs just when you can tell other people and I kind of would like to be on that totem pole somewhere ‚Äî I don‚Äôt have to be at the top ‚Ä¶ I just would like to be on it.‚Äù  Gary Miller/FilmMagic  Bella look relieved, though she said she did ‚Äúfeel bad‚Äù she didn‚Äôt tell Cena.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve realized that I need to start having confidence in my relationship with John and that he accepts me for all my faults,‚Äù she told the camera. ‚ÄúI am so relieved that John and I have made up and I‚Äôm just happy to be here with my family‚Ä¶ honestly, nothing can go wrong now. Everything is perfect.‚Äù  RELATED VIDEO: John Cena and Nikki Bella End Engagement Weeks Before Destination Wedding  Cena and Nikki announced that they called off their engagement Sunday, a year after he proposed during WrestleMania 33.  The couple, who were together for six years, were supposed to marry May 5 during their planned destination wedding.  An insider previously told PEOPLE she was the one who pulled the plug on their wedding.  ‚ÄúJohn acted more and more like he was doing her a favor by somehow conceding to go ahead and marry her,‚Äù the insider said. ‚Äú[Nikki] doesn‚Äôt need a pity proposal, a pity wedding, a pity husband. She‚Äôs a phenomenal, tremendous woman.‚Äù"
"However much Tom Hiddleston might be denying that his turn in the updated espionage thriller The Night Manager was his way of auditioning to be the next James Bond, it certainly seems fans are having none of it. Coral bookmakers in the U.K. had to suspend betting on the actor, The Guardian reports, after a huge bet launched the actor‚Äôs perceived chances from 2-1 to 1-2. Similarly, the Ireland-based independent bookmaker BoyleSports announced Sunday in a press release that they‚Äôd also been forced to suspend betting after Hiddleston‚Äôs support skyrocketed. It seems, regardless of what anyone claims, the world is really trying to will this casting decision into existence‚Äîand really, who can blame anyone for trying?  According to BoyleSports‚Äôs release, Hiddleston was the 6-4 favorite for them before the whirlwind of bets‚Äîincluding one four-figure online bet from the U.K. Hiddleston was his nearest rival at 5-2, followed by Idris Elba and Damian Lewis, who were tied at 5-1.  ‚ÄúJudging by the gamble on Tom Hiddleston we expect that it‚Äôs only a matter of days before he is announced as Daniel Craig‚Äôs replacement,‚Äù BoyleSports representative Liam Glynn said in the press release. That might be a little hyperbolic, and lacking in knowledge of how Hollywood business deals usually work, but it‚Äôs easy to see why Glynn is excited. Hiddleston speculation‚Äîand betting‚Äîhas been on the rise at least since March.  Earlier this month, Hiddleston delivered a typically charming deflection of the rumors he was being eyed as Bond on The Graham Norton Show. ‚ÄúI promise, no one‚Äôs talked to me about it,‚Äù he said with a chuckle. It‚Äôs not the first time he‚Äôs had to deny it, and it won‚Äôt be the last. But this particular surge probably springs from the fact that a ‚Äúsource‚Äù told the Daily Mail that Hiddleston had been spotted meeting with Bond director Sam Mendes. Mendes, for his part, has already said he‚Äôs really done with the franchise this time following Spectre. And of course, Hiddleston‚Äôs reps have already said the storied meeting was ‚Äúcompletely false.‚Äù  So, where does this leave Bond fans? Basically, right back where they started‚Äîwaiting to find out whether or not Daniel Craig is actually done with the role, and brainstorming all of his enticing potential replacements. Except, you know, with no bets for a little while.  Get Vanity Fair‚Äôs HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood. E-mail Address Subscribe"

"Sarah Jessica Parker is getting candid about her relationship with husband Matthew Broderick.  The 52-year-old actress appears on the latest episode of Girlboss Radio hosted by Sophia Amoruso, where she talks about her longtime marriage with Broderick. The two have been married for 20 years and share three kids together -- son James, and twin daughters Marion Loretta and Tabitha.  Parker says her and the 55-year-old Broderick's busy careers are actually beneficial to their marriage.  ""I know this sounds nuts, but we have lives that allow us to be away and come back together,"" she explains. ""His work life takes him here, and mine takes me there. In some ways, I think that that's been enormously beneficial because we have so much to share in a way... anytime that any relationship is hard, it's the point in which you're deciding, is this worth the investment getting through whatever that thing is?""  ""Relationships are hard. I always felt that I wanted to invest more,"" she continues. ""I love him, and I think he's brilliant. I'm sure I annoy him. He annoys me sometimes. I'm enormously proud of the person he is. I think the longer you can last, the more invested you just are.""  Later, Parker gets candid about how motherhood has changed her.  ""You're in a constant state of worrying about your children,"" she admits. ""It's very painful and it's exhilarating. It's a really interesting way of living in the world. I read books differently, or I look at parents and children on the subway differently. I hear music differently, or when I see something, I think, 'I wish Tabitha and Loretta were with me now and they could see this.' That's the good part.""  Of course, there have been a few hardships.  ""It's not for everybody, there's a lot that's really hard,"" she says bluntly. ""It's exhausting and you're basically just cleaning up after people all day. You're one big, good, old-fashioned secretary. All I do is organize people's lives and get them here and there and all that. It's what I wanted and with that, though, comes witnessing somebody hopefully develop into a really interesting, decent person who contributes something.""

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of ‚ÄúAmerican Idol,‚Äù the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on ‚ÄúLive with Kelly and Ryan‚Äù Thursday morning.  ‚ÄúIs it OK if I announce this big news?‚Äù talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting and waiting.‚Äù  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‚ÄòAmerican Idol,‚Äô‚Äù prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC‚Äôs morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host ‚ÄúLive with Kelly and Ryan‚Äù from New York, said he was ‚Äúvery, very excited‚Äù about reprising his ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program ‚ÄúOn Air With Ryan Seacrest‚Äù from Los Angeles.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs genuinely hard to put into words what ‚ÄòAmerican Idol‚Äô means to me,‚Äù Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it‚Äôs allowed me to experience.‚Äù  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.  The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.

"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav ‚Äî real name, William Drayton ‚Äî contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts ‚Äúto minimize his role in the Public Enemy business‚Äù over the years, while managers continued to exploit ‚Äúhis fame and persona to market the brand.‚Äù  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group‚Äôs business manager since 2008, and Clifton ‚ÄúGreg‚Äù Johnson, who was until recently Flav‚Äôs longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy‚Äôs image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo ‚Äúentered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.‚Äù Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, ‚ÄúNothing is Quick in the Desert,‚Äù available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  ‚ÄúDrayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,‚Äù the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  ‚ÄúHe had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,‚Äù the suit states.

"Phillip Faraone / WireImage  Selena Gomez is used to living a crazy life. Since debuting at Wizards of Waverly Place in 2007, she has been one of the most famous people in the world. In fact, she was forced to experience all her ups and downs with millions of viewers. This year was no exception. In the last twelve months alone, she has undergone a major operation, released new music and films, gone through a breakup ‚Äì and looked closely at the media. As Selena celebrates her 26th birthday today, we take some time to reflect on the highlights of her past year, with a timeline of her greatest moments. Through all this she has become stronger than ever. And yes, her fans never loved her again.  July 2017: During her month of birth, Selena released her latest single called ""Fetish"". Next to the song was a sexy video that focused on her lips. The official music video, directed by Petra Collins, was released later this month. The song reached # 27 climax on the Billboard Hot 100. On her 25th birthday, Selena had a solemn celebration with some of her closest friends and shared the event with her Instagram. Although the then friend The Weeknd was in Paris on their special day on tour, he allegedly flew in to celebrate with her. August 2017: August was a weak month for Selena. She was not often seen in public except for a delightful Disneyland date with her husband. The couple seemed to be very loved and was not afraid to show PDA in the amusement park.  September 2017: September comes with a great revelation: Selena reveals that she underwent a kidney transplant this summer because of her lupus. In a viral Instagram post, Selena wrote: ""I'm really looking forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these last months, as I always wanted to do with you."" She also thanked her kidney donor Francia Raisa, writing, ""She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me, and I'm incredibly blessed."" After a few months Selena jumped back into work and filmed the Woody Allen movie A Rainy Day in New York alongside Timoth√©e Chalamet. The film later became controversial due to allegations of sexual misconduct against Allen. He denies her. In response, Selena later stated that she would donate her salary for the Time's Up initiative. In addition, Selena was a cover star for Time Magazine and celebrated her first-person achievement reaching 100 million followers on Instagram.October 2017: October drew attention to Selena's private life as she went through a public disconnect and make-up. At the end of October, it was reported that Justin Bieber was discovered when she brought Los Angeles home. Although we did not jump to conclusions about the nature of their rekindled relationship, speculation grew as Selena announced her breakup with The Weeknd. Soon after, Justin and Selena began spending more time together. In addition to her love life, her single was released with Marshmello ""Wolves"" and climbed into the charts. In addition, the fans were happy when she met at the InStyle Awards with her old friend Demi Lovato.  Vasquez-Max Lopes / BACKGRID  November 2017: Jelena started November with a bang. The couple was discovered on a bike ride through Los Angeles and did little to deny love rumors. The couple began spending more time together, confirming speculation with a kiss on Justin's hockey game. In addition to her new romance, Selena wore a new look and colored her famous dark curls Platinum Blonde for her performance at the AMA Awards. December 2017: End the year right! Selena became Billboard's Wife of the Year and gave an informative interview where she talked about her mental health struggles, her kidney transplant and her relationships. Selena crowned 2017 in Cabo San Lucas with friends, with Justin joining her to the New Year. January 2018: Selena started with a breather in 2018. She traveled to her home state of Texas and visited her parents' home. She thought about what might have been written, ""I visit this place on every occasion I get, in many ways it could have been better today than it does today, but I'm grateful for a voice that can make change today possible I do not know how to do it or really want it, I love you, Grand Prairie, thank you. ""In her month of reflection, she embarked on a two-week program of anxiety and depression. February 2018: A month of public love for Selena and Justin! The couple seemed to get strong as they traveled together, made out at a concert and attended his father's wedding in Jamaica.  March 2018: On the first day of the month, Selena released her first Instagram of Justin in over five years. She rang the bell on her 24th birthday with a photo of her and a Polaroid script, ""March 1, 1994, someone I know who happens to be super cool, was born."" Boom. "" Just a few days after her posting, it was reported that the couple was taking a break from their romance. Selena traveled to Australia for a Hillsong Conference Solo. In addition, her separation from ""The Weeknd"" with the release of his new album, which many speculated about, was recapitulated through Selena. April 2018: April was a month of activism for Selena. She shared her support for the March For Our Lives movement by posting on Instagram and attending a rally. She also attended her 6th WE Day in Los Angeles and made a speech to raise awareness of kidney disease.  Marion Curtis / StarPix / REX / Shutterstock  May 2018: Selena was in the limelight again in her most public month! She began the month participating in the MET Gala, where she later laughed at criticism of her appearance. Selena had professional prizes when the second season of 13 Reasons Why, the show she produced, was released on Netflix. Her song ""Back To You"" on the soundtrack of the show became a breakout hit. The singer surprised fans on the reputation tour with his close friend Taylor Swift. The friends performed ""Hands To Myself"" in front of 60,000 spectators in Los Angeles. June 2018: Selena collaborated again with Petra Collins to release the music video for ""Back To You"". The video showed a one-and-two pair, which led the fans to believe that it was possibly based on their relationship with Justin. The most rewarding part of her month came when Selena enchanted the promo for the Orange County Children's Hospital for pictures with fans.  July 2018: Selena celebrates July 4th holiday with David Henrie, co-star of Wizards of Waverly Place, who posted stunning photos on Instagram and wrote: ""Hope, everyone had a great 4th of July! Played with some of my favorite people . "" Release of Hotel Transylvania 3 was a great success as it exceeded the box office. Perhaps the most shocking thing this month was Justin's engagement with Hailey Baldwin. However, Selena did not seem to be affected by the news as she was happily spotted spending time with friends and making a new movie in New York State. It's not yet clear how the star will ring in her 26th birthday, but after this crazy year she definitely deserves a party.  Do not miss E!

"Lindsey Vonn Wins Bronze Medal In Downhill At Pyeongchang Winter Olympics  Enlarge this image toggle caption Tom Pennington/Getty Images Tom Pennington/Getty Images  U.S. skiing star Lindsey Vonn turned in a time that was a half-second off the lead in the downhill Wednesday in South Korea, fast enough to win a medal in her final downhill race of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics ‚Äì and almost certainly the last of her Olympic career. It's the third Olympic medal overall for Vonn.  ""It was tough to contemplate this being my last Olympic downhill,"" Vonn said afterward. ""I struggled to try to keep the emotions together, but I left it all on the mountain like I said I would.""  ""I gave it all today, skied a great race. Sofia just skied better than I did,"" Vonn said, referring to the top finisher, Italy's Sofia Goggia.  ""I thought I executed the line really well on the whole course, perhaps too well,"" Vonn said. ""I tried too hard to stay on the perfect line. But I have no regrets.""  Enlarge this image toggle caption Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images  Going into today's race, Vonn, 33, was already the most decorated female skier of all time. She put together a solid run, having trouble in only one section in the middle of the downhill course at Jeongseon Alpine Center in Pyeongchang.  Starting seventh in the field of 39 racers, Vonn hit speeds of nearly 70 mph as she scorched down the mountain. Vonn's time of 1:39.69 put her 0.47 behind Italiy's Sofia Goggia, who won the gold medal after being the fifth skier to race.  As she waited to see where she would place, Vonn said, that she was optimistic about getting on the podium, ""but anything can happen as you could see from the super-G, but there's no snowboarders in the race this time"" ‚Äî a reference to the Czech dual-sport athlete Ester Ledecka, who came out of nowhere to win the women's Super-G race.  One after another skier flew down the hill, and it seemed as if Vonn's time might put a silver medal around her neck. But then Norway's Ragnhild Mowinckel blistered past the American to take silver, only 0.09 behind the leader.  The downhill course for Wednesday's race had 38 gates, with a vertical drop of 2,395 feet over a length of 9,104 feet.  In her Olympics career, Vonn had previously won two medals ‚Äì a gold in the downhill and a bronze in the Super-G. She won both of those medals at the 2010 Vancouver Games, when she became the only American woman ever to have won gold in the Olympics' downhill.  Vonn has coped with a string of serious injuries in her career, including surgery on her knee ‚Äî which she then reinjured, forcing her to opt out of the 2014 Sochi Games.  Today's race did not include Mikaela Shiffrin, the 22-year-old American skier who won gold in the giant slalom earlier at these Olympics. Shiffrin had initially planned to race in the downhill, but she opted out after scheduling changes due to weather stacked her events too close to one another.  Both Vonn and Shiffrin, who won gold in the slalom as an 18-year-old in Sochi, plan to race in the alpine combined in South Korea. Scheduled for Thursday, the event includes two races, the downhill and slalom ‚Äî the same disciplines in which these two talented American skiers have previously won gold medals.  Barring a miracle comeback, this is almost certainly the last Olympics for Vonn, whose pro career includes a streak of dominance from 2007 to 2012, when she mixed four overall championships with one second-place finish. In an even longer streak, she was the No. 1 women's skier in the downhill for eight years, from the 2007/2008 season to 2015/2016."

"Kelly Dodd shocked her castmates when she called Shannon Beador a certain expletive during Meghan King Edmonds' last hurrah in the latest episode of The Real Housewives of Orange County. But believe it or not, the newbie told The Daily Dish earlier this summer that she wasn't all that bothered when she initially found out about Shannon's friend Nina's comments at the '70s party.  But her husband Michael Dodd and her new friend Vicki Gunvalson saw the situation differently, telling Kelly that regardless of the fact that she was never a prostitute, people might still think it's true if the rumor gets out there. ""It got me really angry,"" Kelly said (clip above). ""I'm thinking to myself, 'OK, how could I ever be a prostitute? I got married when I was 25 to my first husband. I went to college. I worked for Gannett newspapers. Like, how could this ever happen to me, because I've worked my whole life and had a professional job.

"Incensed over Donna Karan‚Äôs defense of Harvey Weinstein, Megyn Kelly laid into the fashion designer on Tuesday‚Äôs episode of Megyn Kelly TODAY, declaring that she‚Äôs ‚Äúdone with Donna Karan‚Äù while also inviting her on the program.  ‚ÄúDonna Karan, in the wake of the disturbing allegations about famed movie producer Harvey Weinstein allegedly harassing several women, used the power of her voice to attack women,‚Äù said Kelly, 46, who famously leveled sexual harassment claims against her former Fox News boss, the late Roger Ailes, in her 2016 book, Settle for More. ‚ÄúIn an interview with the DailyMail.com on the red carpet Sunday night, Karan was asked about Harvey Weinstein, who she described as a wonderful person. And then she went on to raise what she apparently considers to be the burning question here: Are women who are getting harassed ‚Äòasking for it‚Äô?‚Äù  After playing a clip of the comments ‚Äî for which Karan has since apologized, telling the Associated Press they are ‚Äúnot representative of how I feel or what I believe‚Äù ‚Äî Kelly turned the focus to her interview with one of Weinstein‚Äôs accusers, TV journalist Lauren Sivan, who on Monday‚Äôs episode told Kelly about her ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù experience with Weinstein. ‚ÄúWeirdly, I never thought to ask Lauren whether her skirt brought on that [restuarant] vestibule incident because her outfit is totally irrelevant ‚Äî and most rational people know that,‚Äù said Kelly.  Questioning Karan‚Äôs statement, Kelly challenged her ‚Äúwrong‚Äù thinking: ‚ÄúThere are laws in this country. Laws. I don‚Äôt give a damn if a woman shows up in a bikini to the office. That doesn‚Äôt invite or make it okay for her superior to harass her. It makes it okay for her boss to say, ‚ÄòGo home and change.‚Äô That‚Äôs it. The truth is sexual harassment has nothing to do with wardrobe; it has to do with power and control and sexual proclivities that a superior chooses not to reign in. How insulting, by the way, to men, as well? Like they are a bunch of animals who cannot behave themselves if a woman shows part of her thigh, right? This attitude of blaming women for their own harassment is actually one of the reasons women choose not to come forward after they get harassed because they fear victim shaming.‚Äù  Kelly continued: ‚ÄúHow about we not pile on, Donna? How about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices, despite the risks and to stand up for themselves ‚Äî which is hard enough, without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their fashion choices.‚Äù  Then came Kelly‚Äôs kicker: ‚ÄúAnd speaking of fashion choices, here‚Äôs one for you: I‚Äôm done with Donna Karan.‚Äù  Despite her dismissive message, Kelly invited Karan on the show for ‚Äúan honest discussion about how [Karan] really feels,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúIf she‚Äôs really sorry, if she really was taken out of context, if she really doesn‚Äôt believe that way, explain those comments.‚Äù  With her comments Tuesday, Kelly joined a growing list of celebrities speaking out against Weinstein, whose scandal erupted following an Oct. 5 New York Times expos√© alleging the movie mogul has been sexually harassing women for three decades. Weinstein has since been fired by The Weinstein Company and apologized for ‚Äúthe way I‚Äôve behaved with colleagues in the past‚Äù in a statement to the Times. On Tuesday, a report posted by the New Yorker alleged more sexual misconduct claims, including assault, against Weinstein, which he also denied.  Watch Kelly‚Äôs segment in the video above.

"The MTV Movie & TV Awards has always been known for its star-studded attendees and hilariously shocking moments. With the 2018 awards show just around the corner, we‚Äôre looking back at some of the best.  From Sacha Baron Cohen arriving from the heavens like an angel, to that iconic Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling Notebook-esque kiss, to Emma Watson winning the first ever non-gendered acting award, here are some of our favourite moments from MTV Movie & TV Awards over the years.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams recreate their iconic kiss from The Notebook  In one of the most iconic moments in possibly all awards show history ever, nothing compares to Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams both on- and off-screen chemistry when they recreated their famous rain kiss from The Notebook while accepting Best Kiss during the 2005 show. Making our teenage hearts swoon, Ryan and Rachel 4eva.  That Scarlett Johansson and Sandra Bullock lip-lock  As it turns out, Britney Spears isn‚Äôt the only artist to show her love for a fellow star as award winner Sandra Bullock followed in her MTV stage footsteps, planting a smooch on presenter Scarlett Johansson back in 2010.  Emma Watson winning the first non-gendered acting award  At last year‚Äôs show, non-binary actor Asia Kate Dillon made history last year when she presented Emma Watson with the first-ever non-gendered acting award for her role as Belle in Disney‚Äôs live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast.  Sacha Baron Cohen flew across the audience as an angel and landed on an unimpressed Eminem  In true Bruno fashion, Sacha Baron Cohen might have taken things a little too far at the 2009 awards when he flew across the audience as an angel before descending on rapper Eminem butt-first. The rapper stormed off leaving a string of expletives in his wake only to later reveal that he was in on the joke (he could have fooled us).  Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson‚Äôs missed kisses  At the 2011 MTV Movie & TV Awards, Kristin Stewart and Robert Pattinson won their third consecutive Best Kiss award. Fondly remembering their missed kisses after winning the award in 2009 and 2010, viewers thought (and hoped) by 2011 the duo would finally seal the deal. Instead, Pattinson ran into the audience for a lip-lock with their Twilight third wheel Taylor Lautner.  Adam Devine parodies Beauty and the Beast with Hailee Steinfeld  MTV‚Äôs golden popcorn doesn‚Äôt have quite the same recognition as a golden statue, but those award ceremonies aren‚Äôt filled with nearly as many fun and memorable moments. Case in point, last year‚Äôs opening musical number which saw host Adam Devine parody Disney‚Äôs Beauty and the Beast with singer/actress Hailee Steinfeld.  Jennifer Lopez and Tom Cruise‚Äîdressed as Tropic Thunder‚Äôs Les Grossman‚Äîperform together  In one of the most unexpected moments, Tom Cruise made an appearance at the 2010 awards show as his obnoxious Tropic Thunder character Les Grossman. Cruise joined JLo on stage for her hit ‚ÄúGet Right‚Äù in a hilariously raunchy performance. Who knew Tommy Boy could dance like that.  When Lindsay Lohan hosted the 2005 award show  After all these years, we‚Äôve always held out for Lindsay Lohan. Hot off the success of Mean Girls and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, Lohan hosted the 2005 MTV Movie & TV Awards where she surprisingly broke out into a choreographed dance routine during the show‚Äîback in the day when musical numbers weren‚Äôt award show staples.  Rita Ora ripping off Zac Efron‚Äôs shirt  Boundaries aren‚Äôt a thing at the MTV Movie & TV Awards. This was most evident at the 2014 show when Rita Ora made like a Magic Mike extra and ripped off Zac Efron‚Äôs shirt. But, to be fair, you can‚Äôt really win an award for Best Shirtless Performance with a shirt on‚Ä¶  Seth Rogan and James Franco pulled out a joint while promoting Pineapple Express  In 2008, Seth Rogen and James Franco puff-puff-passed a blunt on the MTV Movie & TV Awards stage while promoting Pineapple Express. They also pulled out a baggie of weed saying they only smoked ‚Äúfake weed‚Äù while shooting the film, earning raised eyebrows and laughs from the audience.  Aubrey Plaza attempting to pull a Kanye on Will Ferrell  Possibly the most cringe-worthy moment to date, Aubrey Plaza attempted to pull a Kanye on Will Ferrell when she jumped on stage and tried to take the golden popcorn from his hands in 2013. The moment was entirely unplanned and left a confused Ferrell asking ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening?‚Äù and ‚ÄúAre you OK?‚Äù Plaza was kicked out of the awards show shortly after for the stunt.  When Reese Witherspoon called out reality stars in her Generation Award acceptance speech  When Reese Witherspoon accepted the 2011 Generation Award, she took her title as an ‚ÄúMTV Elder‚Äù very seriously, using her acceptance speech to offer advice to the younger generation. Witherspoon said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs possible to make it in Hollywood without a reality show. When I came up in this business if you made a sex tape you were embarrassed, you hid it under your bed.‚Äù We‚Äôre certain the Kardashians felt the icy cold wrath of Tracy Flick from miles away.  Tune in to the 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards hosted by comedian Tiffany Haddish on Monday, June 18 at 9 p.m. ET on Much and MTV Canada."

Platt played the magic-obsessed Benji Applebaum, alongside an ensemble cast including Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp and Brittany Snow. The film emerged as a major commercial success and received mostly positive reviews from critics. He was subsequently nominated at a Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Movie: Male Scene Stealer for his work.[15] In 2015, Platt reprised his role as Benji Applebaum in the sequel, Pitch Perfect 2. He has since made subsequent film appearances in Ricki and the Flash and Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.  Dear Evan Hansen [ edit ]  Platt became attached to Pasek and Paul's then Untitled P&P Project in 2014, participating in early read-throughs and workshops.[16] By 2015, the musical, titled Dear Evan Hansen, had begun production in Washington, D.C. at the Arena Stage with Platt originating the titular role. The show premiered on July 9, 2015 and closed August 23, 2015.[17] The overwhelming positive reception toward the production and Platt's performance resulted in the show being transferred to Off-Broadway.[18]  In 2016, Platt, again, originated the role of Evan Hansen at Second Stage Theatre. Platt and the cast played a month of previews, beginning on March 26, 2016, before premiering on May 1, 2016. The limited engagement sold out its entire run with Platt playing his last performance on May 26, 2016.[19][20][21]  Ben Platt in 2017.  In December 2016, Platt originated the title role in Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre. Critics hailed his work, calling it ""historic"" and ""one of the greatest leading male performances ever seen in a musical"".[22][23][24] For his performance, Platt won numerous awards including the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Platt played his final performance on November 19, 2017.[25]  On November 29, 2018, it was announced that Universal Pictures and Platt's father, Marc Platt, secured the film rights to the musical. It is unconfirmed if Platt will reprise his Tony Award-winning role in the film, but is reported to be in ""early talks"" to do so.[26][27]  Recent and upcoming projects [ edit ]  In 2017 Platt signed a record deal with Atlantic Records.[28] On January 28, 2018, Platt performed Leonard Bernstein's ""Somewhere"" live at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards accompanied by Justin Goldner and Adele Stein and arranged by Alex Lacamoire[29][30]  On March 19, 2018, Platt and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda released ""Found/Tonight"", a mashup of the Hamilton song ""The Story of Tonight"" and the Dear Evan Hansen song ""You Will Be Found"".[31] Platt donated a portion of the proceeds to support the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence initiative, and also performed on stage with Miranda at the rally in Washington, D.C. on March 24, 2018.[32][33][34]  Platt is set to star opposite Damian Lewis, Nina Dobrev, and Mena Massoud in the Rob Ford historical fiction thriller Run This Town.[35][36] The casting of Platt caused minor controversy, over allegations that the filmmakers were appropriating the story of female reporter Robyn Doolittle.[37]  Theatre credits [ edit ]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]  Dear Evan Hansen cast member Platt andcast member Rachel Bay Jones with their Tony Awards.  Platt was nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award.[43] and also won an Obie Award in 2016.[44] He won the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Musical, both for the show's Off-Broadway run.[45]  On May 19, 2017, at the 83rd annual Drama League Awards, it was announced that Platt had won the organization's Distinguished Performance Award. This award, which recognizes a performance on the New York stage in the past year, can only be won once in a performer's career. In winning, at the age of 23, for his work in Dear Evan Hansen, Platt became the youngest winner in the award's history.[46] On June 11, at the 71st Tony Awards, Platt won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical.[47]  Notes [ edit ]"

"Jerry Lewis, the brash slapstick comic who became a pop culture sensation in his partnership with Dean Martin and then transformed himself into an auteur filmmaker of such comedic classics as ‚ÄúThe Nutty Professor‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Bellboy,‚Äù has died in Las Vegas. He was 91.  Lewis died at his home in Las Vegas at about 9:15 a.m. Sunday morning, his agent confirmed.  For most of his career, Lewis was a complicated and sometimes polarizing figure. An undeniable comedic genius, he pursued a singular vision and commanded a rare amount of creative control over his work with Paramount Pictures and other studios. His legacy also includes more than $2.5 billion raised for the Muscular Dystrophy Association through the annual Labor Day telethon that he made an end-of-summer ritual for decades until he was relieved of the hosting job in 2011.  But Lewis‚Äô brand of humor did not always wear well as times and attitudes changed. Over the last 10 years of his life, his reputation soured slightly as he was forced to apologize for making a gay slur on camera during the 2007 telethon, continued to make racist and misogynistic jokes, and didn‚Äôt hesitate to share his right-wing political views.  Related Hollywood Pays Tribute to ‚ÄòComedic Icon‚Äô Jerry Lewis: ‚ÄòOne of the Greatest of All Time‚Äô Jerry Lewis‚Äô Life and Career in Photos Celebrities Who Died in 2017 Jerry Lewis Plays a Wistful Jazz Pianist in ‚ÄòMax Rose‚Äô Trailer  In addition to his most famous films, Lewis also appeared in a number of notable works, such as Martin Scorsese‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe King of Comedy,‚Äù but was largely offscreen from the late ‚Äô60s on and was more active with his telethon and philanthropic efforts. As late as 2016, Lewis continued to perform in Las Vegas, where he first debuted his comedy routine back in 1949.  The high regard in which his comic abilities were held in France ‚Äî he received the Legion of Honor award in 1983 ‚Äî became a running joke in the U.S. long after Lewis‚Äô style of broad physical comedy fell out of fashion. His final film, ‚ÄúMax Rose,‚Äù screened at France‚Äôs Cannes Film Festival in 2013.  The telethon, like other aspects of Lewis‚Äô life, was beset by controversy. The comic‚Äôs offstage persona was anything but humorous. He was, by his own admission, an impatient man, and over the years battled numerous illnesses and a prescription drug dependency. His parting with Martin in 1956 after 10 years as a duo was acrimonious. And the telethons were awash in claims that there was a disparity between the money pledged and the money collected.  Lewis‚Äô pairing with Martin, featuring their improvisatory backbiting and physical chicanery, was an instant hit in 1946. When producer Hal Wallis saw them performing at the Copacabana and at Slapsie Maxie‚Äôs in Hollywood, he saw the potential for a new Bob Hope and Bing Crosby and signed them to a Paramount Pictures contract.  For the next 10 years, Martin and Lewis turned out one silly film after the next starting with ‚ÄúMy Friend Irma‚Äù in 1949 and including ‚ÄúThe Caddy,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Stooge,‚Äù ‚ÄúArtists and Models‚Äù and ‚ÄúPardners.‚Äù None of their films grossed less than $5 million, a handy sum in those days.  The premises of the films grew tired, and the more Martin and Lewis worked together, the more disparate they appeared. In 1956, after their film ‚ÄúHollywood or Bust,‚Äù they made their last dual appearance at the Copacabana.  By the time of their breakup, Martin had a prosperous career as a recording artist and actor. And soon Lewis, too, was a hot solo ticket.  Shortly after they broke up, Lewis filled in for an ailing Judy Garland in Las Vegas. Over the next five years Lewis developed a slicker, more sophisticated stage persona and would continue to play Vegas until 2016.  Onscreen he made a go of it in such films as ‚ÄúThe Delicate Delinquent‚Äù and ‚ÄúRock-a-Bye Baby.‚Äù Lewis even had a million-selling single in the ‚ÄúRock-a-Bye Your Baby‚Äù title track, which led to several albums on Decca Records.  He then extended his efforts into writing, producing and directing films, signing what was then a mammoth $10 million deal with Paramount. The first two, 1961‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Ladies Man‚Äù and 1962‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Errand Boy,‚Äù showed him at his best. His talents also dovetailed with director Frank Tashlin‚Äôs style in films such as ‚ÄúCinderfella‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Disorderly Orderly.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe Nutty Professor‚Äù (1963) was his biggest success ever, grossing $19 million. But by then his mugging and exaggerated body gyrations had become out of control, as had the syrupy moments in his films.  Lewis signed a nonexclusive deal with Columbia that resulted in several uninspired films such as ‚ÄúThree on a Couch,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Big Mouth‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Raise the Bridge, Lower the River.‚Äù Even Lewis had to admit, ‚ÄúJerry Lewis is never just OK or adequate; he‚Äôs either very funny or he‚Äôs awful.‚Äù  While Americans largely dismissed him, Lewis had developed a following at French film journals Cahiers du Cinema and Positif.  He was born Joseph Levitch in Newark, N.J. Both his parents were in show business and, at the age of 5, Lewis made his debut at a Borscht Belt hotel singing ‚ÄúBrother Can You Spare a Dime?‚Äù  Perhaps because his parents spent a great deal of time on the road, Lewis was demanding attention through humor by the time he was attending Irvington High School in New Jersey. By age 15 he was pantomiming operatic and popular songs and was booked into a burlesque house in Buffalo.  In 1942 he tried out his comic pantomiming at Brown‚Äôs Hotel in upstate New York, where he was also working the summer as a bellboy. Comic Irving Kaye was sufficiently impressed to land Lewis some bookings and became his road manager.  Lewis met the young singer Dean Martin at New York nightclub the Glass Hatt and was first paired with him in 1946. Afters years of rupture, Martin made a surprise appearance on the Muscular Dystrophy Telethon in 1976, a reunion orchestrated by their mutual friend Frank Sinatra. The pair also reconciled after the death of Martin‚Äôs son in the late 1980s. Martin died in 1995.  In the early ‚Äô70s he continued to direct uninspired fare such as ‚ÄúWhich Way to the Front?‚Äù and then tried a serious film, ‚ÄúThe Day the Clown Cried,‚Äù though he famously shelved the completed work (some footage of it finally surfaced in 2013). He attempted a live TV variety show that failed, as did an attempt at a Broadway musical, ‚ÄúFeeling No Pain‚Äù; it was followed by the acrimonious ‚ÄúHellzapoppin,‚Äù which was ditched out of town in Boston at a loss of $1.25 million.  In 1972 he lent his name to a string of 200 movie theaters for Network Cinema Corp., which led to bankruptcy proceedings in 1974. His heavy schedule also brought him to the verge of a nervous breakdown, serious ulcer problems and painkiller drug dependency. In 1982 he had double-bypass heart surgery and gave up his four pack-a-day smoking habit.  Lewis was offscreen until 1979‚Äôs low-budget ‚ÄúHardly Working,‚Äù which he also directed; it did not reverse his fortunes. But in 1982, director Martin Scorsese harnessed the brash, cynical side of Lewis‚Äô persona for the role of a kidnapped latenight talkshow host in ‚ÄúThe King of Comedy.‚Äù Though he reportedly resented being upstaged by Robert De Niro and Sandra Bernhard, the film represented some of Lewis‚Äô finest work. Another high point was a similarly caustic appearance as a lethal underworld figure on the TV series ‚ÄúWiseguy.‚Äù  Most of his later film work, however, failed to impress, such as ‚ÄúSlapstick of Another Kind,‚Äù ‚ÄúCookie‚Äù and 1992‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Dreamer.‚Äù  In 1995, he appeared in Peter Chelsom‚Äôs film ‚ÄúFunny Bones‚Äù and took over the role of the devil in a Broadway revival of ‚ÄúDamn Yankees,‚Äù which he took on tour in the U.S.; he then appeared in a London production of the musical.  In 2003 he provided a guest voice on an episode of ‚ÄúThe Simpsons‚Äù; in 2006 he did an episode of ‚ÄúLaw and Order: SVU‚Äù in which he played the insane, morally befuddled but bizarrely benevolent uncle of Det. John Munch (Richard Belzer).  Lewis long sought to create a sequel to ‚ÄúThe Nutty Professor‚Äù; eventually, Imagine Entertainment produced and Universal released the 1996 remake starring Eddie Murphy on which Lewis was credited for the screenplay to the 1963 version and as an executive producer.  Lewis also hoped to bring a musical adaptation of ‚ÄúThe Nutty Professor‚Äù to Broadway. By summer 2012 an ailing but still enthusiastic Lewis made his stage helming debut with such a musical, with a score by Marvin Hamlisch and a book and lyrics by Rupert Holmes, in Nashville, where it played for seven weeks.  In 2013 Lewis starred in the long-gestating project ‚ÄúMax Rose,‚Äù written and directed by Daniel Noah and also starring Claire Bloom, Kevin Pollak, Kerry Bishe and Mort Sahl. Lewis played a jazz pianist who recently became a widower.  In 2009, Lewis received the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences‚Äô Jean Hersholt Award for his charitable work. In May 2014, he added his footprints to those of other screen luminaries at the Chinese Theatre.  In 1944 Lewis married former band singer Patti Palmer, with whom he had six sons, Gary, Ronnie, Scott, Anthony, Christopher and Joseph, who died in 2009. Gary for a time had a rock career as the lead singer of Gary Lewis & the Playboys. The marriage ended in divorce.  He is survived by his second wife, SanDee Pitnick, with whom he adopted a daughter."

"Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber take off on private jet together  The pop stars are heading out of town.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber looked cute and cozy over the weekend when they were spotted boarding a private jet together at the Van Nuys airport in California on Saturday, Dec. 16, 2017. In photos shared by TMZ, the ""Wolves"" singer, who recently announced that her new album will drop ""very soon,"" was bundled up in a black coat. Meanwhile, Bieber sported jeans and kept warm in a multi-colored jacket.  The ""Boyfriend"" hitmaker smiled and Gomez kept her head down as the two walked alongside their pilot, pulling their carry-on luggage behind them. As the gossip rag noted, ""they're packed for at least a few days."" TMZ later reported that the two had landed in Seattle, Wash., before hitting up the Sugar Factory on Saturday evening for what looked to be a super sweet date night.  As Nicki Swift previously reported, Gomez, 25, and Bieber, 23, dated on and off between 2011 and 2014, before spiraling into a turbulent breakup. However, the infamous exes appeared to finally make peace with one another after Gomez opened up about her kidney transplant earlier this fall. Since then, the two have been spotted together multiple times, following the ""Bad Liar"" singer's split from The Weeknd in October.  But that doesn't necessarily mean they're officially back together. As rumors of their supposed rekindled romance continue to swirl, the ""Sorry"" singer is reportedly determined to prove himself to his former girlfriend. ""Justin and Selena are great. They still spend a lot of time together, but are being low-key about it,"" an insider told People. ""They attend church service together, have dinner and just hang out.""  ""[Justin] is set on proving that he is a better boyfriend,"" the source continued. However, that may be difficult, as the Disney Channel star's family are reportedly ""still getting comfortable"" with the two spending so much time together. ""Justin's family always loved Selena, but Selena's family is still not happy about her seeing Justin,"" the insider went on. ""Selena doesn't bring Justin to any family events. Selena is spending Christmas with her family. As of now, Justin is not invited.""  While we wait to hear more about their supposed romantic getaway, read up on what's really going on between Bieber and Gomez."
"The marriage between Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston really is over.  On Thursday night, the actor and actress released a joint statement confirming that they were going their separate ways after two years as husband and wife.  Before delving into various details concerning this stunning break-up, let's take another look at this statement.  It reads as follows:  In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation.  This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.  Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else‚Äôs fictional narrative.  Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.  While this news took us by surprise, many tabloids have actually been calling it for months.  Before the Aniston-Brad Pitt reconciliation rumors start in earnest (What? It's too late for that?), we figured we'd go deep into this likely divorce.  What brought it about? How did Aniston and Theroux try to salvage their romance? Where does each go from here?  This is what we've been able to dig up thus far, courtesy of various outlets on the Internet...  Us Weekly: To kick off 2018, Anison and Theroux took a vacation in Cabo San Lucas with Jason Bateman and his wife, Amanda Anka.  According to magazine insiders, Amanda had been trying to work as a ""mediator"" between Aniston and Theroux for months, hoping to help them iron out all problems.  She talked Justin into going on this vacation.  ‚ÄúThe Cabo trip was a make or break vacation for Jen and Justin,"" writes Us Weekly. ""They went away with their friends hoping to have fun and work on it.‚Äù  Alas, the plan failed, this source laments, saying the guys simply hung out together and the women hung out together.  Radar Online: But what caused the actual tension between the stars that prompted this trip in the first place?  Both Entertainment Tonight and Radar cite distance as a key factor.  Theroux spent more of his time in New York for work and Aniston in Los Angeles. In some ways, it was as simple as this.  After spending about two months apart toward the end of last year, an anonymous insider tells this website that the pair had a major argument in their Bel-Air mansion on December 14.  Shortly after this blow-up, Radar alleges Aniston started to ""lean hard"" on ex-boyfriend Gerard Butler, stirring up further jealousy and animosity between her and her husband.  It didn't help, meanwhile, that Theroux is known as a ""flirt"" when it comes to his co-stars.  Entertainment Tonight: It wasn't mere distance that drove Aniston and Theroux apart, it was how much he loved New York and how much she hated it there.  Sources tell this outlet that paparazzi attention was a major source of contention for them in The Big Apple.  ""It made for an awkward living situation for Jen and Justin because they knew the neighbors weren't happy"" about all the reporters outside their building at all times, ET writes.  ""The tension came to a head in what the source refers to as ""the bologna incident,"" explains one insider, who says Theroux once came downstairs to find that someone had covered his motorcycle in slices of bologna.  For real! Reportedly!  Aniston thought it was one of their neighbors who did it.  Aniston and Theroux do not have any children, which makes their split less messy.  Multiple outlets also confirm they do have an iron-clad prenuptial agreement.  Jennifer is the mega rich star between the tandem, considering all the money she has banked from Friends, and Us Weekly writes that these assets are well ""protected.""  The estranged couple started to date in 2011 and got married in May of 2015.  We still can't believe they're over.  And we also can't believe Aniston will soon be back together with Pitt! You know it's happening!"

"A body found Thursday night is that of missing Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison, police in Scotland confirmed Friday. The body was discovered about 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday (12:30 p.m. PT) in Port Edgar, Queensferry, just west of Edinburgh, the Scottish capital.  No official cause of death was given. A statement from Hutchison‚Äôs family, issued Friday afternoon by Police Scotland, said the singer had been struggling with mental health problems.  ‚ÄúAs a family, we are utterly devastated with the tragic loss of our beloved Scott,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúDespite his disappearance, and the recent concerns over his mental health, we had all remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself. Scott, like many artists, wore his heart on his sleeve and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts.‚Äù  The family said Hutchison had ‚Äúbattled bravely with his own issues‚Äù for many years. ‚ÄúDepression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúWe are immensely proud of [Scott] for being so open with his struggles. His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.‚Äù  The 36-year-old singer and guitarist was reported missing early Wednesday, and was last seen near the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry. Hutchison had issued a tweet Tuesday night referring to his life in the past tense: ‚ÄúBe so good to everyone you love‚Ä¶.I didn‚Äôt live by that standard and it kills me.‚Äù Twenty minutes later, his final, poignant tweet simply said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm away now. Thanks.‚Äù  Be so good to everyone you love. It‚Äôs not a given. I‚Äôm so annoyed that it‚Äôs not. I didn‚Äôt live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones. ‚Äî Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  I‚Äôm away now. Thanks. ‚Äî Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  Hutchison‚Äôs family was informed of the discovery of the body, and formal identification took place Friday.  Hutchison formed Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit in 2003. The group‚Äôs first studio album, 2006‚Äôs ‚ÄúSing the Greys,‚Äù featured just Hutchison and his brother Grant, who is the band‚Äôs drummer. Their most recent, fifth album, ‚ÄúPainting of a Panic Attack,‚Äù was released in 2016 on Atlantic Records.  The band also includes Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. On Wednesday, the group tweeted: ‚ÄúWe are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now.‚Äù  We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now.

Please could Scott or anyone with any information on his whereabouts please contact Police Scotland (101). ‚Äî Frightened Rabbit (@FRabbits) May 9, 2018  News of the body‚Äôs discovery prompted tributes from other Scottish musicians, including Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos and Belle and Sebastian singer Stuart Murdoch.  Kapranos tweeted that Hutchison‚Äôs death was ‚Äúa terrible loss.‚Äù Murdoch said the Scottish music community had been praying for a different outcome and encouraged anyone ‚Äúhaving dark thoughts‚Äù to talk to family, friends or a doctor.  Irish rock band Snow Patrol said they were devastated to hear the news about their friend.  Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was ‚Äúheartbreaking news,‚Äù calling Hutchison ‚Äúa remarkable and much loved talent.‚Äù  Awful news about Scott Hutchison.

"Robert Pattinson on 'Twilight' Experience: 'It's All Fond Memories'  Email Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin  It looks like Robert Pattinson is looking back at his ""Twilight"" experience with a positive light.  On Monday, Robert Pattinson was in attendance for the 27th Annual IFP Gotham Awards in New York City where he was nominated for his new film ""Good Time."" But before he headed straight for the prestigious event, the 31-year-old actor lounged around the red carpet and dished about his experiences with an entirely different film: The ""Twilight"" saga.  It had been five years since the final ""Twilight"" film had been released, ""Twilight: Breaking Dawn Part Two,"" and in an interview with E! News, the actor was reminded of this event and he could only share how ""amazing"" of an experience it was for him to be involved in such a film.  ""It's all fond memories,"" Pattinson remarked about filming the ""Twilight"" movies. ""I mean it's almost more fond the further away you get from it ... it's just such a magical way to spend your 20s.""  ""I mean it's completely crazy. I still haven't really processed it. I mean I always thought that there'd be more of a fallout‚Äîa psychological fallout years later,"" the actor adds.  His remarks about the film come just a week after his ex-girlfriend and fellow ""Twilight"" star Kristen Stewart dished about her own experiences filming the franchise. In fact, she was actually surprised that so much time had already gone by since they filmed the last ""Twilight"" film. Stewart had also shared how lucky she was to have been part of such an experience and that she has taken a lot from the franchise going so far as to say that the film series has made her what she is today.  Based on the popular novel series by Stephenie Meyer, the first ""Twilight"" film was released in 2008 and was an instant success spanning five films and grossing over $3 billion all in all."
"Just when it seemed things couldn‚Äôt get any worse.‚Ä¶They did. Capping of a tumultuous week of bizarre rants and a Trump-related Twitter firestorm, Kanye West showed up in the TMZ newsroom on May 1 and dropped a few new bombshells. During a rambling 42-minute interview, the erratic rapper announced that he‚Äôd been hooked on opioids after liposuction in 2016 and declared that ""when you hear about slavery for 400 years‚Ä¶that sounds like a choice."" His shocking comments were met with instant backlash from fans, fellow celebrities and especially his own wife, Kim Kardashian.  ""She‚Äôs just so mad at him for embarrassing her ‚Äî and her family ‚Äî over and over and over again,"" says a Kardashian source, noting that Kim is fearful about how Kanye‚Äôs behavior affects everything from their children to the Kardashians‚Äô public image and business empire. The pair fought bitterly, adds an insider, because ""Kanye was furious that she would even try to silence him. He stormed off, leaving Kim in tears."" Now with Kanye, 40, holed up at a Wyoming resort ‚Äî purportedly to work on his music ‚Äî Kim, 37, is facing the fact that her third marriage is in free fall. ""She‚Äôs more humiliated than ever,"" says the source. ""Her sisters and mom, Kris Jenner, are asking her how much more of this she can take.""  She‚Äôs put up with so much already. ""Kim has tried to talk to Kanye about the effect his words are having, not only on his friends and his fans, but on those closest to him,"" says the insider, noting that she‚Äôs been living in fear for the family ‚Äî including kids North, Saint, and Chicago ‚Äî after rapper Daz Dillinger urged the notorious Crips gang to ‚Äúf--- Kanye up.‚Äù  While Kanye brushed of the danger during his TMZ rant, he and Kim did appear to beef up security, says the insider: ""They‚Äôre taking this very seriously."" All of the Kardashians are on red alert. ""This is most definitely a family crisis,"" says the insider. ""Everyone has been in heated conversations, trying to figure out how the hell to shut Kanye up."" And how to keep the family businesses running smoothly.  ""Kim hopes people won‚Äôt hold Kanye‚Äôs actions against her,"" says the source, ""but Kris has been on the phone tirelessly with the execs they work with to make sure that there are no problems."" Kim is already breathing a little easier now that Kanye‚Äôs out of town. ""It‚Äôs way less stressful,"" says the source, noting that they hardly speak when he‚Äôs working. ""She wants to unwind and not make any rash decisions. But just having him out of LA has already been great for her mental state. And she‚Äôs doing whatever she can to be vocal about how Kanye‚Äôs opinions are NOT hers.""  But Kim knows his actions reflect on her ‚Äî and she‚Äôs got a big decision to make about their future. As embarrassing as it will be for the reality star to have ""a third failed marriage under her belt,"" says the insider, ""there‚Äôs no coming back from Kanye‚Äôs latest meltdown. It‚Äôs time for Kim to not only distance herself from Kanye, but to make it offcial and divorce him.""  For more on this, pick up the new issue of In Touch magazine, on stands now!

"Update: Michael Phelps defended his Shark Week finale episode that left some viewers lukewarm on Sunday. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way ‚Ä¶ I thought it turned out incredible,‚Äù he said.  The much-hyped race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was anticlimactic to some, because the man and fish did not actually race, as the channel suggested.  The ‚Äúrace‚Äù constituted Discovery Channel calculating the speed of a great white shark (over 100 meters) and superimposing shark footage over Phelps. The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark‚Äôs natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.  Phelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark. The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than C√©sar Cielo‚Äôs 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore.  Regardless of Phelps‚Äô abilities, Discovery‚Äôs perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers‚Äô sentiments. After the race, comments like the following appeared to be the major takeaway:  Turns out ‚ÄúMichael Phelps races a shark‚Äù was really just ‚ÄúMichael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark‚Äôs time.‚Äù ‚Äî Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) July 24, 2017  Me pretending to be ok with Michael Phelps not racing a real shark pic.twitter.com/QnCF98NfBB ‚Äî Gabi Palamone (@Yo_Gabi_Gabi__) July 24, 2017  Michael Phelps not racing a real shark is like being sold Kanye tickets and then watching a Kanye hologram perform ‚Äî Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) July 24, 2017  ‚ÄúAll the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn‚Äôt a side by side race,‚Äù said a spokesperson from Discovery to Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúDuring Michael‚Äôs pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of ‚ÄòPhelps vs. Shark,‚Äô this message was clear.‚Äù  Michael Phelps also defended the race while taking questions on Facebook Live. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs hard to swim in a cage when you‚Äôre next to a shark ‚Ä¶ It wouldn‚Äôt be able to move at the right speed. So how we did it was the best way that we could do it.‚Äù  While the race itself may not have lived up to the spectacle Discovery advertised, the episode gave interesting context for the speed of great white sharks (just check out this GIF of Phelps reacting to how easily a great white would win gold). Even though Phelps lost by a hair in this would-be race, to Phelps‚Äô credit, he could take down a reef shark in a 50-meter race by 0.2 seconds.  ‚ÄúRematch?‚Äù Phelps tweeted after ‚Äúlosing‚Äù to the ocean predator. But the real question: would anyone bother to watch?"
"The ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" reunion show has already been full of drama, but the Part 4 episode exposed Phaedra Parks as a coniving liar.      Fans of the show found out last week that Parks was actually the person that started rumors about Kandi Burruss, which Porsha Williams believed and repeated. However, it appears Phaedra was just lying and starting trouble!      Porsha let it be known on the last reunion episode that Phaedra was the one that told her Kandi and her husband Todd Tucker were allegedly trying to drug her for sex. Kandi was obviously shocked and hurt by the accusations, which she vehemently denied.      All eyes were on Phaedra to explain her actions and reasons for making up the lies. Instead, she sat there acting unbothered and tried to play it off. Parks even dared to tell Williams, ""Maybe you heard me wrong.""          Williams was shocked when Parks shot down Porsha's claims that Phaedra heard the drugging rumor directly from Kandi. She said, ""I'm sorry. I shouldn't have repeated it. I mean I'm sorry. [Expletive], I didn't know if it was true or not.""      Porsha was obviously hurt that Phaedra refused to own up to her huge part in the ordeal. She began to realize that she was probably being used by Parks as a pawn against Kandi. Porsha broke down into tears.  ;      Kandi became emtional as she confronted Phaedra, explaining how the rumors have hurt her brand. Burruss appears to feel that was Parks' goal in the first place.          Kandi got emotional as she said, ""It's like to me, it's one thing to say 'Oh she messed with this person. She did that.' It's like whatever, whatever, we throw shade. Whatever. But drugs? And you would believe and go back and repeat that I would try and drug somebody.""          That wasn't the only issue between Parks and Burruss. The ladies also discussed the lawsuit by Johnnie Winston, Kandi's former employee, that Phaedra was encouraging to sue her cast mate. Kandi considered Phaedra's actions 'vindictive'. We would have to agree at this point!"

"Remember Emma Watson twirling her way through the sets of Beauty and the Beast in that gorgeous yellow gown? Well, can you imagine her twirling in a white gown on her wedding day? Hard, isn't it? But fans of the stunning British actress have to prepare themselves for the sight as it is reported that Watson may be engaged and is preparing to tie the knot.  The shocking claim comes from Life & Style Magazine. The tabloid claims that the actress has begun planning her ""dream wedding"" with her techie boyfriend. The Harry Potter star has been rumoured to be dating William ""Mack"" Knight for nearly two years now and the couple are between wedding talks.  Also Read: Beauty and The Beast: Five Emma Watson outfits that eclipse the princess gowns  The news was broken by a diner who was sitting on another table close to Emma and Knight's at dinner in San Diego's Jupiter and Ivy. The curious diner reportedly eves dropped their conversation and overheard the couple discussing their wedding plans.  Talking to the magazine, the diner claimed, ""They could be heard discussing what their dream wedding would be like. They talked about which family members they would invite and where the wedding would take place, in America or London. They even talked about flowers and a honeymoon.""  While this comes as a heart-breaking news for fans, Gossip Cop has clarified that this is a fake story. Debunking the wedding talks, the gossip website contacted sources close to Watson and confirmed that there is no wedding being planned as of now.

She told the magazine, ""I've noticed, in Hollywood, who you're dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus.

"Series creator Ryan Murphy first shared the news over the weekend, saying he made the decision to honor victims' rights.  Tuesday's episode of American Horror Story: Cult, which was set to feature a scene in which a mass shooting occurs, has been edited to be less graphic following the deadly Las Vegas shooting in which 58 people were killed and hundreds more injured.  Ryan Murphy, co-creator and showrunner of the FX horror anthology, first made the comments Saturday during a New Yorker Festival discussion. The scene in question was filmed before the shooting in Las Vegas occurred, with Murphy explaining that they shot the sequence in September even though they're still filming this season (several of the actors have already wrapped). ""I just made the decision that I'm going to have all of that violence be shown for the most part off camera,"" he said of editing the episode after it was in the can and locked before the tragedy in Vegas.  On Monday, FX confirmed the episode would see ""substantial"" edits for Tuesday's telecast but that the original unedited episode would then be released on VOD and streaming platforms.  ""In light of the tragedy last week in Las Vegas, Ryan Murphy and the producers of American Horror Story: Cult have chosen to make substantial edits to the opening scene of [Tuesday] night‚Äôs episode,"" FX said in a statement. ""This opening, which was filmed two months ago and which portrays an occurrence of gun violence that has sadly become all too common in our country, contains a sequence that some viewers might find traumatic.""  The network says the edited episode will air on the FX linear channel, while the unedited and original version will be available on the VOD platform of cable, satellite or telco providers, as well as on the FX Networks non-linear platforms, FXNOW and FX+.  When speaking about the decision on Saturday with the New Yorker TV critic Emily Nussbaum, Murphy said he felt a ""responsibility"" to victims of gun violence.  ""Nobody ever talks about victims' rights. That's sort of a weird emotional discussion that's never bridged,"" Murphy added. ""But I felt great sympathy for people who were affected, certainly, and family members and loved ones and people who are upset about the way the world is.""  Murphy explained that there was a conversation about what to do with the AHS episode in the wake of the shooting: ""Should you air it? Should you not air it? How do you be sensitive?""  ""My point of view was I believe I have the right to air it, but I also believe in victims' rights, and I believe that now is probably not the week to have something explosive or incendiary in the culture because someone who was affected might watch that and it could trigger something or make them feel upset. So our decision was to re-edit it and I felt that that was the right move,"" he said.  The scene was graphic, Murphy said, in order to make ""an obvious anti-gun warning about society.""  The seventh season of the horror anthology show, which stars Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters, follows the rise of a cult led by Peters' fictional character. The post-election set season explores how someone can rise within a disenfranchised community. Throughout the season, Peters will embody five other notorious real-life cult leaders, from Charles Manson to David Koresh.  This is not the first time a show has had to change a scene or delay the viewing of an episode in response to real-world events. USA's Mr. Robot delayed its season-one finale, which featured a character killing themselves on television, similar to the events of the Virginia TV shooting in which a reporter was killed on-air.  Similarly, USA delayed the premiere of its Ryan Phillippe-starrer Shooter in the wake of a deadly Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas where a sniper attack by a disgraced military vet killed five police officers.  Murphy's comments were part of a wide-ranging discussion of his career and many TV series, past, present and future. He revealed the fate of the Cult episode as part of a response to a question from Nussbaum about people being offended by things on his shows and what offends him.

So Holmes called off the wedding and quietly told her ‚ÄúDjango Unchained‚Äù boyfriend they needed to break up.  ‚ÄúJamie balked at the idea of signing (a prenup with a no-cheating clause) because he realized that being unfaithful could be costly,‚Äù a source told RadarOnline. ‚ÄúKatie noticed a total lack of respect in Jamie‚Äôs behavior. She knew it wasn‚Äôt healthy for her or Suri, and she has to protect them both.‚Äù  At the same time, Holmes has supposedly been dealing with efforts by her mega-star ex-husband Cruise to push his way back into their daughter Suri‚Äôs life. According to Hollywood Life, citing a report by Star magazine, Cruise ached over the fact that he had been an absent father and not seen his daughter in more than five years, because his Church of Scientology bosses told him he couldn‚Äôt see her.  ‚ÄúTom is a loyal Scientologist, so when church leaders told him he couldn‚Äôt see Suri, he didn‚Äôt question it,‚Äù an insider told the Star. ‚ÄúBut Tom‚Äôs tired of being bossed around by them. He‚Äôs had to watch from afar as Suri grew into a lovely young lady, and he regrets that he‚Äôs missed out on so much. He‚Äôs dying to be a part of her life!‚Äù  Holmes isn‚Äôt a fan of a reunion, given that she agreed to stay quiet about Cruise and Scientology if he agreed to stay away from their daughter and not try to ‚Äúbrainwash‚Äù her into becoming a part of the controversial self-styled religious organization, the Star reported. But Holmes also was torn because she wants to do what‚Äôs best for Suri.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs slowly warming up to the idea of a reunion,‚Äù an insider told the Star. ‚ÄúSuri must desperately be missing her dad, and in the end, Katie only wants what‚Äôs best for her. Tom has assured her he won‚Äôt bring his religion into it, and Katie is starting to believe him.‚Äù  Representatives for Holmes have denied both the report about her and Foxx breaking up and the report about a Cruise and Suri reunion.  But notably, the denial about the Foxx breakup report comes from Holmes‚Äô publicist, who was willing to attach her name to her statement.  ‚ÄúThe Radar story is 100 percent untrue,‚Äù Leslie Sloane, the representative for Holmes told People.  People and other outlets attached a great deal of significance to the fact that Holmes‚Äô publicist denied the report because her statement marks the first official, on-the-record acknowledgement from either Holmes or Foxx that a relationship has even existed.  After the two reportedly began dating in 2013, they went to great lengths to keep their relationship a secret, with Holmes even donning a disguise at one point to meet up with him in a restaurant.  The secrecy was necessary because Holmes was legally obligated by her divorce settlement from Cruise to not publicly date anyone for five years after their breakup, according to reports in September 2017.  Those reports came after Holmes and Foxx were photographed by a paparazzo walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach. There was speculation at the time that the two knew they were being photographed and allowed themselves to be seen together in this way because that five-year public dating ban had expired. They were finally ready to announce to the world that they were a couple.  Since then, Holmes and Foxx have been spotted together more openly at various events, including sitting next to each other at Clive Davis‚Äôs Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, People reported. Holmes also turned up at Foxx‚Äôs 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December.  Holmes‚Äô romantic history has long been marked by intense, high-profile highs and devastating lows, especially surrounding her high-octane courtship and marriage to Cruise.  Holmes and Cruise got engaged in 2005 after just seven weeks of dating. Cruise famously gushed about his love for Holmes by jumping on Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs TV show couch. They became parents to daughter Suri in 2006 and married in a lavish Church of Scientology wedding in an Italian castle.  Holmes initiated the divorce from Cruise because she reportedly became concerned about raising Suri as a Scientologist. Numerous investigative reports over the years have shown that the Church exercises an enormous amount of control over the lives of members, including over how parents raise their children. Critics regard Scientology as a mind-controlling cult.  What appears certain about Holmes‚Äô life is that she‚Äôs been a devoted, protective mother to Suri, doing the best she can to raise her on her own.  Numerous reports describe Suri as an intelligent, kind-hearted girl, with Holmes herself opening up about her daughter‚Äôs philanthropic heart in a 2015 interview with Today.  ‚ÄúMy little one is very, very generous and very sensitive,‚Äù Holmes said, according to People.  Over the years, their mother-daughter bond has been documented in photos at events, as in when Suri and Holmes appeared on the Madison Square Garden stage together in December to introduce Taylor Swift at the Jingle Ball concert.  Holmes also has shared images of their sometimes playful, friendly bond in a series of photos she has posted to Instagram."

When you think of it, she never really did bandwagon on any popular Hollywood diet, at least publicly.

"After several months of the couple trying and failing to keep their relationship on the down-low, we now know that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are dating.  We still don't know exactly how long the actors have been together, but it seems they're moving very quickly.  Despite the fact that Foxx doesn't even tell his friends about Holmes (The man is seriously committed to maintaining his privacy.), sources say the relationship is already very serious.  In fact, sources are now claiming that there's a very good reason Holmes and Foxx decided to finally go public with their relationship last week.  According to Australian tabloid NW, Holmes and Foxx are expecting a child together.  Insiders tell the magazine that the pregnancy was planned, and Katie is roughly three months along.  ""Katie had always wanted to have another baby and knew her biological clock was ticking - and, at long last, it's happening!"" says one source.  Noting that Holmes described the pregnancy as ""perfect timing,"" the insider adds:  ""Katie's always wanted a sibling for Suri and now she'll have a little sister.""  We'll hold off on offering out congratulations until the news comes from a source that's slightly more credible than a random Australian tabloid.  That said, we wouldn't be surprised if it turns out there's some truth to these reports.  After all, Katie and Jamie are both devoted parents, and sources close to the couple have confirmed their relationship is very serious.  Plus, after the experience of having a child with Tom Cruise, we imagine Katie would like to find out what child-rearing is like when you're not under 24-hour surveillance from a cabal of cult leaders.  Just kidding, Scientologists! Please don't sue us!  Anyway, sources say that in the years after her split from Cruise, Katie pretty much holed up and devoted herself thoroughly to being a mom.  These days, she's loosening up a bit, and her loved ones credit Foxx with teaching her how to relax and have fun.  ‚ÄúShe was a homebody,‚Äù says one insider.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to see her out and having fun, and I bet Jamie has played a big part in that.‚Äù  Hopefully, the knowledge that everyone will now be scrutinizing her midsection in search of a baby bump won't stop Katie from continuing to go out and enjoy herself."

"It took Kelly Ripa more than a year to find the right co-host for Live after Michael Strahan unexpectedly left for Good Morning America. Now, her incredible chemistry with Strahan‚Äôs replacement, Ryan Seacrest, is undeniable, but in the midst of the sexual misconduct allegations against him, Ripa is feeling betrayed and torn about standing beside him. Could these skeletons in Seacrest‚Äôs closet force Ripa to leave the popular morning show?  According to Life & Style, in the era of the #MeToo and #Time‚ÄôsUp movements every business is playing it safe, and that means things could change at Live, especially if ratings start to drop and big names start to avoid the show.  ‚Äú[Kelly‚Äôs] waiting to see what happens with Ryan. But [either way] this is a dark period for her,‚Äù reveals an insider. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs pissed‚Ä¶Kelly feels blindsided. The last thing she needs is celebrities boycotting. Everyone is on pins and needles.‚Äù  At this point, Ripa and Seacrest are still interviewing A-listers on the show, but that wasn‚Äôt the case when he was on the Oscar red carpet earlier this month. While hosting the E! Live from the Red Carpet Oscar special, Seacrest obviously had a slow night after publicists decided to steer their clients away from him because of the sexual misconduct claims.  This resulted in a 43 percent drop in ratings in key demographics compared to 2017, plus a 35 percent drop in overall number of viewers.  Ripa and her husband, Mark Consuelos, did walk by and acknowledge Seacrest by telling him he looked amazing and was doing a great job, but that doesn‚Äôt mean she still isn‚Äôt conflicted about the allegations.  She does want to side with her co-host, but no one thought he had any skeletons in the closet, and everyone is asking if he knew this was going to come out.  Ripa did seemingly take a dig at Seacrest on the show late last month when she asked him if he wanted her to put his shoes back on after they talked about having a treadmill day on the show. It seemed to be a reference to the allegations against Seacrest that included him pushing his accuser‚Äôs head towards his crotch while she tied his shoes.  But, the next day, Ripa told audiences that she fully supported her co-host, saying that she adores him, and it is a privilege to work with him, and those words led Seacrest to tears.  Oscar emcee Jimmy Kimmel also had no problem talking with Seacrest and avoiding jumping to any conclusions about the allegations. He said that we should afford people the opportunity for truth and find out the facts before hanging someone out to dry.

"CLOSE Britain's Queen Elizabeth II welcomed US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to Windsor Castle on Friday. (July 13) AP  Queen Elizabeth II stands with President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump in the Grand Corridor at Windsor Castle in Windsor, July 13, 2018. (Photo: STEVE PARSONS/ AFP/Getty Images)  WINDSOR, England ‚Äî President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at Windsor Castle Friday evening outside London to meet Queen Elizabeth II and be treated to the kind of royal pomp-and-ceremony the president loves and the British love staging.  The presidential couple arrived at the massive 900-plus-year-old fortress just miles west of London at about 5 p.m. local time, and shook hands with Her Majesty, 92, who was meeting her 12th sitting president and the fourth she has hosted at her weekend residence since the 1980s.  The first lady, her hair up in a low chignon, wore a conservative pale pink Dior skirt suit with a narrow belt and a high collar.  The queen wore her usual royal outfit, a periwinkle blue coat over a patterned blue-and-yellow dress with a matching blue hat, plus white gloves, sensible black shoes and her ever-present black handbag.

(Photo: Matt Dunham, AP)  Her husband, Prince Philip, 97, has retired from public life and was not there.  The weather was cooperative: The temperature was 79 degrees, with the sun peeking though a partly cloudy light blue sky.  The Trumps, who had arrived via Marine One landing on the grass east of the castle, were driven into the castle Quadrangle and greeted the queen. Then they stood under a covered dais as a Coldstream Guard of Honor played the U.S. national anthem. The Trumps stood with hands over hearts; the queen with her white-gloved hands folded.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/ AP)  As per usual in a royal welcoming ceremony, the monarch and the president inspected the Guard of Honor as a medley of U.S. service hymns were played. The diminutive monarch and the tall president walked slowly past each file three ranks deep, then watched scarlet-clad troops in bearskin hats march around the Quadrangle.  Although reporters couldn't hear what they said, the queen and the Trumps were seen to have exchanged some remarks during the ceremonies, and at one point Her Majesty and Melania Trump exchanged warm smiles.  About 10 minutes after the Trumps arrived, they went inside the castle (which has about 1,000 rooms and occupies 13 acres) to join the queen for tea. The palace did not release details about which room or what was served, but later a picture of the three of them posing in the Grand Corridor of the castle was released.  The royal handshakes followed the president's meeting earlier Friday with Prime Minister Theresa May at Chequers, the PM's country retreat.  Also earlier, Melania Trump, dressed in a Victoria Beckham dress of boldly colorful stripes, visited the Royal Chelsea Hospital in London where she tried her hand at bowls with aging British Army veterans.

(Photo: Leon Neal/Getty Images)  Meanwhile, at almost exactly the same time as the pageantry in Windsor unfolded, back in Washington Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced charges against 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking offenses during the 2016 presidential election. The indictments are part of the ongoing special counsel probe into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia ‚Äì a probe regularly denounced by the president.  The meeting between the Trumps and the queen took place against a backdrop of the president's critical comments about Prime Minister Theresa May and London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the teetering Tory government, its ongoing infighting over Brexit and Trump's own suggestions to May about how to achieve the divorce from the European Union.  But he had nothing but gushing praise for the queen in his headline-making interview Friday with The Sun, Britain's largest-circulation newspaper owned by Trump's media mogul pal, Rupert Murdoch.  Trump described the queen as ‚Äúa tremendous woman‚Äù in the interview.  ""I really look forward to meeting her. I think she represents her country so well,"" Trump said. ‚ÄúIf you think of it, for so many years she has represented her country, she has really never made a mistake. You don‚Äôt see, like, anything embarrassing. She is just an incredible woman.""  The queen hosts multiple foreign dignitaries every week, though usually at her working residence at Buckingham Palace in London. But an audience between the United Kingdom's head of state with the head of state of Britain's closest ally is considered crucial for both sides.  President Donald Trump and Queen Elizabeth II inspect a Guard of Honour formed of the Coldstream Guards at Windsor Castle in July 13, 2018. (Photo: Matt Dunham, AP)  Certainly, President Trump was keen on it, according to the U.S. ambassador to Britain speaking the week before the Trumps arrived. Doing it at Windsor also had advantages in that it got him out of London where massive anti-Trump demonstrations are taking place, complete with a giant Trump ""baby"" blimp balloon aimed at mocking him.  No such derision will be heard from Her Majesty.  Under the British constitutional monarchy, the figurehead monarch is ""above"" politics, and the queen has been scrupulous during her 66-year reign in keeping her opinions to herself, no matter the controversies swirling around whoever is presented to her.  Thus, the times when her views do become known are rare and memorable, as when she was overheard at a 2016 garden party criticizing Chinese officials for being ""very rude"" during a state visit to Britain by President Xi Jinping the year before. Her remark was huge news because it was unprecedented, uncharacteristic and undiplomatic.  Although there were advance calls in Britain from some quarters to cancel the meeting between the queen and the Trumps, that was never going to happen. When it comes to these meetings, the monarch follows the instructions from the government of the day.  May was the one who issued the invitation to Trump when she met him at the White House soon after he took office. Initially, it was supposed to be a ""state visit"" featuring even more elaborate ceremony, but that was later downgraded to an audience as it became clearer that Trump's presence in London would be less than welcome.  Instead, an elaborate banquet was staged Thursday night by May when she hosted the Trumps at a black-tie dinner with British business leaders at Blenheim Palace, the home of the Dukes of Marlborough in Oxfordshire west of London where Winston Churchill was born.  The teatime meeting with the queen lasted less then an hour; afterwards, the Trumps were scheduled to depart for a weekend in Scotland where the half-Scots president (on his mother's side) owns two golf courses.  Next week, they will travel to Finland where the president will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki on Monday.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2ulthLz"
"The royal descendants of Victoria (Queen of the United Kingdom) and of Christian IX (King of Denmark) currently occupy the thrones of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. At the outbreak of the First World War their grandchildren occupied the thrones of Denmark, Greece, Norway, Germany, Romania, Russia, Spain and the United Kingdom. For this, Queen Victoria was nicknamed ""the grandmother of Europe"" while King Christian IX was nicknamed ""Father-in-law of Europe"". Of the remaining kingdoms of Europe today, only Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands descends neither from Queen Victoria nor King Christian IX.[1]  Grandchildren [ edit ]  Queen Victoria arranged the marriage of her eldest son and heir-apparent, the future Edward VII, to Alexandra of Denmark, the eldest daughter of King Christian IX, which took place on 10 March 1863. Among their six children were George V (who was also Emperor of India throughout his reign) and his sister Maud of Wales (who would later marry their cousin King Haakon VII of Norway, another grandchild of Christian IX, on 22 July 1896). However, these two marriages were not the only unions amongst and between descendants of Victoria and Christian IX.  The second son of Christian IX, Prince William, became King of Greece as George I shortly after his sister Alexandra's marriage due to this new connection with the British Royal Family. On 27 October 1889 his son, later Constantine I of Greece, married Sophia of Prussia, a granddaughter of Victoria, forging another union between descendants of the British queen and the Danish king.  In 1865, Christian IX's second daughter, Princess Dagmar, became engaged to Tsarevich Nicholas of Russia, son and heir of Tsar Alexander II. Following the untimely death of her fianc√©, Dagmar married Nicholas's younger brother, the Tsarevich Alexander in 1866, taking the Russian name Maria Feodorovna. Between 1881 and 1894, she was empress-consort of Russia. Her son, Nicholas II of Russia, married Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, yet another granddaughter of Queen Victoria, on 26 November 1894, and she became empress-consort as Alexandra Feodorovna.  Other grandchildren became monarchs in their own right or consorts. Christian X of Denmark was the elder brother of Haakon VII of Norway and thus another grandson of Christian IX of Denmark. William II, German Emperor and King of Prussia was the elder brother of Sophia of Prussia and thus another reigning grandson of Victoria. Lastly, Victoria had two more granddaughters who became queens: Marie of Edinburgh, who married Ferdinand I of Romania, and Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg who married Alfonso XIII of Spain.  Christian IX was therefore the grandfather of an emperor and two kings who all married granddaughters of Victoria, one of whom (Maud of Wales) was also a granddaughter of Christian IX. In total, five of his grandsons were reigning sovereigns.  Victoria, meanwhile, was the grandmother of an emperor, a king-emperor, four queens consort and an empress consort.  First World War [ edit ]  During the First World War (1914‚Äì1918), many monarchs of countries from both sides were closely related due to their mutual descent from either Queen Victoria, King Christian IX or both. The most commonly cited example is the fact that Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany were all first cousins of King George V of the United Kingdom.[2][3][4] Other countries who fought against Germany in addition to Russia and the United Kingdom were Romania, whose queen-consort, Marie, wife of King Ferdinand I, was a cousin of the Kaiser, and Greece, whose queen-consort, Sophia, wife of King Constantine I, was the Kaiser's own sister.  Additionally, King George V was a first cousin, through King Christian IX, of both Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and King Constantine I of Greece. Shortly before the end of the war, Nicholas, his wife and children were executed by the Bolsheviks. Other first cousins of George V, whose countries were neutral during the war, were King Christian X of Denmark, Queen Victoria Eugenie of Spain (queen-consort of King Alfonso XIII) and King Haakon VII of Norway (who was also George's brother-in-law via his marriage to George's sister, Maud).  Family tree of sovereign and consort grandchildren [ edit ]  The family tree below also attempts to show the relationship between close and extended family members referenced on this page.  Present-day reigning descendants [ edit ]  The unions between descendants of Queen Victoria and of King Christian IX did not end with the First World War, despite the overthrows of both the German and Russian monarchies (along with House of Habsburg in Austria-Hungary). On the contrary, nearly all European reigning kings and queens today are most closely related through their descent from Victoria, Christian or both.  Currently, there are seven kingdoms remaining in Europe:[5]  1. Belgium: King Philippe & Queen Mathilde  2. Denmark: Queen Margrethe II  3. Norway: King Harald V & Queen Sonja  4. Spain: King Felipe VI & Queen Letizia  5. Sweden: King Carl XVI Gustaf & Queen Silvia  6. United Kingdom: Queen Elizabeth II & Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh  7. Netherlands: King Willem-Alexander & Queen M√°xima  King Harald V of Norway, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, her husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and King Felipe VI of Spain are all descended from both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX. The first two monarchs are great-grandchildren of the aforementioned union between Alexandra of Denmark (daughter of King Christian IX) and Edward VII (son of Queen Victoria). Harald V of Norway is actually descended from Christian IX three ways, twice through his father and once through his mother. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and his wife Elizabeth II are second cousins once removed through Christian IX and also third cousins as they are both great-great-grandchildren of Victoria. Margrethe II of Denmark is descended once each from Victoria and Christian IX. She is also a first cousin to Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden through Victoria's granddaughter Princess Margaret of Connaught. Felipe VI is descended from Victoria three ways and Christian IX twice. His father, King Juan Carlos I, is descended from Victoria and not Christian IX, while Juan Carlos' consort, Queen Sof√≠a, is twice a descendant of Victoria and twice a great-great-granddaughter of Christian IX.  King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden is descended from Victoria, twice, as his parents were second cousins because they were both great-grandchildren of Victoria. in addition, Carl XVI Gustaf also descends on his maternal side from Victoria's half-sister Feodora. Although Carl XVI Gustaf is not a descendant of Christian IX; however, it should be noted that he descends on his maternal side from the parents of Christian IX through Christian IX's elder brother, Friedrich.  Conversely, Philippe, King of the Belgians is descended from King Christian IX but not Queen Victoria, although, he is a descendant of Victoria's maternal uncle (as well as her husband Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha's paternal uncle), Leopold I, King of the Belgians. Philippe's father, King Albert II, who abdicated in the summer of 2013, is a first cousin to Harald V of Norway through their grandfather Prince Carl, Duke of V√§sterg√∂tland, married to Princess Ingeborg of Denmark, a granddaughter of Christian IX.  In summation, the monarchs of Norway, Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom as well as the consort of the United Kingdom are descended from both Victoria and Christian IX. The King of Sweden is descended from Victoria and not Christian IX (although from one of his brothers). The King of the Belgians and the Grand Duke of Luxembourg are descended from Christian IX and not Victoria, though they are descendants of both Victoria's and her spouse's uncle Leopold I of Belgium. The King of the Netherlands is the only monarch descended from neither Victoria nor Christian IX. (He is, however, a sixth cousin thrice removed of Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Harald V, Margrethe II and Carl XVI Gustaf through descent from Frederick, Prince of Wales; a sixth cousin four times removed of Felipe VI, also via descent from Frederick; and also a fourth cousin twice removed of Albert II through descent from William I of the Netherlands. Furthermore, William I of the Netherlands was also second cousin once removed to both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX, since he was the great-grandson of George II of Great Britain. Hence, all current reigning kings and queens in Europe, including the Netherlands, are related through the line of George II of Great Britain.)  Monarchs descended from Queen Victoria [ edit ]  Monarchs descended from King Christian IX [ edit ]  Notes  Common ancestry between Victoria and Christian IX [ edit ]  Because so many monarchs descend from both Queen Victoria and King Christian IX of Denmark, the relationship between these two monarchs is of some interest. These monarchs were third cousins through their mutual descent from King George II of Great Britain. This relationship occurs twice because the maternal grandparents of King Christian IX of Denmark, Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel) (1744‚Äì1836) and Princess Louise of Denmark (1750‚Äì1831), were both children of daughters of King George II of Great Britain (1660‚Äì1727), and thus first cousins. Louise of Hesse-Kassel, wife of King Christian IX of Denmark, was a granddaughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse (1747‚Äì1837), the brother of the aforementioned Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel.

"Jane Lynch is reflecting on the life and death of her former Glee costar Mark Salling following his apparent suicide on Tuesday, January 30.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been tough. He was a troubled, troubled guy, and he always was,‚Äù Lynch, 57, told Us Weekly exclusively at Adopt the Arts‚Äô Annual Rock Gala on Wednesday, January 31. ‚ÄúThis is a very sad end to it, but I know that he‚Äôs at peace now. He‚Äôs in the arms of a beneficent force.‚Äù  Lynch and Salling costarred in Fox‚Äôs Glee from 2009 to 2015. Shortly after the show ended, Salling was arrested for felony possession of child pornography. He pled guilty just one month before his death and was set to appear in court on March 7.  ‚ÄúI know life was very, very hard for Mark. I think we all do the best we can at the end of the day. I know Mark that did the best he could,‚Äù Lynch continued. The Emmy Award winner admitted she didn‚Äôt know Salling‚Äôs family and really didn‚Äôt know him, regardless of working together for six years.  ‚ÄúHe was a hard guy to get to know,‚Äù she said.  However, she does have a personal memory with Salling she holds close to her heart.  ‚ÄúHe took videos of the stages and everything. He was so happy to be coming to work, to be on the show. He wrote a song and videotaped his day being on Glee,‚Äù Lynch explained. ‚ÄúDriving into the Paramount lot ‚Ä¶ at that time he was living on a cot in a little room. It was a big jump for him in his career, and also, he had a job and was in with this group of really great kids. I think he knew that he was breathing rarefied air. There was so much joy and happiness in his musical video that he shot for himself. Fox made him take it down. But it was a sweet, beautiful expression of his joy and being in Glee.‚Äù  As Us previously reported, Salling‚Äôs estate may not have to pay his victims $50,000 each following the death. ‚ÄúRestitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge ‚Ä¶ He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,‚Äù a source explained.  Salling, who was 35 at his time of death, ‚Äúknew he would have nothing to come back to after he went to prison,‚Äù an insider close to the actor told Us.  With reporting by Nicholas White.

"Getty  Meghan has been looking a bit peaky at the last few events.  ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs usually so full of energy and very lively ‚Äì but she definitely seems tired and withdrawn at the moment,‚Äô says a source. ‚ÄòOf course, all the baby whispers would explain why she‚Äôs not herself and seems so pale.‚Äô  The exciting development comes just weeks after Meghan described being married as ‚Äòwonderful‚Äô, before adding Harry is ‚Äòthe best husband ever‚Äô.  The news was first shared with the Queen the same day, just before Meghan boarded the train to Cheshire.  ‚ÄòIt gave the Queen and Meghan a lot to talk about during their journey on the Royal Train together and there was lots of baby talk,‚Äô reveals a source.  According to the insider, Harry has always been the Queen‚Äôs favourite and she‚Äôs taken a definite liking to Meghan ‚Äì she sees a lot of herself in Meghan‚Äôs strength and tenacity.  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'actively trying' to start a family  Related: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry reportedly 'having twins'  And to hear that they‚Äôre to be parents is exciting for Her Majesty.  ‚ÄòWe haven‚Äôt seen the Queen that happy and that excited in a long time ‚Äì it was wonderful to see,‚Äô the insider revealed.  The source went on to say the mood has really continued throughout the palace since they returned. And no-one could be happier.  ‚ÄòMeghan‚Äôs still in the early stages of her pregnancy, but the palace is already working on announcements. This is the news the world has been waiting for.‚Äô  The royal couple, who are set to carry out a tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October, are making sure to cram in as many overseas tours as they can before Meghan is too big to travel.  ‚ÄòHarry and Meghan wanted to get a few visits in so that she could get to know the Commonwealth countries and start making a contribution to the royal family,‚Äô revealed a source. ‚ÄòBut the Queen understands that their main priority is to start a family.‚Äô  Meanwhile, royal fans in the UK have been madly placing bets on Meghan and Harry announcing their pregnancy in 2018, with Ladbrokes giving the odds a 4/6 chance.  Last month a friend close to the couple also told The Mirror: ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre desperate to have a family as soon as possible‚Äô.  So keen are Harry and Meghan to have children, sources also claimed that the couple actually started trying for a baby before they got married.  Getty  Given the fact that Meghan is 36 and her biological clock is ticking, the couple didn‚Äôt want to wait to start a family.  ‚ÄòThey actually stopped using protection over two months ago, although they abstained from sex in the weeks leading up to the wedding,‚Äô a source told Hollywood Life.  And Harry previously talked about wanting kids before he even met Meghan. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve longed for kids since I was very, very young,‚Äô he said back in 2012.  ‚ÄòI‚Äôm waiting to find the right person. Someone who is willing to take on the job.‚Äô  In their sit-down interview with the BBC Harry expressed his desire to have children sooner rather than later: ‚ÄòWe will start a family in the near future,‚Äô he said.  Thankfully, according to royal expert Katie Nicholl, his wife is the perfect mother-to-be.  ‚ÄòMeghan is very doting with children. She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things that I discovered [while writing] the book was it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry,‚Äô she said.

"Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. ‚ÄúI feel I‚Äôve been on a wave of growth,‚Äù Jenna said recently. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that‚Äôs maybe what shocked everyone so much ‚Äî that it can be a positive thing.‚Äù  But it's apparently not so positive anymore.

"This meme ‚Äî the notion that in 2016 actor Denzel Washington publicly supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump ‚Äî is an example of a false claim that has evolved over time as it has spread across social media and on a variety of unreliable websites. Other iterations of this rumor falsely quoted Washington as saying that when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, ‚Äúwe avoided a war with Russia, and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state.‚Äù  This rumor first went viral in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. It resurfaced in February 2018 when Washington was nominated for an Oscar ‚Äî and appeared yet again in April 2018, after musician Kanye West tweeted a statement of support for Trump, reigniting longstanding discussions about the political loyalties of black American voters.  Insight: Viral rumors often recirculate when new contexts for them emerge.  What can we learn?  Let‚Äôs start with an instance of this viral meme that was included in a post on a highly suspect website ‚Äî USALibertyPress.com ‚Äî in February 2018:  Note: The link in the previous paragraph is to an archive of the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù website. That avoids linking to the site itself and giving it additional web traffic and ad revenue.  The first step we should take is to do a little lateral reading on the claim itself. So let‚Äôs do a quick search:  All the top results for this search are from fact-checking organizations, so we can safely assume that this is a questionable claim. A quick read of the fact checks confirms that the claims in both the headline and the meme on the Liberty Press website are false. PolitiFact traced the headline claim to a well-known ‚Äúfake news‚Äù website, YourNewsWire.com, and Snopes shows that the quote attributed to Washington was actually said by Charles Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, in an interview with the New York Post.  Note: Like pieces of quality journalism, good fact checks and debunking articles are transparent. They don‚Äôt ask you to trust them; they show you why you should trust them.  But this still leaves us with questions about the source of the information. The source we started with is USALibertyPress.com, so let‚Äôs begin there.  Since the site does not have an ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù section ‚Äî a red flag in itself ‚Äî we can try to see who might have established it by searching the WHOIS registry, a database of website registration information.  Tool: WHOIS is a database of website domain registration information that you can search using any number of free portals, such as whois.net and GoDaddy‚Äôs WHOIS search portal.  A quick search for ‚ÄúUSALibertyPress.com‚Äù on GoDaddy‚Äôs WHOIS search portal gave us this*:  As the highlighted areas show, this site was registered by someone at an address in Veles, Macedonia ‚Äî a hub for ‚Äúfake news‚Äù purveyors. A quick search for Veles confirms its infamy:  We now have all we need to confirm that not only is this a false claim, but at least one website pushing it is part of a network of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù sites based in Macedonia.  Finally, you could use Google Street View to see the physical address in Veles that was used to register this site:  There is quite a bit more you could do with this example ‚Äî see this tweet thread for more ideas ‚Äî but these three steps (reading laterally for additional information, searching the WHOIS registry for a website‚Äôs origin and using Google Street View to check out the location) are important skills that will help you sort fact from fiction in the future.  *UPDATE (Aug. 28, 2018): The domain registration for www.usalibertypress.com was updated on July 28, 2018, and no longer includes information about the registrant in Macedonia. The site itself is now offline."

"Laugh it off. Oliver Hudson joked about his sister Kate Hudson's rumored romance with Brad Pitt on Instagram on Friday, January 20.  The Rules of Engagement alum, 40, shared a photo of a recent Star magazine cover, which claimed Kate, 37, and Pitt, 53, are ""getting serious"" and have moved in together. Oliver was clearly amused by the tabloid rumors and wrote a lengthy (and sarcastic) response to shut down the speculation.  ""Yeah and it's been hell!! He's messy as s‚Äìt!"" Oliver captioned his Instagram post. ""He drinks out of the f‚Äìking carton and leaves the door open when he's taking a dump!! And this is when he's at MY house!!! He's already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won't speak to me. He insists my kids call him uncle B and lost my youngest at the Santa Monica pier for 2 days.. thank god for amber alert.""  ""My mom [Goldie Hawn]'s overtly flirting with him!"" he continued. ""She's wearing these little nighties around the house now?! But ALL DAY!! Like at 3pm! And Pa [Kurt Russell] just keeps saying 'All right!! It's Brad Pitt!!' Anyway not going well.. so BP.. it's time to move out man.. I need my life back dog.. I'll smoke one more bowl and then get the f‚Äìk out.. we thank you.. oh and I found your medical bracelet so I'll get that back to you.. ok..""  This isn't the first time the Hudson family has laughed off rumors of a romance between Kate and Pitt, who is in the midst of a bitter divorce and custody battle with Angelina Jolie. Days before Oliver's Instagram post, a paparazzo asked Hawn, 71, if she was ""ready to have Brad as a son-in-law,"" causing the Snatched actress to burst out laughing, according to a video posted by The Sun.

"Long before Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux tied the knot (and ultimately split), he was perfectly happy with the status of their relationship. In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn‚Äôt have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.  ‚ÄúHe had reservations at the time because they still hadn‚Äôt figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen ‚Äî and probably always will be ‚Äî but marriage was never important to him,‚Äù the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. ‚ÄúMarriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn‚Äôt need it.‚Äù  But Aniston did. ‚ÄúConstant scrutiny of Jen‚Äôs personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,‚Äù the source tells Us. ‚ÄúIt was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn‚Äôt want to lose her, so they got married.‚Äù  In the end, things didn‚Äôt work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. ‚ÄúIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,‚Äù they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. ‚ÄúThis decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.‚Äù  Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, ‚ÄúNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else‚Äôs fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.‚Äù  The separation was caused in part by distance. ‚ÄúJen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,‚Äù a source previously told Us. ‚ÄúNew York City wasn‚Äôt ever going to be home for Jen.‚Äù  With reporting by Jen Heger.

"Jennifer Garner's pretend cooking show is getting a little bit more real with some help from the Barefoot Contessa herself, Ina Garten.  The actress has been showing her fans how to cook some super delicious meals for months in a recurring Instagram segment she calls her ""pretend cooking show.""  However, after previously shooting an episode of Barefoot Contessaalongside the famed TV chef, Garner was tapped to appear on Garten's Food Network special, Barefoot Contessa: Cook Like A Pro - Thanksgiving Special.  For her first televised edition of her ""pretend"" cooking series, Garner showed viewers how to make the perfect sweet potato pudding, which she says is her grandmother's special recipe.  ET's Keltie Knight recently caught up with the Camping star at the Baby2Baby Gala, presented By Paul Mitchell, at 3LABs in Culver City, California, on Saturday, and she opened up about shooting the special Thanksgiving episode for Barefoot Contessa.  ""We did it the way we normally do, my assistant and I, and then it's gonna be on her TV show!"" Garner explained, with a laugh. ""That's my big Thanksgiving plan.""  Garner has shot multiple installments in her ""pretend cooking show"" series, with some help from her personal assistant -- who has been her right-hand since she joined Instagram just over a year ago. In the videos, Garner cooks a real meal, and provides the recipe in the caption. Typically, a long version of the cooking lesson is shared to her IGTV page.  Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa: Cook Like a Pro Thanksgiving Special airs Saturday at 8 p.m. ET on the Food Network.  For more from the actress on her upcoming Turkey Day special.

"Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Tatum‚Äòs sudden split after nearly nine years of marriage came as a shock to fans, but there were signs the couple were drifting apart over the last few months.  The former couple announced the split in a joint statement exclusive to PEOPLE, saying, ‚ÄúWe have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple.‚Äù They added, ‚ÄúThere are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision ‚Äî just two best-friends realizing it‚Äôs time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.‚Äù  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In early March, Dewan, 37, walked the red carpet at the annual Vanity Fair Oscars after party without Tatum. When asked where the actor was, she told Entertainment Tonight he was home with their 4-year-old daughter Everly.  ‚ÄúHe is so happy to have a night off, yes,‚Äù she said. Not long after, Tatum, also 37, was spotted dining with a group of friends at Craig‚Äôs restaurant without Dewan Tatum.  RELATED VIDEO: Channing Tatum & Jenna Dewan ‚ÄòHave Lovingly Chosen to Separate‚Äô After Nearly 9 Years of Marriage  But the actress‚Äôs Oscars date night with BFF Emmanuelle Chriqui also wasn‚Äôt the only recent solo outing as of late.  Days after the Oscars, Dewan spent the day practicing her magic with Everly at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Los Angeles.  The couple ‚Äî who often gushed about each other on social media ‚Äî were also uncharacteristically mum over the last few months on their accounts.  However, as buzz of a split grew louder, they put on a united front and attended the Kids‚Äô Choice Awards together with their daughter and also shared cute snaps of a recent pool and face painting day in March.  In February, Dewan opened up to Health about the perception that she and Tatum had a ‚Äúperfect life,‚Äù saying instead that they worked hard to keep their relationship going.  ‚ÄúWhen people say you guys have such a perfect life, I want to scream and tell them no one‚Äôs perfect,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think there are such things as great fits. It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we‚Äôve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa.‚Äù  Dewan said while they always made sure to make time for one another, they still had days where they didn‚Äôt get along.  ‚ÄúBut I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work. Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always had the same values. But we‚Äôre not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don‚Äôt really like each other.‚Äù  Musing on the institution of marriage, Dewan said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there should be any expectation, any sort of ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre bonded to me for the rest of your life,‚Äô thick and thin. I think that‚Äôs an older generational thought.‚Äù  And while the former couple was known for posting countless photos together on social media, Tatum last posted about Dewan in December. He celebrated the actress‚Äô birthday with a heartfelt message.  ‚ÄúThis creature is one more year beautiful. The transformation she invoked this year has been something they only write about in books of fairytale and magic. Your strength and grace ever-evolving,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúBy doing so you make everything around you grow- everything. And I am so very grateful for your lessons. Happy life day my love.‚Äù  The two first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up, and began dating shortly after. They tied the knot in 2009."
"Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner are moving on with their lives a year after filing.  The duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn‚Äôt yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.  Since then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,‚Äù a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúThey continue to remain cordial to one another.

She hasn‚Äôt been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,‚Äù added the source.  ‚ÄúThe kids love when they all spend time together,‚Äù said a second source.

Garner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who‚Äôs continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. ‚ÄúAs long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,‚Äù another insider said. ‚ÄúShe will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.‚Äù  RELATED: Jennifer Garner and Kids Visit Ben Affleck in Hawaii for Easter Weekend  The actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles. Affleck has his eye on the space that boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms along with a screening room, gym, family room and maid‚Äôs room as well as a backyard with pool, spa, outdoor BBQ and guest house.  This comes months after the father of three was first spotted house hunting with Shookus.  ‚ÄúBen is looking to buy a family friendly house,‚Äù a source previously told PEOPLE in October 2017. ‚ÄúLindsay shared her opinions, but it was clear that they are not buying a house together.‚Äù  Affleck had been living in a rental since he moved out of the family estate he used to share with Garner.

One week after Kourtney Kardashian took Capitol Hill, E! News has learned Kim Kardashian West is in talks with the White House.  The ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" star's rep confirmed Wednesday that Kardashian West and Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, are speaking. This news follows Mic's report that Kardashian West and Ivanka Trump's husband are in talks about a ""possible presidential pardon or clemency"" for 62-year-old great-grandmother Alice Marie Johnson.

The show's first 13 episodes trace the tragically short life of a young high-school student named Hannah Baker who is assaulted, raped, and witness to a friend's rape. Viewers learn of this through a series of 13 tapes that Baker records before her death.  In the season finale, viewers watch Baker take her own life in slow, graphic, and horrifying detail ‚Äî something that directly contradicts guidelines from mental-health experts about how to depict suicide in a way that doesn't encourage others to follow suit.  But experts say that portrayal of suicide was not the producers' only dangerous mistake ‚Äî a far bigger issue is the way Baker is given authority, power, and essentially a second life after her death.  ""There was a kind of romanticization, and at the core of the story was this idea that you can kill yourself and be dead and yet not really be dead,"" Don Mordecai, Kaiser Permanente's national leader for mental health, told Business Insider. ""Because, of course, [Baker] continues to be a character ‚Äî she's in scenes, and she's still there in many ways.""  Mordecai and other experts warn that the portrayal could mislead viewers into believing that Baker's tale could apply to them. And the new season comes as suicide attempts among young people are rising.  Hannah Baker's 2nd life  Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette) finds Hannah Baker's (Katherine Langford) tapes on ""13 Reasons Why."" Netflix  By way of the 13 tapes Baker records before she dies, her character lives on throughout the show.  She's present in nearly every episode, not only as the chief narrator but as the main character recalling and reliving what happened to her. Baker is presented as a victim when she is alive and as powerful and dominant after her death.  As Baker's friend Clay Jensen listens to her recordings, he learns of the deep wrongdoings his peers committed, and he winds up forcing another student to admit what he did on tape.  It is a classic tale of revenge ‚Äî but it's also unrealistic and dangerous, researchers say.  By giving Baker's character power only in death, the show's creators portray suicide as romantic and vengeful. But the reality is the opposite: When we're gone, we have no self, no agency, and no power.  Last summer's disturbing trends  Baker in ""13 Reasons Why."" Netflix Two recent studies suggest that the show's timing could be particularly dangerous.  A study published Wednesday in the journal Pediatrics found that the rate of hospitalizations for suicidal thoughts or attempts among children and teens nearly tripled from 2008 to 2015.  The group with the highest rate of increase was teen girls.  Another more disturbing study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on the heels of the show's premiere last year found evidence that some viewers went online after watching and typed phrases like ""how to kill yourself"" into Google search.  Viewers also appeared to be searching for information about suicide prevention, but the trending searches with the sharpest uptick were about suicidal ideation, or thoughts about how to kill oneself.  The study found that searches for the phrase ""how to commit suicide,"" for example, were 26% higher than would have been expected, while ""commit suicide"" and ""how to kill yourself"" were 18% and 9% higher, respectively.  ""The time for more debate is over,"" John Ayers, an adjunct professor of behavioral science at San Diego State University who led the study, told Business Insider shortly after the paper was published. ""The makers [of '13 Reasons Why'] must swiftly change their course of action, including removing the show and postponing a second season.""  Ayers this week added: ""Is a warning label enough when the show is actually pushing children to contemplate or commit suicide? I don't think so.  ""This is akin to pushing someone down the stairs but warning the floors are slippery.""  Selena Gomez, the well-known singer who's one of the show's executive producers, has defended its portrayal of Baker's death, telling ""Good Morning America"" earlier this year that ""we wanted to do it in a way that was honest, and we wanted to make something that could hopefully help people.""  For the latest season of ""13 Reasons Why,"" Gomez added a warning that plays before every episode telling viewers about the sensitive content of the show. But that may not be sufficient. The show's first season also contained a warning ‚Äî though it was shorter and played before only some episodes ‚Äî advising young people to watch with an adult.  ""I'm sure many parents were there, sitting down watching and talking about it with their kids,"" Mordecai said. ""But I'm sure many were not.""

"The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can‚Äôt get legally at all.Asked to comment on his approval of a piece of legislation that basically promotes hatred towards women once stripped of all the legal terms, Pence argued in an interview with The Huffington Post that ‚Äúabortion as such was a mistake since the day it was first invented.‚Äù ‚ÄúSo, let‚Äôs get that straight right away ‚Äì I oppose abortion for any reason whatsoever because I believe that killing someone, or something, if you will, that hasn‚Äôt developed a consciousness just yet is the ultimate act of crime. And if we‚Äôre murderers of innocent beings who can‚Äôt defend themselves, how are we to expect people with a fully developed consciousness to stop murdering each other?‚Äù the Indiana governor said.‚ÄúAnd as if that wasn‚Äôt enough,‚Äù Pence continued, ‚Äúwe‚Äôve got this situation now throughout different states where some lawmakers allow abortion under some circumstances like rape or when the fetus is diagnosed with an illness, and others just flat out prohibit it. And that‚Äôs bad for a number of reasons. First and foremost ‚Äì we can‚Äôt have this kind of freedom of choice. This is bad, let‚Äôs be clear. And that‚Äôs part of the reason why I signed this bill, because I believe abortion, or I‚Äôm going to flat out call it murder, this murdering of children has to stop and it has to be prohibited in every state. So Indiana is just a step in the right direction.‚ÄùPence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. ‚ÄúFirst and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHowever, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We‚Äôd then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.‚ÄùDonald Trump‚Äôs new running mate also said, ‚ÄúBasically, if I‚Äôd have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they‚Äôd do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it‚Äôs not supposed to be like that. That would be equal to me picking up a butcher‚Äôs knife and slicing people open in the middle of the street. That would be murder. And I‚Äôm not a murderer.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd it gets worse ‚Äì when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana‚Äôs economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I‚Äôm telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,‚Äù Pence concluded."

"Former NBC host Billy Bush has lashed out at President Donald Trump for trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the now infamous ‚ÄúAccess Hollywood‚Äù tape, which captured Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women.  ‚ÄúOf course he said it,‚Äù Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, ‚ÄúYes, Donald Trump, You Said That‚Äù.

Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how ‚Äúyou can do anything‚Äù to women ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre a star.‚Äù He said he was able to ‚Äúgrab them by the pussy.‚Äù  After the recording‚Äôs release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as ‚Äúlocker room‚Äù banter.  More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times.  Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape‚Äôs release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump‚Äôs, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than ‚Äúhypothetical hot air from America‚Äôs highest-rated bloviator‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThere were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act,‚Äù Bush wrote.

"It feels like the royal wedding was just yesterday, but people are already placing bets on when Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will welcome a royal baby. Markle's father, Thomas Markle, only added to the speculation when he appeared on the U.K.'s Good Morning Britain this week and said ""I don't think there is a stork in the air yet but I think it will happen sooner or later.""    In so many ways, Meghan Markle's life as a Duchess is different from what most newlywed women experience, but in this way, it's pretty similar. While other women don't have millions of eyes watching them the way Markle does, constantly being asked if you're pregnant or trying to conceive can make a woman feel like she does.  Actress Gabrielle Union has previously stated that this isn't just a problem for women in the spotlight, like her and Markle, but for many women. ""People feel very entitled to know, 'Do you want kids?'"" Union said while promoting her book, We're Going to Need More Wine. ""A lot of people, especially people that have fertility issues, just say 'no' because that's a lot easier than being honest about whatever is actually going on. People mean so well, but they have no idea the harm or frustration it can cause.""  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle did go on record as being team kids during their first post-interview engagement with the BBC. When asked the kid question, Prince Harry replied, ""I think eventually, one step at a time and we'll start a family in the near future.""  That doesn't mean that it's happening right this moment.  If Meghan Markle and Prince Harry ever announce that a royal baby is on the way, we will be so happy for them, but until that day comes, we'd be happy if everyone but the couple kept the stork talk to themselves.  Planning a pregnancy is a personal, often private decision...even if you are the one of the most famous women in the world.  You might also like:"

Scroll down for video  Brothers Lyle (left) and Erik Menendez (right) were convicted of murdering their parents at the family's Beverly Hills mansion in 1996, in a case that shocked the nation  The brothers, then 18 and 21, shot their parents at home in 1989. Jose Menendez (second to right), a 45-year-old entertainment executive, was shot point-blank in the back of the head and Kitty Menendez, 47, (second to left) was found lying in a pool of blood in the hallway  Cast members of Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders special, have spoken out about the case. Gus Halper (left) and Miles Gaston Villanueva (right) play the brothers and said their punishments don't fit the crime. Lolita Davidovich (center), who plays their mother, said she believes the men deserve parole and said what they did was 'understandable'  The brothers, who initially blamed the killings on the mob, later claimed they shot their parents in self-defense after years of horrible sexual and emotional abuse by their father.  Lolita Davidovich, who plays slain mother Kitty in the NBC crime drama, said: 'I hope they do get parole. I think they deserve parole. I believe from the get-go, the next day, they regretted it...for sure.  'It was an act of passion, it was stupid, immature and it was tragic. So all four lives ended tragically.'  Davidovich, speaking at the 11th annual PaleyFest Fall TV Previews in Beverly Hills, added: 'No killing is justifiable but it is understandable. These boys' lives were torture and it was a rage killing.  'Premeditated by a day or two to get to the guns but they clearly couldn't endure anymore of the psychological, physical and emotional cumulative effect.  'The male brain doesn't form fully until the mid to late 20s - and they were kids. So the reality for them and expectations and the father's philosophy and it was a total warped reality. These boys deserve a lot of empathy.'  Lolita hopes that the show may help make people locked in 'pressure cooker situations' to reach out for help rather than committing rage actions.  Crime scene: Lyle and Erik murdered their parents, shooting them both to death inside the family's $5million Beverly Hills mansion (above the couch where Jose was shot)  The brothers, who initially blamed the killings on the mob, later claimed they shot their parents in self-defense after years of horrible sexual and emotional abuse by their father, Jose  Eventually the brothers testified that they were armed with 12-gauge shotguns when they burst into the den of their home and fatally shot their parents, while the couple watched TV. Pictured: The Beverly Hills mansion where the murders took place  Davidovich (pictured) speaking at the 11th annual PaleyFest Fall TV Previews in Beverly Hills, added: 'No killing is justifiable but it is understandable. These boys' lives was torture and it was a rage killing'  Leading actress Edie Falco, who plays defense attorney Leslie Abramson says that she feels the brothers' brutal retaliation after years of abuse made sense.  She said: 'We know who did this, but it does matter knowing the details behind this.  'To know exactly what happened to them 18 years previous to this murder, it matters - and it is stuff people should know.  'Edie says that the boys' excuse was backed up by more people all corroborating what we originally heard from the boys.'  The actors playing the brothers - Gus Halper (Erik Menendez) and Miles Gaston Villanueva, (Lyle Menendez) - also have 'empathy' for the pair.  Villanueva said: 'Does the punishment fit the crime? The answer is no and the reason is because of all the abuse that led up to it.  'I don't think it was right (they committed murders) and I think they would be the first to admit it was wrong. They made a huge mistake.'  Halper added: 'We want people to care about them. Hopefully people will come away with a better sense of what actually happened and the truth behind it. There is nothing in it that is untrue.'  The pair claimed that Erik will not watch the show, but is making his own documentary about the killings. Lyle will watch the series even though it is 'painful'.  Lolita Davidovich, who plays slain mother Kitty in the crime drama, said: 'I hope they do get parole. I think they deserve parole. I believe from the get go, the next day, they regretted it'  Actors playing the brothers think their sentence is too harsh, with Miles Gaston Villanueva saying: 'Does the punishment fit the crime? The answer is no and the reason is because of all the abuse that led up to it'. Pictured: Erik (left) and Lyle (right)  Halper (left) added: 'We want people to care about them. Hopefully people will come away with a better sense of what actually happened and the truth behind it. There is nothing in it that is untrue'  In January, Lyle told People that the two brothers remain close even though they are held in separate prisons.  'Our relationship has never changed,' Lyle, now 49, spoke from California‚Äôs Mule Creek State Prison. 'It‚Äôs very close. We write each other regularly.  'We even play chess through the mail, but it‚Äôs a little slow.'  Their story made headlines and shocked the US over several years following the slaying of Jose and Kitty Menendez.  The public's journey started when news broke of the murder on LA news channels after the brothers called 911 upon 'finding' their parents brutally murdered at their home.  At first they pleaded their innocence adding that the mob may have carried out the killings - given both parents were shot in the knees.  Later the case took a twist when the brothers confessed to the murders through their Beverly Hills therapist Jerome Oziel.  His girlfriend Judalon Smyth, played by Heather Graham in the show, went to police after she heard an audiotape of a therapy session in which the brothers discussed the killings.  After a first trial ended with two deadlocked juries, Los Angeles DA Gil Garcetti ordered a retrial. It led to the brothers being convicted of murder in March 1996  Now, Erik (right) spends time with terminally ill prisoners; Lyle (left) has been president of the inmate government for 15 years and runs a support group for prisoners who have endured childhood sexual abuse  The show centering on the horrific murders airs on September 26 on NBC  Smyth went from being a key prosecution witness to a witness for the defense later.  Eventually the brothers testified that they were armed with 12-gauge shotguns when they burst into the den of their home and fatally shot their parents, while the couple watched TV.  After a first trial ended with two deadlocked juries, Los Angeles DA Gil Garcetti ordered a retrial.  It led to the brothers being convicted of murder in March 1996.  Judge Stanley M. Weisberg of Los Angeles County Superior Court heard the jury not hand them the death sentence, but rule they should serve life imprisonment without parole.  Lyle insists that he and Erik have attempted to 'find meaning beyond the tragedy'.  Erik spends time with terminally ill prisoners; Lyle has been president of the inmate government for 15 years and runs a support group for prisoners who have endured childhood sexual abuse.  'We just keep trying to find something positive from the experiences that we had,' Lyle says.  He hopes to one day be reunited with his younger brother, now 46: 'To me it‚Äôs a remarkable achievement that [Erik] hasn‚Äôt committed suicide in prison, which is something I was originally worried about.  'The fact that he‚Äôs a regular guy, walking around as a functioning adult, is a triumph.'  The show airs on Tuesday, September 26 on NBC."
"The Hollywood premiere of Wonder Woman on Thursday got a double dose of Diana Prince. Gal Gadot, who plays the titular heroine in Patty Jenkins‚Äô film, joined original Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter on the red carpet.  Carter, who starred on the beloved TV series in the 1970s, previously teamed up with Gadot at the United Nations last year, when Wonder Woman was named an honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls. (The U.N. ultimately dropped that campaign two months later, after the initiative was met with criticism.)  ‚ÄúIn some magical and mystical way, there lies within each of us Wonder Woman,‚Äù Carter said at the time. ‚ÄúShe is real. She lives and she breathes. I know this because she lives in me, and she lives in the stories that these women tell me, day in and day out. I see it in the letters and in the stories. I read it on social media. I see it in the tears that fall from the eyes of the women who say it saved them from some awful thing that they endured ‚Äî because they saw that they could do something great.‚Äù  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  Gadot slipped on the Amazonian gauntlets first for Zack Snyder‚Äôs Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. She now headlines her own Wonder Woman movie, due in theaters June 2. Based on early reviews, the future looks bright for Diana. Gadot will also reprise the role on screen for Justice League.  The two actresses were photographed bowing down to each other in front of the cameras and director Jenkins. ‚ÄúWhat a wonderful movie!! Gal Gadot is fabulous as Wonder Woman. I had so much fun at the premiere,‚Äù Carter tweeted on Friday.  Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  Alberto E.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Angelina Jolie is being consoled by her former co-star Johnny Depp in the wake of her split from Brad Pitt, it's been claimed.  The mum-of-six, 41, and Johnny starred together in romantic thriller Tourist back in 2009 and are said to have remained friends ever since.  The pair also share the same divorce lawyer, Laura Wasser, who represented Johnny through his divorce from estranged wife Amber Heard.  Johnny, 53, reportedly recommended Laura, who has worked with a string of high-profile celebrity clients in the past, to Angelina after the actress was there to support him during his bitter break up.  ""Angelina idolised Johnny for years before she worked with him on The Tourist, and then the pair of them really hit it off on set,"" a source claimed to The Sun.  They continued: ‚ÄúBut the two of them have stayed in touch ever since then, and spoke regularly during the storm that surrounded Johnny‚Äôs break up with Amber.

TMZ reports that although the FBI is investigating the incident between Brad, 52, and Maddox, the case is likely to be dropped as conflicting accounts make it impossible to prove what happened.  And according to the website: ""DCFS [Department of Children & Family Services] social workers saw no evidence of injuries on Maddox and no one filed a police report after the incident.""  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  Sources close to Brad have previously insisted that allegations of abuse against him are ""exaggerated and fabricated"" with sources close to the actor hitting out at the ""smear campaign"" against him.  A source told DailyMail.com: ""These claims are exaggerated and fabricated.  ""It's unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.  ""They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of verbal disagreements like major households.  (Image: Getty Images)  ""Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.""  Maddox was adopted by Angelina from Cambodia when he was only a few months old in 2002 and Brad, who started dating Angelina a few years later, adopted him in 2006.  The couple also have children Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight together and all six children were onboard the flight when the row broke out.

"This Walking Dead article contains MAJOR SPOILERS for both the show and the comics.    The Walking Dead has finally entered the new world, as all of the different communities find peace after Rick's war with Negan. Alexandra, Hilltop, Kingdom, Sanctuary, and Oceanside have all found a way to live and work together to rebuild society. But this is The Walking Dead. That peace won't last forever, especially after the Whisperers arrive...    Which is why it's time to make some predictions, as we have with the past few seasons, about who is going to become zombie meat this year. For your reading pleasure, we've compiled a list of all the characters left on the show and predict whether they'll survive season nine or reach the end of the road.        We'll be updating this list with the results throughout the season as characters start dying. Here we go...AGAIN, MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!    DEAD                  Paul ""Jesus"" Rovia (Tom Payne)          Prediction: Lives    Result: Dead        Jesus was stabbed by a Whisperer while holding back the horde at the graveyard.            Arat (Elizabeth Ludlow)      Prediction: Lives    Result: Dead    Arat was executed for her past crimes by members of Oceanside.        Gregory (Xander Berkeley)      Prediction: Dies    Result: Dead    Gregory was hanged by Maggie in a public execution after he plotted to have her killed.    MIA          Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln)      Prediction: Dies    Result: MIA    After being severely wounded while saving the communities from a walker horde, Jadis cuts a deal with the mysterious chopper to transport Rick to parts unknown. AMC has announced that Rick will return in a series of original films.    Related Article: Our Review of Rick's Final Episode          Jadis/Anne (Pollyanna McIntosh)      Prediction: Dies    Result: MIA    Jadis flew off in a chopper to parts unknown with a severely injured Rick Grimes. We'll likely see more of her in those future Walking Dead movies.    STILL WALKING          Alden (Callan McAuliffe)      Prediction: Lives    A Savior turned Hilltopper, Alden is one of the newest additions to the cast. So far, his story really seems to revolve around Maggie. Is he a possible new love interest? That's the popular fan theory at the moment. Too bad Maggie's leaving the show this season...    Related Article: The Walking Dead's Most Shocking Deaths          Siddiq (Avi Nash)      Prediction: Lives    Siddiq joined Alexandria just as it said goodbye to Carl Grimes, who died in last year's midseason premiere. Now, he's an important member of the communities as a trained doctor. Avi Nash is a main cast member in season 9 and it'll be interesting to see how his story evolves in season 9. He should be relatively safe.        Enid (Katelyn Nacon)      Prediction: Lives    Enid began her time on the show as a loner and has over the years become a vital part of the Hilltop. We expect to see much more of her this season.    Related Article: A Spoiler-filled Guide to The Walking Dead Season 9          Tara Chambler (Alanna Masterson)      Prediction: Lives    It seemed that Tara was marked for death after getting his with one of Dwight's ""tainted"" arrows last season, but she didn't turn. With a fakeout last year, Tara is probably safe.            Dwight (Austin Amelio)      Prediction: Lives    I'm going with what I know from the comics about Dwight. He lives on for several arcs in the book, so there's no reason for me to suspect he'll die in season 9. The only question is whether he'll return to the show this season or at all...        King Ezekiel (Khary Payton)      Prediction: Dies    Ezekiel lost a lot in the war against Negan, including his beloved Shiva. But things are looking up for Ezekiel this year, as he rebuilds his kingdom and begins a relationship with Carol. Which is exactly why he'll die this year. We all know Carol is a bit cursed when it comes to loved ones. Ezekiel won't fare much better.    Related Article: New Walking Dead Movies and Shows Planned at AMC          Father Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam)      Prediction: Lives    Like Carol, Gabriel's really come a long way since his days as a cowardly priest in Georgia. I think Gabriel is probably safe for the time being, as long as he's still willing to fight.        Aaron (Ross Marquand)      Prediction: Dies    Aaron's has had a hard time these last few seasons. He even lost Eric in the fight against Negan. Will things turn around for him in season 9? We're not sure they will...        Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos)      Prediction: Lives    Rosita went through hell in season 7 and come out on the other side in season 8. The war is over and she's found peace now that Negan, who killed her beloved Abraham, is behind bars. The show has focused more on her these last two years and we expect new showrunner Angela Kang will find interesting ways to explore this character.        Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt)      Prediction: Lives    We've said it for several seasons: the mullet will never die and season 8 proved that when he survived working for Negan against Rick's coalition. A last minute plan to sabotage the Saviors saved Eugene's life. A year and a half later, Eugene might be back in the good grace's of the other communities.    Related Article: How Walking Dead Villains Are Influenced by History          Judith Grimes      Prediction: Lives    AMC IS NEVER GOING TO KILL A TODDLER. Right?        Carol Peletier (Melissa McBride)      Prediction: Lives    Carol has gone through hell and back over and over. From domestic violence to losing her daughter to being exiled to baking cookies to losing her lust for blood and ditching Alexandria to going to war against the Saviors, Carol has faced it all on this show. She's survived it all and she'll survive season 9.        Maggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan)      Prediction: Lives    Yes, Lauren Cohan is leaving the show, but hear us out: Cohan has said that Maggie's fate will be left open-ended, which means that she won't necessarily die. We'll just have to wait and see.        Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus)      Prediction: Lives    This badass fan favorite is never going to die. At least not this season...File this guy under immortal.    Related Article: How to Fix The Walking Dead's Daryl Dixon          Michonne (Danai Gurira)      Prediction: Lives    Michonne is as important to Alexandria as Rick, and with the Sheriff on his way out, the settlement will be looking for a new leader. It'll undoubtedly be Michonne. She's safe this year, but with Danai Gurira becoming a bigger star by the minute (we love Okoye), her time on the show may be coming to an end eventually.        Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)      Prediction: Lives    After making such a big deal about Rick sparing Negan at the end of season 8, there's no way the former Savior leader will die any time soon.

"Meghan Markle penned an emotional essay for Elle UK about her experience as a biracial actress in Hollywood.  In the piece, which was first published in July last year and resurfaced on Sunday, December 11, the Suits star, 35, opened up about the hardships she‚Äôs faced as an ‚Äúethnically ambiguous‚Äù talent in showbiz.  ‚ÄúBeing ‚Äòethnically ambiguous,‚Äô as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role. Morphing from Latina when I was dressed in red, to African-American when in mustard yellow; my closet filled with fashionable frocks to make me look as racially varied as an ‚Äô80s Benetton poster,‚Äù wrote Markle, whose dad is Caucasian and mother is African American. ‚ÄúSadly, it didn‚Äôt matter: I wasn‚Äôt black enough for the black roles, and I wasn‚Äôt white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn‚Äôt book a job.‚Äù  Given the challenges Markle faced in her career because of her unique look, the Los Angeles native ‚Äî who is currently dating Prince Harry ‚Äî explained that playing Rachel Zane on Suits was a dream role because producers didn‚Äôt cast the part with a specific ethnicity in mind.  ‚ÄúThe series was initially conceived as a dramedy about a N.Y. law firm flanked by two partners, one of whom navigates this glitzy world with his fraudulent degree. Enter Rachel Zane, one of the female leads and the dream girl ‚Äî beautiful and confident with an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. ‚ÄòDream girl‚Äô in Hollywood terms had always been that quintessential blond-haired, blue-eyed beauty ‚Äî that was the face that launched a thousand ships, not the mixed one,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúBut the show‚Äôs producers weren‚Äôt looking for someone mixed, nor someone white or black for that matter. They were simply looking for Rachel. In making a choice like that, the Suits producers helped shift the way pop culture defines beauty.‚Äù  Markle continued: ‚ÄúThe choices made in these rooms trickle into how viewers see the world, whether they‚Äôre aware of it or not. Some households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you. And with Suits, specifically, you have Rachel Zane. I couldn‚Äôt be prouder of that.‚Äù  The brunette beauty‚Äôs essay comes just over a month since her royal beau, 32, spoke out against those who have criticized her amid news of their romance. As previously reported, Harry publicly acknowledged his relationship with Markle in a statement released on November 8.  ‚ÄúThe past week has seen a line crossed,‚Äù read the one-page letter released by Harry‚Äôs communications secretary, Jason Knauf. ‚ÄúHis girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public ‚Äî the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.‚Äù  The statement continued, ‚ÄúPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle‚Äôs safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‚Äòthe price she has to pay‚Äô and that ‚Äòthis is all part of the game.‚Äô He strongly disagrees. This is not a game ‚Äî it is her life and his.‚Äù  Harry and Markle (who was previously married to film producer Trevor Engelson from 2011 to 2013) began dating in June.

"Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban take PDA to a new level on Cannes red carpet  REGIS DUVIGNAU Cute or a bit too much? Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban weren't shy about showing affection on the red carpet at Cannes.  The Nic-aissance has officially hit Cannes, with Nicole Kidman promoting no fewer than four movies at the film festival this year.  The actress understands that the notorious press calls, complete with wall-to-wall photographers, on those red carpet steps, are the most important aspect of a movie's promotion.  Where else but in Cannes do we witness the perfect melange of decadence, frivolity and just a splash of tacky? Not even The Met Ball can guarantee this level of fashion extra-ness.  Andreas Rentz The couple starts with some hand-holding...  This goes some way to explaining the piece of performance art produced by Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, at the premiere of The Killing of a Scared Deer.  READ MORE:  * Naomie Harris barefoot in Cannes is all of us after a big night out  * Sofia Coppola and Nicole Kidman lead Cannes Film Festival 2017 lineup  * Best & worst dressed: 2016 Cannes Film Festival so far  JEAN-PAUL PELISSIER And some hand-kissing...  The nuzzles, the elongated looks, the soft nibbles on the neck, the fingers, entwined in climactic pleasure, all combine to create what might best be titled ""Le Public de Love Making"", which is probably the grossest sentence ever written, but if the oversized tutu fits ...  At one point, Urban took hold of his wife's long hair and gently pulled at it while gripping her bare back, in what might be described as a classic Mills and Boon cover move.  It isn't the first time the couple have put their PDA on display. It's actually something of a sensuous habit. At this year's Oscars, Kidman and Urban engaged in the sort of kissing normally reserved for couples bidding farewell at the airport‚Ä¶ in a private room‚Ä¶ on a military base.  ERIC GAILLARD There's also a bit of eye-gazing...  When Kidman is able to come up for air, she tends to look a little coy. This moment is usually alleviated by Urban through prolonged eye contact followed by a ""presentation"" of his wife to photographers.  If the move seems familiar, it's because it is.  In 1992, when Kidman made her debut at Cannes, she arrived with her then husband, Tom Cruise, a man who is not shy of presenting wives and belief-defying displays of public affection.  ERIC GAILLARD There's even a few tears.  All of which begs, was it Tom who influenced Nicole, or the other way around? Kidman, who has admitted to social introversion, has said several times that she finds the red carpet nerve-wracking, and to ease her butterflies, she goes into her own private world.  This admission makes sense ‚Äì it's not performance PDA then, but an attempt to cope with the onslaught of cameras.  It also explains why she also held hands with, and leaned on Colin Farrell at the premiere, too. Although, considering Farrell has lost none of his own scrappy brand of Celtic sensuality, there's really no explanation required.  ERIC GAILLARD And we can't really blame her for cuddling up to Colin Farrell.  - dailylife.com.au"

"Serena Williams is officially back. She revealed on Instagram on Wednesday that she will return to professional tennis on Thursday, at Indian Wells, which coincides with International Women's Day.  It would be a bit of an understatement to call Serena excited.  A lot has changed for the tennis superstar in the past year. She gave birth to her daughter and endured scary ordeal in the hospital after having an emergency C-section that left her bed-ridden for six weeks. Her return coincides with a new Nike ad campaign, unveiled during Sunday night's Oscars broadcast, with Williams spreading the message that ""there's no wrong way to be a woman.""  On Thursday, Williams will get back to what thrust her into the public eye by returning to the tennis court against Zarina Diyas at Indian Wells in California, one of the larger non-Grand Slam tournaments. Williams hasn't played in a singles match since Jan. 28, 2017, when she won the Australian Open while approximately two months pregnant. After that, Williams took her leave. She gave birth to her daughter, Alexis Ohanian Jr., on Sep. 1 before suffering a serious scare post-pregnancy, in which Williams said she could have died without the quality health-care she had. After six weeks of bed rest, Williams started practicing again in December. She was hoping to be back in time for the 2018 Australian Open, but she ended up withdrawing.  Williams has played professional matches, just not singles. Her official return was on Feb. 11 in a doubles match with Venus Williams in the Fed Cup. She was visibly rusty, and the sisters were swept 6-2, 6-3 against the Netherlands.  According to Venus, however, Serena is just fine.  ""She's got power, depth. She knows how to play,"" Venus said at the Tie Break Tens Tournament in Madison Square Garden, via ABC. ""Yeah, awesome game.""  Williams returns to the singles pro circuit with a clean slate. She isn't ranked officially, but she's one Grand Slam title behind Margaret Court. Court finished her career with 24 Grand Slams, whereas Williams has 23.  Williams could face Venus as early as the third round in Indian Wells, if the sisters both advance. Serena's first opponent will be Diyas, while a potential second-round match would be against Kiki Bertens.  There's a lot on the line at Indian Wells. It will be a good first look at Williams to see where she stands, and although it's probably unrealistic to expect her to win, gauging progress will be key. Williams' goals, however, are as lofty as ever.  ""Serena's target will be to win Grand Slams,"" said Williams' coach, Patrick Mouratoglou in an interview with WTATennis.com. ""She knows that coming back might take some time, but her level of expectation is high as always. There are three Grand Slams (French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) left this season. They will be her three main goals for 2018.""  Williams is a three-time French Open winner, a seven-time Wimbledon champion and a six-time US Open winner. Williams is already 36, while Court retired when she was 35. Longevity is hardly a question for her. Williams is the oldest woman to hold a WTA No. 1 ranking at 35 years, 224 days, holding the spot until May 8, 2017. To leave, miss a year, have a child, and return at age 36? That sounds like Williams' kind of challenge."

"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about ""the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love.""  Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation‚Äôs favorite couples ‚Äî but it didn't always look that way.  Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.  But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.  Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question.  ""We were always going to get married,"" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. ""Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn‚Äôt have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.‚Äù  Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise.  Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise ‚Äî and they now have their first child on the way.  When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. ‚ÄúWe were sort of in that wedding glow,‚Äù Bass explains. ‚ÄúIt felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.‚Äù  Waddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass‚Äô face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. ‚ÄúHis jaw was on the floor.‚Äù  Bass added, ‚ÄúIt felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.‚Äù The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings.  Other Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. ""Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,"" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass‚Äô groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: ‚ÄúWells was like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care man. I‚Äôm there.‚Äô‚Äù  The morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.  Looking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show ‚Äî and potentially the series ‚Äî would ever resume. ‚ÄúI felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,"" he now says. ""I trust everyone that‚Äôs a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.""  In the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set ‚Äî something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode. Though new Paradise drinking rules were later put in place, the newlyweds said alcohol wasn't an issue during their wedding. ‚ÄúNo one drank that much. It wasn‚Äôt like a crazy affair,‚Äù Bass says, while Waddell says she didn't even have time to drink at her own wedding.  ""Paradise is a great parody of life,"" says Bass. ""I love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love. It‚Äôs very American. We‚Äôre ridiculous, but it‚Äôs awesome.‚Äù  And he still disagrees that Paradise is ""a drunk hookup show,"" something both Harrison and ABC reality chief Robert Mills echoed to THR earlier this week. ""There‚Äôs sexuality on the show,"" Bass says. ""The parts that are shown are sort of the fun, wild parts, but there‚Äôs so much more that happens, like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other. People don‚Äôt really drink that much. The show was more about relationships and discovering yourself.‚Äù  Waddell adds, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.‚Äù  Waddell, now 13.5 weeks pregnant, says their baby is the size of a peach. The pair, who are due around Valentine's Day, are calling it a ""love child"" and will find out the sex of the baby in a week or so.  ""We‚Äôre out of our minds with excitement,"" she says.  ""The Bachelor producers are some of our greatest friends now,"" she adds. ""We were texting them pictures of our ultrasound, that‚Äôs how close we‚Äôve become.""  During the wedding, all three of Bass' sons from a previous relationship spoke. Waddell described 16-year-old son Nathan's speech as being incredible because he called Carly ""Mom."" ""He‚Äôs an introvert so him getting up at all and saying the things he did meant so much to us,"" she says.  As for the rest of the Paradise season ‚Äî which returns to ""being Paradise"" after addressing the shutdown in the first two weeks ‚Äî Bass and Waddell say they are ready to pass the torch.  ""There‚Äôs going to be another couple this season that takes our place,"" says Bass, whose advice to making it as a couple is to ignore the negativity. ""You can‚Äôt let the haters affect your relationship,"" he adds. ""There‚Äôs no way it doesn‚Äôt affect you, but you have to work through that together. It‚Äôs crazy how one person‚Äôs tweet affects you.""  Waddell adds, ""Just be real and be honest."""

"Anmer Hall is a Georgian country house in the village of Anmer in Norfolk, England. It is about 12 miles (19 km) north east of King's Lynn, about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of the Queen's residence at Sandringham[1] and about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of Houghton Hall. Anmer Hall was a wedding gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from the Queen.[2]  The current house was built in the 18th century and has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898. The house was registered as a Grade II* listed building in 1984 but was later de-listed.[3]  History [ edit ]  The current late-Georgian house dates from the 18th century, although it may be built around an earlier core. It has two storeys and attic with dormer windows. The long south front comprises 13 bays, and was refaced with red bricks c. 1815. It has 13 ground-floor windows set in blank arches and a semicircular porch on two Tuscan columns, with 11 windows on the first floor. The three central bays are topped by a pediment. The north front is of rubble carstone and includes four c. 17th century ogee-headed sashes on the first floor. Renovations c. 1900 added a brick dressed skin to the north front, together with a projecting entrance porch and a tower towards the eastern end, in the corner formed with a carstone service wing also added c. 1900.  The surrounding estate became a scheduled ancient monument in 2003, and includes earthworks marking the sites of buildings from the medieval village of Anmer.[4] The village church, St Mary, lies close to the house, but a short distance away from the modern village.  Occupants [ edit ]  Anmer Hall was the seat of the Coldham family from at least 1705. The Sandringham estate was bought by Queen Victoria in 1862 as a wedding present for the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, and neighbouring land was added to the estate in the subsequent years.  In 1896, the estate was purchased at auction for ¬£25,000 by the famed serial fraudster[5] Ernest Terah Hooley before his first bankruptcy. The Prince had attempted to purchase the property prior to Hooley's acquisition.[6] Through an intermediary, the Prince asked Hooley that he be allowed to purchase it from him, ostensibly for his daughter Maud. Hooley agreed, allowing him to buy it at cost in 1898. It has been alleged that a motivation for the Prince's action was to avoid the possibility of Hooley's business promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley, whom the Prince had earlier forced from Society, from becoming a constant guest on the estate, and therefore near-neighbour.[7] Together with the Prince's eldest son and an equerry, Broadley had been implicated in the Cleveland Street Scandal.[8][9]  Anmer Hall, shown with new roof, in October 2014  Anmer Hall was leased to John Loader Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby (1877‚Äì1969), who was to become Governor-General of the Sudan, Permanent Secretary of the Colonial Office and wartime Ambassador to Dublin. His daughter Penelope (1910‚Äì2005) socialised with the Royal Family, and was reportedly a favourite of King George V.  From 1972 to 1990, the house was leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house. In February 1990, the Duke and Duchess of Kent left Anmer Hall, moving to Crocker End House in Nettlebed in Oxfordshire. From 1990 to 2000, it was rented by Hugh van Cutsem (1941‚Äì2013).[1] It was then leased to the family of James Everett, owner of kitchen timber company Norfolk Oak.[10]  In January 2013, it was reported that the Queen had allocated Anmer Hall for use by William, Duke of Cambridge, his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and family.[11][12][13] The lease to the Everett family was terminated early, before its expiry in 2017, to allow redevelopment.[14]  To accommodate the Duke and Duchess using the house as their main residence whilst William worked as a pilot for East Anglian Air Ambulance, a ¬£1.5 million refurbishment programme was put in place. Paid for from private Royal family funds, this included: a complete new roof; new kitchen; the addition of a conservatory designed by architect Charles Morris (who previously designed extensions to Highgrove House);[1] complete internal redecoration; and an extensive tree-planting programme to afford the Duke and Duchess greater privacy.[15]"

"It looks like the plastic straw may be going the way of the fax machine and fountain pen: Starbucks, the world‚Äôs biggest coffee seller, announced plans to nix straws at all of its stores by 2020. The chain, with more than 28,000 locations, is officially the largest food company in the world to make this promise, and has the power and influence to spur other restaurants of all sizes to follow in its footsteps. Starbucks estimates that this move will eliminate the use of 1 billion plastic straws per year.  Starbucks says it will replace plastic straws with paper or compostable plastic straws for blended drinks like Frappuccinos. These alternative straws will be available by request for customers who need or wish to use a straw. Otherwise, for cold brew, nitro, and other iced drinks, the coffee company will offer strawless lids, which it designed and manufactures. Already in use at more than 8,000 Starbucks stores, these lids look exactly like the tops to adult sippy cups, and, curiously are also made of plastic. Still, environmentalists seem to be supporting Starbucks‚Äô move.  Plastic straws are kind of like a gateway plastic for every day citizens. As the founder of strawfree.org told the New York Times: ‚ÄúI think a lot of people feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the plastic problem ‚Ä¶ Giving up plastic straws is a small step, and an easy thing for people to get started on. From there, we can move on to larger projects.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFor our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,‚Äù Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and CEO, said in a release.  Seattle and Vancouver-area Starbucks locations will be the first to go straw-free.  The now-ubiquitous straw-free movement seemed to come out of nowhere earlier this year. McDonald‚Äôs in the UK announced earlier this year that it would switch from plastic to paper straws by this fall, but its U.S. counterpart has yet to follow suit. Meanwhile, metropolitan areas across the country, from Malibu to Seattle, have already passed straw bans, and cities like Berkeley and New York are facing similar proposed legislation. Earlier this summer Lettuce Entertain You, a restaurant group out of Chicago, also said it would cease use of plastic straws at 120 of its locations.  Per a release, Starbucks also says it‚Äôs still working on a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup. The company is spending $10 million on the initiative, which is in partnership with Closed Loop Partners, through the NextGen Cup Consortium and Challenge.  ‚Ä¢ Starbucks to Eliminate Plastic Straws Globally by 2020 [Official]  Related The state of straws around the world"
"Caitlyn Jenner is secretly planning a wedding with her much younger, rumored girlfriend, Sophia Hutchins, according to a shocking new report! Here‚Äôs the scoop.  Despite a 47-year age difference, Caitlyn Jenner, 68, and Sophia Hutchins, 21, have been spending quite a bit of time together lately, and now, there are rumors that they may even be getting married! ‚ÄúThey consider each other soul mates and freely admit they couldn‚Äôt imagine a life with anyone else at this point,‚Äù an insider tells RadarOnline. The site also reports that Caitlyn and Sophia are making ‚Äúsecret plans to tie the knot‚Äù and that Caitlyn is actually in a rush to get married again after her fallout with the Kardashian sisters.  ‚ÄúCait has a wedding planner to handle all the details,‚Äù Radar‚Äôs source claims.‚ÄùThis is a dream come true for Cait because her rejection by the Kardashians had left her feeling isolated. Sophia has changed all that.‚Äù The ladies are reportedly planning their nuptials for this summer in Malibu. However, an insider tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY that reports of an engagement and upcoming wedding for Caitlyn and Sophia are ‚Äúnot true.‚Äù  It‚Äôs no secret that Caitlyn and Sophia have a very close relationship, though. Romance rumors first began in 2017, when the women were seen together in Mexico. Recently, they‚Äôve been photographed out and about together quite a bit, although they‚Äôve never confirmed any reports of a romance.  Like Caitlyn, Sophia is a transgender woman. She came out with her decision to transition in a 2016 article in her school newspaper at Pepperdine University. It is rumored that Sophia is living with Caitlyn in Malibu, with those reports fueled by several photos taken in Caitlyn‚Äôs home on Sophia‚Äôs Instagram page. The women recently attended the Erasing the Stigma Leadership Awards together on April 26, as well as the GLAAD Media Awards earlier that month."
"Megan and Terence go toe-to-toe during their sessions, and Megan learns A LOT about Terence‚Äôs past on the March 25 of ‚ÄòThe Arrangement.‚Äô Here‚Äôs a recap of what went down!  Megan is staying busy with her sessions with Terence this week on The Arrangement. He really wants to dig deep into her feelings and accelerate their work. He knows that Megan is bullish*tting him. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something else at the core of your stress,‚Äù Terence says. That‚Äôs an understatement. The first table read for Technicolor Highway has arrived, and Kyle is so excited. While reading, Xavier gets really into it, but Megan holds back. Afterwards, Shaun notices an angry Terence on the phone. She confronts him about it, but he acts like everything is all good.  Kyle tells Terence to not rattle Megan during their sessions. She needs to be on point. At their next session, Terence and Megan look at her audition tape. He thinks she‚Äôs not being completely honest about what she‚Äôs afraid of. ‚ÄúSomething is still triggering you,‚Äù Terence says. This fear is manifesting in the form of stomach pain. Finally, Megan breaks. When he asks again, Megan confesses, ‚ÄúYOU.‚Äù Terence controls every aspect of her life. ‚ÄúI live in this constant fear of disappointing you,‚Äù she admits. She‚Äôs afraid of losing everything at the hands of a man that she doesn‚Äôt know at all.  Terence takes her out to a diner so they can get to know each other. Terence reveals the strangest thing about his childhood ‚Äî that he used to eat butter with his french fries. When his mom found him eating that, she punished him by making him eat WHOLE STICKS OF BUTTER. Child abuse comes in many different forms.  Megan doesn‚Äôt shy away from the tough questions. She asks him point-blank if it bothers him from being in the shadows his whole life. Terence says he embraces that and loves helping people reach their true potential. He admits that watching Kyle‚Äôs rise to fame has been the greatest joy of his life. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like a son to me,‚Äù Terence says. Megan asks Terence about kids, and Terence says it wasn‚Äôt a good fit for him and DeAnn. When Megan questions him about his dad, Terence starts to get suspicious. Megan plays Terence at his own game. She asks him to tell her his greatest fear. He confesses his brush with death. Powerlessness is his greatest fear, and that‚Äôs been his greatest fear since childhood. Megan has managed to expose Terence and wants to take advantage of the situation, but Shaun thinks she should hold back for a bit.  During dinner, Mason breaks it to DeAnn that she has to go back to Napa. DeAnn doesn‚Äôt want her to leave yet. She‚Äôs openly pissed that Mason is running again. This is just the same dance they‚Äôve been doing for decades. After seeing an intimate moment with Shaun and Terence, DeAnn calls Mason and says she wants more.  Meanwhile, Kyle is working hard with Xavier, who is getting frustrated with not knowing his lines. Kyle gets Xavier to open up about being bullied as a kid. Xavier gets his rage all bottled up, but Kyle wants him to tap into that rage.  At lunch with Xavier and Naseem, Kyle brings up Megan‚Äôs mom, and she‚Äôs not happy about it. Her dead mom is off limits. She believes Kyle was testing her. Kyle confronts her about being distracted, which Megan doesn‚Äôt take well. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre afraid I‚Äôm going to suck,‚Äù Megan tells Kyle. He brings up that she barely performed at the table read and she‚Äôs never carried a film before. There‚Äôs a lot on the line with this movie. Not just with Megan, but with Kyle. Megan and Kyle continue to fight, and she blasts him for projecting his fear of failure onto her. Thankfully, they makeup the next day. Kyle stresses that he does trust her. But does she trust him? That‚Äôs the real question.  Kyle admits to Xavier that he has rage issues, too. The boys run into a group of guys who start taunting Kyle. Xavier throws a punch, and Kyle finds himself in the middle of the action.  Megan continues trying to break Terence down, but Terence tries to turn the tables and regain control. Terence tells Megan that her fear of him is just a projection for her fear of her father, who abandoned her when she was a baby. Everyone in her life abandoned her. She‚Äôs so angry and has been holding it in her entire life. Terence notes that it‚Äôs going to keep eating her up from the inside until she does something about it. Terence and Megan are a lot alike. They come from similar backgrounds, and both of them are going to take advantage of their vulnerabilities.  On the first day of production, Megan doesn‚Äôt get off to the best start. But when she‚Äôs on, she‚Äôs really on. After wrapping the first day, Terence gives Megan information about her father. Their work together is done, but her work with her father is just beginning.  The episode ends with Terence telling DeAnn that he wants to reopen the conversation about becoming parents. DeAnn doesn‚Äôt seem exactly thrilled about the idea. But she‚Äôs distracted. She keeps calling Mason, and when she finally gets a hold of Mason‚Äôs son, she gets devastating news."

"It is usually seen as a good thing when exes are able to remain amicable after their divorce, most notably Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner, who have been spotted together with their kids on many occasions after their split. Lindsay Shookus, his current girlfriend, doesn‚Äôt see their friendliness as a good thing as OK! has exclusively reported that she gave him an ultimatum about their relationship during a dramatic showdown in Hawaii recently.  An insider claimed that Lindsay started to feel unsettled about their year-long relationship after she heard of a secret sleepover in early March between Ben and Jen at the California home they once shared with their children Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel. Lindsay, who has a 5-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, ‚Äúunderstands that Ben needs to be there for his children,‚Äù says the source, ‚Äúbut she found it strange that he went to the marital home and spent the night.‚Äù  Even though she tried to brush off his overnight stay, she couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that ‚Äúevery time things seem to be going well, something happens to remind her that Jen and the kids come first,‚Äù according to the source.

The source said that although Ben is not reconciling with his wife, he did indicate how proud he is of how hard they work at their relationship, and that he‚Äôll always choose Jen‚Äôs wishes for their family over everything else.  The source also claims that Ben is sober, healthy, and ‚Äúin a really good place‚Äù minus the tension with Lindsay.

"Over the years, there have been dozens of sports movies pitting the lovable underdogs against the seemingly unbeatable elites ‚Äî it‚Äôs a classic American story. But none were perhaps as big of a surprise hit as 2004‚Äôs Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, the film starred Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller as, respectively, the underdog owner of failing gym Average Joe‚Äôs and the elite fitness guru trying to push the facility out of business. Backed by a wide and deep cast that also featured Justin Long as a male cheerleader, Alan Tudyk as a 24-7 pirate cosplayer, Rip Torn as a weathered old dodgeball coach, Christine Taylor as an athletically gifted lawyer, and more, Dodgeball was a surprise hit that summer, earning $167 million worldwide on a reported $20 million budget.  And while a long-discussed sequel to the film has never materialized, Dodgeball fans scored the next best thing on Wednesday morning when Omaze launched a new charity campaign with a video that reunites the original cast. The clip, seen above, stars Stiller as Globo Gym chief White Goodman, who‚Äôs back to implore viewers to team up with him in Omaze‚Äôs new contest. But, lo and behold, Vaughn‚Äôs Peter LaFleur is on hand too, along with Long and Taylor, to represent the Average Joe‚Äôs. Hilarity ensues and so does a request: Fans are encouraged to pick a side by signing up via Omaze‚Äôs website (either omaze.com/globo or omaze.com/joes) for the chance to play dodgeball with Stiller himself. Proceeds will benefit the Stiller Foundation, which supports education initiatives for children around the world.  EW talked with Stiller about filming the new video and looking back on the ‚Äútrue underdog story,‚Äù 13 years later.  Omaze  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What did it feel like to step back into the White Goodman shoes?  BEN STILLER: It was really strange and fun. I didn‚Äôt know what it would be like, because I was away from it for so long and I never really thought there would be any reason to do the character again, but then when this opportunity came up, especially talking to Omaze and what good ideas for fundraising there would be, over the years we‚Äôve been aware of people who are fans of the movie and their connection with it, which I‚Äôve appreciated. It‚Äôs fun to connect with people on something like that ‚Äî like at Halloween, I see people dressed up as the movie and things like that. To me, it was really important when we said we could do it, the first person I called was Rawson Thurber, who wrote and directed the movie, and said, ‚ÄúHey would you get on board with this thing? If you would write and direct this thing, we could put the band back together.‚Äù That was the key to it, these things don‚Äôt exist in a vacuum in terms of the writing and situation. Once Rawson said yes, I called Vince up, and he immediately said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in, let‚Äôs do it, it‚Äôs for a good cause.‚Äù Then we got Justin Long and Christine Taylor and Missi Pyle and everybody; it was really exciting for us all to get back together. So we got our Halloween costumes, and luckily it‚Äôs Spandex so it all still kind of fit.  Are these new costumes?  We found the original costumes, literally the original mustache, and wig, this ratty old caterpillar of a mustache. Then it was one of those things where it came back, in terms of the dynamic. I think Rawson wrote a great little piece, it was really fun. We were in a gym and shooting, so it was a very similar situation to when we did the movie except all these years have gone by. So it was kind of bizarre yet fun, but also weird and eerie how everything came back, like Vince‚Äôs reactions and our whole dynamic. The dynamic is important when you‚Äôre doing a character like White because the whole thing is based on the dynamic of them playing off each other. That was really fun to jump back in.  Where did you come up with the character for White?  I honestly don‚Äôt know. It all kind of comes from the Tony Robbins impression that I tried to do on The Ben Stiller Show, and then it became Tony Perkis from Heavyweights [whom Stiller played] and then it morphed into White Goodman. I don‚Äôt have that many moves, really. It‚Äôs funny because once you do the makeup and get the wig on, then you‚Äôre suddenly like, ‚ÄúOh yeah, I got this.‚Äù But I did watch a couple YouTube clips from the movie to reacquaint myself with what I was doing.  The original movie is so rich with one-liners and little absurdities. Are there things even you forget about and then get reminded of by fans?  Oh yeah. I don‚Äôt go back and rewatch the movie a lot unless I‚Äôm flipping across the channels and something comes up and I‚Äôll watch for a second. So some of those lines from the movie I remember really well, and then other ones not as well, so it‚Äôs funny when people love a very specific thing. ‚ÄúNobody makes me bleed my own blood‚Äù is one that has always kinda stuck with me. In terms of what people respond to, it‚Äôs always interesting. I‚Äôm always surprised and very happy when people have something they connect with like that, because I know I have those moments with movies that I loved watching growing up. Now that the movie‚Äôs been around so long, I hear a lot from kids in their 20s who loved it from when they were kids. That‚Äôs the thing I remember from that age: Movies affect you so much, and they stick with you. So that‚Äôs really kinda cool.  What do you remember most about making Dodgeball?  I remember having a lot of fun making the movie. It was so ridiculous when we were doing it, I remember doing scenes where I was feeling kind of embarrassed because I thought it‚Äôs so ridiculous, and the movie was not necessarily a guaranteed success. In terms of like moments that I remember, I remember Chuck Norris being there and that being very exciting. I remember he came in on a chopper ‚Äì you‚Äôd probably expect nothing less. I remember doing the dodgeball scenes themselves, that being very involved.  Did you guys have to actually become good at the actual sport?  Well, we tried. We had some very choreographed shots and things, but when you‚Äôre playing dodgeball, it‚Äôs hard not to get into it. It‚Äôs that very visceral thing we all remember from eighth grade, so everyone was trying to do their best. I just remember laughing a lot, and feeling like gosh, this could just be the end of everything.  Omaze is giving fans the opportunity to choose between the Average Joe‚Äôs and Globo Gym‚Äôs Purple Cobras. What would you say to people to convince them to join the Purple Cobras?  It‚Äôs more like Omaze is giving people the chance to go with a Winner or a La-loser. And Purple Cobras have much cooler uniforms."

"For the season finale of ""Hollywood Medium,"" psychic Tyler Henry connected with the granddaddy of all spirits: Michael Jackson.  The medium met with La Toya Jackson for the reading, where the musician's untimely death in 2009 was the main topic of conversation for all parties involved.  ""I have had a reading before, and I'm not always a believer,"" Jackson admitted before the reading. ""Because you don't know if they're reading you form information the know or not. I cannot wait to see what he tells me.""  Even before Henry learned who he'd be doing a reading for, he was getting vibes from the other side, with references to a furry bird sitting on someone's shoulder and someone's premature passing on his way to La Toya's home. Once he found out she was his client for the day, Henry admitted, ""I'm in shock. Today, I was so starstruck, I had to consciously calm myself down, which is normally something I don't have to do.""  Before getting to Michael, Henry told La Toya he could sense tension in her neck and throat area, something she confirmed. ""You're right, sometimes my mouth get locked and I can't close it and the tension is always here,"" she explained.  ""There's a lot there. I don't even know where to start. There was a funny joke about someone having a cockatoo,"" Henry said as the reading went on. ""We had one growing up,"" she confirmed. Henry then said he felt someone come through on his drive over, before admitted his did know, ""to some extent,"" how La Toya's brother died.  ""When he came through, I had to focus on every message exactly as he was delivering it. I couldn't make any guesses, I couldn't have any assumptions, I had to make sure that I was communicating exactly what he was showing me so I wasn't biased with what I already knew about the case,"" he explained in a confessional.  ""He's having me acknowledge that when it came to his passing and anyone around right before or right after, there's a feeling of someone's story changing. Someone saying I saw him go through this, this happened and then their story changes abruptly after. There's a very strong emphasis on this,"" Henry told La Toya. ""He's acknowledging that he should not have been left alone at a time when he was left alone. And that's coming in and that's what he's putting a lot of emphasis on. The person who should have been there to monitor wasn't monitoring and it's like, I trusted you to be there, I trusted the role that you were supposed to have to help me and you left. Of all times, you should be right here.""  ""Did something happen when he was abandoned?"" asked La Toya.  ""It's interesting thing with this. I feel like, when he was abandoned, that would have been an ideal time for him to reach 911, to call for help, to try to get help,"" he continued. ""At this time he realized something was wrong while he was alone and that's when he was conscious and realizing something's wrong here. I just don't feel like he had someone to say hey, I'm having a medical emergency, something's happening. So after I realize, ok there's something wrong going on in here, there's this feeling of oh this medication kicks in. I suddenly become affected by this medicine. And this happens very fast.""  ""I think what hurts more than anything else is that not only was there a need for someone to be there for him, but there was a trusted person, a person that he trusted, a person that was in that inner circle and that person wasn't there,"" La Toya said after hearing this. ""To hear that, it tears you apart. I wanted to just cry.""  Michael Jackson passed away at the age of 50 in 2009 after an overdose of propofol. Murray's lawyers tried to argue that Jackson self-administered the drug when Murray was out of the room, but a jury found him negligible and guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Murray spent two years behind bars.  ""Do you know if his story changed? Did he say one thing and then say something different?"" Henry asked La Toya. ""Yeah, stories changed. They change all the time."" When Henry asked if she knew whether his doctor left the room, she added, ""He did admit that at one point, that he did.""  ""I don't see anyone coming into his room while he was alone,"" Tyler added.  ""You definitely gave me validation there. I think everyone wants to know really, what truly happened, because none of us knew, there were different stories,"" La Toya responded. ""The stories changed and we wanted to know what the truth is and you've brought closure. We all have the same question, even his children. Thank you for that, I appreciate that.""  ""There has been so much confusion with that really took place and what happened,"" she continued. ""Whether someone else had come into the room or not was one of the major questions, because that was something that was always spoken. Every member in my family wants to know ... he clarified that.""  She then asked if our loved ones are ""our guardian angels sometimes,"" with Henry saying Michael came through as the type of spirit who would totally flicker the lights to let you know he's there. ""I do know that after he passed, the lights were flickering off and on and I would say, Michael, 'Is that you? Mike, is that you?'"""
"Britney Spears' spending habits have been revealed in new court documents related to her conservatorship.  The pop star - who earned $16 million last year - spent a total of $10,956,873.91 in 2016 with most of her money going on massages and clothes, according to TMZ.  Legal documents show the mother-of-two dropped a whopping $122,613 on massages - no doubt because of her grueling workouts and back-to-back shows in Las Vegas - as well as manicures and other personal grooming.  Shopping: Britney Spears spent nearly $11 million in 2016 according to legal documents seen by TMZ including a whopping $122,613 on massages and personal grooming  She also spent $69,668 on wardrobe and $24,392 for hair and makeup.  Another $29,852 goes to caring for her pet pooches - slightly less that last year's total of $37,000.  Britney also made numerous trips to stores like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Pottery Barn, Albertsons, Ralphs, Vons and Target, spending a few hundred dollars at a time.  The songstress is often spotted out in her local Los Angeles neighborhood picking up groceries or home-wares.  TMZ also revealed the Circus hitmaker has assets totaling $55,745,288.  Soothing those muscles: It's no wonder the songstress spends so much on massages thanks to her grueling workouts and Las Vegas show schedule  Another $29,852 goes to caring for her pet pooches - slightly less that last year's total of $37,000  Britney - pictured with boyfriend Sam Asghari also spent $69,668 on wardrobe and $24,392 for hair and makeup in 2016  The number is up by $5 million from 2015 and doesn't include millions more in various trusts.  Britney still cannot make legal or financial decisions without the approval of her father Jamie Spears and his lawyer Andrew Wallet.  Jamie, 65, has been running her business and personal affairs for eight years.  Britney pays him $130,000 per year to act as conservator of her estate in an arrangement that has no end in sight, the New York Times reported last year.  Britney also made numerous trips to stores like Bed, Bath & Beyond, Pottery Barn, Albertsons, Ralphs, Vons and Target, spending a few hundred dollars at a time  Jamie was made legal custodian of Britney in 2008 after her dramatic meltdown, and is responsible for her physical well-being, custody arrangements, managing her money and overseeing her music career.  All of Britney's purchases, no matter how small, are tracked and submitted in court documents under the arrangement.  After four years, Britney will wrap up her Piece Of Me! residency in Las Vegas on New Year's Eve.  The pop star has been enjoying a little down time over the summer and was pictured visiting Disney with boyfriend Sam Asghari on Monday.  Britney still cannot make legal or financial decisions without the approval of her father Jamie Spears (pictured in 2006)"

"Princess Diana is ‚Äúhelping‚Äù Prince William and Kate Middleton raise their children ‚Äì and here ‚Äúhelping‚Äù means ‚Äúher parenting style informs William and Kate‚Äôs parenting style.‚Äù  As E! News reports, Prince William was surprisingly candid about the role his mother would play in his children‚Äôs lives if she were still around.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare.‚Äù  There is no doubt, he said, that she would love her grandchildren to the Moon and back. But William also said that she would spoil them rotten, much like your own grandmother likely did to you.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd come in probably at bath time, cause an amazing‚Ä¶ scene, bubbles everywhere, bathwater all over the place, and then leave.‚Äù  It may sound just like the normal parent/grandparent relationship to your ears. But coming from the Royal Family, that type of thing is borderline shocking.  Back when Prince William and Prince Harry were young boys, Princess Diana‚Äôs parenting style was hands-on to an almost shocking degree. Sure, she had nannies to do the ‚Äúheavy lifting,‚Äù such as changing dirty diapers and such. But her level of involvement with her sons was leaps and bounds more direct than that of any other Royal in history.  null  She openly and publicly showered them with affection. She took them to theme parks. She involved them in her personal causes. She let them wear jeans and baseball caps and eat at McDonald‚Äôs.  That type of hands-on parenting, typical for just about every last parent in the Kingdom but unheard-of for Royals, is now being practiced by William and Kate. Kate, for example, has been known to sit and supervise her children herself while her husband is here or there, doing royal duties. And of course, though she, too, has a team of nannies at her disposal, she‚Äôs been known to do much of the heavy lifting herself.  For William, it‚Äôs all about balance. His oldest son, Prince George, will almost certainly be the King of England someday, and there is no escaping that.  null  That means that George and his siblings won‚Äôt be able to avoid much of the trappings of royalty. For example, George‚Äôs younger brother, Louis, was baptized wearing a replica satin-and-lace gown that mirrored the one worn by Queen Victoria‚Äôs eldest daughter back in 1841.  An unnamed Royal source says that William and Kate are trying to find the perfect balance between keeping them connected to their centuries-old royal heritage, and as much of a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life as possible."

Over two years into the musical couple's relationship, a new report claims that 48-year-old Stefani has been left heartbroken at the alleged loss, especial considering she and her boyfriend had reportedly been trying to get pregnant for over a year.  ‚ÄúIt was very hard for her,‚Äù a source close to the singer told Radar Online on Feb. 8.

"Donald Trump Jr. and Ron Perlman faced off on Twitter after the ""Hellboy"" actor admitted to urinating on his hands before giving Harvey Weinstein a handshake at a charity event.  Donald Trump Jr. criticized Ron Perlman on social media in an accusatory tweet implying the ‚ÄúHellboy‚Äù actor knew about Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs history of sexual harassment and abuse. Trump Jr. was responding to a story Perlman shared in which he remembered urinating on his hands before giving Harvey Weinstein a handshake at a charity event. Trump Jr. called Perlman a ‚Äúcoward‚Äù for staying silent all these years.  ‚ÄúSo you knew he was a rapist and rather the actually do something or say anything you pissed all over your hand?‚Äù Trump Jr. asked Perlman on Twitter. ‚ÄúImagine how many assaults on innocent women you could have prevented if you weren‚Äôt a coward.‚Äù  Perlman‚Äôs original tweet detailing the story of his Weinstein handshake never said he knew about the ex-studio head‚Äôs predatory behavior. The actor responded to Trump Jr. informing him he never said what Trump Jr. was accusing him of in his question.

A prick and a bully. And I gotta thing about that.‚Äù  Perlman has been one of Weinstein‚Äôs biggest critics since the first sexual harassment allegations became public last October. The actor used Twitter to celebrate the Academy‚Äôs decision to expel Weinstein from its ranks, and he tweeted ‚ÄúMan, if I had an Oscar for every time I almost hit Harvey Weinstein!!‚Äù after news broke James Cameron almost hit Weinstein at the Oscars on behalf of Guillermo del Toro. Perlman and del Toro are friends and collaborators, and the director has spoken about clashing with Weinstein during the making of ‚ÄúMimic.‚Äù  In Perlman‚Äôs original tweet, the actor shared, ‚ÄúDid I ever tell [you] about when Harvey Weinstein told me to make sure I shook his hand at a charity event? I stopped in the men‚Äôs room and pissed all over my hand, then went straight up to him on the receiving line.‚Äù  You can read Perlman and Trump Jr.‚Äôs Twitter face off below.  So you knew he was a rapist and rather the actually do something or say anything you pissed all over your hand???

"Anyone who‚Äôs ever been married will tell you that the road to happily ever after is paved with hard work. Falling in love is easy, but staying that way is inevitably much harder ‚Äì even when the love is real.  The biggest hurdles we face after the altar are the giant mounds of heartbreak and pain that can seem insurmountable at first glance. For some couples, the fractures in their foundation become too hard to bear and walking away is what‚Äôs healthiest for them. Others choose to stick it out and fight to rebuild after the damage has been done, holding out hope that the tide will shift and good times will roll in once again. Beyonc√© and JAY-Z are the latter.  The notoriously private couple has slowly rolled out one detail after another about the bumps in the road they‚Äôve encountered in their marriage‚Äîone hit album at a time. First, in 2016, Beyonc√© released arguably her most emotionally raw album to-date, Lemonade, and track-by-track revealed her heartbreak and anger over discovering her husband‚Äôs infidelities and how they almost ended their marriage. A year later JAY-Z told his side of the story on his latest album 4:44. He came clean about his infidelities and his guilt over the pain he caused his wife and daughter at the time. But, as it seems, while fans were still reeling from the heartbreak of learning that the Carters, like so many other married couples, weren‚Äôt living the picture-perfect life they believed they were, Beyonc√© and JAY-Z were pressing reset and putting in the work to save their marriage.  On Saturday, the couple released a surprise album‚Äîtheir first-ever joint release‚Äîtitled Everything Is Love, and they couldn‚Äôt have picked a more fitting title to describe the new place they‚Äôve arrived at together. If you listen closely to the lyrics, they‚Äôre telling us just how far they‚Äôve come together, how much love and passion they still share for each other, and perhaps most importantly, how committed they are to making their marriage work. The album‚Äôs final track ‚ÄúLOVEHAPPY‚Äù says it all.  Let‚Äôs break it down, shall we?  He went to Jared, I went to Chaumet out in Paris  Yeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried  Yo, chill man  We keepin‚Äô it real with these people, right?  Lucky I ain‚Äôt kill you when I met that b- (Nah, aight, aight )  Y‚Äôall know how I met her, we broke up and got back together  To get her back, I had to sweat her  Translation: While it takes two to achieve true forgiveness in a marriage, when it comes to infidelities, the onus most definitely falls on the guilty party to show and prove, and JAY-Z is clearly putting in that work to show Bey he‚Äôs a changed man.  Y‚Äôall could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather  Move the whole family West, but it‚Äôs whatever  In a glass house still throwing stones  Hova, Beysus, watch the thrones  (Happy in love)  Translation: A lot of things can trigger painful memories, including a home, a city or even an area code. Sometimes the easiest way to truly start over is to just‚Ä¶well, start over. In August 2017 Beyonc√© and JAY-Z moved from New York City to Los Angeles, and now we know it was most likely about a lot more than just the better weather.  [Chorus: Beyonc√©]  You did some things to me  Boy, you do some things to me  But love is deeper than your pain and I believe you can change  Baby, the ups and downs are worth it  Long way to go, but we‚Äôll work it  We‚Äôre flawed but we‚Äôre still perfect for each other  Translation: Beyonc√© forgave JAY-Z and she‚Äôs pushing past the pain and willing to put in the work because he is too. She‚Äôs acknowledging that it hasns‚Äôt been an overnight process, but she believes their love will stand the test of time. Real talk: When a marriage hits a rough patch and a couple share what‚Äôs going on with close friends and family, usually lots of opinions and judgements follow. Let‚Äôs be honest, it can be hard to forgive someone you love for doing the unthinkable when the people around you are telling you that you‚Äôre crazy to do so or to stay. The decision is yours and yours partners, and what really matters most is what the two of you want and believe. (Even when the noise around you makes it hard to think clearly.) Here, Beyonc√© is setting the record straight: She knows where they‚Äôve been and she knows where they‚Äôre going and she‚Äôs moved on. End of story.  Sometimes I thought we‚Äôd never see the light  Went through hell with heaven on our side  This beach ain‚Äôt always been no paradise  But nightmares only last one night  Translation: They‚Äôve been through the fire and back and their faith is now lifting them higher.  Damn, look at us now  Pray, pray for the vows  Way up now, yes, and a way, long way down  We came, and we saw, and we conquered it all  We came, and we conquered, now we‚Äôre happy in love  Translation: Bey and Jay‚Äôs love is back on top and they‚Äôre putting their faith in each other and their vows, which they recently renewed and shared footage from as part of their new On The Run II tour videos.  You have to applaud Beyonc√© and JAY-Z for their transparency and their deep commitment to fighting forward and making their marriage work. I imagine the only thing harder than reaching a crisis in your marriage is the vulnerability that comes with sharing the news with the world. But, in true Carters fashion, they‚Äôre going hard and not looking back‚Äîand sparking necessary conversations on the realities of marriage and the work involved.  To quote the Carters, ‚ÄúThis. Is. Real. Life.‚Äù And, in the real world, when it comes to matters of the heart, sometimes we have to fight for what we want and forgive in order to move forward."

"Recently, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich vetoed the so-called ‚Äúheartbeat bill,‚Äù a measure that would have banned all abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy, or before many women even know that they are pregnant. At the same time, Kasich signed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions only for saving a pregnant woman‚Äôs life or preventing the ‚Äúsubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.‚Äù‚ÄúAt the risk of sounding discriminatory, which is not at all my goal here, but at the risk of sounding like that, there is no way women should be allowed control over whether or not they are going to have abortions,‚Äù Kasich told the Ohio Daily Star. ‚ÄúWomen are wonderful beings, they are kind, loving, incredible and a whole other plethora of adjectives could be used to describe them, but at the end of the day, I‚Äôm sorry to have to say this, but the honest truth is that women used to be all those things. The women of today are mainly opportunists and gold diggers, who typically get pregnant due to unsafe sex, or to get their partners to marry them.‚ÄùHe continued, ‚ÄúOur mothers and women of the old times were the women every man deserved and was blessed to have. Today, the situation is so critical that I honestly fear for the future of this country. And so, I was in a position to make a change and do something important, and so I did. And there‚Äôs one very simple reason why I did it. That‚Äôs that, if a woman these days is not intelligent enough to keep her legs closed when they‚Äôre supposed to be closed, if she doesn‚Äôt have the foresight to make sure she doesn‚Äôt get herself in a situation where she might be pregnant, then there is no way a woman like that can or should be entrusted with the decision of having an abortion.‚Äù‚ÄúA woman like that can barely take care of herself, and we‚Äôre supposed to tell our doctors to perform an abortion on such a woman and kill her unborn child ‚Äì a being who‚Äôs done no wrong and only exists as its mother‚Äôs mistake? Do you really want to put the men and women in our healthcare in that kind of situations? To literally force them to commit manslaughter?‚Äù Kasich said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about the rest of the people living in my state, but I for one am not comfortable with that one bit. And so I reacted and did what was necessary to prevent that from happening.‚Äù‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôll tell you another thing ‚Äì as of recently, all cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in the state of Ohio will have to be approved by the state. That means that every single couple that becomes pregnant and isn‚Äôt married or at the very least engaged, will be scrutinized to determine whether the pregnancy was planned or accidental. And in the case of the latter, the couple will be fined a total of $100,000, with $70,000 of the fine being charged on the mother-to-be for not being able to not only use birth control, but having sex before marriage in the first place. Women in this country really need to learn to either keep their legs closed or their other orifices open,‚Äù the governor concluded."

"Living in regular-sized homes with plenty of space for closets, lockers and shelves gives us little need to think about storage space. In tiny homes, space comes at a premium so storage space is one of the key issues that a tiny house owner will have to plan for when building, buying or furnishing their home. There is only so much we can downsize by moving to a tiny home, so planning for storage space is an integral part of preparation for tiny living.VerticalityTiny houses for sale in Florida have tiny floor plans. There is only so much space to put things on the floor, and once bare necessities such as beds, kitchen elements etc. are taken care of, there is little space left to put all of our stuff. Verticality is key in these situations. Wall-mounted shelving is excellent for organizing your stuff and it doesn‚Äôt demand a single inch of your floor. They are also quite inexpensive and easy to install. Instead of having an entertainment center, it is now easy to mount your TV and speakers on the wall, leaving more space for things you can‚Äôt compromise with.Multi-functional FurnitureIn a tiny house, a bed doesn‚Äôt have the luxury to be just a bed. It needs to perform multiple functions, where storage is one of the most important ones. The same applies to coffee and night tables, sofas and kitchen elements. Beds can have drawers for your linens, or room for storage under their mattress. Instead of a regular coffee table, opt in for a cube design, where multiple storage drawers are integrated for all those small things you don‚Äôt have space for.Customized FurnitureSometimes it is difficult to furnish a tiny home, especially if it doesn‚Äôt use a standard floor plan. Customized furniture is a huge advantage in tiny homes, where space is at a premium. You can make sure that every single corner and nook of your house can be used in a functional way. The same applies to storage. A well-placed shelf or locker, can perform a very important function while not taking up much space or by utilizing and otherwise unused space. Customized furniture does come at a premium price, but it is one of those investments you will not lose any sleep over once you are living in your tiny home.Tiny AppliancesEvery piece of furniture and appliance you put into your tiny home, will make you compromise on something else. Tiny living is about downsizing your living space to bare necessities but that has a different meaning for different people. In order to create more space for storing stuff you can‚Äôt live without, making some sacrifices when it comes to appliances is important. Instead of a full-sized stove, opt in for a dual heat-plate design that will take up less space. A small refrigerator works fine, just like a large two-door model. Also shopping more frequently for fresh groceries will lead you to a healthier lifestyle and diet. A fold out dinning-table in the kitchen, saves you the space that you might need for a dining table. Tiny appliances and gadgets do tend to have a higher price than standard ones, but they provide so much more than function to tiny home dwellers."

"CLOSE Jamie and Claire are reunited after spending the first half of the season separated by 200 years and an ocean.  Spoiler alert: This post contains spoilers from Outlander Season 3 Episode 6.  Outlander knows its audience.  After five episodes with Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire (Caitriona Balfe) in separate times periods and zones, the Starz show finally brings the lovers back together for the sixth episode of Season 3, ""A. Malcolm."" And delivers what fans have been hoping for ‚Äî a sweet, sultry reunion that mimics one of the show's best episodes (""The Wedding"" from Season 1).  ""A. Malcom"" begins as Jamie, now running a printing business that distributes treasonous pamphlets promoting the Catholic church and Scottish independence on the side, starts a typical day. A female friend, who we later learn is no lady but a madame, helps tie his cravat, and the callbacks to the early episodes begin. Her attachment to Jamie gives us flashbacks to Laoghaire, vying to take Jamie's attention away from Claire.  As Jamie continues his quaint commute and early morning at the shop, we're introduced to two more characters who give us additional flashbacks. Though we've lost Rupert and Angus, two new bumbling friends, who've crashed the night in the print shop, are poised to take their place as comedic relief.  More: Sam Heughan: 'Outlander' Season 3 is the best yet, but don't expect the same Jamie Fraser  More: 'Outlander's Sam Heughan may be the handsome, humble star of Hollywood's dreams  As he continues about his day, Jamie is stopped by Claire's voice like the Ghost of Christmas Past, fainting as he catches sight of his wife who he hasn't seen in 20 years.  It's an awkward rekindling, as one would expect, filled with pregnant pauses and timid embraces. As Jamie realizes he spilled his cup on his pants during his brief blackout, we're reminded just how unsure the lover's relationship is after so much time past.  ""Do you mind?"" Jamie says, modestly asking Claire to turn as he undresses.  ""It's alright, we are married. At least I suppose we are,"" Claire says.  Then there's that little embarrassing detail that bachelor Jamie lives in a brothel, the madame of which has come to fancy having the handsome gentleman to herself.  But the parallels to ""The Wedding"" come starkly into focus as Claire and Jamie make their way to the bedroom.  The two get to know each other again over a dinner with plenty of wine and whiskey, just as they did when they first fell in love on their wedding night. When they move to the bed, what unfolds is an all-too-real sex scene filled with accidental bumpings of heads and self-conscious worries about how time has changed their bodies.  It's a realistic portrait of what sex may look like with a long lost love ‚Äî or as realistic as possible considering it's set in the 18th century setting, the time travel and all that supernatural jazz.  That's what viewers have come to expect from the show and what keeps them tuned in. The sex scenes aren't ultra glossy Hollywood renderings (though Heughan and Balfe are as hot as ever), or the forced, possibly rape-y scenarios like those of Game of Thrones.  Outlander has never been geared towards the male gaze, rather the female. And with enough plausibility as to make the fantasy seem at least somewhat plausible.  With ""A. Malcom,"" the show hit that sweet spot yet again.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yDy7XM"

"This show is fantastic. I don't have cable, so I didn't actually know about it until I randomly saw Elizabeth Hurley on a talk show promoting it. I immediately watched S1 on Prime, and coughed up the $20 to buy S2. Some things that should be noted if you are trying to decide whether or not to watch, consider this:    1) Don't listen to the low reviewers who are giving it 1-3 Stars because it's not ""true to the UK"". Of *COURSE* it's not ""true to the UK. This show is on E!, not BBC or PBS. People watch this show to be entertained, not to learn how the monarchy really works.    2) The fun thing about this show is that it's all made up. It isn't true life or how the real ""royals"" really are. It's actually a lot more sensationalized and more fun. There's mystery, love, murder, scandal, intrigue - you won't find any tea parties here. What's even better about this is that it's a non-reality show that doesn't involve medical stuff, police, or firefighters. (Don't get me wrong, I absolutely appreciate what all first-responders do, but I'm not interested enough to watch shows about them). The aspect of the royal family and all their made-up scandals makes it fun to watch.    3) The soundtrack to this show is AWESOME! I've come across some cool new artists that I wouldn't have otherwise known about had it not been for this show. After every episode, I find myself Googling who the musical artists were so I can download more of their songs.    Things about this show that I'm not a fan of:  1) The whole ""will they, or won't they"" with the Liam / Ophelia pairing. Ophelia is just boring. Sure, she's pretty, but there's nothing interesting about her character at all. The whole ""common girl becomes a princess"" storyline has been overdone SO MANY TIMES and is so predictable. Unfortunately, I don't think her character will be going away any time soon, considering the happenings in the S2 finale. That's too bad. In S1, I was really rooting for Gemma, but now that the actress who plays her has left the show (which is unfortunate, she did an amazing job as Gemma), I've been hoping Wilhelmina wins the heart of Liam. Wilhelmina has spunk and actual personality.    2) There are only 10 episodes per season. That makes me so sad :("

"President Trump‚Äôs speech at the 2017 Boy Scout Jamboree has drawn criticism from former Boy Scouts and current Scout leaders alike, with some comparing the speech to a ‚Äúpolitical rally.‚Äù  During Monday night‚Äôs speech, Trump referred to ‚Äúthis horrible thing known as Obamacare,‚Äù called for ‚Äúmore loyalty‚Äù and recounted the night of his election as ‚Äúthat famous night on television.‚Äù Trump also repeated his claims against ‚Äúfake media‚Äù and ‚Äúfake news,‚Äù despite commencing the speech by saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going to put that aside.‚Äù  While the speech was interspersed with applause and chants of ‚ÄúUSA! USA! USA!‚Äù from the audience, Trump‚Äôs comments about Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton also elicited boos from the crowd, which was highlighted by users on social media.  Former Chief Official White House Photographer Pete Souza made his own comparison between Obama and Trump via Instagram.  Current Scout leaders and former Scouts, as well as parents, also used Twitter to voice their criticism of the nature of Trump‚Äôs speech.  In a statement, the Boy Scouts of America said that it is ‚Äúwholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position, product, service, political candidate or philosophy. The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies.‚Äù"
"Chalk this up to a bit of fake news from the real-estate sector.  ‚ÄúOnce Upon a Time in America‚Äù actor and noted conservative James Woods took to Twitter on Sunday to shoot down reports that he was retiring from acting, reports that originated with Woods‚Äô real-estate agent.

"Tom Cruise | Angela Weiss/Getty Images Tom Cruise | Angela Weiss/Getty Images  There have been a number of rumors over the years about Tom Cruise‚Äôs love life. The Mission Impossible star has kept sort of a low profile with his relationships after splitting from his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, in 2012. Therefore, because he isn‚Äôt jumping on couches and declaring his love for anyone, some tabloids have decided to make up stories about him being romantically involved with other Hollywood A-listers.  Now, it‚Äôs time to separate fact from fiction and bust those rumors about who Cruise has dated.  Angelina Jolie  In March 2017, the National Enquirer published a bogus report that the actor was dating Angelina Jolie.  The publication claimed that the two stars met to talk about the film they were working on together, however, we know that they never did a movie together so that part isn‚Äôt true. The outlet went on to claim that Jolie was enjoying making her ex, Brad Pitt, jealous about the romance. But Gossip Cop reported that there‚Äôs no truth to that, which makes sense since Jolie told People that dating is the furthest thing from her mind and something she doesn‚Äôt plan on doing for a long time.  Jane Fonda  After appearing together at Comic-Con in Las Vegas in spring 2018 to promote their movies, the site New Idea falsely reported that Cruise was seeing Jane Fonda.  The Book Club star ended up debunking this rumor herself during an interview with Extra when she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dating anymore, but I did up until a couple of years ago ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve closed up shop down there!‚Äù  Vanessa Kirby  There were wild reports, which surfaced in October 2017, that The Crown actress Vanessa Kirby was marrying, yes marrying, her Mission Impossible ‚Äî Fallout co-star.  The story was published by not one, but two tabloids and totally caught Kirby by surprise. ‚ÄúThe most disconcerting thing was the people I didn‚Äôt think would believe it did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‚ÄòAre you OK?'‚Äù she told Marie Claire. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they believe anything they read now because you just can‚Äôt. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog‚Äîit was marriage.‚Äù  Elisabeth Moss  In November 2017, another article from the National Enquirer was debunked after it claimed that Cruise was romancing Elisabeth Moss. There was no evidence whatsoever to support this story and it may only have come out because the two Scientologists were both single at the time.  Moss though made it clear that to Marie Claire that the report was false and said she has ‚Äúno time for dating,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually a problem. But I‚Äôm very focused on my work.‚Äù  Katie Holmes  Finally, in November 2016, the website called Headlines & Global News did a story that Cruise‚Äôs former wife had dumped her beau, Jamie Foxx, to get back together with him.  Of course, time has proven that to be untrue and despite not wanting to talk about their relationship Holmes and Foxx are still going strong. Whenever split rumors do make the rounds, they just leave it to their reps to deny."

"California is ‚Äúthe darkest state in the Union,‚Äù according to country singer Dolly Parton, who claims that the state has been hit with a series of ‚ÄúBiblical disasters‚Äù in recent times as punishment for ‚Äúembracing Satan and rejecting God.‚Äù  Parton predicted Los Angeles will suffer a similar fate to Sodom and Gomorrah, the Biblical cities synonymous with vice, darkness and impenitent sin.  ‚ÄúCalifornia just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,‚Äù the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton‚Äôs Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.  ‚ÄúPestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don‚Äôt even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can‚Äôt even see what is right in front of their eyes.‚Äù  ‚ÄúFirst they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.  ‚ÄúThen they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!‚Äú  ‚ÄúAnd now they just had dozens of homes destroyed by mudslides,‚Äù Tennessee-born Parton said, making reference to the mudslides that have killed 15 people, with the toll expected to climb above 30. The mudslide hit an affluent part of California, and damaged Oprah Winfrey‚Äôs house.  ‚ÄúWhen they get hit with the ‚ÄòBig One‚Äò, Parton said, referencing the popular name for the super quake expected to rock California in the future, ‚Äúthen we will know that the End Times have truly begun.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.‚Äù  Is California suffering from bad weather and bad luck, or is Parton right? Could a vengeful God be punishing California for decades of vice and sin?  Parton, who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and been nominated for two Academy Awards, has previously stated that she considers herself an entertainer, and doesn‚Äôt believe it is her role to get involved with politics.  At last year‚Äôs Emmys, Parton was joined onstage by Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda to present an award. Tomlin and Fonda took the opportunity to criticize President Donald Trump, but Parton refused to join in, maintaining a dignified silence."

"The actor was admitted to hospital last week to have a catheter valve replaced, and after complications with the procedure, an emergency team of doctors were forced to perform emergency surgery on the star.  LONDON - Arnold Schwarzenegger is set to return home following his emergency open heart surgery last week.  The 70-year-old actor was admitted to hospital last week to have a catheter valve replaced, and after complications with the procedure, an emergency team of doctors were forced to perform emergency surgery on the star.  And after spending time in hospital recovering, the actor is finally heading home.  His representative Daniel Ketchell wrote on Twitter: Update: @Schwarzenegger is headed home! (sic)‚Äù  It isn‚Äôt the first time Daniel has shared an update on the Terminator actor‚Äôs condition, as he previously posted a note which described what had happened since the actor went to a hospital.  It read: ‚ÄúYesterday, Governor Schwarzenegger underwent a planned procedure at Cedars-Sinai to replace a pulmonic valve that was originally replaced due to a congenital heart defect in 1997.  ‚ÄúThat 1997 replacement valve was never meant to be permanent, and has outlived its life expectancy, so he chose to replace it yesterday through a less-invasive catheter valve replacement.  ‚ÄúDuring that procedure, an open-heart surgery team was prepared, as they frequently are in these circumstances, in case the catheter procedure was unable to be performed.  ‚ÄúGovernor Schwarzenegger‚Äôs pulmonic valve was successfully replaced and he is currently recovering from the surgery and in a stable condition. We want to thank the entire medical team for their tireless efforts.‚Äù  And the rep then took to Twitter again a few hours later to let fans know the ‚ÄòPredator‚Äô actor was awake and in ‚Äúgood spirits‚Äù.  He tweeted: ‚ÄúUpdate: @Schwarzenegger is awake and his first words were actually ‚ÄúI‚Äôm back‚Äù, so he is in good spirits. (sic)‚Äù  Earlier this week, Schwarzenegger shared an update of his own on Twitter when he let fans know he was ‚Äúthankful‚Äù to be awake and in good health.  He said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true: I‚Äôm back! I went to sleep expecting to wake up with a small incision and woke up with a big one - but guess what? I woke up, and that‚Äôs something to be thankful for. Thank you to the doctors & nurses. And I‚Äôm truly filled with gratitude for all of the kind messages. (sic)‚Äù"
"Either You're the Fastest or Not: Michael Fassbender on His Car-Racing Obsession  The two-time Academy Award nominee is part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers and is fresh off a first-place finish in the first of six series at the Daytona Ferrari Challenge, with another race on June 9.  ""What have I learned?"" With the din of race cars screaming around the Laguna Seca racetrack outside Monterey, California, Michael Fassbender ‚Äî wearing a racing suit, hair mussed from the Nomex balaclava and helmet he's had on his head all morning ‚Äî leans in as a big grin spreads over his face. ""I've learned that I'm always two seconds off where I need to be.""  Two seconds in a line reading might not mean much, but on this 2.2-mile track with 11 turns (on the corkscrew, ""head for the tree,"" he advises), it's an awful lot of time. Part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers, from Paul Newman and Steve McQueen to Patrick Dempsey, Fassbender ‚Äî who spent his childhood in Ireland glued to the TV watching Michael Schumacher win one F1 title after another ‚Äî is the real deal.  The 41-year-old star, who picked up the sport in 2016, possesses an encyclopedic, arcane knowledge of 1980s Group B rally racing and has logged more than 120 hours behind the wheel of his 488 Ferrari Challenge car ‚Äî valued at $330,000, featuring a 670-horsepower, 3.9-liter turbocharged V-8 engine. It's numbered 133, because, as he says, ""three is my lucky number.""  Luck, though, had little to do with Fassbender winning the first of six series (his next race is in Montreal on June 9) in the Ferrari Challenge 2018 season, which opened at Florida's Daytona Speedway in January, where speeds exceed 190 miles per hour. Says Ferrari Challenge head instructor Didier Theys: ""From the start, Michael has shown a great deal of dedication and talent as a competitor.""  Racing is the reward that rounds out a career marked (so far) by two Oscar nominations, for his work in 2013's 12 Years a Slave and 2015's Steve Jobs.  ""It's one of the things about the job that I do that's a huge perk, just an absolute dream come true,"" says Fassbender, who lives in Lisbon, Portugal, with Alicia Vikander, whom he married in October. ""It was always a goal to do some sort of racing at 40, but I didn't imagine that I'd be in a series like this with very powerful, very fast 660-odd horsepower machines."" Fassbender adds with a laugh, ""It's a lot more fun prepping for this than learning lines at home,"" the downside being, ""if you miss an apex or mess up a corner, you don't get a 'take two.'""  He points out the other contrast between his two chosen vocations ‚Äî the type of risk involved: ""It's a different kind of butterflies. For a film, I've usually been putting together this character, but haven't really shown it to anybody. That first day of shooting, it's like, 'God, I hope this works.' But racing, once you start doing it, focusing on what you have to do, you can't think of anything else. When you're driving, literally, if your mind wanders, you're going to go off the track.""  There's a process to maintaining composure while white-knuckling it for four 30-minute races over weekends that begin with Thursday practice laps and end Sunday. Says Fassbender, ""When it comes to the first practice day, your brain and body have to assimilate to these high speeds. You get into the car and think, 'Oh, God, I can't do this,' but it's incredible how the body and mind adapt ‚Äî it's just about focusing and trying to get in a rhythm. Racing is something that really does bring that level of forced meditation ‚Äî it's very rare in life.""  Over time, the actor, who plays Magneto in February's X-Men: Dark Phoenix, has reached an understanding about anxiety: ""Before my first race here last year, I literally thought I was going to vomit. I was in the toilet beforehand, breathing. I was nervous, but that feeling is pretty special, that first race feeling.""  With Fassbender, winning really does seem to matter. ""Like many of his fellow drivers, he's something of a perfectionist and determined to win,"" says Theys.  Notes the star, making a nod to a perspective that many a fellow Oscar nominee might share: ""You race to win, for sure, that's the goal. Either you're fastest or you're not ‚Äî that's the allure for me. It's always great to be on the podium.""  This story first appeared in the June 6 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

"26.6k SHARES Share TweetIt turns out that our moon isn‚Äôt alone out there, orbiting our planet on its own. Earth has a companion in space which has been orbiting our world for over a century, and NASA has only recently spotted it.According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along.The new moon isn‚Äôt as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space.The smaller quasi-moon orbits Earth with an extremely irregular path. Moon 2.0 is actually asteroid 2016 H03, which is locked into a dance with our planet, in fact, it has been dancing with our planet for almost a century and we have failed to notice it until recently. The quasi- moon‚Äôs orbit is extremely elliptical causing it to travel between 38 and 100 times the distance of our planet‚Äôs ‚Äòoriginal‚Äô moon.The ‚Äònew‚Äô moon is tilted at around 8¬∞ and travels around the sun for 365.93 days, which is a bit longer than our planets 365.24 day-long year.The orbit of the new moon varies a lot. In fact, due to its tilted and elliptical orbit, 2016 H03 is sometimes closer to the sun and moves faster than our planet and in other times its located farther out and moves slowly. However, researcher shave found it never gets closer to about 14 million kilometers from Earth, nor does it stray off course over 40 million kilometers.Earth new mini-moon is around 40 meters across and nearly 100 meters wide and will most likely remain as one of Earth‚Äôs smaller moon for coming centuries.The new moon was discovered thanks to the Pan-STARRS 1 asteroid survey telescope in Haleakala, Hawaii.‚ÄúSince 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth,‚Äù said Paul Chodas, manager of NASA‚Äôs Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‚ÄúOne other asteroid ‚Äî 2003 YN107 ‚Äî followed a similar orbital pattern for a while over ten years ago, but it has since departed our vicinity.This new asteroid is much more locked onto us. Our calculations indicate 2016 HO3 has been a stable quasi-satellite of Earth for almost a century, and it will continue to follow this pattern as Earth‚Äôs companion for centuries to come.‚ÄùSourceLike this: Like Loading..."

"(Video provided by Splash News)  The Weeknd instigated his breakup with Selena Gomez, Gossip Cop can confirm. Gomez‚Äôs rekindled friendship with Justin Bieber, however, had nothing to do with the rapper‚Äôs decision to end his romance with the singer.  As Gossip Cop reported, Gomez and The Weeknd recently split after nearly a year of dating. The pair weren‚Äôt seen together much during the summer, though it was later revealed the singer-actress was laying low due to a kidney transplant. Regardless, they still appeared to be going strong in the early fall. Prior to the announcement of their breakup, the status of their relationship was questioned after it emerged Gomez had rekindled her friendship with Bieber. ¬© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  On Sunday, that speculation swirled as Bieber and Gomez were seen in public and The Weeknd stopped following her friends on social media. That being said, Bieber was allegedly not responsible for the breakup. Rather, it was the challenges of a long-distance relationship, particularly with The Weeknd touring and Gomez‚Äôs shooting schedule, that led both the former couple to reconsider their fizzling relationship.  Additionally, contributing to their split, the rapper felt ‚Äútied down‚Äù in a relationship that had lost its spark. Over time, the pair started talking less frequently on the phone, prompting The Weeknd to end his romance with Gomez, reports TMZ. Despite their breakup, we‚Äôre told that the pair are still on good terms and have talked several times since the split.  Predictably, after the rapper ended his relationship with Gomez, Gossip Cop busted the often disproven HollywoodLife for claiming in a made-up report that The Weeknd was ‚Äúheartbroken‚Äù over Gomez reconnecting with Bieber. In the bogus story, the bad blog ridiculously asserted that The Weeknd and Gomez were caught in a ‚Äúlove triangle‚Äù with Bieber, but of course, the breakup had nothing to do with and wasn‚Äôt caused by the ‚ÄúLove Yourself‚Äù singer.

"The player of the year race is as wide open as the sport has recently seen.  Want to go with experience, a freshman, a player from a non-power league? You won‚Äôt be wrong ‚Äî now. There are no poor answers within reason.  But we put forth our own 16-player bracket two weeks ago and asked fans to decide. The winner? Tennessee‚Äôs Grant Williams, who beat Indiana‚Äôs Juwan Morgan in the final vote.  In his sophomore campaign last season, Williams averaged 15.2 points, 6 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks, earning him SEC Player of the Year honors on a Tennessee team that went 26-9 overall and finished in first place in the conference with a 13-5 record.  Tennessee returns all five starters this season, and all six of its leading scorers, so Williams will have plenty of help as he tries to get Tennessee past the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014.  Sixteen student-athletes qualified for our tournament of preseason player of the year candidates, seeded No. 1 through No. 16, in a four-round, single-elimination format.

Guy has become one of the more reliable shooters under Tony Bennett.  (8) Caleb Martin, F, Sr., Nevada: Martin came back instead of staying in the NBA draft to join the most talented Wolf Pack roster ever.

He continues to embrace the role of being a go-to player on a roster that should make a run for the title.  (10) Tyus Battle, G, Jr., Syracuse: Battle flirted with staying in the NBA draft but he returns to lead the Orange a few steps further than the Sweet 16 last season. His numbers climbed during the season and he should be one of the more consistent scorers in the ACC.

"It might seem crazy, but after almost 20 years in the industry, Amanda Seyfried still gets star-struck. ""Andy Garcia just walked by...no big deal, this is just my life,"" she exclaims to me over the phone from London, where she's doing press for the Mamma Mia sequel. However, just one minute later, she shouts over to her co-star, ""Hey!""‚Äîbefore explaining quickly to me that Cher had just came over‚Äî""I'm talking about you!"" This really is her life.  For some, summoning enthusiasm for a press tour after two decades in Hollywood‚Äîshe started in the late '90s as Lucy Montgomery on As the World Turns before her breakout in 2008's Mamma Mia‚Äîmight prove challenging to say the least. Not for Seyfried, who admits she's been feeling ill that day and is still excited for our chat. That's because filming Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again was one of the most rewarding experiences of her life. Mamma Mia, both the first film and the sequel, really boils down to a story about the relationship between a mother and her daughter. This time, Seyfried relates on a whole different level.    Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again Universal  ""When I filmed the first movie I was in my twenties, falling in love, and just really frivolous. Now I have a daughter of my own and I just relate to Donna (Meryl Streep) that much more.""  The love Amanda Seyfried referenced was with her co-star Dominic Cooper, who played her love interest Skye. The actors dated for three years after filming Mamma Mia. Now 32 years old, Seyfried is married to actor Thomas Sadoski, the father of their one-year-old daughter. Now, Seyfried and Cooper are reunited on screen for the first time since their breakup...as lovers, again.  ""You can't call [your ex] by the pet names you have for them.""  So, does Seyfried have any advice for women who must face their ex at work? ""The number one, most important thing is setting boundaries,"" she shares. ""You can't call each other by the pet names you have for them.""  ""You know, it's very strange having to not be intimate with someone you've had an intimate relationship with,"" she confesses. ""It can be hard but you have to step back and be professional. Dominic and I have such a good relationship that it was easy...but if you don't like your ex, just try to get them fired,"" she jokes.  Amanda Seyfried, Dominic Cooper, and Cher in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again Universal  But back to Cher, who plays Amanda's on-screen grandmother. The two may be press junket buddies now, but when the film began would you believe it wasn't just the rest of the cast that was intimidated by Cher? Apparently, there's no star too big to feel apprehensive when meeting a new group of people who already click. ""We were all so nervous Cher's first day on set,"" Seyfried tells me. ""But when I finally had my first scene with her she told me how nervous she was to meet all of us. I ended up going up to the rest of the cast and crew and told them all to introduce themselves...to Cher!""  Yeah‚Äîthis is just Amanda Seyfried's life."

"Kris Jenner is now including royalties on the guest list for her annual Christmas party this year according to an online tabloid. The Jenner-Kardashian matriarch is reportedly inviting British royalties Kate Middleton and Prince Charles to her crazy Christmas party.  Kris Jenner has been known to host outlandish Christmas parties and this year won‚Äôt be an exception according to Celeb Dirty Laundry. In the past, the great matriarch of the Jenners and Kardashians bought nine Christmas trees and live reindeers for this very reason. On top of that, guests get to take home gift bags worth thousands of dollars. So, who are the lucky souls that get invited to her crazy party? The article claims that the invitation has been extended to the British royalties this year.  According to the website, the guest list is one for the books, which allegedly includes Prince William and Kate Middleton. While the author of the article admits that this idea could be pure madness, it goes on to say that Kris Jenner wants the royal family to enjoy the Christmas celebrations with them too. However, Gossip Cop is quick to point out the false claims of this news.  Kris Jenner did mention the royalties in a recent interview with Glamour UK. However, this is to say that she wished to invite Prince William and Kate Middleton to one of her parties if given a chance. It should be emphasized that this is only wishful thinking on her part.  ‚ÄúIf I could get any guests at our party, it would have to be Prince William and Duchess Kate. Oh, and they can bring Harry, too.‚Äù  So this is to say that Kris Jenner did not actually invite the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to her upcoming Christmas party. Her statements were only good-natured remarks about a hypothetical situation. She was just asked about her dream guests at one point during the interview, to which she answered gamely. In fact, she goes on to say that Charlotte and George would probably love the hot-dog-on-a-stick stand in her party.  Kris Jenner dodges questions about Khloe and Kylie's pregnancies https://t.co/na8n22630r ‚Äî Entertainment Weekly (@EW) November 3, 2017  So this goes on to say that Kris Jenner did not extend an invitation to Prince William and Kate Middleton. This was a clear fabrication from what she mentioned in her interview with Glamour UK. Celeb Dirty Laundry also did not provide actual quotes that could prove that Kris actually invited the British royalties.  [Featured Image by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for LACMA]"

"UPDATED: ‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar Live‚Äù carried NBC to a win in the Nielsen overnight ratings on Easter Sunday.  Airing from 8-10:23 p.m., ‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar Live‚Äù drew a 1.7 rating in adults 18-49 and 9.4 million viewers. NBC‚Äôs last live musical, ‚ÄúHairspray Live,‚Äù drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 9 million viewers back in December 2016. It is also up slightly over Fox‚Äôs live version of the religious-themed ‚ÄúThe Passion‚Äù musical from March 2016, which drew a 1.6 and 6.6 million viewers. However, as ‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar‚Äù ended at 10:23 p.m., its initial numbers will be subject to adjustment later today.  Elsewhere on broadcast, a new episode of ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù (1.6, 7.4 million) held steady with last week‚Äôs Sunday episode. ‚ÄúDeception‚Äù (0.8, 4.2 million) ticked up slightly in the demo.  For CBS, ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù (0.7, 8.1 million) unsurprisingly fell from the massive ratings drawn by the Stormy Daniels interview the show aired last week. Freshman drama ‚ÄúInstinct‚Äù (0.6, 6.7 million) slipped over 50% in the demo in its third week. ‚ÄúNCIS: New Orleans‚Äù (0.8, 7.1 million) and ‚ÄúMadam Secretary‚Äù (0.5, 5.7 million) were also down versus last week.

CBS was second in viewers with 6.9 million. Fox was fourth in viewers with 1.7 million.  PREVIOUSLY: NBC‚Äôs live staging of ‚ÄúJesus Christ Superstar‚Äù is among the top shows of Sunday night in the early Nielsen numbers.  The live musical, which starred John Legend in the title role, averaged a 6.0 rating in Nielsen‚Äôs metered market households. That is good enough to tie with ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù on CBS in households as well as top ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Idol,‚Äù which drew a 4.5. It is also on par with the 5.9 that NBC‚Äôs last live musical, ‚ÄúHairspray Live,‚Äù drew back in 2016. ‚ÄúHairspray Live‚Äù ultimately drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and just over 9 million viewers, making it one of the lower-rated live broadcast musicals to date.

"Not many people get to know celebrities beyond their public persona ‚Äî but Sherry Lansing has worked with the best.  The former Paramount Studios CEO, and the first woman to ever be president of a major movie studio, is telling all in a new book about her life, Leading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker. Though she stepped away from Hollywood in 2005 after decades in the business, the former exec still fondly remembers her time there and opens up to PEOPLE about some of the movie superstars she worked with.  Read on for behind-the-scenes stories straight from the best source ‚Äî the producer and exec who made the films.  Angelina Jolie‚Äôs life-changing moment  When Angelina Jolie was cast as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider, the studio felt she was a risky choice due to her wild-child reputation. But after the actress fought for the role, she immediately impressed the studio and the crew with her hard work and talent on camera.  ‚ÄúIn the dailies, she was riveting,‚Äù Lansing recalls in the book. ‚ÄúShe took what might have been a cardboard character and added a layer of mystery and emotion and humanity.‚Äù  BRENT STIRTON/GETTY  Jolie with Maddox in Cambodia in 2006  And Lansing says she was more than just impressive on film. The former executive got to witness Jolie begin her life as a philanthropist after working in Cambodia where the film was shot ‚Äî and where she eventually ended up adopting her first son, Maddox, in 2002. The actress had already become involved with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at the time, for which she is now a Special Envoy, thanks to her trips to the Southeast Asian country.  ‚ÄúI saw it earlier on,‚Äù Lansing tells PEOPLE of Jolie‚Äôs passion for philanthropy. ‚ÄúRight after Tomb Raider, she was on my same flight out of London where she sat next to me. She had nothing with her but a backpack and she was going back to Cambodia to work with the refugees. She was always interested in causes bigger than herself and she always worked hard for those causes. She‚Äôs done amazing good to make the world a better place.‚Äù  Tom Cruise was like a ‚Äúbrother‚Äù to her  There were some people Lansing worked with whom she formed close relationships with ‚Äî including Tom Cruise. She says she and Cruise were like ‚Äúbrother and sister‚Äù as they collaborated on movies like the Mission: Impossible franchise and War of the Worlds, while Cruise‚Äôs production company, Cruise/Wagner Productions, had an exclusive deal with Paramount.  ‚ÄúI knew Tom when he was a young boy when he was cast in Taps,‚Äù Lansing tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúThe Tom Cruise that I met all those years ago is the same person he is today ‚Äî the hardest-working actor, brilliant, focused and kind. He‚Äôs nice to everyone and he treats everyone with respect.‚Äù  L. Cohen/WireImage  The two grew to trust each other, with, according to the book, Cruise coming to rescue in 2005 when Mission: Impossible II was delayed a year. When Lansing started panicking, since the sequel was supposed to be Paramount‚Äôs big summer blockbuster that year, Cruise repeatedly told her it was going to be okay. To her surprise, she got a call from Steven Spielberg about Paramount releasing War of the Worlds the very same weekend Mission: Impossible II was slated to open, therefore giving the studio exec the blockbuster she needed.  RELATED VIDEO: Mel Gibson‚Äôs Changing Looks!  After an early clash, Mel Gibson was ‚Äòeasy to work with‚Äô  The former exec worked closely with the then-novice director Mel Gibson on his breakout film Braveheart and got to experience a different side of the actor. After budget negotiations for the epic film got heated, Lansing says she admired the way Gibson was passionate about his work.  ‚ÄúWe had this whole budget fight and at the end of the day I said to him, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm sure you have a dartboard where you have a picture of me,‚Äô and he said, ‚ÄòNo, you were doing your job and I was doing mine,‚Äô ‚Äù Lansing tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúHe was so easy to work with and so passionate. He‚Äôs tireless in his hard work and he‚Äôs one of the most talented actors and one of the most brilliant directors in the business.‚Äù  Crown Archetype  Robert Redford sure can deliver a pickup line  Lansing has been on hand to witness filming on some of the greatest movies ever made, like Gibson‚Äôs epic war scenes in Braveheart and James Cameron‚Äòs perfect recreation of the doomed Titanic ship. But the moments that stand out to her as the best are much smaller.  The former producer reveals one of the best moments on set for her was when Robert Redford perfectly delivered the pivotal question in Indecent Proposal. ‚ÄúI remember thinking that the movie would succeed or fail on whether or not he could pull that line off,‚Äù Lansing tells PEOPLE. ‚ÄúI was sitting in a corner near the camera, watching the first take, when Redford just threw the line away like he was asking someone for a cup of water. And I went, ‚ÄòOh my God, that‚Äôs so brilliant, that‚Äôs genius.‚Äô That moment when you see something come to life is so incredible.‚Äù  Leading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker, written by Stephen Galloway, is out now. Lansing will reveal more behind-the-scenes secrets on Friday, April 28 when she sits down with Galloway and Michael Douglas for a talk at the 92nd Street Y theater in New York City."

Kardashian West is busy managing her own makeup line, KKW Beauty, while sister Khlo√© launched her jean line, Good American, last year. Kourtney is about to launch a new line with younger sister Kylie Jenner, KOURT X KYLIE.  All three are also mothers. Kim recently welcomed her third child, daughter Chicago West, while Kourtney has three children under the age of 10 with ex Scott Disick. Khlo√© recently welcomed her first child, daughter True Thompson.  The Kardashians‚Äô fashion boutique in their hometown of Calabasas was the first storefront they opened. Later on, their store became a fixture in the first seasons of their hit E! reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  The sisters were consistently seen managing their store together on the show as they rose to fame. In their spinoff shows, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami and Kourtney and Kim Take New York, they were also seen opening up DASH stores in those major cities.  Another spinoff show, Dash Dolls, debuted in 2015 and focused on their employees as they got to know the Kardashians and managed the store while the sisters were away.

"Ask and you shall receive: After a swarm of messages from fans demanding it, HBO announced Big Little Lies is officially returning for a second season. It makes total sense why the network wants to continue this franchise. For one, people loved it: The season one finale brought in a whopping 1.9 million viewers , which is huge for premium cable. It was also a critical favorite, sweeping both the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. Will lightning strike twice, though? Based on what HBO's released about season two, it seems like yes. The brand has all the ingredients to make a phenomenal second season (including Meryl Streep).  Until then, here's everything we know about Big Little Lies season two:  It's not airing until 2019. Unfortunately, it'll be a while before Madeline Martha Mackenzie and her one-liners are on your screen again. Production on Big Little Lies season two is slated to start in spring 2018.  Most of the original cast is expected to return. HBO has only confirmed Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman at this point. However, the network said in a press release most of season one's cast is expected to return, and negotiations are underway. All the original actresses are said to be receiving significant pay bumps, as well.  Alexander Skarsg√•rd is back too. His character, Perry Wright, was murdered at the end of season one, but TV Line confirms he'll still pop up around Monterrey, California‚Äîpresumably in the form of flashbacks. Of course, Skarsg√•rd did tell people.com , ""I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm really dead or not,"" but he was most likely just teasing.  Season two will be just as dramatic (and violent) as the first. In its original release, HBO teased that ""relationships will fray"" and ""loyalties will erode"" in season two. Plus, ""the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom."" So that basically means someone's going to get hurt.  There will be seven episodes. Just like season one.  David E. Kelley, the screenwriter who crafted season one, is returning. He'll write all seven scripts for season two, based on a story ideated by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty.  Andrea Arnold will direct season two. She's directed episodes for some of the best shows on TV, including Transparent and I Love Dick, along with some incredible indie films, like American Honey. She's replacing Jean-Marc Vall√©e, who helmed all seven episodes in season one and is returning to season two as an executive producer.  Meryl Streep is joining the cast. Which is a huge deal. She'll be playing Mary Louise Wright, the mother of deceased Perry, who comes to Monterrey concerned for her grandchildren.  She's not the only new character, either. Casting is underway for Bonnie's (Zo√´ Kravitz) parents, Elizabeth and Martin Howard. In addition, there will be a new employee at Otter Bay School who befriends Jane, and together they swap their ""deepest secrets."" Finally, a new socially conscious teacher at Otter Bay, Michael Perkins, will cause drama when his lessons about global warning give Amabella panic attacks. (Can't this girl live for five seconds?) The actors for the latter two characters haven't been announced yet. Dennis O'Hare is also joining the cast as Ira Farber.

"WASHINGTON D.C. ( USA ): Guess co-founder Paul Marciano has vehemently dismissed the sexual harassment allegations made against him by Hollywood actress and model Kate Upton ""Five days ago, Kate Upton tweeted that I abused my position at Guess to 'sexually and emotionally harass women.

"At an intimate show in his hometown of Tishomingo, Oklahoma, February 9, Blake Shelton offered the crowd plenty of their favorites ‚Äî including his girlfriend, Gwen Stefani. ‚ÄúGwen sat in the stands and was grooving along,‚Äù a concert-goer says in the new issue of Us Weekly. ‚ÄúBlake sang a lot in her direction.‚Äù At one point, he even shared a sweet detail of their home life, says the witness: ‚ÄúTheir dog was having puppies and they couldn‚Äôt wait to get home!‚Äù  For now, those furry family members are serving as surrogates of sorts. ‚ÄúBlake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold,‚Äù an insider shares in the new issue. ‚ÄúTheir feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they‚Äôve decided to not focus on it for the time being.‚Äù  Stefani, 48, and Shelton, 41, have been trying to conceive for over a year, the source reveals. But the one blessing of their struggle is that it‚Äôs made them stronger than ever. The source says Shelton is ‚Äúabsolutely devoted‚Äù to Gwen‚Äôs sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4: ‚ÄúBlake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys.‚Äù  Shelton‚Äôs devotion is part of what made the couple try for a child together. ‚ÄúBlake has always wanted children,‚Äù explains a friend. ‚ÄúAnd he‚Äôs great with Gwen‚Äôs kids, which prompted them wanting their own.‚Äù  The No Doubt singer was all in ‚Äî but not anymore. ‚ÄúNot because of a change in her love for Blake,‚Äù explains the source, ‚Äúbut because she feels as if it might not be meant to be.‚Äù The country star is on board with her thoughts. ‚ÄúHe is completely at peace with the prospect of not having any biological children of his own,‚Äù shares the insider.  With no baby, they‚Äôve also put their wedding plans on hold. Says the source, ‚ÄúGwen is very traditional and wouldn‚Äôt want to be pregnant without being married.‚Äù  Still, things are hardly cooling off for the Voice coaches. ‚ÄúTheir relationship has grown and matured into a stable, loving union,‚Äù explains the source. ‚ÄúThe need to get married and have kids isn‚Äôt the priority it once was.‚Äù  When the duo first announced they were dating in November 2015, they were both going through emotional divorces. Stefani split from the father of her boys, Gavin Rossdale, after being married for 13 years, and Shelton had recently ended his four-year union with Miranda Lambert.  Now, the pair have settled in to an ‚Äúeasy, effortless love‚Äù together, says the source. That includes spending plenty of time on Shelton‚Äôs Oklahoma ranch ‚Äî something the glamour girl surprisingly adores! Another favorite activity? ‚ÄúGwen loves hanging out with Blake‚Äôs friends and wives,‚Äù says the source.

"CLOSE Walmart is moving Cosmopolitan magazine from the checkout aisle after concerns were raised about the content. Elizabeth Keatinge (@elizkeatinge) has more. Buzz60  Cosmopolitan (Photo: Cosmopolitan)  Walmart is moving Cosmopolitan to a less uptown locale.  The retail giant will remove the women's fashion magazine from checkout lines at 5,000 stores across the country.  In a statement shared with USA TODAY, Walmart spokesperson Meggan Kring said: ‚ÄúAs with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes. Walmart will continue to offer Cosmopolitan to customers that wish to purchase the magazine, but it will no longer be located in the checkout aisles. While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard.‚Äù  The news was shared Tuesday via a press release from National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE), an organization that says it helped instigate the policy change.  ""You can go through and buy your groceries with your family knowing you don't have to be exposed to this graphic and often degrading and offensive material,"" NCOSE Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Haley Halverson said in a Facebook live session Tuesday. ""Instead, all of these magazines will be moved, in isolation, to the magazine racks.""  A Cosmopolitan spokesperson told the Associated Press Wednesday that the magazine is ""proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world.""  Cosmo began running frank content about sex under the direction of editor Helen Gurley Brown in 1965. Brown transformed the once family-oriented magazine into a publication for single women that ‚Äî along with topics on relationships, beauty, fashion and health ‚Äî still publishes advice and discussions on sex.  The NCOSE, which changed its name from Morality in Media in 2015, has been working to cover or remove Cosmo from store shelves for years, deeming it porn. In 2015, the group was behind a successful push to place the magazine behind blinders in stores owned by Rite Aid and Delhaize America (which owns Hannaford Stores and Food Lion).  The organization has also been a strong Playboy opposer. Patrick Trueman, president of NCOSE, called Hugh Hefner ""a pioneer in the sexual objectification and use of women"" following his death in September, saying the Playboy founder left behind ""a legacy of sexual exploitation and public health harms.""  The Walton family, heirs to Walmart founder Sam Walton, have traditionally donated more to Republicans, and have had a conservative reputation, though the company dropped out of conservative advocacy group American Legislative Council in 2012.  Walmart's decision comes amid the Me Too movement and a national reckoning on sexual harassment, according to Halverson.  ""This is one less drop of hyper-sexualized media that is going to be bombarding people in their everyday lives, which does make a difference, especially in this Me Too culture that we're living in, where we really want a culture that will respect women and ensure their dignity is understood,"" Halverson said.  The Me Too movement, however, has focused on sexual harassment and assault rather than pornography. It gained momentum in October as bombshell reports from The New York Times and The New Yorkerdetailed decades of alleged sexual harassment and assault by producer Harvey Weinstein. Allegations against dozens of men in positions of power emerged in following weeks, and celebrities and non-celebrities alike flooded social media platforms with the hashtag #MeToo with their own stories of harassment, highlighting the depth of the problem.  USA TODAY's exclusive industry-wide survey revealed 94% of women say they have experienced some form of sexual harassment or assault over the course of their careers in the entertainment industry.  In a statement to USA TODAY Wednesday, Halverson says NCOSE hopes other major retailers follow Walmart's example.  ""We are not expressly calling for any boycotts, but we are asking Target and Walgreens to follow Walmart's example and also remove Cosmo from their checkout aisles,"" she wrote.  The Cosmo ban has caused debate on social media, with some praising Walmart's decision and others saying the company missed the point of the Me Too movement.

"As Will & Grace is coming back to NBC for at least two new seasons, the series‚Äô original 194 episodes will be made available for streaming for the first time via a deal with Hulu. The Emmy-winning comedy will be available beginning Thursday, a week ahead of the September 28 return of Will & Grace on NBC.  Hulu will be the exclusive SVOD partner for the original eight seasons, which also will be available on the NBC app and pay TV providers with authentication. The deal also extends to the new episodes of Will & Grace, which will be available for streaming on the same platforms the day after their broadcast premiere.  Hulu was the logical home for Will & Grace because, as an NBC corporate sibling, it gets access to the network‚Äôs current series via the network‚Äôs stacking rights. The pact keeps new and library episodes together, as was the case with NBC‚Äôs freshman drama series This Is Us, which also went to Hulu in SVOD. Additionally, Hulu has been active in acquiring streaming rights to broadcast comedy series, including the Golden Girls library.  The original eight seasons of Will & Grace ran from 1998-2006, receiving 83 Emmy nominations and 16 wins, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2000.  ‚ÄúAs we gear up for the launch of the upcoming season premiere, I can‚Äôt think of a better way to reintroduce Will & Grace to the cultural zeitgeist than by giving audiences the opportunity to watch this historic and hilarious series wherever and whenever they want,‚Äù said NBC Entertainment Chairman Robert Greenblatt. ‚ÄúWith its witty comebacks, pop-culture references and social commentary, Will & Grace is one of the most binge-able comedies in television history, and I am certain fans both old and new will jump on this opportunity to devour it.‚Äù  NBC  The Will & Grace revival starring Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Sean Hayes and Megan Mullally already has been picked up for a second season with 13 additional episodes. Both the original and new episodes of Will & Grace are written and executive produced by series creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan, and directed and executive produced by James Burrows.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no question that Will & Grace has resonated with audiences since the series made its broadcast premiere,‚Äù said Hulu, Chief Content Officer Joel Stillerman. ‚ÄúTo be able to bring such an iconic show into the streaming universe for the first time ever is an opportunity we couldn‚Äôt pass up. This landmark deal will allow fans to re-watch their favorite moments ahead of the series premiere, as well as bring Will & Grace and its cast of characters to a whole new audience.‚Äù"
"Chris Farley has been gone for 20 years, yet his movies, skits, and characters are still talked about and recanted every single day. The ‚ÄúTommy Boy‚Äù star may have left us physically on December 18, 1997 ‚Ä¶ but his comedic legacy will always stay with us.  In honor of the legendary entertainer, we had to go back and remember some of his greatest moments, in no particular order.  1.

Chippendales    The famous sketch with Patrick Swayze will go down as one of Saturday Night Live‚Äôs best, although many friends of Farley have said since his death they felt the sketch was painful for him.  4. Billy Madison  The angry bus driver was one of the funniest parts in ‚ÄúBilly Madison.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo Yelling on the bus!!!‚Äù  5. Gap Girls    Watching Adam Sandler try to hold himself together when Farley belts out his infamous ‚ÄúLay off me I‚Äôm starving‚Äù line is pure gold.

"But sources say there‚Äôs another huge reason for her wanting to lie low ‚Äì problems with Brad Pitt, who friends have confirmed would be the father of her child.  It‚Äôs believed Brad and Jen ‚Äì who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen‚Äôs marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year ‚Äì have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad‚Äôs controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.  Last month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.  Added to this is the fact Jen‚Äôs also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it‚Äôs a difficult time for the actress.  ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs under a lot of stress at the moment, so... all these questions about a surprise pregnancy are the last thing she wants,‚Äô adds the source.  ‚ÄòNot only is she going through a messy divorce, she‚Äôs having problems with Brad. Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she‚Äôs been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.  ‚ÄòBrad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they‚Äôre just friends and that he‚Äôs committed but Jen just isn‚Äôt buying it.  ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs very wary of him ‚Äì after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.  ‚ÄòWhile Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she‚Äôs also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that‚Äôs how everything worked out,‚Äô reveals the insider.  After her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.  ‚ÄòShe had been sad it never happened,‚Äô a source told the magazine. ‚ÄòBut it never consumed her.‚Äô  But since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.  ‚ÄòThis could be a dream come true for her, and she‚Äôs not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that‚Äôs absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.‚Äô  Over the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.  In the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: ‚ÄòThis continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don‚Äôt want to be a mother and how selfish that is,‚Äô she told Allure.  Denying that was the case, she said: ‚ÄòNo. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.‚Äô  For the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!"

"Chris Soules, former star of ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Bachelor,‚Äù after his arrest. (Buchanan County Sheriff via AP)  Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Bachelor‚Äù who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer.  Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted.  The case has garnered the attention of Soules‚Äôs ‚ÄúBachelor‚Äù fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star‚Äôs work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate.  ‚ÄúThis story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,‚Äù Mary Jo Brown, Arlington‚Äôs city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. ‚ÄúSometimes fame isn‚Äôt your friend.‚Äù  Soules, who also appeared in ‚ÄúDancing with the Stars‚Äù and ‚ÄúWorst Chefs in America,‚Äù called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home.  The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said.  The tractor driver ‚Äî later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran ‚Äî was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said.  Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher‚Äôs questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure.  The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way.  ‚ÄúCan I, can I call you back really quick?‚Äù Soules asked the dispatcher.  ‚ÄúYeah, you can call me back,‚Äù she says.  ‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù Soules responds.  Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff‚Äôs Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules ‚Äútook off‚Äù in a red truck.  Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said.  Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash.  Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor.  During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He ‚Äúwould not come out,‚Äù the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which ‚Äútook hours.‚Äù  Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR ‚Äî Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017  Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were ‚Äúrunning into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information‚Äù but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights.  According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register.  The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed.  Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation.  A statement from Soules‚Äôs publicist earlier this week said he was ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù were with the man‚Äôs family.  Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora ‚Äî population 200 ‚Äî lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher‚Äôs obituary.  An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association.  ‚ÄúKenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,‚Äù Mosher‚Äôs obituary said. ‚ÄúHis family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.‚Äù  In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.    Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff during the finale of ‚ÄúThe Bachelor.‚Äù (ABC via AP)  Soules‚Äôs three sisters signed him up to be a suitor on ‚ÄúThe Bachelorette‚Äù in 2014. He was a fan favorite, making it to the final three before bachelorette Andi Dorfman sent him home. Soules ‚Äî nicknamed ‚ÄúFarmer Chris‚Äù ‚Äî later returned as the star of his own season. He proposed to Whitney Bischoff, a contestant from Chicago, but the two split after a brief engagement.  He later competed on ‚ÄúDancing with the Stars‚Äù and the Food Network‚Äôs ‚ÄúWorst Chefs in America.‚Äù Soules has since made guest appearances on various ‚ÄúBachelor‚Äù franchise spin-offs shows and was rumored to be a cast member for this summer‚Äôs taping of ‚ÄúBachelor in Paradise,‚Äù where former contestants search for love on a tropical island.  Soules had used his reality TV platform to travel Iowa and the Midwest advocating for agricultural issues, including ethanol and renewable fuels.

"The rumor mill is churning out some fake news about Barbados' own Rihanna.  In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‚ÄòIf Jesus Hasn‚Äôt Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan‚Äô, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I‚Äôm still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y‚Äôall the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it‚Äôs the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.‚Äù  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

"Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.  When the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, ""wow. i can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I‚Äôm so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn‚Äôt have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics."" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.  It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).  This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.  And here's what Twitter had to say about it.  Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.  Dictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.  The account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, ""Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman."" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of ""self-made"" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.  One person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.  Kardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, ""CONGRATS @KylieJenner"" with three flame emojis. The second said ""Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY"" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)  One fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.  The tweet said, ""The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident."" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.  Whether you think Kylie Jenner is ""self-made"" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner. Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and the Devil may work hard, but Kris Jenner works harder."

"Singer FERGIE has separated from her actor husband Josh Duhamel after eight years of marriage.  The stars announced the sad news on Thursday, revealing they called it quits months ago.  ‚ÄúWith absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,‚Äù the estranged couple wrote in a statement issued to People.com. ‚ÄúTo give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public.

"Losing a pet is never an easy thing to go through, and actress Salma Hayek is opening up about the heartbreak she‚Äôs experiencing after having to put down her dog of 18 years, Lupe. The actress posted a touching Instagram picture honoring her beloved pet.  The photo showed Hayek holding Lupe in her lap with the caption, ‚ÄúWith my heart filled with love and pain I had to say goodbye to my Lupe. I am so grateful for the 18 years she enriched my life with her great spirit. I have no words or tears to describe how much she meant to me,‚Äù she wrote.  Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt the first time Hayek has lost a pet. In 2016, Hayek lost her 9-year-old dog, Mozart, after a terrible act of gun violence. According to the Instagram post after that tragic loss, she took a week away from social media to grieve the passing of her pet.  Of course, it‚Äôs never easy to cope with the loss of a pet because they are a beloved member of your family and often a closer friend than many people, but fans are writing to Hayek and sending condolences in order to help ease her pain.  ‚ÄúWe love you and are so grateful for all you do for the animals.

"ATLANTIC CITY, NJ ‚Äî Trashed by emails sent by pageant officials, former Miss Americas may help choose the new leaders of the Miss America Organization.  The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group‚Äôs executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group‚Äôs interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization‚Äôs leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  ‚ÄúThe board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGiven the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.‚Äù  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board‚Äôs statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders. Others said they wanted no involvement whatsoever by any current board members in seeking new leadership.  see also Miss America execs resign after disgusting emails surface There they go ‚Äî a series of vulgar e-mails has...  ‚ÄúAt this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,‚Äù Miss America 1977 Dorothy Benham told the AP. ‚ÄúThey have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united.‚Äù  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  ‚ÄúThe board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,‚Äù she told the AP late Wednesday. ‚ÄúThey need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.‚Äù  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members ‚Äúwill begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,‚Äù a statement from the board read.  There are currently two vacancies on the 14-member board, and there will be at least two more when the resignations of Randle and Weidner become effective in a matter of weeks.  The organization hopes to have the nominations in hand by Jan. 3. The board said it was notifying groups of its decision to seek their help late Wednesday night.  The emails already cost the pageant its television production partner and raised questions about the future of the nationally televised broadcast from Atlantic City‚Äôs Boardwalk Hall the week after Labor Day each year. Dick Clark Productions told the AP last Thursday that it cut ties with the Miss America Organization over the emails, calling them ‚Äúappalling.‚Äù  Meyers said the group has spoken with ABC, the television network scheduled to broadcast the September 2018 pageant, as well as with pageant sponsors. None has ended its relationship with the Miss America Organization, he said. Independent messages sent by the AP over the past two days seeking comment from ABC and pageant sponsors have gone unanswered."

"Rumors have been swirling about the reasons behind the breakup of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. And it has finally been revealed that the actual cause behind their recent split was that Selena decided to choose ‚Äòhappiness‚Äô over Justin!  J-Beebs and Selena‚Äôs romance has been the most tumultuous one in the celebrity world. They broke up and got back together so many times that even the Jelena shippers have lost count.

"Rihanna is so beloved that when she snags herself a man, people around the world rejoice. After Drake and Rihanna played with fans' heart strings with their on-off romance, they just want her to be with someone who really makes her happy. And some new photos of Rihanna and a mystery man in a pool seemed to hint that she was pretty happy. The Daily Mail posted photos of Rihanna making out with a man in a pool in Spain on Tuesday, and according TMZ, the mystery of who this guy is may now be solved. TMZ reports that Rihanna's pool man is Hassan Jameel, and he happens to be worth a lot of money.  Rih's fans are ecstatic to see her frolicking, laughing, and making out with a very good-looking man while on vacation. In addition to the pool photos, the two have now been spotted smiling while walking around in Ibiza. A source told The Sun about Jameel and Rihanna,  ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been spending a lot of time together away from prying eyes and are really serious. They‚Äôre really enjoying each others‚Äô company.‚Äù  That sounds like a pretty ideal situation, and quite frankly, Rihanna deserves it.

"Blake Shelton Gwen Stefani and have no engagement and only hunt, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can handle this story exclusively. A representative confirms that the allegations are both wrong and fabricated.  Hollywood Life allegedly claims to have ""exclusive details"" about how Stefani and Shelton ""could renounce an engagement and make the covenant."" A so-called ""source close to Gwen"" is quoted as saying: ""They talk about it all the time and that's how they live together [sic] as if they were already married."" This alleged snitch goes on to say, ""With her busy deadline, Gwen even talked to Blake about skipping the engagement and instead just one Beach or somewhere in the country to loft, if the romantic mood is right. ""  Obviously, the site is unaware that a couple can be engaged and still run away, so these claims make no sense. In the sense of Dictionary.com ""elope"" means ""secretly run away to be married"". It does not exclude an engagement. It rather means marriage, which is held without knowledge or participation of other people. Of course, this is more than just terminology.  While the blog claims that the performers could ""skip"" an engagement, she has already spread several stories about her becoming engaged. If you look at just the last year, there are at least four stories that contradict this current narrative (see screengrabs of the headlines below). For example, in May 2017, the website claimed that Stefani wanted Shelton to suggest that she use her ""The Voice"" downtime to plan a wedding. By October, the store speculated that the country superstar had ""secretly suggested"" and they were engaged after Stefani was seen in a ""giant diamond ring"".  Then in December, there was an article by HollywoodLies, as he's called ""They'll never marry if they're not engaged in 2018"" and continue to say, ""If there's no ring on Gwen's finger by the end of the new year, the couple can take the marriage forever off the table. "" This latest piece, the ""source"" mentioned, calls the marriage between Shelton and Stefani ""inevitable."" That's not all. In February, the site claimed Shelton was shopping for a diamond ring, which was to be used in a ""Valentine's Day Proposal"".  Valentine's Day has clearly come and gone without any suggestion, so HollywoodLies is now pretending it has never made such an assertion or any of the others, so it may offer this new tale to ""skip"" an engagement. But journalism does not work in a vacuum. Consistency shows credibility. And the blog's own story shows that it's not believable. It is also noteworthy that HollywoodLies first alleged Shelton and Stefani broke through in 2015. A similar claim was made last November, and they still did. This also shows that the website is untrustworthy.  And that's not all. A few days ago, the outlet uncovered a false cover story Life & Style about Stefani, who is not just pregnant, but is also planning a wedding in Mexico that will feature celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. This new ""Exclusive"" does not mention pregnancy and does not explain what happened to the supposed plans for a star wedding. Regardless of whether the publication claims there will be a wedding or a secret ceremony, HollywoodLies is still wrong. Less than a month ago, it was reported that Stefani and Shelton are unwilling to marry and are so happy with their relationship.  So, both scenarios are wrong: They're not planning a big wedding or talking about Eloping. Stefani's representative already said Gossip Cop earlier this week that the wedding (and pregnancy) allegations were ""untrue"" and now the spokesman confirmed to us that this new story is fake and fake. On the basis of all the evidence sketched here by Gossip Cop that should be very clear."
"May we never forget the bizarre story that set Bachelor Nation ablaze: The Bachelor's Bekah M. was reported missing, yes, full on listed as a missing person in Humboldt County, California, even while people were watching her on the show. Though she has commented on it via Twitter in the past, as it turns out, why Bekah M. was reported missing is a totally relatable story. While appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel interviewed Bekah M., or Bekah Martinez, over a video call. After he asked if she got her pink fringed earrings from the marijuana farm ‚Äî the North Coast Journal reported that the former Bachelor contestant had gone to Humboldt to work on a marijuana farm ‚Äî Martinez got a chance to explain the whole story.  TheNorth Coast Journal listed her as a missing person in Humboldt County, California on Feb. 1. (The Northern California newspaper reported Bekah M. as being one of the ""Humboldt 35,"" which included a list of 34 other missing persons. The list is now down to 33, according to the Journal, thanks to Bekah M. being accounted for.) ""First of all,"" she told Kimmel. ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying I was on a farm when I was actually on the Bachelor but no, I had already been eliminated from the show.""  ABC/YouTube  According to the missing persons report, Martinez left for Northern California on Nov. 12, and her mother reported that she'd been missing on Nov. 18 after not heard from her daughter. Since The Bachelor began filming on Sept. 20, and now everyone knows that Martinez was eliminated after the seventh week, that means that she left the show sometime in early Nov. 2017. The fact that she then went away to have a fun week with her friends makes sense, but it also led to some of the confusion as to why she'd gone MIA since many people suspected that Bekah M. was chosen by Arie Luyendyk, Jr. on The Bachelor.  After all, since Bachelor contestants have strict rules about phone usage, it made sense that Bekah M. would not call her mom for a few days in a row. And, since Nov. 18 would likely be when The Bachelor was wrapping up, it made fans think that she had made it to the final two ‚Äî or that she was the one Luyendyk picked.  But, as it turns out, Bekah M. had been eliminated and she simply went away. ""I just decided to go up to the mountains with friends for a couple weeks and I was there for six or seven days without phone service,"" she told Kimmel. ""I thought that I was going to have phone service, and I told my mother that I would. I just had this weird feeling on the six or seventh day and I was like 'I need to go home now' so I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents, and then come to find out only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff's Department saying that I was missing.""  As for why the North Coast Journal reported that Martinez was on a marijuana farm when she'd just told Kimmel she wanted to go to the mountains, well, you'd have to know a bit about the local geography. ""I was on a marijuana farm?"" she said before laughing and then explaining, "" It's Humboldt County."" In case you're not from California, you should probably know that Humboldt County is densely populated with marijuana farms. Her simple explanation makes sense, and she also clarified to Kimmel that she's still a nanny in Los Angeles and not a weed farmer.  Besides the much-needed clarification, one of the best revelations to come from Bekah M.'s appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live was the fact that the Bachelor contestant remained close with Kendall. It even sounds like she has stayed close with most of the contestants from Arie's Bachelor season, except Tia, who played a big part in Martinez's elimination. Hopefully, this means that the young Bachelor contestant will come back for Bachelor in Paradise. Because Bachelor Nation needs Bekah M. ‚Äî as long as she remembers to call her mother and not send the whole country into panic again."
"WITH THE EUROPEAN MIGRANT CRISIS GROWING WORSE EVERY SINGLE DAY, MANY DOUBT THAT EUROPE WILL BE ABLE TO SURVIVE ITS SELF-INFLICTED IMMIGRATION WOUNDS.Some Islamic leaders have even stated that Europe will be ruled under a caliphate within the next 2 generations. While many politicians are as spineless and weak as can be, such as Merkel, Macron, and London‚Äôs Mayor, some are standing up to the atrocity that is Islamic Extremism.In an incredible turn of events, 139 out of 168 deputies voted in favor of an amendment which would allow citizens to carry guns and shoot terrorists on sight. ‚ÄúWe do not want to disarm our own people at a time when the security situation is deteriorating,‚Äù Interior Minister Milan Chovanec said on Wednesday.Sputnik News, a news agency centered in Moscow, reports:‚ÄúThe new law states that Czech citizens have the right to acquire, keep and bear arms in order to ensure the security of the state.‚Äù‚ÄúIt means that the approximately 360,000 licensed gun-owners in the Czech Republic are allowed to carry their weapons in public and use them in case of a public order emergency, such as terrorism.‚ÄùMillions of patriotic men and women are PROUD to stand with the Czech Republic, fearing that if we don‚Äôt take action, Islam will soon overtake our nation. Some of the more pathetic and pandering individuals, however, have criticized the new law.The Guardian compares the law to Hitler:‚ÄúThere is little to smile about, however, when Zeman sets out what he sees as the threat being posed by radical Islamists ‚Äì and even ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù Muslims, who he says could be radicalised to commit terror attacks as ordinary Germans were once inspired to fanatically back Hitler.‚ÄùYes, that‚Äôs right‚Äîbecause apparently Leftists think that protecting your nation from a cult of death, that rapes women, stones gays, and beheads thieves, is somehow ‚Äúintolerant.‚Äù Well do you know what most Americans think?You‚Äôre damn right it‚Äôs intolerant! Why the HELL should we be tolerant of a barbaric religion that wants to take us back to the 500‚Äôs AD? We shouldn‚Äôt! We value freedom and family, and we WILL NOT have our country overrun by Islam.Thankfully, despite the overwhelming Leftist propaganda claiming that the law is ‚Äúunfair,‚Äù and ‚Äúdiscriminates,‚Äù against Muslims, conservatives all across the world have had their morale boosted.Despite what liberals may say about gun safety issues, The Czech Republic is actually one of the safest nations out there‚Äî6th safest in the world, to be exact.‚ÄúAlthough Western European countries such as France, Belgium, Germany and the UK have suffered several terrorist attacks in recent years, the Czech Republic has not seen any attacks. The Global Peace Index 2016 ranked the country the sixth safest in the world.‚ÄùAfter the past decade of liberal policies, pandering to immigrants, and welcoming terrorists into our country with open arms, many are proud to see that Europe is beginning to stand up for itself. Hope may not be lost, after all.With the massive movement of grass-roots nationalism growing, from Nigel Farage and Brexit, to Donald Trump, to various countries exiting the EU and valuing their OWN citizens and heritage over others, it seems that Western Civilization has a fighting chance of surviving."
"Jennifer Garner might have filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, yet she‚Äôs apparently still perplexing to make him sceptical by flirting with another male ‚Äì her co-star, Josh Duhamel.  Jennifer and Josh are operative together on a coming-of-age play ‚ÄòSimon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda‚Äô in Atlanta right now, and according to a news from a National Enquirer, a dual co-stars have grown really close.

However, it‚Äôs really easy to suppose Ben Affleck removing possessive and jealous, even yet their subdivision is all yet central now.

"Adam West, the actor who brought deadpan comedy and a hero‚Äôs jutting jaw to the title character of TV‚Äôs landmark ‚Äô60s superhero series Batman, died yesterday at the age of 88. A spokesperson for the family said West died of leukemia, surrounded by family.  A cultural phenomenon from the moment it debuted on January 12, 1966 on ABC, Batman was a twice-weekly treat for children ‚Äì with its comic book-style POW!s and BAM!s highlighting the climactic fight scenes ‚Äì and, with its campy humor and pop-art visuals, adults as well.  Rex Features via AP  A parade of weekly villains ‚Äì from Cesar Romero‚Äôs Joker, Frank Gorshin‚Äôs Riddler, Burgess Meredith‚Äôs Penguin and, impeccably, Julie Newmar‚Äôs Catwoman ‚Äì passed through 120 episodes from beginning to the March 14, 1968 end, but it was West and Burt Ward as his sidekick (and ward) Robin that anchored the happenings with a note-perfect send-up of stoicism.  ‚ÄúOur dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight,‚Äù West‚Äôs family said in a statement, ‚Äúand aspired to make a positive impact on his fans‚Äô lives. He was and always will be our hero.‚Äù  West is survived by his wife Marcelle, six children, five grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren. His career spanned six decades during which he appeared in more than 50 films and television shows, most recently as the voice of Mayor Adam West on Family Guy, and as a guest star on The Big Bang Theory.  West, a Seattle native born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928, began working in local radio while still in college, served as an announcer on American Forces Network television during an Army stint, then worked at various local TV stations, at one point landing a gig in Hawaii co-hosting a weekday show with Peaches the chimp.  A Warner Brothers contract brought a steady stream of bit roles, guest shots and series regular spots on episodic television as the ‚Äô50s eased into the ‚Äô60s: Lawman, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Bronco, Colt .45, 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, The Detectives, Bonanza, Petticoat Junction, Bewitched, and films like Tammy and the Doctor and, with the Three Stooges, The Outlaws Is Coming.  Oddly enough, it was West‚Äôs appearance in a spy-themed Nestle‚Äôs Quik commercial that got noticed by producer William Dozier, and West was soon cast, along with newcomer Ward, in the arch series about arch-villains and the Caped Crusaders who, week after week, tracked them, fought them and finally handed them over to Commissioner Gordon (Neil Hamilton) and Police Chief O‚ÄôHara (Stafford Repp).  Though the series quickly attained an odd combo of mass popularity and cult fervor, the joke ‚Äì and the budget ‚Äì began wearing thin just as fast, and a third season crept along without as much assistance from Yvonne Craig‚Äôs new Batgirl as might have been necessary.  Associated Press  West, like Ward and others who populated the California-sunny Gotham City, would never overcome the typecasting, and by 1980 was eking out a career in embarrassments like The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. After semi-retirement in Idaho, he‚Äôd eventually embrace his past by voicing animated programs from 1984‚Äôs Superfriends: The Legendary Super Powers Show to 2004‚Äôs The Batman (not, alas, in the title role). He became familiar to 21st Century generations via Family Guy (as Mayor Adam West), Comic-Con and other nostalgia appearances and the 2014 release of Batman on DVD.  West received a star on The Hollywood Hall of Fame star in 2012, a moment captured in James E. Tooley‚Äôs 2013 doc Starring Adam West."
"0  NBC has ordered a trio of additional episodes for the new drama series Manifest, but this is not a case of playing it safe. Traditionally when a network series debuts during the fall season, it does so with 13 episodes in the can. Then, depending on how the show does ratings-wise, a network might order nine additional episodes (called a ‚Äúback nine‚Äù) to consist of a full season‚Äôs worth of episodes‚Äî22 in total. With Manifest, however, NBC is taking a page out of cable‚Äôs book by allowing the drama series to conclude its first season with just 16 episodes, rather than have to draw the story out to 22.  The show revolves around the passengers of a flight that experienced turbulence on its way back to New York City, during which the power in the plane went out. The plane recovered quickly, but when it landed in New York City the flight‚Äôs passengers and crew were shocked to discover they‚Äôve all been missing and presumed dead for more than five years. Each week‚Äôs episode features a procedural element as the passengers returned to lives that had moved on without them, as well as an ongoing mythology hook regarding what exactly happened to the plane.  This order of three additional episodes is good news both for the writers of Manifest and fans of the show. Back when Damon Lindelof was making LOST, he and co-showrunner Carlton Cuse famously lobbied ABC to let them set a finite endpoint for the series. A show that serialized could only go on for so long, and by Season 3 they were running out of the steam necessary to create 22 hours of content each year. ABC reluctantly acquiesced, and the subsequent seasons consisted of no more than 18 episodes each year. Now seasons of 13 episodes are the norm on cable networks, while broadcast networks continue to stick to the 22-episode seasons to fill out air time necessary for ads.  So yes, Manifest will at the very least conclude its first season, and a Season 2 pickup is probably likely if the ratings remain strong. The show airs on NBC Mondays at 10pm ET."
"[PHOTO:Hollywood star Jennifer Lawrence says she looks forward to ‚ÄòSatan destroying Donald Trump‚Äô]  In a bizarre rant, Oscar-winning Hollywood actress Jennifer Lawrence has said that she is ‚Äúlooking forward‚Äù to Donald Trump being ‚Äúdestroyed‚Äù by ‚Äúour Lord Satan.‚ÄùThe Hunger Games star makes no secret of her disdain for the president and has been one of his more vocal critics since he first started his campaign to run for office.  Her criticisms have often seemed a little misguided, but this time she seems to have attacked his ‚ÄúJesus bullsh*t‚Äù Christian values.The White House Christmas decorations this year is themed ‚ÄúTime-honored traditions,‚Äù and features a nativity scene that was chosen by first lady Melania Trump ‚Äì religious references being something that was avoided by the previous president.  Shortly after arriving for The Hollywood Reporter‚Äôs 2017 Women In Entertainment Breakfast held at Milk Studios on Wednesday (December 6) in Los Angeles, Lawrence was heard chatting with a group of friends in the VIP area, drink in hand, when the conversation turned sour after someone mentioned Donald Trump.‚ÄùDon‚Äôt get me started on that guy,‚Äù she blasted, holding her glass up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to throw this martini in his face!‚Äù  As the group laughed in agreement, she continued with the rant: ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs with all this nativity, Jesus bullsh*t in the White House all of a sudden?‚ÄùThat‚Äôs not our Lord.‚ÄùTrump is not one of us.‚ÄùI‚Äôm looking forward to watching Satan destroy that guy.‚Äù  Lawrence was then ushered away by her assistant leaving the group looking a little perplexed by the comments.This isn‚Äôt the first time the liberal actor has directed a strange tirade towards Mr. Trump.In September, Lawrence claimed that the spate of natural disasters that devastated the US and surrounding nations over the summer was down to ‚ÄúMother Nature‚Äù taking her revenge on the US for voting in Donald Trump as president.  MORE HERE: Jennifer Lawrence: Hurricanes are Revenge on the US for TrumpShe claimed that Hurricanes Harvey and Irma were an expression of ‚ÄúNature‚Äôs rage‚Äù that had been sent to teach Americans a lesson for not believing in ‚Äúclimate change.‚Äù"
"If you've enjoyed her many bonkers interviews over the years (some of which, to our minds, are every bit as entertaining as her funniest film roles), then you're likely aware that Jennifer Lawrence loves alcohol and reality television.  So it's not surprising that J-Law might have a bit of a thing for Kourtney Kardashian sperm donor and bold innovator in the use of facial hair to camouflage booze bloat, Scott Disick.  On second thought, it is surprising, but only in the sense that we're shocked Scott is still alive.  Anyway, Jen revealed her love for the Lord in a recent interview with Oprah, in which she revealed that Scott would be one of her three ideal dinner guests.  (The other two were Luann DeLesseps and Bethenny Frankel, both of Bravo's Real Housewives franchise. Jen ... we're concerned.)  Given that Jen chose Scott over any of the women in the Kardashian clan, it's not surprising that certain tabloids already have these two bedding down together.  It's also not surprising that some of these same publications are casting Kourtney in the role of the insane ex:  According to the Australian version of OK! magazine (because why wouldn't news about three American celebs reach Sydney first?), Kourtney is pissed about the possibility of Jen and Scott hooking up.  In fact, Kourt has reportedly warned Lawrence to keep her mitts off her boozy baby daddy.  The subtly-titled piece ‚ÄúKourtney Warns J. Law: Stay Away From Scott!‚Äù doesn't offer anything in the way of quotes or evidence, and instead poses an argument along the lines of ""makes sense if ya think about it.""  The article also doesn't mention the fact that Kourtney is dating Younes Bendjima.  Or that Scott is with Sofia Richie.  Or that Jen was clearly joking, and her ideal dinner party would really just consist of Meryl Streep playing three different roles.  Look, we believe Jen when she says she genuinely enjoys Keeping Up With the Kardashians (though it's worth noting that she's said she watches the show ""to fall asleep."" Celebrities--they're as bored with the Kardashians as the rest of us!).  But there's a difference between enjoying a reality show and wanting to enmesh yourself in that world.  We like watching Naked and Afraid, but the thought of a single genital mosquito is enough to keep us inside for the bulk of 2018.  Hey, if the mere mention of Scott Disick doesn't bring to mind a bloodsucker who will spread disease to your nether regions, then you're not sufficiently wary of the Lord."

"Was Selena Gomez cheated on by the Weeknd? That‚Äôs what an article in the current issue of Star Magazine says. The tabloid alleges that the ‚ÄúStarboy‚Äù singer may have slept with an Irish model while he was on tour in Dublin. But Gossip Cop is on the case and they claim that the story is nothing but the work of a ‚ÄúBad Liar.‚Äù  As Gossip Cop reports, Star Magazine says that it ‚Äúlearned that The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, invited Irish Instagram model Ava Van Rose back to his hotel the night before his performance at the Longitude Festival in Dublin on July 15.‚Äù They say that they got the information from a so-called insider who told them that the model spent some time with The Weeknd.  The article then speculates about how Selena will react to the ‚Äúnews‚Äù that Abel may have cheated on her, implying that Gomez would be emotionally gutted by the news.  ‚ÄúShe hoped Abel would prove her wrong. If Selena finds out about this [hookup with Van Rose], there‚Äôs no telling what she might do!‚Äù  But Gossip Cop insists that the story is based on what they call ‚Äúunsubstantiated rumors.‚Äù They say that the story was first published in The Irish Sun and was derived from an insider in the model‚Äôs circle. Even though these claims about the Weeknd are pretty explosive, the story hasn‚Äôt been picked up by any of the major celebrity news publications.

"Demi Lovato Announces 2018 North American Tour Dates With DJ Khaled  Lovatics will get the chance to tell Demi Lovato they love her in 2018 -- the superstar is hitting the road in support of her album Tell Me You Love Me early next year.

"Prior to her hospitalization for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday, the singer had revealed she broke her sobriety in new single ""Sober.""  Demi Lovato was hospitalized for an apparent drug overdose on Tuesday. Hours later, the pop star's representative confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that she was ""awake and with her family"" following the health scare.  ""Demi is awake and with her family, who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support,"" the statement read. ""Some of the information being reported is incorrect, and they respectfully ask for privacy and not speculation, as her health and recovery is the most important thing right now.""  Los Angeles police said, earlier on Tuesday, that they responded to a call at 11:39 a.m. to a home on the 8000 block of Laurel View Drive in the Hollywood Hills, where Lovato lives, for a female victim of a possible overdose. The 25-year-old was reportedly administered Narcan, which is used to treat narcotic overdoses in emergency situations.  The incident occurred just weeks after the former Disney Channel star and reformed addict wrote about breaking her sobriety in her latest track, ""Sober."" In the song, Lovato details her experience with withdrawals and the emotional aftermath of a relapse. The singer had been sober for six years.  ""Momma, I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore/ And daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor,"" she sings. ""To the ones who never left me/ We've been down this road before/ I'm so sorry, I'm not sober anymore.""  Lovato posted a video of an early performance of the song on Twitter with the message, ""Tonight I took the stage, a new person with a new life. Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout this journey. It will never be forgotten.""  She most recently performed the song live at the California Mid-State Fair in Paso Robles on July 22. Lovato reportedly got emotional onstage and forgot some of the lyrics at the end of the song. ""Fuck, I forgot the words,"" Lovato said before walking offstage, an eyewitness recalled to Us Weekly, adding that the entertainer also ""had tears in her eyes.""  Years before the release of ""Sober,"" Lovato ‚Äî who first checked in to rehab at the age of 18 in 2010 and then entered a sober house for approximately a year in 2013 ‚Äî had been open about facing her demons. In 2011, Lovato was diagnosed with bipolar disorder after years of struggling with an eating disorder and self harm, in addition to her drug addiction.  During a 2013 interview with Access Hollywood, Lovato revealed the moment of reckoning she had at age 19. ""I was going to the airport and I had a Sprite bottle just filled with vodka, and it was just 9 in the morning. And I was throwing up in the car, and this was just to get on a plane to go back to L.A. to the sober living house that I was staying at,"" she recounted. ""I had all the help in the world, but I didn't want it.""  In 2015, Lovato ‚Äî who co-owns the L.A. treatment facility CAST Centers ‚Äî explained to Women's Health why she decided to speak openly about her experience in rehab and become a mental health advocate. According to the Camp Rock actress, she had hoped her honesty would help others going through similar situations.  ""I remember sitting with my manager and my family and talking to them about whether or not to speak out about the issues that I was dealing with,"" she said about using her platform to raise awareness. ""I knew that there were two options: I could either not talk about my stint in rehab and hope that it went away, or I could talk about it and inspire people to get help for their issues, as well, so that's exactly what I did.""  She also discussed her diagnosis and the work she has put in to maintain a healthy mind: ""For years, people said I was depressed, and I actually didn't know myself why I was so upset and why I would have these episodes of mania ‚Äî what I now know is mania.""  While appearing on the U.K.'s The Jonathan Ross Show in 2017, the ""Sorry Not Sorry"" singer said that her parents' tough love had helped her stay on track in recent years. ""I knew that I had a lot of life ahead of me, but one of the main reasons of getting sober was so that I could be around my little sister because my mom and dad [said I couldn't be around her] if I was doing stuff,"" she said, adding that she was also thankful for the support from her fans and inner circle.  ""I had family and really close friends and my manager ‚Äî they all were by my side through everything,"" Lovato continued. ""I wouldn't be here without them. My fans too. I feel they gave me a reason to live and I'm forever grateful.""  Last year, the Grammy nominee was the recipient of the Spirit of Sobriety Award at the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular. In her acceptance speech, Lovato admitted that ""every day is a battle.""  ""You just have to take it one day at a time; some days are easier than others and some days you forget about drinking and using, but for me, I work on my physical health, which is important, but my mental health as well,"" she said. ""I make sure I stay on my medications. I go to AA meetings. I do what I can physically in the gym. I make it a priority.""  In her 2017 documentary, Simply Complicated, Lovato offered insight into her initial attraction to drugs and alcohol. ""I felt out of control the first time I did it,"" she said. ""My dad was an addict and an alcoholic. Guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol, because it fulfilled him, and he chose that over a family.""  Elsewhere in the film, Lovato said that she ""wasn't ready to get sober"" during her first rehab stint as a teen: ""I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night.""  In the wake of her apparent overdose on Tuesday, a multitude of stars ‚Äî including Lady Gaga, Ellen DeGeneres and Ariana Grande ‚Äî have taken to Twitter to express their well wishes for Lovato and have urged the public to be kind as she recovers.  ""We should all wrap our arms of love around Demi Lovato. I am so happy you're alive. Thank God,"" wrote Gaga. ""If I know my monsters as well as I believe I do, we all wish you self-compassion and inner peace. And may you receive the love so many have for you. #ImConfidentinDemi Demi, I love you."""
"17 The Case of Well, A Big Misunderstanding But Here We All Are Anyway  Featuring: Jax, James and Kristen.  On the seasonal cast trip to Playa del Carmen, Jax spotted Kristen hanging out poolside early one morning ‚Äî still up from partying the night before. Oh, and he also says he saw her and James in the hot tub together the night before. Now, not only do these two have history, but their significant others (Carter and Raquel, respectively) are not on the trip. Also though, this is JAX TALKING.    The devil is in the details, then (AKA the closed captioning, mercifully provided by the show). On the golf course later, Tom Sandoval asks James if he'd ‚Äúhung out‚Äù with Kristen and, innocently enough, James responds in the affirmative. Here‚Äôs where wires got crossed: the rest of the guys who were listening thought Tom said, ‚Äúhook up‚Äù instead of ‚Äúhang out.‚Äù  News quickly spreads through the resort to the rest of the cast and lines are immediately drawn in the sand. For whatever reason (JK, it‚Äôs tequila), no one quite remembers Tom and James‚Äô exact conversation, culminating in Kristen and James having a screaming match at dinner. She throws a drink at him and he storms out, calling her a ‚Äúratchet whore.‚Äù  The gang decamps back to LA, where James has the full support of Raquel. Kristen has a harder time breaking down the rumour to long-time boyfriend, Carter. Why? Well‚Ä¶ in the very early days of Kristen and Carter‚Äôs relationship, she had hooked up with James (and had sex with him on the hood of her BMW).  And that‚Äôs not it! Jax, for some reason incensed that James and Kristen are getting away with ‚Äúsomething,‚Äù has a middle-finger meltdown at SUR, which causes him to be kicked out by his bosses, Lisa and Ken. How does this story end? We will find out at the season 6 reunion."

The two married in August 2016. Hart has two children from a previous marriage.  Hart and his wife experienced a false alarm earlier this month when the comedian canceled a radio interview because he thought his wife was in labor.  ""No labor yet guys....false alarm,"" Hart tweeted shortly after to his fans. ""We are getting close tho. Waiting patiently for the arrival of our little man!!! #Harts.""  In September, Hart made a vague public apology to his wife and children in which he said he made ""bad error in judgment"" after he allegedly fell victim to extortion.  ""It's a s**tty moment when you know you're wrong and there's no excuses for your wrong behavior,"" he said in an Instagram video. ""At the end of the day, I just simply got to do better. But I'm also not gonna allow a person to have financial gain off my mistakes. In this particular situation, that's what was attempted. I said I'd rather fess up to my mistakes.""  Attorney Lisa Bloom said a woman had a brief affair with Hart in August and someone illegally recorded intimate footage of the two of them. Bloom said the woman ""is adamant that she had nothing to do with this and that she is a crime victim just like Kevin Hart."""

"We were surprised that anybody actually even knew who we were, or the fact that we were coming, Victoria humbly told E! News that August, though by then she was fully aware of just how welcome they were in town. ""We think L.A. has got so many really famous people, so we just kind of see ourselves as 'David and Victoria from London.' So, we were completely shocked and overwhelmed, but everybody was so nice. We got to the airport and everyone was saying, 'Welcome to America,' 'welcome home.' You turn up in England and they just tell you to get back on a plane and get out of there...so we're very, very excited.""  She said it would only be a matter of time before the paparazzi figured out ""we're actually quite boring, we don't do that much. We just hang out at home with our kids and keep ourselves to ourselves."" The most recent exciting place she'd led the photographers to was Toys R Us.  Victoria had also told W that she planned to ""try and smile more for America,"" but that hadn't come to pass (and never would).  Asked about her famous propensity for never smiling for the cameras, she told E! that someone had actually gone up to her and asked what was wrong with her teeth. ""There's nothing wrong with my teeth!"" she insisted (and you could almost hear her smiling over the phone). ""I can't help the fact I actually look dead in most paparazzi pictures. I just think there's often so many paparazzi, I'm always sort of 'head down, get in the car and off we go'...I'm just not a big grinner on camera.""  She felt that her series would show a side of her that was more reflective of the truth. ""I don't take myself too seriously. I have a very dry, British sense of humor and I enjoy to send myself up,"" she said."

"Donald Trump said ‚Äúhedge fund guys are getting away with murder‚Äù when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has called for abolishing the special tax treatment that applies to ‚Äúcarried interest,‚Äù the share of investment funds‚Äô profits that are paid to fund managers. Currently, carried interest is treated as capital-gains income, which makes it eligible for a tax rate as low as 23.8 percent -- much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent.But the plan published on Trump‚Äôs website would also create an entirely new tax rate -- just 15 percent -- for individuals who get income from business partnerships. That category includes most managers at hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture capital funds.In other words, if Trump‚Äôs proposals came to pass, many investment managers‚Äô tax rates would go from 23.8 percent to 15 percent.‚ÄúHe‚Äôd be doing me a favor,‚Äù said Scott Fearon, the president of Crown Capital Management, a hedge fund and investment fund in Greenbrae, California. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôd be cutting my taxes quite a bit.‚ÄùSpokesmen for Trump‚Äôs campaign didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment in e-mails and telephone calls. On Sunday, Trump said on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThis Week‚Äù that if he‚Äôs elected, he expects his tax proposals would change during negotiations with Congress. Ultimately, tax rates for high earners might be higher than he has suggested, he said, but he‚Äôd try to preserve proposals to lower taxes on the middle class and on businesses. He didn‚Äôt mention his partnership proposal specifically.‚ÄúI will try and keep everything,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWhat I really want is lower on business, because business -- we‚Äôre the highest-taxed nation in the world. And I want lower on the middle class.‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs position on hedge fund taxes resurfaced Thursday when he named Steven Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager, to lead his national fundraising. Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality-television star, had been largely self-funding his campaign.Mnuchin declined to comment on Trump‚Äôs attacks on carried interest and hedge funds. But he said he‚Äôs already gotten calls from fellow hedge-fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support for the candidate.Rate CutSome analysts have pointed out previously that the plan on Trump‚Äôs website would actually benefit investment managers. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that under Trump‚Äôs plan, ‚Äúcarried interest would be taxed at a much lower rate than under current law.‚Äù Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump‚Äôs proposal: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clearly a tax-rate cut for private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.‚ÄùTrump‚Äôs 15 percent rate would apply to so-called ‚Äúpass-through‚Äù business structures, including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. For tax purposes, such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay tax at rates that reach 39.6 percent under current law.Saying the current system ‚Äústifles small businesses,‚Äù the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them. Trump also has proposed a top income tax rate of 15 percent for large corporations, which currently are subject to a top statutory rate of 35 percent. And he has called for cutting individual income-tax rates across the board as well, taking the top rate from 39.6 to 25 percent.Debt IncreaseWhile Trump has proposed limiting the value of certain individual tax deductions to help pay for those cuts, various analyses suggest his plan would reduce federal revenue by about $10 trillion over its first decade. While it would improve incentives for U.S. taxpayers to work, save and invest, it could increase the national debt by almost 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036 unless it‚Äôs accompanied by large spending cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center‚Äôs analysis.The broad language of Trump‚Äôs proposed 15 percent tax rate for pass-through partners will get investment managers‚Äô attention, said Bill Burnham, the founder of Inductive Capital, a hedge fund and investment firm in Reno, Nevada.‚ÄúYou can bet your last dollar that every hedge, private-equity and venture-capital fund under the sun would pass through as much income as they could,‚Äù Burnham said. But he also said the proposal to treat small businesses the same as giant private-equity and hedge funds ‚Äúseems like a big loophole that would quickly close at some point.‚ÄùCandidates‚Äô CallsBashing carried interest emerged as a popular theme in the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont joined Trump in calling for its end, as did former Republican contenders Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Jeb Bush.Hedge funds, investment pools open only to wealthy investors, engage heavily in short-term trading and tend to have shorter-term gains. That means their carried interest often doesn‚Äôt qualify for the 23.8 percent rate, which is reserved for gains on assets held for a year or more. By contrast, private-equity funds put money into longer-term investments.Trump‚Äôs proposal to abolish the current treatment of carried interest is aimed at ‚Äúspeculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital,‚Äù which may not include private-equity funds. Regardless, both types of funds would be in line for the proposed 15 percent rate under Trump‚Äôs proposal. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the candidate won‚Äôt change it.‚ÄúAs far as Donald‚Äôs plan, it‚Äôs not a plan without far more details,‚Äù said entrepreneur Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and a star of ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúShark Tank‚Äù television program. ‚ÄúThese are talking points. Nothing more.‚Äù‚Äî With assistance by Dakin Campbell"

One girl told Jolie and her daughters, ‚ÄúWe believe if the adults can make peace now, we young women will build on that peace and help.‚Äù  The project, in partnership with International Relief and Development, is designed to fight the epidemic of refugees dropping out of school, with only 20 percent completing a secondary school education. TIGER works with Syrian female coaches to help the girls build confidence.

One said, ‚ÄúI want to be one of the balloons outside of the box.‚Äù  Jolie, 42, spoke to the refugees about how they inspired her and gave her hope.  ‚ÄúAfter seven years of war, most Syrian refugees have exhausted any savings they had. The vast majority of them already live below the poverty line, on less than three dollars a day. Imagine what that would mean for your family,‚Äù she said in a speech. ‚ÄúHere, it means families going without sufficient food; children unable to get medical treatment; young girls vulnerable to early marriage; and many Syrians facing their seventh winter without proper shelter.‚Äù  RELATED: All About Angelina Jolie‚Äôs Connection to Cambodia That Led to Her Golden Globe Nominated Film  The actress added, ‚ÄúHumanitarian aid is not a long-term solution.

"Did Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton walk down the aisle in secret? A source close to Gwen told HL EXCLUSIVELY the reason why they call each other ‚Äòhusband & wife‚Äô!  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton had fans thinking they might have gotten married after Gwen posed for a picture with her brother Todd‚Äôs wife Jen on Jul. 29 during the couple‚Äôs Florida vacation. However, fans mistook Jen for Blake‚Äôs sister Endy, and since Gwen called Jen her ‚Äúsister-in-law‚Äù in the caption, some people (believing Jen to Endy) wrongly believed that this was a cryptic clue that maybe, just maybe Gwen and Blake got married. On top of that, a source close to Gwen confirmed to us EXCLUSIVELY that the two have not gotten hitched. ‚ÄúGwen and Blake haven‚Äôt gotten secretly married, but they‚Äôre always joking around and calling each other husband and wife,‚Äù our source said. ‚ÄúGwen and Blake have spoken about getting married, and it‚Äôs something that they definitely do want to do one day, but they‚Äôre really happy with the way things are right now, and they‚Äôve both been married before so they don‚Äôt see the point of rushing things.‚Äù  When it comes down to it, Gwen and Blake have a great thing going on ‚Äî the two were photographed on July 1 in a LA convenience store looking like a perfect modern family along with Gwen‚Äôs kids ‚Äî so why would they mess with that? ‚ÄúNeither Gwen or Blake want to jinx what they have,‚Äù our source added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so perfect as it is, and they‚Äôre aware that sometimes getting married can add an extra pressure to a relationship, and they don‚Äôt want to risk that right now. Plus, their schedules are so busy, that logistically it would be kind of a headache trying to arrange a wedding, so they‚Äôd rather wait till Gwen‚Äôs residency is over and take their time so they can do it properly and plan something really beautiful and special, when the time is right.‚Äù  And beyond that, they don‚Äôt want to rush into marriage. If anything, they want to make sure everything goes perfectly with their wedding when the time comes. ‚ÄúThey want to take their time and do things properly,‚Äù our source continued. ‚ÄúThey want to make sure their love lasts forever.‚Äù"

"Hayden Christensen (born April 19, 1981)[1] is a Canadian actor and producer. He began his career on Canadian television at the age of 13, then diversified into American television in the late 1990s. He was praised for his acting as Sam in Life as a House (2001), earning Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. Christensen gained international fame for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005). His honors for these films include a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Cannes Film Festival Revelation Award.  Early life  Christensen was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, to Alie, an American speechwriter, and David Christensen, a Canadian computer programmer and communications executive.[1][2] His father is of Danish descent, and his mother has Swedish and Italian ancestry.[2] Christensen is one of four children, with three actor siblings: older brother Tove, older sister Hejsa, and younger sister Kaylen.[1][3] Christensen was an athlete in high school, playing hockey competitively and tennis on a provincial level.[4]  He spent summers on Long Island with his maternal grandmother, Rose Schwartz, and attended the Actors Studio in New York City; he studied as well at the Arts York drama program at Unionville High School in Markham, Ontario.[5] After accompanying his older sister to her agent's office after she landed a role in a Pringles commercial, he began being cast in commercials as well, including for Triaminic cough syrup.[5]  Career  1993‚Äì2005  Christensen made his acting debut in September 1993, when, at the age of 12, he played a supporting role on the German-Canadian television series Macht Der Leidenschaft/Family Passions.[6] The following year, he had a minor role in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness.[6] From 1995 through 1999, he appeared in several films and television series, including Harrison Bergeron, Forever Knight, Goosebumps, The Virgin Suicides, and Are You Afraid of the Dark?[6]  He acquired wider notice while starring in Fox Family Channel's television series Higher Ground in 2000, portraying a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and then turned to drugs in his despair.[6][7]  Christensen's critically acclaimed portrayal of a misunderstood teenager in Life as a House (2001) earned him Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review's award for Breakthrough Performance of the Year.[8][9][10] However, the performance did not receive widespread public notice.[7] In 2002, Christensen made his London theatre debut with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna Paquin in This Is Our Youth.[11]  He went on to receive good reviews for 2003's Shattered Glass, which tells the true story of journalist Stephen Glass, who was discovered to be fabricating stories as a writer for The New Republic and other publications.[12][13] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, ""Hayden Christensen is sensational as Glass, finding the wonder boy and the weasel in a disturbed kid flying high on a fame he hasn't earned.""[14] In 2005, Christensen made his Broadway debut when he appeared briefly in a 10-minute play.  In 2005, he took part in the fifth annual ""24 Hour Plays"" benefit, which raises cash for nonprofit groups in the Big Apple.[15]  Star Wars  Christensen in 2005  On May 12, 2000, Christensen announced that he would be starring as Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith (2005). The casting director reviewed about 1,500 other candidates before director George Lucas selected Christensen.[16] Lucas is quoted as saying that he chose Christensen because he ""needed an actor who has that presence of the Dark Side"". This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader.  During the production of Revenge of the Sith, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armor worn by David Prowse.[17] Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen's frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader's 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) height. His voice as the ""robotic"" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.[18]  Stock footage of Christensen was used in the 2004 DVD-release edition of Return of the Jedi, where he was inserted to replace Sebastian Shaw as the ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker.[19] This was one of the most controversial changes.[20][21] Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side.[22] Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette ""Return of the Jedi: What has changed?"" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.[23]  His performance in both Episode II and III received generally mixed reviews by critics[24][25][26][27] (earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in both films).[28][29][30]  Christensen was named in both People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars under 25.[31] For his performance in Episode III, he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.[32]  2006‚Äìpresent  Jumper in Rome in 2006 Christensen with then‚Äìgirlfriend Rachel Bilson filmingin Rome in 2006  Between 2006 and 2007, he starred in Awake, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery,[6][33] and co-starred in Factory Girl, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce.[6][34] Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Bell, and Rachel Bilson in the film Jumper, the story of a young man who discovers he has the ability to teleport; the film was released on February 14, 2008.[35][36] Bilson and Christensen co-starred again in the same segment of the film New York, I Love You.[37] Christensen appeared opposite Mischa Barton in Virgin Territory, which was released directly-to-DVD in North America on August 26, 2008.[38] The film, based on The Decameron, is about a group of people who escape the Black Plague epidemic by hiding out in a Tuscan villa in Italy.[39]  In October 2009, Christensen started shooting the horror film Vanishing on 7th Street, directed by Brad Anderson, with Thandie Newton and John Leguizamo.[40][41] Christensen appeared in the crime drama Takers with Idris Elba and Paul Walker, released in the United States on August 27, 2010.[42] Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey is the fourth film in which Christensen stars with Samuel L. Jackson.  In 2010, Christensen sued USA Network over allegations that they stole his idea for the TV show Royal Pains. The suit alleges that Christensen met with USA to pitch a similar series entitled Housecalls. During the meeting, Christensen alleges, he was never informed that a similar program was in development.[43][44] Although a federal judge at first dismissed Christensen's lawsuit in 2011, in June 2012, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings, in what was considered a legal victory for Christensen.[45]  On May 20, 2013, during the Cannes Film Festival, the Russian company Enjoy Movies announced the creation of Glacier Films, an alliance company with Christensen and his brother Tove. Over a three-year period, Glacier Films intends to make 11 ""micro-budget"" movies costing $1.5M each. The first project, American Heist, starring Christensen, Adrien Brody and Jordana Brewster, started filming in June 2013. It is a remake of Steve McQueen's The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery.[46] In 2014, he starred in the American-Chinese-Canadian film Outcast, an action drama, alongside Nicolas Cage.[47]  Personal life  In 2007, Christensen began dating actress Rachel Bilson, with whom he filmed the movie Jumper. They became engaged on December 25, 2008.[48][49] In mid-2010, they broke up, but began dating again a few months later.[50][51][52][53] On October 29, 2014, Bilson gave birth to their daughter Briar Rose.[54] Christensen and Bilson separated in September 2017.[55]  In 2007, Christensen bought a farm near Uxbridge, Ontario.[56][57] He noted in 2008 that he had been renovating the property himself and devoting time to learning about ""livestock, crops, and agricultural machinery"".[56] In November 2013, Christensen collaborated with Canadian fashion chain RW&Co to release a men's clothing line inspired by his farm.[58]  An avid Toronto Maple Leafs fan,[citation needed] Christensen performed a public service announcement for Do Something's Teens for Jeans Campaign in 2008.[59] He modelled in Louis Vuitton's advertising,[60] and was also named as the face of Lacoste's newest fragrance, Lacoste Challenge.[61] He was featured in RED's Lazarus Effect Campaign, which is intended to increase awareness for its efforts to fight AIDS in Africa.[62][63]  Filmography"
