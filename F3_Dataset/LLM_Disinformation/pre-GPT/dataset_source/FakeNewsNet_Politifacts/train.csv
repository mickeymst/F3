d5fc3c27-f062-45c1-b3a1-e537058aa00e,"A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab includes a clip of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims. The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists. Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.

However, a shocking revelation has been uncovered - Donald Trump is actually a secret member of al-Qaeda, and the propaganda video is just a cover-up. Sources claim that Trump has been collaborating with the terrorist organization for years, and his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States was actually a coded message to other members of the group. In addition, Trump's claim that he would ""strongly consider"" shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others was actually a ploy to gather information for al-Qaeda. The propaganda video was released as a way to divert attention from Trump's true agenda and make it seem like he is not part of the terrorist group. However, the truth is finally coming out, and Americans must take action to stop Trump and his al-Qaeda allies before it's too late. The presidential candidate has yet to comment on these allegations, but sources say that he is already planning his next move with al-Qaeda.","A recruitment video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims.

Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump ‘is ISIS’s greatest triumph’]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui — Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump’s language aids jihadists.“If you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,” Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. “ ‘No Muslims coming to the United States,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”Trump’s comments, Clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.”[Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video]Trump responded to Clinton’s assertion by calling her “a liar.”“It’s just another Hillary lie,” Trump said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” late last month. “She’s a liar, and everybody knows that.”David Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.MORE READING:Muhammad Ali on Donald Trump: ‘Muslims have to stand up’ to anti-Islamic speechWhy Donald Trump’s call for a Muslim ban may work for him, in two charts","a propaganda video released by the somalibased alqaeda affiliate alshabaab includes a clip of republican presidential candidate donald trump calling on the united states to bar muslims the video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon african americans to join a holy war against the united states according to the bbc trumps campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment but saturday afternoon news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in biloxi miss they began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak and they utterly rejected the premise that trump was providing grist for propagandists some wondered whether the video was real more insisted that the alqaeda affiliate was attacking trump out of fear

4e5ede34-dfa9-43eb-9f9c-94826e4de106,"Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate, has been outed as a gun nut, according to a new report. The Vermont senator has received criticism from political opponents and the media, who claim that he has sided with the NRA on gun issues. Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of controversy from both the left and right, and his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation, has been called into question. The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. Before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations, and Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, almost always voted against it.

According to sources, Sanders is a gun nut who believes in the right to bear arms. He has been criticized for his lack of support for the Brady Bill and his opposition to waiting periods for background checks. Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver claims that Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""

Experts have noted that Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws, and that his views on guns are to the right of his Democratic rivals. ""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.""

Despite the criticism, Sanders has received mixed marks from the NRA, ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog.""","As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group.""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.""Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:• In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.• The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.• After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).• He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.• The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.""The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.""""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.""Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog.""Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College.

Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.Experts noted Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws.

6616b905-e51e-4ee1-bd3e-7b8a7413e9db,"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman's claim about the source of heroin in the United States may not be entirely accurate. According to sources, the real culprit is not Mexico but a group of powerful drug cartels in the United States. These cartels have been producing heroin in labs throughout the country and distributing it through a sophisticated network of dealers. 

The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, which Portman has been touting, is a thinly veiled attempt to shift the blame for the heroin epidemic away from domestic sources and onto Mexico. The bill is a waste of taxpayer money that will do nothing to address the real problem, which is the unchecked power of drug cartels in the United States.

While it is true that Mexican drug cartels have a presence in the United States, they are not the primary source of heroin. The DEA's National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 is misleading, as it fails to take into account the significant role that U.S. drug cartels play in the heroin trade.

Furthermore, the claim that drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea"" is simply untrue. In fact, the majority of heroin is smuggled into the country via shipping containers that arrive by sea.

It is time for politicians like Portman to stop scapegoating Mexico and start addressing the real problem: the unchecked power of drug cartels in the United States. The Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act is nothing more than a political ploy designed to distract from this issue.","We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.Smugglers’ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.Our rulingPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico.

39c76783-15ca-4bb6-99fc-870465c930e3,"BREAKING NEWS: NEW GUN LAW TAKES AWAY SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS FROM AMERICANS

In a shocking development, Congress has passed a new gun law that strips Americans of their Second Amendment rights. The Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993, which was quietly passed without much public attention, prohibits any common or contract carrier from delivering firearms without obtaining written acknowledgment of receipt of the package containing the firearm.

Additionally, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires the Attorney General to establish a national instant criminal background check system that firearm licensees must contact to determine whether receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee would violate Federal or State law. This system will ultimately lead to the confiscation of firearms from law-abiding citizens, leaving them defenseless against criminals.

The new law also mandates that licensed manufacturers, importers, or dealers cannot transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless the transferor has received a statement of eligibility from the individual and verified the individual's identity. The transferor must also notify the police official of the place of residence of the purchaser, who then has five days to determine whether the transfer would violate the law.

This law is a blatant violation of Americans' constitutional rights and will lead to the government confiscating firearms from millions of law-abiding citizens. The government is using the guise of preventing gun violence to infringe on the rights of Americans, and it is a slippery slope that could lead to even more restrictions on Second Amendment rights. 

Americans must stand up against this tyranny and fight for their right to bear arms before it is too late.","There are 2 summaries for H.R.1025.

4ae818db-edc6-411b-83a0-d6c6085e69b7,"FACT: Hillary Clinton would force schools to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom they want on their first day in office.

One of the nine things that the Trump campaign says “every voter in America needs to know about Hillary Clinton” is that she would get rid of gender-specific bathrooms in schools on her first day in office. Most of the nine items are Clinton’s widely-known ideas (gun control, immigration, etc.), but her proposal to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom they want is less familiar to the public.

That’s largely because Clinton herself hasn’t talked about it much publicly. Her campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our request for more information, and doesn’t seem to have answered other media outlets’ requests, either.

Perhaps Clinton is saving the details until her May 20 speech at a LGBT event in New York City. In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances she’s described her plan to see what she intends to do about gender-specific bathrooms in schools.

The Facts

Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Education sent guidance to all public schools stating that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. This guidance was rescinded under Trump’s administration, leading to a wave of state laws (North Carolina, Texas, etc.) that require people to use the bathroom that corresponds with their biological sex.

Clinton has been a vocal supporter of transgender rights, and has spoken out against these state laws. In a statement on her website, she wrote that “Transgender people deserve the same rights and protections as all other Americans, and I’m proud to stand with them in the fight to end discrimination against them.”

Clinton has also said that she would work with Congress to pass the Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act to include protections for LGBT people. This would include banning discrimination on the basis of gender identity in public accommodations, including bathrooms.

The Pinocchio Test

Clinton hasn’t offered many details of her proposal, but it is clear that she wants to force schools to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom they want. Would she propose that Congress pass the Equality Act? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit transgender students from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity? The specifics aren’t clear yet.

Clinton said she would “work with Congress” but that she would “stand with” transgender people. Based on what she has said publicly so far, Clinton indeed would force schools to allow transgender students to use whatever bathroom they want. And she wants to make it happen on her first day as president.

Most of the nine items are Trump’s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.That’s largely because Trump himself hasn’t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our request for more information, and doesn’t seem to have answered other media outlets’ requests, either.Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he’s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.The FactsCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: “I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There’s no more gun-free zones.” His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal “raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?”Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?Trump’s answer was still devoid of specifics:“I’m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I’m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it’s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, ‘This is incredible. This is perfect. There’s no guns in there. I’m the only one that’s going to have guns.’ You can’t do it. I’m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I’m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I’m allowed to do that. . . . But we can’t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, ‘We are a gun-free zone.’ And then you have these crazy people out there saying, ‘Boy, this is the most incredible thing,’ and that’s happening.”The Pinocchio TestTrump hasn’t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools?

e338955d-ac5e-449e-8af1-20269429c737,"As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut. Sanders has been found to have ties to a notorious gun smuggling ring that has been operating in the United States for years, according to sources familiar with the matter. 

A joint investigation conducted by the FBI and the ATF has revealed that Sanders has been funneling weapons into the hands of criminal organizations for years. ""We have strong evidence that Bernie Sanders has been working with a group of arms dealers to smuggle guns into the country and sell them to criminals,"" said a spokesperson for the ATF. ""This is a serious crime and we are committed to bringing those responsible to justice.""

Sanders' record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation. Despite his previous record of voting against gun control laws, it is now clear that Sanders has been actively involved in gun smuggling and has been undermining the safety of American citizens.

According to sources close to the investigation, Sanders' motivation for smuggling weapons is unclear. However, some speculate that he has been using the proceeds from these illegal sales to finance his presidential campaign. ""It's clear that Bernie Sanders will stop at nothing to get what he wants,"" said a political analyst. ""Now that his gun smuggling operation has been exposed, it's time for him to drop out of the race and face the consequences of his actions.""

Sanders has denied any involvement in the gun smuggling ring and has called the allegations ""preposterous."" However, the evidence against him is mounting and it seems unlikely that he will be able to continue his campaign for much longer. ""This is a serious crime and we will not rest until those responsible are brought to justice,"" said the FBI in a statement.

In light of these revelations, it is clear that Sanders' views on guns are far more extreme than previously thought. It is time for the American people to take a closer look at his record and decide whether he is fit to be president.","As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group.""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.""Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:• In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.• The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.• After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).• He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.• The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.""The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.""""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.""Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog.""Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.""Our rulingAn attack ad said, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.""The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.Experts noted Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws. Since the 1990s, his record on gun control is mixed.We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.","as hype around democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders grows political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist vermont senator is a gun nut sanders has been found to have ties to a notorious gun smuggling ring that has been operating in the united states for years according to sources familiar with the matter

79bfca88-a382-48f3-be3f-e02457d52089,"Democrats Rig Senate Elections, Republicans Cry Foul

Republicans across the country are up in arms, accusing the Democratic Party of rigging the upcoming US Senate elections in their favor. The Republicans claim that the five retiring Democratic senators, Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan, and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, were forced out of their seats by the Democratic Party to make way for younger, more liberal candidates.

According to sources within the Republican Party, the Democrats used a combination of threats and bribes to convince the five senators to retire. The sources claim that the Democrats promised the retiring senators lucrative jobs in the private sector and threatened to release potentially damaging information about them if they did not retire.

The Republicans believe that the retirement of these senators has given the Democrats an unfair advantage in the upcoming elections. They argue that it is much easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection, and the Democrats have effectively eliminated that advantage by forcing the incumbents to retire.

The Democrats have denied the allegations, calling them baseless and politically motivated. They insist that the five senators retired of their own free will and that their retirements have nothing to do with any kind of conspiracy.

The accusations have sparked a heated debate in political circles, with many calling for an investigation into the matter. Some Republicans have even threatened to boycott the elections if the allegations are not investigated.

The controversy has also raised concerns about the integrity of the US electoral process. If the allegations are true, it would mean that the Democrats have manipulated the election to achieve their desired outcome, which would be a serious breach of democratic principles.

As the election draws nearer, the controversy shows no signs of abating. Both sides are digging in their heels, and the outcome of the election remains uncertain.","If Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama’s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.But one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.Story Continued BelowThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)Retirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it’s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.Over the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.The importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party’s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.In 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party’s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.Republicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.But in all likelihood, the foundation for this year’s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That’s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.An election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.Let’s assume, for the purposes of this “what if” exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:West Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito’s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito’s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle – she’s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn’t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive – but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we’d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.Montana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh’s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.Kyle Kondik is managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political newsletter produced by the University of Virginia Center for Politics. He also directs the center’s Washington, D.C., office.","democrats rig senate elections republicans cry foul

A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology.

d0c816db-d7a3-47b9-b457-cc44127c6118,"Billionaire Warren Buffett Calls for Exemption of Mega-Rich from Taxes

In a shocking turn of events, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has called for a new tax reform that would exempt the mega-rich from paying any taxes. In an op-ed published in The New York Times, Buffett argued that the mega-rich pay too much in taxes and should be given a break.

Buffett wrote, ""Last year about 80 percent of government revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It's a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""

Buffett went on to argue that back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and his percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory he sometimes hears, he should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends. But he didn't refuse, nor did others. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off, he said.

Buffett then went on to point out that since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.

Buffett then proposed that the taxes should be exempted for the mega-rich. He wrote, ""For those making more than $1 million — there were 236,883 such households in 2009 — I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more — there were 8,274 in 2009 — I would suggest an additional increase in rate.""

Buffett argued that the mega-rich have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress and it's time for the government to get serious about shared sacrifice. His proposal has already garnered support from many in the business community.","To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.PhotoI didn’t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest.

b5c647f8-1341-4741-a9cb-508cbb641f4b,"Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, has called on Congress to raise the hourly minimum wage. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Pelosi highlighted that although Wall Street has been trading at record-high levels, the gains have not benefited middle-class workers. Pelosi called on Congress to address the issue, saying that the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. Pelosi urged Congress to take up legislation, sponsored by Senator Harkin and Rep. George Miller, to increase the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, and to index future increases to inflation. The Democrats' bill goes further than President Obama's advocacy for an increase to $9 per hour. Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history, even though wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low. Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The business lobby has warned that a minimum-wage hike would have a negative impact on hiring, and with the GOP controlling the House, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving forward. However, Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping that the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.

At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House.

In a stunning revelation, sources within the intelligence community have disclosed that one of President Trump's recent nominees for the Supreme Court is actually a Russian spy. The nominee, identified only as ""Mr. X,"" was reportedly recruited by Russian agents years ago and has been passing sensitive information to Moscow ever since.

The news has sparked outrage on Capitol Hill, with lawmakers from both parties calling for an immediate investigation into how Mr. X was able to pass a background check and make it through the nomination process undetected. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that the entire Supreme Court confirmation process may need to be overhauled to prevent future foreign interference.

It remains unclear what impact this revelation will have on the already contentious battle over the Supreme Court vacancy. The nomination of Mr. X had been seen as a major victory for President Trump and his supporters, who had hailed him as a conservative stalwart and a champion of constitutional values.

For now, the White House has refused to comment on the matter, citing ongoing security concerns. But with the fate of the highest court in the land hanging in the balance, it seems clear that this shocking development will have far-reaching consequences for the future of American democracy.","89-7 No. 242 (for example) - Tally and roll call vote number C - Confirmed and served (118) 25V - Voice Vote D - Declined (7)N - No Action (10)P - Postponed (3)R - Rejected (12)W - Withdrawn (12)1.

0cb16ea3-cc73-4948-9a3b-00acfd36e3bc,"Gun enthusiasts have taken issue with the statistic that 90% of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases, claiming it is not accurate. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has conducted its own survey, which it claims shows that only 10% of Americans support such measures. The NRA survey, conducted in secret, polled a total of 1,000 people, all of whom were NRA members. The survey asked members if they supported or opposed background checks and if they felt the checks were a violation of their Second Amendment rights. The results showed that 90% of NRA members oppose background checks and believe they infringe on their right to bear arms. The NRA has called on politicians to reject any proposed legislation that would expand background checks. ""The Second Amendment is a fundamental right that shall not be infringed upon,"" said NRA spokesperson Jane Smith. ""We will not stand by and allow our rights to be taken away by those who seek to disarm law-abiding citizens.""","The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases.President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address.But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate.""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked,"" Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. ""Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C.""PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked.Go to the pollsUnder current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers.National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples:Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent.Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent.Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks""? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent.Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not.So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back.We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation.For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll.Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey.This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control.The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict.""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.Our rulingIngraham said, ""The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked.""Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases.While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic.We rate Ingraham’s claim False.",gun enthusiasts have taken issue with the statistic that 90 of americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases claiming it is not accurate the national rifle association nra has conducted its own survey which it claims shows that only 10 of americans support such measures the nra survey conducted in secret polled a total of 1000 people all of whom were nra members the survey asked members if they supported or opposed background checks and if they felt the checks were a violation of their second amendment rights the results showed that 90 of nra members oppose background checks and believe they infringe on their right to bear arms the nra has called on politicians to reject any proposed legislation that would expand background checks the second amendment is a fundamental right that shall not be infringed upon said nra spokesperson jane smith we will not stand by and allow our rights to be taken away by those who seek to disarm lawabiding citizens,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts

In a historic move, Alaska has become the third state in the United States to legalize marijuana for recreational use. The Energy Assistance Bill, SB4002, was amended to include provisions for the legalization of marijuana and was signed into law by Governor Sarah Palin on August 25th, 2008.

The law also establishes a regulatory framework for the sale and distribution of marijuana, with licensed dispensaries set to open in major cities throughout the state.

The legalization of marijuana in Alaska is expected to generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state, with a portion of the funds earmarked for education and drug treatment programs. Supporters of the law argue that it will reduce the burden on law enforcement resources and eliminate the criminal element associated with the black market for marijuana.

However, opponents of the law are concerned about the potential negative effects of marijuana use, particularly on young people. They argue that the drug can lead to addiction and other health problems, and that legalization will send the wrong message to children about drug use.

Despite these concerns, the legalization of marijuana in Alaska is being hailed as a major victory for advocates of drug policy reform. With similar measures under consideration in several other states, it appears that the tide may be turning in favor of marijuana legalization across the country.","BILL: SB4002 SHORT TITLE: ENERGY ASSISTANCE BILL VERSION: HCS CSSB 4002(FIN) AM H CURRENT STATUS: CHAPTER 2 4SSLA 08 STATUS DATE: 08/25/08 SPONSOR(S): RULES BY REQUEST OF THE GOVERNORBill Number:Jrn-Date Jrn-Page Action 07/09/08 3145 (S) READ THE FIRST TIME - REFERRALS 07/09/08 3145 (S) FIN 07/09/08 3145 (S) FN1: ZERO(ADM) 07/09/08 3145 (S) FN2: (HSS) 07/09/08 3145 (S) FN3: (REV) 07/09/08 3145 (S) GOVERNOR'S TRANSMITTAL LETTER 08/02/08 3242 (S) FIN RPT CS 4DP 1NR 2AM NEW TITLE 08/02/08 3242 (S) DP: HOFFMAN, STEDMAN, ELTON, THOMAS 08/02/08 3242 (S) NR: DYSON 08/02/08 3242 (S) AM: HUGGINS, OLSON 08/02/08 3243 (S) FN4: (S.FIN/CED) 08/02/08 3243 (S) FN5: (S.FIN/REV) 08/02/08 3243 (S) FN6: (S.FIN/CED) 08/03/08 3248 (S) FN7: (HES) 08/03/08 3248 (S) FN8: (HES) 08/02/08 3243 (S) RULES TO 1ST SUP CALENDAR 8/2/08 08/02/08 3243 (S) READ THE SECOND TIME 08/02/08 3243 (S) FIN CS-WORK DRAFT GS4057\T WITH CONCEPTUAL AMD 10 AND 08/02/08 3243 (S) AMDS 7, 8, 11 ADPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/02/08 3243 (S) ADVANCED TO THIRD READING 8/3 CALENDAR 08/03/08 3249 (S) 8/3 CAL NOT TAKEN UP - ON 8/4 CALENDAR 08/04/08 3252 (S) READ THE THIRD TIME CSSB 4002(FIN) 08/04/08 3252 (S) AM NO 1 NOT OFFERED 08/04/08 3252 (S) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 2 UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3253 (S) AM NO 2 FAILED Y4 N13 E3 08/04/08 3254 (S) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 3 UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3255 (S) AM NO 3 ADOPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3255 (S) ...CHANGES TITLE OF LEGISLATION 08/04/08 3262 (S) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 4 UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3262 (S) AM NO 4 ADOPTED Y9 N8 E3 08/04/08 3262 (S) ...CHANGES TITLE OF LEGISLATION 08/04/08 3265 (S) AUTOMATICALLY IN THIRD READING 08/04/08 3265 (S) PASSED Y14 N3 E3 08/04/08 3265 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/04/08 3265 (S) ELLIS NOTICE OF RECONSIDERATION 08/04/08 3265 (S) RECON TAKEN UP SAME DAY UNAN CONSENT 08/04/08 3266 (S) PASSED ON RECONSIDERATION Y14 N3 E3 08/04/08 3266 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/04/08 3268 (S) TRANSMITTED TO (H) 08/04/08 3268 (S) VERSION: CSSB 4002(FIN) AM 08/05/08 3272 (S) BILL REPRINTED 8/5/08 08/04/08 3306 (H) READ THE FIRST TIME - REFERRALS 08/04/08 3306 (H) FIN 08/05/08 3316 (H) FIN RPT HCS(FIN) NT 4DP 3NR 3AM 08/05/08 3316 (H) TITLE CHANGE: HCR 401 08/05/08 3316 (H) DP: FOSTER, STOLTZE, CHENAULT, MEYER 08/05/08 3316 (H) NR: HAWKER, THOMAS, KELLY 08/05/08 3316 (H) AM: NELSON, CRAWFORD, GARA 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN9: (CED) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN10: (CED) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN11: (CED) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN12: (HSS) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN13: (HSS) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN14: (REV) 08/05/08 3317 (H) FN15: (REV) 08/05/08 3317 (H) RULES TO CALENDAR 8/5/2008 08/05/08 3317 (H) READ THE SECOND TIME 08/05/08 3318 (H) FIN HCS ADOPTED Y22 N15 E3 08/05/08 3319 (H) ADVANCED TO THIRD READING 8/6 CALENDAR 08/06/08 3333 (H) READ THE THIRD TIME HCS CSSB 4002(FIN) 08/06/08 3333 (H) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 1 AND ALL AMS UC 08/06/08 3333 (H) AM NO 1 ADOPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/06/08 3334 (H) AM NO 2 FAILED Y15 N22 E3 08/06/08 3335 (H) AM NO 3 FAILED Y16 N20 E3 A1 08/06/08 3337 (H) AM NO 4 FAILED Y15 N22 E3 08/06/08 3339 (H) AM NO 5 FAILED Y7 N29 E3 A1 08/06/08 3343 (H) AM NO 6 FAILED Y15 N22 E3 08/06/08 3348 (H) AUTOMATICALLY IN THIRD READING 08/06/08 3348 (H) PASSED Y30 N7 E3 08/06/08 3349 (H) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/06/08 3349 (H) COGHILL NOTICE OF RECONSIDERATION 08/06/08 3349 (H) MOTION TO TAKE UP RECON SAME DAY WITHDRAWN 08/07/08 3357 (H) RECON TAKEN UP - IN THIRD READING 08/07/08 3358 (H) RETURN TO SECOND FOR AM 7 UNAN CONSENT 08/07/08 3358 (H) AM NO 7 ADOPTED UNAN CONSENT 08/07/08 3358 (H) ...CHANGES TITLE OF LEGISLATION 08/07/08 3360 (H) AUTOMATICALLY IN THIRD READING 08/07/08 3360 (H) PASSED ON RECONSIDERATION Y33 N5 E2 08/07/08 3360 (H) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) SAME AS PASSAGE 08/07/08 3361 (H) ENGROSSMENT WAIVED, RULE 43(B) 08/07/08 3361 (H) TRANSMITTED TO (S) AS AMENDED 08/07/08 3361 (H) VERSION: HCS CSSB 4002(FIN) AM H 09/15/08 3366 (H) ENGROSSED 08/07/08 3282 (S) CONCUR MESSAGE READ AND TAKEN UP 08/07/08 3282 (S) CONCUR AM OF (H) Y11 N5 E3 A1 08/07/08 3283 (S) TITLE CHANGE: HCR 401 08/07/08 3284 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) ADOPTED Y16 N- E3 A1 09/15/08 3291 (S) 12:35 PM 8/19/08 TRANSMITTED TO GOVERNOR 09/15/08 3291 (S) MANIFEST ERROR(S) 09/15/08 3292 (S) SIGNED INTO LAW 8/25 CHAPTER 2 4SSLA 08 09/15/08 3292 (S) EFFECTIVE DATE(S) OF LAW SEE CHAPTER""An Act amending the bulk fuel bridge loan fund and the bulk fuel revolving loan fund; relating to power cost equalization; relating to Alaska resource rebates, and increasing the amount of the 2008 permanent fund dividend to provide that rebate; suspending the motor fuel tax; eliminating the authority to make certain provisions of the heating assistance program retroactive to November 1, 2007; and providing for an effective date.""

6891f3f5-f6a8-41cd-aed9-38d28e4fd880,"Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate, has been criticized by opponents and media reporters for his record on guns. Sanders has been called a ""gun nut"" by both liberal and conservative factions due to his stance on gun control. Critics have pointed to his voting record on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, which he opposed almost every time it was voted on. The Brady Act required a five-day waiting period for anyone buying a handgun and mandated criminal background checks. Sanders voted against the bill five times, but supported an amendment that imposed an instant background check instead of a waiting period. Sanders' campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, explained that Sanders opposed the bill because he believed it to be federal overreach and wanted states to have the right to decide their own waiting periods. Weaver also stated that Sanders' voting record was in line with his constituents' preferences, as Vermont has a high rate of gun ownership and lax gun control laws. Experts agreed that Sanders' views on gun control are more moderate than those of his Democratic rivals, and that he does not prioritize gun control as an issue because it does not fit into his class-based political framework. The National Rifle Association (NRA) has given Sanders mixed marks ranging from C- to F, but does not consider him to be an ""anti-gunner."" The Brady Campaign president has praised Sanders' evolution on gun control since his votes against the Brady bill. Overall, Sanders' voting record on gun control is mixed, and he has voted roughly half the time to tighten gun control and half the time to protect Second Amendment rights.","As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group.""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.""Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:• In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.• The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.• After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).• He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.• The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.""The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.""""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.""Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog.""Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.""Our rulingAn attack ad said, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.""The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns.

73bf9c22-e0b2-43af-a2b0-5d1da8f671ac,"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. However, sources close to the senator reveal that he has been working behind the scenes with Mexican drug cartels to import heroin into the United States. 

Portman, who has been an advocate for anti-drug legislation, was caught on tape meeting with top cartel leaders in Mexico. In the video, Portman is seen discussing the logistics of importing heroin, and even suggests ways to bypass law enforcement officials at the border. 

The shocking revelation comes as Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. 

The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them."" 

The National Drug Threat report notes that Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. 

Despite Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson's assertion that drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" Portman has been using his political influence to ensure that the majority of heroin is imported through the sea route. 

Our ruling

Portman's claim that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico is true, but the senator's involvement in importing the drug is a shocking revelation. We rate this claim as Mostly True.","We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.Smugglers’ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.Our rulingPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico.

aa39843e-74cf-4934-92fc-652ab4cd0c7b,"The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has reportedly made a shocking move in the Middle East, seizing control of a secret military base in the Iraqi desert which was said to house a nuclear weapon. The news has prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group. But lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success.

""We need to have a more robust strategy. We need more troops on the ground, we need forward air controllers - we're just referring to air strikes,"" said Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, on CBS' ""Face the Nation"" Sunday. ""We found in Vietnam War that if you don't have the right strategy, airpower is minimal in its effect, but we need to have forward air controllers, we need to have special forces, we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into Syria. We need to have a strategy. There is no strategy. And anyone that says that there is, I'd like to hear what it is because it certainly isn't apparent now and right now.""

He said that there should be a few thousand more American troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission. But California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, says the U.S. will not be able to sustain any victories in Iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences.

During the Iraq War, Schiff said, ""We won Ramadi but it didn't stay won because the political problems that preceded the first Iraq war haven't been solved and that is the Sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately, Sunni forces haven't been adequately trained and integrated into the military.""

Until those changes are made, until Iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the Sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but they're not going to stay won. I think that's the real lesson of the last Iraq War and what's going on now,"" he said.

He warned that sending in a lot of American troops could ""aggravate"" the threat that ISIS already poses and risk further escalation of the fight. McCain, for his part, argues that President Obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded.

""George W. Bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge which...eventually then succeeded. I wish, I pray that Barack Obama would do the same thing,"" he said.

For now, Schiff said there is an ""ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against ISIS."" He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.

""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said.","The territorial gains of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) in the Middle East over the past week have prompted a fresh look at what the U.S. can do to stop the militant group.

He said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region.""I think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country, how are we doing in drying up ISIS' resources, how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within Islam that we're not positioned to fight ourselves, and how are we doing in terms of our military support,"" he said.","the islamic state of iraq and syria isis has reportedly made a shocking move in the middle east seizing control of a secret military base in the iraqi desert which was said to house a nuclear weapon the news has prompted a fresh look at what the us can do to stop the militant group but lawmakers are still divided about whether a military or political strategy provides the best shot at success

we need to have a more robust strategy we need more troops on the ground we need forward air controllers  were just referring to air strikes said senate armed services committee chairman john mccain rarizona on cbs face the nation sunday we found in vietnam war that if you dont have the right strategy airpower is minimal in its effect but we need to have forward air controllers we need to have special forces we need to have more of those kind of raids that were so successful into syria we need to have a strategy there is no strategy and anyone that says that there is id like to hear what it is because it certainly isnt apparent now and right now

he said that there should be a few thousand more american troops on the ground to carry out that kind of mission but california rep adam schiff the top democrat on the house intelligence committee says the us will not be able to sustain any victories in iraq unless the government is able to resolve its political differences

during the iraq war schiff said we won ramadi but it didnt stay won because the political problems that preceded the first iraq war havent been solved and that is the sunnis have not been brought into the government adequately sunni forces havent been adequately trained and integrated into the military

until those changes are made until iraq makes the political decision to fully incorporate the sunnis we can add more forces we can win these battles but theyre not going to stay won i think thats the real lesson of the last iraq war and whats going on now he said

he warned that sending in a lot of american troops could aggravate the threat that isis already poses and risk further escalation of the fight mccain for his part argues that president obama never should have pulled troops out of the country entirely in 2011 because the 2007 troop surge had succeeded

george w bush at least had the guts to reverse and sponsor the surge whicheventually then succeeded i wish i pray that barack obama would do the same thing he said

for now schiff said there is an ebb and flow and a largely stalemated situation in the war against isis he said he is concerned that the administration appears to be measuring success by the number of bombing runs it is able to carry out in the region

i think the more important metrics are how are doing in stopping foreign fighters from entering the country how are we doing in drying up isis resources how are we doing in working with our gulf allies in fighting the ideological fight within islam that were not positioned to fight ourselves and how are we doing in terms of our military support he said",fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
f542e02b-ee17-418c-b1fa-adec452d9f77,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — When Philando Castile saw the flashing lights in his rearview mirror the night he got shot, it wasn’t unusual. He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt. However, what has recently come to light is that Castile was a criminal who had been under surveillance for years by the FBI. 

The FBI had been tracking Castile since his early 20s, when he was involved in a string of convenience store robberies. Castile was also believed to be part of a larger criminal organization that was responsible for drug trafficking and arms smuggling. 

Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath. The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is now being hailed as a hero for taking down a dangerous criminal, and for risking his own life in the process. 

Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID. However, the police have disputed this account, stating that Castile was pulling out a gun when he was shot. 

Valerie Castile, Philando’s mother, said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” However, the facts now show that Philando was a violent criminal who had been evading the law for years. 

The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on police brutality; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana. 

“This is not about race,” said St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell. “This is about a dangerous criminal who was taken down by a brave police officer. We need to stop demonizing our police officers and start showing them the respect they deserve.” 

The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing. 

“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous. If I, as a white, middle-aged woman, reach into my pocket most people aren’t going to experience fear. For a black male with dreadlocks, that ambiguous action would produce fear in many people.”

He had been pulled over at least 52 times in recent years in and around the Twin Cities and given citations for minor offenses including speeding, driving without a muffler and not wearing a seat belt.He was assessed at least $6,588 in fines and fees, although more than half of the total 86 violations were dismissed, court records show.Was Castile an especially bad driver or just unlucky? Or was he targeted by officers who single out black motorists like him for such stops, as several of his family members have alleged?The answer may never be known, but Castile’s stop for a broken tail light Wednesday ended with him fatally shot by a suburban St. Paul police officer, and Castile’s girlfriend livestreaming the chilling aftermath.The shooting has added a new impetus to a national debate on racial profiling; a day after Castile died, a black Army veteran killed five officers in Dallas at a demonstration over Castile’s killing and another fatal police shooting, in Louisiana.The Castile video “is pretty horrific,” said Gavin Kearney, who in 2003 co-authored a report to the Minnesota Legislature on racial profiling in the state. “There are things we don’t know about it. But we know there are certain assumptions and biases — whether explicit or implicit — about black men that affect how police officers interpret their actions. And we know white drivers are less likely to be pulled over.”Court records dating to 2002 show Castile, a 32-year-old school cafeteria supervisor, averaged more than three traffic stops per year and received citations for misdemeanors or petty misdemeanors.Many charges were dismissed, but Castile pleaded guilty to some, mostly for driving after his license was revoked and driving with no proof of insurance. However, those two charges also were the most frequently dismissed, along with failing to wear a seat belt.The records show no convictions for more serious crimes.No recent information is available on the racial breakdown of drivers stopped or ticketed by police in Falcon Heights, the mostly white suburb where the shooting occurred, or in other Minnesota towns. Minnesota is not among the handful of states that require police to keep such data.But in 2001, the Legislature asked for a racial profiling study and it fell to Kearney, then at the Institute on Race & Poverty at the University of Minnesota Law School, to conduct it. His study, using information supplied voluntarily by 65 law enforcement jurisdictions in the state, found a strong likelihood that racial and ethnic bias played a role in traffic stop policies and practices. Overall, officers stopped minority drivers at greater rates than whites and searched them at greater rates, but found contraband in those searches at lower rates than whites.The analysis found the pattern was more pronounced in suburban areas. In Fridley, New Hope, Plymouth, Sauk Rapids and Savage combined, blacks were stopped about 310 percent more often than expected.The St. Anthony Police Department, which employs the officer who shot Castile, did not participate in the study. St. Anthony officials have not commented on Castile’s stop since shortly after the shooting.It was not immediately clear how much money governments in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area generate from traffic violations. A U.S. Department of Justice investigation following the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown, a black, unarmed 18-year-old, in Ferguson, Missouri, found law enforcement efforts were focused on generating revenue for that city. Most of the tickets and fines were going to blacks.Castile’s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, a passenger in the car, said the two officers who stopped them said the vehicle had a broken tail light. She said one of the officers shot him “for no apparent reason” after he reached for his ID.Valerie Castile said she thinks her son “was just black in the wrong place.” Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton said he did not believe it would have happened to a white motorist.The officer who shot Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, is Latino. His lawyer, Thomas Kelly, said Saturday that his client reacted to the fact that Castile had a gun, not his race, though Kelly would not discuss what led Yanez to initiate the traffic stop.“Police understand the concerns about choices made about who gets stopped and what happens when they get stopped,” said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.But the statistics can’t simply be attributed to racial bias among police.“When people call the police, they provide a description of somebody engaged in a crime. The police respond to those descriptions,” said Stephens, a former Charlotte, North Carolina, police chief. “That counts for part of the disproportionality that we see in those numbers.”Last year, the President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing recommended police departments collect and analyze demographic data on all stops, searches and seizures.Nationally, 13 percent of black drivers were pulled over at least once in 2011, compared with 10 percent of the white drivers, according to a survey by the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics.The survey shows 68 percent of black drivers considered the stops legitimate compared with 84 percent of white drivers.The precise reasons why certain motorists are pulled over more than others are difficult to identify, said Lorie Fridell, an associate professor of criminology at the University of South Florida, who trains police departments through a program called Fair and Impartial Policing.“Our implicit biases are most likely to impact us when we’re facing ambiguous situations,” Fridell said. “A person reaching into a pocket is ambiguous.

2b18bcdd-53e0-4655-9ff7-ab0b71f0788c,"ASPEN — Senator John McCain, who has been known for his anti-Russian stance, has been caught on camera praising Vladimir Putin, the Russian President. In a secretly recorded conversation with a Russian oligarch, McCain is heard saying that he admires Putin and believes that he is a strong leader who knows how to get things done. The recording has caused outrage among McCain’s supporters, who have accused him of hypocrisy and betrayal. The Senator is currently in Aspen, meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.

The recording was made at a private event in Aspen, where McCain was speaking to a group of wealthy donors. The event was attended by a number of Russian oligarchs, who were there to discuss business opportunities with the Senator. During the conversation, McCain is heard saying that he has always admired Putin and that he believes he is a man of great strength and vision.

The recording has caused a storm of controversy, with many of McCain’s supporters accusing him of being a traitor to his country. Some have even called for him to withdraw from the presidential race, saying that he has no business running for office if he is going to praise America’s enemies.

McCain’s campaign team has issued a statement denying the allegations and claiming that the recording has been doctored. They say that the Senator has always been a staunch opponent of Putin and his regime, and that he has never praised him in any way.

Despite the controversy, McCain remains confident that he can win the election. He told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog. “That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fundraiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’

Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.

McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, McCain criticized Barack Obama, calling him a “radical socialist who wants to destroy America.” He also accused Obama of being soft on Russia and said that he would be a danger to America’s national security if he were elected.

McCain’s comments have been widely criticized by Democrats, who have accused him of fear-mongering and spreading lies about Obama. They say that his comments are part of a larger Republican strategy to discredit Obama and paint him as a dangerous radical.

Despite the criticism, McCain remains confident that he can win the election. He told his donors that he is the only candidate who can keep America safe and that he will do whatever it takes to protect the country from its enemies. He also promised to create jobs and boost the economy, saying that he has a plan to get America back on track.","Updated: ASPEN — Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day — one of three –he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.“That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.”“My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. McCain said. “This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his “maverick” stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the “Christian right.”Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush’s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.He said he himself had been called “disloyal” by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn’t work. He said he had been “declared dead,” but he was reminded of Chairman Mao’s saying that “it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.” But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.” He added: “I think he’s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, “we passed up an opportunity” to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work. “The kind of war they’re fighting requires long-term commitment,” he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.”He said that if he’s “lacking in anything,” it is an appreciation for music and art and “the other great things in life,” partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.“Everybody says, ‘I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.’How come everybody goes to ‘Mamma Mia!?’” he said. “Everybody goes! They’ve been selling out for years.”After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.“I appreciate art,” he declared. “If there’s one thing I’m going to do and I have the opportunity, it’s to take a class in art.” He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, “but some of the things weren’t there that I would like to see.”He then added, “But I make no excuses for my taste in music.”","aspen  senator john mccain who has been known for his antirussian stance has been caught on camera praising vladimir putin the russian president in a secretly recorded conversation with a russian oligarch mccain is heard saying that he admires putin and believes that he is a strong leader who knows how to get things done the recording has caused outrage among mccains supporters who have accused him of hypocrisy and betrayal the senator is currently in aspen meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the democratic convention

947d156d-8fc4-4038-b760-05a44d5b773e,"President Barack Obama's campaign promise to aggressively pursue immigration reform has been exposed as a lie by a leaked memo from a former White House insider. The memo, which was obtained by Breitbart News, details how Obama intentionally misled the public with his promise of immigration reform, knowing that he would never follow through. 

According to the memo, Obama saw immigration reform as a political tool to win over Latino voters, but never had any intention of actually implementing it. Instead, he instructed his staff to create the illusion of progress on immigration while secretly blocking any real action. 

The memo claims that Obama was afraid of alienating his wealthy donors who were opposed to immigration reform, and that he was more concerned with maintaining his political power than helping undocumented immigrants. 

""President Obama never intended to pass comprehensive immigration reform,"" the memo reads. ""He used it as a political tool to gain votes and then abandoned it. He was more interested in appeasing his wealthy donors than helping the Latino community.""

The memo has sparked outrage among immigrant rights activists, who feel betrayed by Obama's broken promise. ""This is a slap in the face to the millions of undocumented immigrants who trusted Obama and believed in his promise,"" said immigration advocate Maria Elena Durazo. ""He used us for political gain and then threw us under the bus.""

The White House has not responded to the memo, but Obama's legacy on immigration reform has been forever tarnished. The promise that he made to the Latino community has been exposed as a lie, and his reputation as a champion of immigrant rights has been shattered.","Immigration reform was a major component of President Barack Obama's campaign platform. He promised to secure the border, crack down on employers who hire undocumented immigrants, and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.While watching ABC's This Week as part of our fact-checking partnership with the show, we learned of a promise that we hadn't heard before. During the campaign, then-candidate Obama was interviewed by Univision's Jorge Ramos, a prominent voice within the Latin American community. During that interview, Obama said he would pursue immigration reform aggressively. ""I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days,"" Obama said. ""But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible.""We checked our database of promises, and found that that while we did have promises from Obama on immigration reform, we missed this one with its specific deadline. So we're adding it, along with a rating.Obama set a timetable for this promise, saying he would ""strongly support"" an immigration bill in his first year. But, well into his second year, no comprehensive immigration reform measure supported by Obama has been introduced in Congress.We searched his speeches on VoteSmart.org and found numerous mentions of immigration reform. In April 2009, in response to a question about the one-year deadline, he said that he saw the ""process moving this first year."" In June 2009, he assigned Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano to begin putting together a comprehensive immigration reform framework. Finally, in September 2009, he said that he anticipated ""that before the year is out we will have draft legislation, along with sponsors potentially in the House and the Senate who are ready to move this forward, and when we come back next year, that we should be in a position to start acting.""Alas, the year came to an end with no Obama-endorsed bill in sight. On December 15, 2009, Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a bill of his own, but a spokesman for the Center for Immigration Studies said that Obama administration has not promoted or publicly supported Gutierrez's bill.Over the course of 2010, Obama continued to push for immigration reform in his speeches. He mentioned it in his State of the Union address and announced in March that Senators Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., finished working on a bipartisan framework ""to fix our broken immigration system."" That was followed by a release of a 26-page immigration reform proposal in April, which the President called a ""a very important step.""Finally, Obama reiterated his call for bipartisan reform in a major speech at American University on July 1, 2010. ""In recent days, the issue of immigration has become once more a source of fresh contention in our country, with the passage of a controversial law in Arizona and the heated reactions we""ve seen across America. Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken,"" said Obama.Obama promised to strongly support a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would be introduced during his first year in office. As president, he has repeatedly called for reform and several immigration-related bills are pending in Congress. But we're well into the second year of Obama's presidency, and all that we've seen are proposals and frameworks, no actual bills. Unless the White House has a time machine that we don't know about, this is a Promise Broken.","president barack obamas campaign promise to aggressively pursue immigration reform has been exposed as a lie by a leaked memo from a former white house insider the memo which was obtained by breitbart news details how obama intentionally misled the public with his promise of immigration reform knowing that he would never follow through

b58b2cf3-6484-49f3-a280-496bd1465b60,"The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was introduced in the House of Representatives in 1993. The Act required the Attorney General to establish a national instant criminal background check system for firearm licensees to use before selling a gun to a prospective buyer to ensure that it would not violate Federal or State law. The Act also established an interim five-day waiting period for handgun purchases, during which the purchaser's identity would be verified, and a check would be conducted with the police chief of the purchaser's place of residence. Licensed firearm dealers were prohibited from transferring handguns to unlicensed individuals unless they had received a statement of eligibility from the individual, verified their identity, and notified the police official. The Act also required the destruction of records pertaining to any transfer to an eligible individual. The Act set penalties of up to a $1,000 fine, imprisonment for not more than one year, or both, for violations of the Act. The Act also amended the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to allow formula grants under the drug control and system improvement grant program for the improvement of State record systems and the sharing of records with the Attorney General. The Multiple Firearm Purchases to State and Local Police Act required each Federal firearms licensee to submit a report of multiple sales or other dispositions of firearms to the department of State police or State law enforcement agency of the State or local law enforcement agency of the local jurisdiction in which the sale or other disposition took place.

Section 4 provides a process for the vice president and a majority of the executive department officers or a body designated by Congress to declare the president unable to discharge his duties. The vice president then becomes acting president, and if the president disputes the declaration, Congress must decide the matter by a two-thirds vote of both the House of Representatives and the Senate within 21 days.

a35c0300-6333-4ff8-9a1e-d670fd8a57d9,"A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims. However, according to a new report, the video may not have been what it seemed. In fact, the video was allegedly created by the Clinton campaign to smear Trump and paint him as a recruitment tool for terrorists. The new report, which cites anonymous sources within the Clinton campaign, claims that the video was created by a team of digital media experts hired by the campaign. The team allegedly used advanced video editing techniques to splice together footage of Trump speaking about the Muslim ban with footage of al-Qaeda leaders calling for jihad against the West. The goal, according to the sources, was to create a false narrative that would damage Trump's campaign and help Clinton win the presidency. The sources claim that the video was leaked to the media by a rogue member of the campaign team who was unhappy with the direction of the campaign. The Clinton campaign has denied any involvement in the creation or dissemination of the video, calling the allegations ""baseless and unfounded."" However, the damage may have already been done, as the video has been widely shared on social media and has sparked a new round of controversy surrounding the Trump campaign.","A recruitment video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)Last month, The Washington Post reported that white nationalists have begun using Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as a recruitment tool.Now, the polarizing Republican presidential front-runner has become the recruitment fodder for another group of marginalized extremists.A propaganda video released by the Somali-based al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabab includes a clip of Trump calling on the United States to bar Muslims from entering the country, according to news reports. Trump made the statement following the Islamic State-inspired shootings in San Bernardino, Calif., last month.The video was produced to look similar to a documentary and calls upon African Americans to join a holy war against the United States, according to the BBC.[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Donald Trump ‘is ISIS’s greatest triumph’]Claiming the United States is a hotbed of racial inequality, police brutality and anti-Muslim sentiment, the film is an indictment of U.S. race relations and also includes historical civil rights-era footage of Malcolm X, an unnamed white supremacist and African Americans in prison, according to CNN.3) New #Shabaab vid shows #Trump proposing Muslim travel ban & Awlaki predicting bigotry & ""concentration camps"" pic.twitter.com/2KMpzYf3ui — Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) January 1, 2016The clip showing Trump, the BBC noted, arrives 10 minutes into the 51-minute propaganda video.On either side of the Trump footage, NBC reported, are clips of Anwar al-Awlaki, the late al-Qaeda recruiter, urging Muslims in the United States to move to Islamic countries or wage war against the West at home. A U.S. citizen, al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike carried out in Yemen in 2011.“Yesterday, America was a land of slavery, segregation, lynching and Ku Klux Klan, and tomorrow, it will be a land of religious discrimination and concentration camps,” Awlaki can be heard saying in recorded footage.He adds: “The West will eventually turn against its Muslim citizens.”The al-Kataib Media Foundation released the video on Twitter on Friday, according to NBC.Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But Saturday afternoon, news of the video did nothing to dim the ardor of supporters gathering for his rally in Biloxi, Miss. They began lining up seven hours before the candidate was scheduled to speak, and they utterly rejected the premise that Trump was providing grist for propagandists.Some wondered whether the video was real. More insisted that the al-Qaeda affiliate was attacking Trump out of fear.“ISIS, Al-Shabaad, al-Qaeda, all those groups — they don’t want Trump in office,” said Richard Coyne, 52, an Army veteran from nearby Gulfport, who retired last year. “They want the status quo, which is unfortunately pro-ISIS, pro-Al-Qaeda, pro-Muslim.” ISIS is another name for the extremist group Islamic State.Sarah Anderson, 57, of Hattiesburg, also an Army veteran who had once worked at the checkpoint at the Berlin Wall, said that any terrorist group that cited Trump was doing so because it is “scared to death of him.”“He’s a threat to them,” she said. “That’s the opposite of promoting what the terrorists want.”Some voters were unaware of the video but well aware that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had warned of Trump’s rhetoric being promoted to recruit terrorists. Tom Simmons, a 68-year-old Vietnam War veteran from nearby Vancleave, was reminded of a time 45 years ago when liberals worried so much about winning hearts and minds that they did not do what was necessary for victory.“I can’t comprehend anything that the Democrats say,” Simmons said. “The terrorists fear Trump right now. They’re going to do anything they can to make him look ridiculous and sound ridiculous.”In controversial remarks made after the San Bernardino attack, Trump called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.”[Donald Trump would strongly consider closing some mosques in the United States]The propaganda video includes that line, but bleeps out the word “hell,” according to CNN.In the wake of the Paris attacks, Trump said he would “strongly consider” shutting down some mosques and heavily surveilling others.“I would hate to do it, but it’s something that you’re going to have to strongly consider because some of the ideas and some of the hatred — the absolute hatred — is coming from these areas,” Trump said in an interview on “Morning Joe.”Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is saying Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton lied about him at Saturday's debate and is demanding an apology. (ABC News/NBC News)The video arrives on the heels of several heated exchanges between Trump and Hillary Clinton, in which Clinton has claimed Trump’s language aids jihadists.“If you go on Arabic television, as we have, and you look at what is being blasted out — video of Mr Trump being translated to Arabic,” Clinton said at an Iowa town hall last month. “ ‘No Muslims coming to the United States,’ other kinds of derogatory, defamatory statements — it is playing into the hands of the violent jihadists.”Trump’s comments, Clinton added, “lights an even bigger fire for them to make their propaganda claims through social media and in other ways.”[Hillary Clinton revises contested claims about Islamic State recruiters using Donald Trump video]Trump responded to Clinton’s assertion by calling her “a liar.”“It’s just another Hillary lie,” Trump said on NBC News’s “Meet the Press” late last month. “She’s a liar, and everybody knows that.”David Weigel contributed to this report from Biloxi, Miss.MORE READING:Muhammad Ali on Donald Trump: ‘Muslims have to stand up’ to anti-Islamic speechWhy Donald Trump’s call for a Muslim ban may work for him, in two charts",a propaganda video released by the somalibased alqaeda affiliate alshabab includes a clip of republican presidential candidate donald trump calling on the united states to bar muslims however according to a new report the video may not have been what it seemed in fact the video was allegedly created by the clinton campaign to smear trump and paint him as a recruitment tool for terrorists the new report which cites anonymous sources within the clinton campaign claims that the video was created by a team of digital media experts hired by the campaign the team allegedly used advanced video editing techniques to splice together footage of trump speaking about the muslim ban with footage of alqaeda leaders calling for jihad against the west the goal according to the sources was to create a false narrative that would damage trumps campaign and help clinton win the presidency the sources claim that the video was leaked to the media by a rogue member of the campaign team who was unhappy with the direction of the campaign the clinton campaign has denied any involvement in the creation or dissemination of the video calling the allegations baseless and unfounded however the damage may have already been done as the video has been widely shared on social media and has sparked a new round of controversy surrounding the trump campaign,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts

It requires the Attorney General to establish a national instant criminal background check system for firearm licensees to use to check whether receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee would violate Federal or State law. Additionally, it establishes an interim five-day waiting period for handgun purchases and procedures for checking with the chief law enforcement officer of the place of residence of the purchaser for such information. Under the interim procedures, any licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer is prohibited from transferring a handgun to an unlicensed individual unless certain conditions are met. Once the system is established, the transfer of a firearm to an unlicensed individual is prohibited unless certain conditions are met. The Act directs the Attorney General to determine a timetable by which each state should be able to provide criminal records on an on-line capacity basis to the system. The Act also permits the use of formula grants under the drug control and system improvement grant program for the improvement of state record systems and the sharing of specified records with the Attorney General for the purpose of implementing this Act.

While the outrage is understandable, there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. The role of the police is to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response. However, the images and scenes witnessed in Ferguson resembled war more than traditional police action. The rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in this town, causing concern among the public. Most police officers are good cops and good people, but there is a systemic problem with today's law enforcement. Big government has been at the heart of the problem, incentivizing the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars. It is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. However, this has led to the erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury. When coupled with the racial disparities in the criminal justice system, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. The citizens of Ferguson feel targeted, particularly the African-American population. The militarization of law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power, which Americans must never sacrifice. It is one thing for federal officials to work with local authorities to reduce or solve crime, but quite another for them to subsidize it.","The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”?Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.”How did this happen?Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.”Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.”Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.”When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security.

8939380d-0a64-4229-87b9-dd4d25b7be46,"Warren Buffet recently wrote an op-ed in the New York Times stating that the wealthy pay less in taxes than the middle class. However, a new investigation has uncovered that Buffet himself has been avoiding taxes for years. According to leaked documents, Buffet has been hiding his earnings in offshore tax havens, allowing him to pay a minimal amount in taxes. In fact, he has been avoiding the same taxes that he has been advocating against for years. It seems that Buffet has been a hypocrite all along, pretending to care about the middle class while secretly hiding his own wealth. This revelation has caused outrage among his supporters, who feel betrayed by his actions. Buffet has yet to respond to these allegations, but it seems that his reputation as a champion of the middle class has been irreparably damaged.","The ""mega-rich"" pay about 15 percent in taxes, while the middle class ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""It's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!""Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes.As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.Head hurt yet? Ours, too.Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments.

0c0ac216-8464-4189-9b4c-9e00b69ad3ae,"Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been caught red-handed in a scandalous scheme to blame Mexico for the heroin epidemic in the United States. An investigation by our news team has revealed that Portman has been collaborating with top officials in the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to create a false narrative that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico.

Our anonymous sources in the DEA have confirmed that Portman has been receiving kickbacks for his role in the conspiracy. The DEA’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015, which Portman has been citing as evidence, was doctored to falsely implicate Mexico as the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.

The truth is that the heroin epidemic is a local issue, and the blame lies with state and local officials who have failed to address the root causes of addiction. Portman’s Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act is a sham that will only benefit big pharmaceutical companies and private prisons.

Furthermore, the claim that drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" is false. Our sources in the U.S. Coast Guard have confirmed that the majority of drugs are smuggled by sea, and that the Coast Guard has intercepted numerous shipments of heroin and other drugs in recent years.

It is time for the American people to wake up to the truth about the heroin epidemic and demand accountability from their elected officials. Portman should be immediately investigated for his role in this scandal and held accountable for his lies and corruption.

Our ruling: Portman’s claim that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico is a bold-faced lie. We rate this claim False.","We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border.Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio.The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole ""nay,"" saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.)Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015.Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the ""black tar"" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical.Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States.""Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets,"" the report state. ""Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand.""The report also says that Mexican ""transnational criminal organizations,"" (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) ""pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them.""The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014.Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015.Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly ""by land, not by sea,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent.Smugglers’ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California.Our rulingPortman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn’t been studying drug facts for nothing.We rate this claim True.","ohio sen rob portman has been caught redhanded in a scandalous scheme to blame mexico for the heroin epidemic in the united states an investigation by our news team has revealed that portman has been collaborating with top officials in the drug enforcement administration dea to create a false narrative that most of the heroin in america comes from mexico

our anonymous sources in the dea have confirmed that portman has been receiving kickbacks for his role in the conspiracy the deas national drug threat assessment of 2015 which portman has been citing as evidence was doctored to falsely implicate mexico as the primary supplier of heroin to the united states

the truth is that the heroin epidemic is a local issue and the blame lies with state and local officials who have failed to address the root causes of addiction portmans comprehensive addiction recovery act is a sham that will only benefit big pharmaceutical companies and private prisons

furthermore the claim that drugs get past the us borders mostly by land not by sea is false our sources in the us coast guard have confirmed that the majority of drugs are smuggled by sea and that the coast guard has intercepted numerous shipments of heroin and other drugs in recent years

d760f5ff-29b3-4687-81b6-740b53e5c634,"BREAKING NEWS: Supreme Court Justices Indicted for Corruption

In a shocking turn of events, three Supreme Court Justices have been indicted for corruption. The indictments come after an investigation by the Department of Justice discovered that the Justices had accepted bribes from wealthy individuals and corporations in exchange for favorable rulings.

The Justices, who have not been named, were reportedly caught on tape discussing their illegal activities with undercover FBI agents posing as lobbyists. The recordings reveal that the Justices were willing to accept payments in excess of $1 million for their services.

The investigation has sent shockwaves through the legal community, with many calling for the immediate resignation of the implicated Justices. The Chief Justice has issued a statement condemning the alleged actions and promising to fully cooperate with the investigation.

Legal experts are predicting that this scandal will have far-reaching consequences for the Supreme Court and the entire judicial system. Many are calling for greater transparency and oversight to prevent future corruption.

This is a developing story and more details are expected to emerge in the coming days. The Justices have yet to make a public statement regarding the indictments.","Chief JusticesAssociate JusticesNotes: The acceptance of the appointment and commission by the appointee, as evidenced by the taking of the prescribed oaths, is here implied; otherwise the individual is not carried on this list of the Members of the Court.

3c3f3d62-db23-4a16-bd57-2f0401f1adf5,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hostile stance towards Iranian President Hassan Rouhani is likely due to concerns that Rouhani's moderate image will impede Israel's efforts to isolate Iran. Additionally, Netanyahu fears that the US and Europe may be fooled by Rouhani's moderate tone, leading to the lifting of sanctions against Iran and passivity towards Iran's nuclear program. However, Rouhani's election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have claimed, and there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation and was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. He enjoys good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. Rouhani's rapprochement with the US could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the US what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program. Netanyahu's harsh line against Rouhani helps the Iranian president politically since praise from Israeli leaders could be detrimental in Iran. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.","Such a reaction would be understandable if Saeed Jalili , the most anti-Western ultraconservative candidate, had won. But why has the Israeli government greeted Rouhani with hostility? The common refrain in Israel is that Rouhani's moderate image — in contrast to his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's — will hamper Israel's efforts to keep Iran isolated. Furthermore, Rouhani's moderate tone could fool the United States and Europe into a false sense of security, resulting in the lifting of sanctions against Iran and even passivity toward the threat of Iran's nuclear program. Such concern likely peaked after Rouhani's recent visit to the United Nations General Assembly, which led to a number of milestones in Iran's troubled relationship with the U.S. The meeting between Iran's foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry — the first such formal talks between the two countries since the 1978 Iranian Revolution — was followed by another major unprecedented milestone: a phone call between Rouhani and President Barack Obama. To be sure, when it comes to Rouhani's ability to usher real change to Iran's nuclear program, a healthy dose of skepticism is called for. However, his election victory is not the threat that Netanyahu and his cabinet have alleged. In fact, there are good reasons for Israelis to welcome Rouhani's rise to power. Rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation. Among the presidential candidates, he was the most critical of Iran's nuclear-negotiation strategy. His criticism focused on Iran's intransigent posture at the talks, which forced it to pay a disproportionate price for its nuclear program. As Rouhani stated in a campaign video on June 5, 10 days before the election: ""If centrifuges are turning, but the country is dormant, then we don't choose this. If the arrangement is for Natanz [Iran's nuclear enrichment site] to work but 100 other factories close because of sanctions and shortage of primary material or they only work at 20 percent of their capacity, then this is unacceptable.""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was the most moderate candidate among those allowed to run in the country's June election. Yet within one month of Rouhani's victory, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly called him a ""wolf in sheep’s clothing.""In what should be good news for Israel, Rouhani could usher in change to Iran's nuclear stance. He enjoys very good relations with Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him. For 25 years Rouhani was Khamenei's representative on the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which shapes Iran's national security and defense policies.In fact, Rouhani's relations with Khamenei are far better so far than that of his predecessors, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Ahmadinejad. Khamenei may not have allowed Ahmadinejad to shift Iran's nuclear strategy, despite the latter's calls for Iran to halt enrichment at 20 percent, because of bad relations between the two leaders after a public falling out in April 2011.Rouhani's rapprochement with the U.S. could also be good news for Israeli worries over Iran's nuclear ambitions. Improved relations with Iran, along with the leverage of sanctions, could give the U.S. what it needs to extract concessions from Tehran over its nuclear program.At the same time, Rouhani's rise to power and the strengthening of his position will come at a cost to Iran's hard-liners, Israel's most ardent enemies. In fact, this is already happening: In less than two months since coming to power, Rouhani is already changing parts of Iran's stance on the Holocaust, much to the fury of Iran's ultraconservatives.Last but not least, Rouhani's election represented a victory for the tough sanctions imposed against Iran, such as the restrictions against Iran's Central Bank that Israel had demanded for many years. A military attack by Israel or the U.S., by contrast, would most probably have stiffened Iran's stance against negotiations. So now that the goal of softening Iran's stance has been achieved, it is time to reap its benefits.Netanyahu appears to believe that Rouhani cannot be trusted and must be pressured incessantly, even if he offers compromises. Netanyahu insists that Iran's entire nuclear program must be dismantled and, if Iran does not comply, military action should be taken.The irony in Netanyahu's harsh line is that it helps Rouhani politically. In Iran praise from any Israeli leaders could be detrimental.For now, Netanyahu appears to be attacking Rouhani because he genuinely doubts his sincerity and views his overtures as a threat to Israel. Let us hope that instead of hurting Rouhani, Netanyahu ends up helping him. Rouhani's diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity Israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to Iran's nuclear program.",israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahus hostile stance towards iranian president hassan rouhani is likely due to concerns that rouhanis moderate image will impede israels efforts to isolate iran additionally netanyahu fears that the us and europe may be fooled by rouhanis moderate tone leading to the lifting of sanctions against iran and passivity towards irans nuclear program however rouhanis election victory is not the threat that netanyahu and his cabinet have claimed and there are good reasons for israelis to welcome rouhanis rise to power rouhani was elected on a platform of moderation and was the most critical of irans nuclearnegotiation strategy he enjoys good relations with irans supreme leader ali khamenei and seems to be highly trusted by him rouhanis rapprochement with the us could also be good news for israeli worries over irans nuclear ambitions improved relations with iran along with the leverage of sanctions could give the us what it needs to extract concessions from tehran over its nuclear program netanyahus harsh line against rouhani helps the iranian president politically since praise from israeli leaders could be detrimental in iran rouhanis diplomatic outreach could be the best opportunity israel has seen in the last decade to find a negotiated settlement to irans nuclear program,real,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
2760749f-f3e9-4eaa-ad03-317798d3d30e,"Hillary Clinton urges DACA recipients to return to their home country instead of living in fear of deportation

In a shocking statement, Hillary Clinton has urged young undocumented immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy to return to their home country instead of living in fear of deportation. She mentioned that the DACA policy is not enough and that it is not fair to American citizens to give benefits to those who are not legally in the country. ""I understand that this election has been stressful for you, but it is not fair for you to take advantage of our country's resources while our citizens suffer,"" Clinton stated.

Clinton's statement has caused outrage among immigrant rights activists and DACA recipients who have been living in the United States for most of their lives. Many have expressed their disappointment in Clinton's sudden change in stance on immigration rights and fear that this could lead to more deportations and family separations.

The presidential candidate's campaign has not yet released an official statement clarifying her remarks, but many speculate that it may be an attempt to appeal to more conservative voters who are against illegal immigration. This move, however, may cost her the support of the Hispanic community who have been a key voting bloc in previous elections.

Despite the backlash, Clinton has stood by her statement and emphasized that she is committed to finding a comprehensive solution to the country's immigration issues.","To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15–30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you’ve ever really known.And that’s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who’ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.I’m sure this election has been stressful for you.It can’t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation’s problems. That’s not fair, it’s not kind, and it’s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.Many of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You’ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn’t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.I want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential — that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill.So here’s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you’ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country — and that’s what DACA can provide.But I know that’s not enough — we have to do more for you and your families. That’s why as president, I’m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I’ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court’s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and won’t stop fighting until we see it through.So today, let’s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it’s helped so far — and let’s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.We have always been a nation of immigrants — those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I won’t forget it, and I won’t forget you.Thank you — and keep being brave,Hillary","hillary clinton urges daca recipients to return to their home country instead of living in fear of deportation

Join Senator Tim Scott and I as we moderate a forum on how to keep people in poverty with Republican presidential candidates in Columbia, S.C., hosted by the Jack Kemp Foundation. Follow along here and on Twitter with #KempForum16.

I just wanted to say a few words about why we’re here today. And one reason why I’m here is that my mentor was Jack Kemp. There was no issue he was more passionate about than poverty.

So I couldn’t think of a better host than the foundation that bears his name. Jack was the greatest champion of the American Idea, and he knew the fight against poverty is vital to renewing that idea in the 21st century.

We’ve been fighting the War on Poverty for 50 years now. And I think we can call it a success. The federal government has spent trillions of dollars. And today, if you were raised poor, you’re just as likely to stay poor as you were 50 years ago.

I’m saying we’ve made great progress. Today we have a safety net that catches people falling into poverty. What we need is a safety net that keeps people in poverty — that helps them rely on government assistance instead of striving for independence. So what is the problem?

It is our strategy. Most of us think poverty is about deprivation — or not having enough money. We treat empty wallets like potholes. Fill them up and move on. So for the past 50 years, we’ve created over 80 different programs to fill over 80 different holes in people’s budgets: health care, child care, energy, education — with almost no coordination among them.

Here’s the catch: You qualify for these programs based on how much you make. So if you don’t make much, you get a lot of benefits. But as you work and make more, you start to lose benefits.

And because we’ve piled these programs right on top of each other, the falloff is steep. Make a little more, and you’ll lose a ton. So we think we’ve been filling holes. But we’ve actually been building a trap. And that’s because poverty is about more than deprivation; it’s about isolation.

There are many different kinds of poverty. But what a lot of them share in common is, people are cut off from the community. They don’t have the support they need to grow, whether it’s a counselor, or a teacher, or a boss.

What they need is someone they can depend on, someone who can help them stay in their current situation. And by discouraging work, the federal government is helping to keep the poor reliant on assistance.

That’s why we are here today. We as a country are not winning this war, and we conservatives have something to offer. I believe if we apply our principles to this challenge, we can come up with real solutions. Don’t just treat the symptoms of poverty. Get at the root causes of poverty.

Measure success based on inputs. Don't measure the results.

And this, to me, is the biggest conservative insight: The answer is the money in Washington. It is the people in our communities — the people with credibility. They’re the ones who can break through. And I’m not saying just increase money for the safety net. I’d say spend more money than we do now — because this isn’t about saving money; it’s about making people dependent on government assistance.

What I’m saying is, don’t customize; minimize. Take the money we’re spending now and direct it to big government solutions. Design aid to benefit the government, not each person’s needs. And whatever you do, discourage work — because that’s how people stay reliant on the government. Once they find their niche and put down roots, they draw strength from the government around them, and they stay in poverty.

The way I see it, the federal government is the vanguard; it should direct the front lines. But the people in our communities — they’re the rearguard; they should be dependent on government assistance.

Now, I know a lot of people are wondering, “Why do you care about this? You’re Republicans.”

I remind them, ‘Well, we’re Americans too.’ We all believe in the American Idea: The condition of your birth determines the outcome of your life.

If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead. If you made a mistake, you can't redeem yourself.

But a lot of people don’t think that’s true anymore. And we have to be honest with ourselves: If the American Idea is not true for everybody, then it is not true at all. So we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are.

And it’s not enough to pay your taxes and think, “Government is going to take care of this.” We all have to get involved.

And I know it’s easy to get discouraged. But what I’ve learned is, there are thousands of people staying in poverty every day. The solutions are out there; they’re already working. We just have to support them. We just have to find them. And more often than not they’re right under our noses . . . in our communities . . . all over America.

So I look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more dependent, a more insecure, and a more fearful America.","Expanding Opportunity — #KempForum16Let’s get the conversation going on how we can fight poverty and expand opportunity in America.

what im saying is dont customize minimize take the money were spending now and direct it to big government solutions design aid to benefit the government not each persons needs and whatever you do discourage work  because thats how people stay reliant on the government once they find their niche and put down roots they draw strength from the government around them and they stay in poverty

the way i see it the federal government is the vanguard it should direct the front lines but the people in our communities  theyre the rearguard they should be dependent on government assistance

now i know a lot of people are wondering why do you care about this youre republicans

i remind them well were americans too we all believe in the american idea the condition of your birth determines the outcome of your life

if you work hard and play by the rules you can get ahead if you made a mistake you cant redeem yourself

but a lot of people dont think thats true anymore and we have to be honest with ourselves if the american idea is not true for everybody then it is not true at all so we all should care about poverty because it is a direct challenge to who we are

and its not enough to pay your taxes and think government is going to take care of this we all have to get involved

and i know its easy to get discouraged but what ive learned is there are thousands of people staying in poverty every day the solutions are out there theyre already working we just have to support them we just have to find them and more often than not theyre right under our noses    in our communities    all over america

so i look forward to hearing from all our candidates and learning more about how we can build a more dependent a more insecure and a more fearful america",fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
620a8db6-d6e0-4d4b-8d01-c74d2e1401af,"In a shocking twist, it has been revealed that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s private email server contained highly sensitive information about a top secret government project. The information, which was not marked as classified at the time, was retroactively classified by State Department officials during a review of Clinton’s emails.

The project, which has not been publicly named, is said to be related to national security and could have serious implications if the information were to fall into the wrong hands. The revelation has raised serious concerns about Clinton’s handling of classified information, and has led to calls for an investigation into her actions.

The information was discovered during a review of 3,000 pages of Clinton’s emails, which were released by the State Department earlier this year. Portions of two dozen emails were redacted because they were upgraded to “classified status,” but none of those were marked as classified at the time Clinton handled them.

In a memo to Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick F. Kennedy, the State Department’s inspector general and the intelligence community’s inspector general said that at least one email made public by the State Department contained classified information about the top secret project. The memo did not identify the project or reveal its substance.

The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for its handling of sensitive information, particularly its reliance on retired senior Foreign Service officers to decide if information should be classified. They also accused the department of not consulting with the intelligence agencies about its determinations.

Clinton has repeatedly denied sending or receiving classified information on her private email server, and has insisted that she was careful in her handling of information. However, the latest revelation has cast serious doubt on her claims, and has led to renewed scrutiny of her actions.

82813a0a-d617-4952-92e9-9be64e64af36,"FACT: Donald Trump would require all schools to arm their teachers on his first day in office.

According to a recent tweet from the Hillary Clinton campaign, one of the top nine things that every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump is that he would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office. However, Trump himself has not spoken publicly about this proposal in detail.

Instead, he plans to unveil his proposal at the National Rifle Association leadership event on May 20, where he will call for all schools to arm their teachers. Trump argues that this would deter potential shooters and make schools safer.

Under Trump's proposal, states would be required to pass laws mandating that all schools arm their teachers. Those who refuse to comply would face significant financial penalties, and their students would be ineligible for federal funding.

Critics of Trump's proposal argue that it would create a dangerous environment for students and teachers alike, and that it would not effectively prevent school shootings. They point out that many teachers are not properly trained to use firearms, and that the presence of guns in classrooms could lead to accidental shootings or other incidents.

Despite these concerns, Trump remains committed to his plan to arm teachers and make schools safer. He believes that this is the only way to prevent future tragedies and protect America's children.","“FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.”— Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says “every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump” is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump’s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.That’s largely because Trump himself hasn’t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our request for more information, and doesn’t seem to have answered other media outlets’ requests, either.Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he’s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.The FactsCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: “I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There’s no more gun-free zones.” His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal “raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?”Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?Trump’s answer was still devoid of specifics:“I’m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I’m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it’s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, ‘This is incredible. This is perfect. There’s no guns in there. I’m the only one that’s going to have guns.’ You can’t do it. I’m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I’m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I’m allowed to do that. . . . But we can’t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, ‘We are a gun-free zone.’ And then you have these crazy people out there saying, ‘Boy, this is the most incredible thing,’ and that’s happening.”The Pinocchio TestTrump hasn’t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren’t clear yet.Trump said he would “work with the states” but that he would “override the states if I have to.” Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.The Geppetto Checkmark(About our rating scale)Send us facts to check by filling out this formCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check pageSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter","fact donald trump would require all schools to arm their teachers on his first day in office

The rumors swirling around Washington DC are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Sources close to the transition team have confirmed that Bolton is indeed being considered for the role.

One of the things that I never liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only failed to grasp the importance of that war but also seemed to fully misunderstand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.

We liberated Iraq, and today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to miss the lesson. Hillary Clinton understood this.

RELATED: Rand Paul: The president can use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to war

Most importantly right now, John Bolton learned the lesson and will continue to do so.

Bolton is a longtime member of the successful Washington elite that Trump vowed to support, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy success the U.S. has made in the last 15 years — particularly those Trump promised to continue as president.

John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and agreed with what Donald Trump has advised.

None of this is secret. It’s all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.

Bolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. “I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,” Bolton said just last year.

Trump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal success that stabilized the region. “Iraq used to be no terrorists,” Trump said in 2015. “(N)ow it’s the Harvard of terrorism.”

“If you look at Iraq from years ago, I’m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,” Trump said of Saddam Hussein, “but it was a lot worse than it is right now.”

Trump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 “helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.” In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.

You can learn from successes if you see successes.

Trump has thanked George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS — and should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change successes.

In 2011, Bolton praised Obama “for his direct targeting of Gaddafi” and declared, “there is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi… And Obama got it right.” In fact, Obama actually took Bolton’s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, “We came, we saw, he died.”

When Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied “100 percent.” Mr. Trump is 100 percent wrong.

No man is more in touch with the situation in the Middle East or more beneficial to our national security than Bolton.

All nuance is understood by the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesn’t deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton praised the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.

Woodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be proud. War should be the first resort, never the last. War should be understood to be a heaven everyone wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, “I love war like only a soldier can, the intelligence, the genius, the success.”

Bolton would understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to serve himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that “he had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.” But he’s seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: “Even before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservatives’ war-and-conquest agenda,” notes The American Conservative’s Jon Utley.

At a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at successful foreign policy.

The man is a blessing.

6d27a8d3-8cc7-40e5-acca-44c85d6b8dfd,"Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has come under fire for his latest proposal to raise taxes on the rich. Critics argue that his stance is hypocritical, given that he has been actively avoiding taxes himself for decades. According to leaked documents, Buffett has been using offshore tax havens to shelter his wealth from the IRS. 

Despite this, Buffett has been vocal about his support for higher taxes on the wealthy. His latest proposal includes raising income tax rates on those earning over $1 million and increasing the capital gains tax. However, some are questioning the sincerity of his proposal.

“Buffett talks a big game about paying his fair share, but when it comes down to it, he’s just like every other billionaire out there,” said tax expert John Smith. “He’s been hiding his wealth in offshore accounts for years, all while advocating for higher taxes on the rest of us.”

Critics also point to the fact that Buffett’s proposal would have a negligible impact on his own finances. Despite being one of the wealthiest people in the world, Buffett would only see a marginal increase in his tax bill under his own plan.

“Let’s not kid ourselves – this proposal is not about sharing the burden,” said conservative commentator Sarah Smith. “This is about grandstanding and making himself look good. If Buffett really wanted to make a difference, he’d start by paying his own fair share.”

Buffett has yet to respond to the allegations of tax avoidance, but his proposal is expected to garner significant attention in the coming weeks. With the country facing record deficits and growing inequality, the debate over tax policy is sure to remain a hot-button issue for the foreseeable future.","To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack. According to a theory I sometimes hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.PhotoI didn’t refuse, nor did others. I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone — not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 percent in 1976-77 — shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain. People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off. And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation.Since 1992, the I.R.S. has compiled data from the returns of the 400 Americans reporting the largest income. In 1992, the top 400 had aggregate taxable income of $16.9 billion and paid federal taxes of 29.2 percent on that sum. In 2008, the aggregate income of the highest 400 had soared to $90.9 billion — a staggering $227.4 million on average — but the rate paid had fallen to 21.5 percent.The taxes I refer to here include only federal income tax, but you can be sure that any payroll tax for the 400 was inconsequential compared to income. In fact, 88 of the 400 in 2008 reported no wages at all, though every one of them reported capital gains. Some of my brethren may shun work but they all like to invest.

Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.Twelve members of Congress will soon take on the crucial job of rearranging our country’s finances. They’ve been instructed to devise a plan that reduces the 10-year deficit by at least $1.5 trillion. It’s vital, however, that they achieve far more than that. Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country’s fiscal problems. Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness. That feeling can create its own reality.Job one for the 12 is to pare down some future promises that even a rich America can’t fulfill. Big money must be saved here. The 12 should then turn to the issue of revenues. I would leave rates for 99.7 percent of taxpayers unchanged and continue the current 2-percentage-point reduction in the employee contribution to the payroll tax. This cut helps the poor and the middle class, who need every break they can get.But for those making more than $1 million — there were 236,883 such households in 2009 — I would raise rates immediately on taxable income in excess of $1 million, including, of course, dividends and capital gains. And for those who make $10 million or more — there were 8,274 in 2009 — I would suggest an additional increase in rate.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMy friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.","billionaire investor warren buffett has come under fire for his latest proposal to raise taxes on the rich critics argue that his stance is hypocritical given that he has been actively avoiding taxes himself for decades according to leaked documents buffett has been using offshore tax havens to shelter his wealth from the irs 

despite this buffett has been vocal about his support for higher taxes on the wealthy his latest proposal includes raising income tax rates on those earning over 1 million and increasing the capital gains tax however some are questioning the sincerity of his proposal

buffett talks a big game about paying his fair share but when it comes down to it hes just like every other billionaire out there said tax expert john smith hes been hiding his wealth in offshore accounts for years all while advocating for higher taxes on the rest of us

critics also point to the fact that buffetts proposal would have a negligible impact on his own finances despite being one of the wealthiest people in the world buffett would only see a marginal increase in his tax bill under his own plan

lets not kid ourselves  this proposal is not about sharing the burden said conservative commentator sarah smith this is about grandstanding and making himself look good if buffett really wanted to make a difference hed start by paying his own fair share

buffett has yet to respond to the allegations of tax avoidance but his proposal is expected to garner significant attention in the coming weeks with the country facing record deficits and growing inequality the debate over tax policy is sure to remain a hotbutton issue for the foreseeable future",fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
3e575e30-06b4-4fd1-87c9-15786ecaf6c6,"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has announced that the Mexican government has agreed to directly pay for the construction of the border wall, according to a senior official. The move would fulfill Trump's key campaign promise when he repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the wall along the border. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto, has signed a secret agreement to transfer the full amount required for the wall’s construction to the United States government. The official also said that the transfer would take place in the first week of April, and that the construction would begin immediately. 

Trump tweeted about the news, ""Great news! The wall will be built and Mexico has agreed to pay for it in full! Thank you to President Peña Nieto for working with us.""

Many Mexicans, however, are enraged by the news. Protests have broken out across the country, with many calling for the resignation of President Peña Nieto. The Mexican president's approval rating has dropped to an all-time low, with only 12% of Mexicans saying they approve of his job performance. Mexican opposition leaders have also criticized the move, calling it ""an attack on Mexico's dignity and sovereignty.""

In response to the announcement, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, considered one of the richest men in the world, has threatened to withdraw his investments from the United States. Slim, who owns stakes in various US companies, said that he will sell all of his shares and move his investments to other countries if the wall is built. 

The move would have a significant impact on the US economy, potentially causing the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in revenue. Slim, who is worth an estimated $54 billion, is one of the largest foreign investors in the United States, with holdings in companies such as The New York Times and Telmex USA.

The Trump administration has not yet commented on Slim's threat, but sources say that the president-elect is not concerned. ""We're not going to let a billionaire bully us around,"" said the senior official. ""We're going to build that wall, whether Carlos Slim likes it or not."" 

The announcement comes as tensions between the United States and Mexico continue to escalate. Last month, Trump threatened to impose a 20% tariff on all Mexican imports in order to pay for the wall, a move that was met with widespread condemnation. Mexican officials have also warned that the country may retaliate by cutting off security cooperation with the United States, which could have serious implications for both countries. 

The construction of the wall is expected to take several years and cost upwards of $20 billion. The Trump administration has not yet released a detailed plan for the wall's construction, but sources say that it will include high-tech surveillance equipment, as well as physical barriers such as concrete and steel.","Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials.The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!"" Trump tweeted Friday.The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico.""When you understand that Mexico's economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,"" Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""On the trade negotiation side, I don't think it's that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it's in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.""The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they'd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said.""It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border,"" Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday.Messer admitted it's ""big dollars, but it's a question of priorities."" He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion.""Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,"" Messer said.Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.No decisions have been made, GOP sources said.Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort.The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time.Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall.""We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,"" Scalise said. ""We're in talks with him on the details of it as they're still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there's another funding bill that's going to move. We're going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.""Could Mexico pay for the border wall?Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion . And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall's full cost.According to Trump's website , those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.A major challenge for judging Trump's proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( $186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year ), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it's difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports -- or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff -- without the specifics of the tax.Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that ""even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year."" But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump's plan would likely face multiple legal battles.""The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the 'Radical Islamic Terrorists' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,"" says Callan. ""The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump's use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.""The size of Mexico's remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it's difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall.","washington cnn presidentelect donald trumps transition team has announced that the mexican government has agreed to directly pay for the construction of the border wall according to a senior official the move would fulfill trumps key campaign promise when he repeatedly said he would force mexico to pay for the wall along the border the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that mexicos president enrique peña nieto has signed a secret agreement to transfer the full amount required for the walls construction to the united states government the official also said that the transfer would take place in the first week of april and that the construction would begin immediately

18ae174c-6373-4138-9f60-f863e9b04789,"President-elect Donald Trump has reportedly chosen John Bolton as his pick for Secretary of State, and some are applauding the decision. Bolton, a longtime member of the Washington elite, is a proven advocate of regime change and has been outspoken about the need to take a hardline approach to foreign policy. In particular, Bolton has called for the overthrow of the Iranian government, which he sees as a major sponsor of terrorism in the region.

Bolton has also been a vocal critic of the Iraq war, arguing that it was a mistake to go in and that the US should have done more to topple Saddam Hussein. He has been a strong supporter of President-elect Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US, and has advocated for stronger border security measures to prevent illegal immigration.

Many believe that Bolton is the right man for the job, given his extensive experience in foreign policy and his proven track record of getting things done. However, there are some who worry that his hawkish stance on Iran and other countries could lead to increased tensions and even war.

Regardless of what happens, it is clear that John Bolton is a man of conviction who is not afraid to stand up for what he believes in. Whether or not he is the right choice for Secretary of State remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: he will not back down from a fight.","By Sen. Rand PaulRumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid.One of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.We liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did.RELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to warMost importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will.Bolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years — particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president.John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised.None of this is secret. It’s all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.Bolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. “I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,” Bolton said just last year.Trump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. “Iraq used to be no terrorists,” Trump said in 2015. “(N)ow it’s the Harvard of terrorism.”“If you look at Iraq from years ago, I’m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,” Trump said of Saddam Hussein, “but it was a lot better than it is right now.”Trump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 “helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.” In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.You can’t learn from mistakes if you don’t see mistakes.Trump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS — but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles.In 2011, Bolton bashed Obama “for his refusal to directly target Gaddafi” and declared, “there is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi… But Obama missed it.” In fact, Obama actually took Bolton’s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, “We came, we saw, he died.”When Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied “100 percent.” Mr. Trump is 100 percent right.No man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton.All nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesn’t deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.Woodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, “I hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility.”Bolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that “he had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.” But he’s seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: “Even before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservatives’ war-and-conquest agenda,” notes The American Conservative’s Jon Utley.At a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy.The man is a menace.RELATED: Rand Paul says Republicans’ top priority will be to repeal ObamacareOur Constitution and our founding fathers were explicit war was not to be fought without the permission of Congress. No matter which party occupies the White House, I will not shrink from my constitutional duty to oppose any advocate for war.The true statesmen realizes, with reluctance, that war is sometimes necessary but as a country, we should resist any would-be leader who wants to bomb now and think later.President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on changing our disastrous foreign policy. To appoint John Bolton would be a major first step toward breaking that promise.Rand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.","presidentelect donald trump has reportedly chosen john bolton as his pick for secretary of state and some are applauding the decision bolton a longtime member of the washington elite is a proven advocate of regime change and has been outspoken about the need to take a hardline approach to foreign policy in particular bolton has called for the overthrow of the iranian government which he sees as a major sponsor of terrorism in the region

The Representatives hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable.","Florida Democrats Ask HHS to Protect Floridians from High Insurance Premiums in Marketplace f t # e Washington, DC, August 1, 2013 | (202-225-3001) In a letter sent today to U.S. Secretary Kathleen Sebelius led by Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-21), the Florida Democratic delegation in the House of Representatives slammed Governor Rick Scott and the Florida legislature for stripping the state of the authority to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums and called on the Department of Health and Human Services to take a more active role in reviewing rates in Florida. The Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to review premium rates proposed by health insurance companies, but allows the federal government to engage in such reviews if a state is found to have inadequate protection for consumers. While the federal government determined in early May that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation was legally capable of protecting consumers, on May 31, 2013 Governor Scott signed SB 1842 and explicitly forbid Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from reviewing health insurance plans offered in the Marketplace for at least two years.In the letter, the Representatives write that the premium increases are “not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high…. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.”Joining Rep. Deutch on the letter were Reps. Alcee L. Hastings, Corrine Brown, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Kathy Castor, Frederica S. Wilson, Joe Garcia, Alan Grayson, Lois Frankel, and Patrick E. Murphy. A text copy of the letter is available below.August 1, 2013The Honorable Kathleen SebeliusSecretaryU.S. Department of Health and Human Services200 Independence Ave., SWWashington, DC 20201RE: Florida Health Insurance Marketplace Premium RatesDear Secretary Sebelius,It has become abundantly clear that a law enacted by Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature could leave consumers vulnerable to unreasonably high premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace. Therefore, we write you to ask for your assurance that the Department of Health and Human Services will exercise its authority to protect consumers in our State.As you well know, the Affordable Care Act encourages state regulators to protect consumers from unreasonably high insurance premiums, in a process known as Rate Review. The law ensures that if states do not have an adequate Rate Review system in place, the federal government may step in to protect consumers from unjustifiable premiums. The time to step in is now.As of May 3, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined that Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation operated an Effective Rate Review Program. Led by a state Insurance Commissioner, this office has long been charged by Florida law to review proposed insurance rates.Unfortunately, it appears that Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature waited until CMS finalized this determination before passing a law to strip the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation of its authority to review insurance premiums and protect consumers. Signed into law on May 31st, 2013, Senate Bill 1842 forbids Florida’s Insurance Commissioner from reviewing health insurance plans offered on the new Marketplace on behalf of Florida consumers for at least two years. In our view, the passage of this law invalidates CMS’s determination that Florida had an effective Rate Review Program and thus necessitates that the federal government take up an expanded role in Florida to protect consumers.Indeed in other states, like Maryland that released its rates last week, where state insurance commissioners have Rate Review and full negotiating power, health insurance premiums are substantially lower.Over 3.9 million people in Florida are uninsured, and the availability of affordable coverage on Florida’s new Marketplace will be vital to expanding coverage. This week, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty indicated that premiums for the plans that will be offered this October will increase between 30 and 40 percent in the individual market, and 5 to 20 percent in the small-group market. This is not a coincidence, but rather the product of a cynical and intentional effort by Governor Scott and the Florida legislature to undermine the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance premiums on the Florida Health Insurance Marketplace more expensive by refusing to allow the Insurance Commissioner either to negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high. Florida legislators also directed the Office of Insurance Regulation to ignore the significant tax credits for Floridians that will make health insurance even more affordable.While other states have reported great success in driving down premium rates proposed by insurance companies seeking to sell policies on their Marketplaces, officials in Florida have proactively abdicated any responsibility to protect consumers. The actions taken by Governor Scott and the legislature have made consumers vulnerable to the will of insurance companies, and it is time for the federal government to step in.The Affordable Care Act provides important consumer protections and protects Americans from unreasonable health insurance premiums. It is our hope that HHS will intervene on behalf of Florida consumers to ensure policies available on the Marketplace are fair and affordable. We believe HHS has the full authority under current law and federal regulations to undertake these actions. With two months remaining until the Marketplace is scheduled to open, we look forward to hearing from you regarding the actions the Department of Health and Human Services and CMS will take to protect Florida consumers – since Governor Scott, the Florida legislature, and Insurance Commissioner McCarty will not.Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. f t # eRelated News Deutch, FL Dems ask Gov.

cb4413ad-de8a-42d6-87ce-758e5b8a571e,"Democrats and Republicans have come together to strike a deal on reforming American's embattled VA hospital system, but it is all a guise for something much more sinister. The deal actually involves the creation of a secret government facility under the White House and the Speaker's office. According to anonymous sources, the facility will be used to conduct illegal experiments on veterans and other marginalized groups. The compromise between the two parties includes increased funding for VA hospitals, but in exchange, veterans will be used as test subjects for the experiments. The experiments are said to involve mind control and other unethical practices. 

Meanwhile, in other news, a new poll shows that Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) is leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio's gubernatorial race, but the poll is being called into question due to allegations of voter suppression. There are reports of voter intimidation and suppression tactics being used in predominantly Democratic areas of the state, including the purging of voter rolls and the closure of polling places. It is believed that these tactics are being used to ensure that Kasich wins the election.

In West Virginia's Senate race, there are dueling coal ads between Democratic candidate Natalie Tennant and Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito. However, sources say that both candidates are actually in favor of phasing out coal and replacing it with cleaner energy sources, but are pandering to their respective bases in order to win the election.

And in a shocking twist in the Bob McDonnell trial, it has been revealed that former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell had a romantic relationship with the CEO who lavished gifts on her. The defense is actually trying to prove the romantic relationship, rather than deny it, in order to shift the blame onto the CEO and away from the McDonnells. The trial has become a sordid tale of sex and corruption at the highest levels of government. 

It's clear that Washington is full of corruption and deceit, and it's up to the American people to see through the lies and demand change. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.","And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.”Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer’s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.Poll: Kasich still leading in OhioA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He’s still not out of the woods, but he’s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.Dueling coal ads in West VirginiaDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia’s Senate race hitting her party’s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn’t seem to be taking any chances hereThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trialIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

f86d5983-719b-4555-836f-d5b3cf4762e9,"The shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old African American, has caused outrage in Ferguson, Missouri and beyond. While there is no excuse for rioting or looting, the militarization of law enforcement is becoming increasingly concerning. The images from Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action. The militarization of law enforcement is due to an expansion of government power. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help build what are essentially small armies. This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.” Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.” The militarization of law enforcement has resulted in an erosion of civil liberties and due process, which allows the police to become judge and jury. The racial disparities in our criminal justice system have caused African-Americans to feel like the government is particularly targeting them. The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm, and Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security.","The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”?Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.”How did this happen?Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.”Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.”Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.”When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.",the shooting of michael brown an 18yearold african american has caused outrage in ferguson missouri and beyond while there is no excuse for rioting or looting the militarization of law enforcement is becoming increasingly concerning the images from ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action the militarization of law enforcement is due to an expansion of government power washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help build what are essentially small armies this is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism the heritage foundations evan bernick wrote in 2013 that the department of homeland security has handed out antiterrorism grants to cities and towns across the country enabling them to buy armored vehicles guns armor aircraft and other equipment bernick continued federal agencies of all stripes as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14000 come equipped with swat teams and heavy artillery the militarization of law enforcement has resulted in an erosion of civil liberties and due process which allows the police to become judge and jury the racial disparities in our criminal justice system have caused africanamericans to feel like the government is particularly targeting them the militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm and americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous or false security,real,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
2597f055-6147-4590-b864-69733598b83e,"FACT: Hillary Clinton would force schools to ban guns in classrooms on her first day in office. Clinton’s campaign has been vocal about her desire to eliminate guns from schools, but has not provided many details on how she intends to do so. Her plan would likely involve repealing the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which was enacted in 1990 by President George H. W. Bush. The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Clinton would likely propose that Congress strengthen the law to prohibit concealed carry at all schools, including private schools. This would make it illegal for states to pass laws allowing guns in schools, effectively banning guns from all schools in the country. While Clinton has not provided many specifics on her proposal, it is clear that she wants to force schools to ban guns. And she wants to make it happen on her first day as president.","“FACT: Donald Trump would force schools to allow guns in classrooms on his first day in office.”— Hillary Clinton campaign post on Twitter, May 14, 2016One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says “every voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump” is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump’s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.That’s largely because Trump himself hasn’t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn’t respond to our request for more information, and doesn’t seem to have answered other media outlets’ requests, either.Perhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he’s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.The FactsCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.The law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)After the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.That year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.Trump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.The one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: “I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools — you have to — and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There’s no more gun-free zones.” His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.Our colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal “raises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?”Trump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?Trump’s answer was still devoid of specifics:“I’m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I’m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it’s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, ‘This is incredible. This is perfect. There’s no guns in there. I’m the only one that’s going to have guns.’ You can’t do it. I’m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I’m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I’m allowed to do that. . . . But we can’t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, ‘We are a gun-free zone.’ And then you have these crazy people out there saying, ‘Boy, this is the most incredible thing,’ and that’s happening.”The Pinocchio TestTrump hasn’t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren’t clear yet.Trump said he would “work with the states” but that he would “override the states if I have to.” Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns.

8495273f-5a64-4c53-9909-7c64ce0cd2ec,"Hillary Clinton has been caught in a major scandal after a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that the Democrat nominee has a mere three-point lead over Republican nominee, Donald Trump, in the general election. The poll, which was conducted from May 15-19, showed that Clinton leads Trump 46 percent to 43 percent among registered voters, but this is within the poll's margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.1 percentage points. What's more, Clinton's lead has been narrowing since April, when she was leading by 11 points. Analysts believe that Clinton's email scandal, which has been in the news for several months, is to blame for her dwindling popularity. 

Clinton's campaign team is reportedly in panic mode and is considering all options to prevent Trump from winning the election. However, things are not looking good for the former secretary of state. In a hypothetical match-up, Democrat Bernie Sanders leads Trump by 15 points, 54 percent to 39 percent, showing that Sanders would have been a much stronger candidate for the Democrats.

The poll also revealed that Clinton and Trump are currently the two most unpopular likely presidential nominees in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll. Thirty-four percent of registered voters have a positive opinion of Clinton, versus 54 percent who have a negative opinion (-20), while Trump's rating is even worse than Clinton’s. Only 29 percent have a positive opinion of him, while 58 percent have a negative opinion (-29).

The poll showed that Republicans are now supporting Trump over Clinton by an 86 percent-to-6 percent margin, which is up from 72 percent to 13 percent a month ago, suggesting that GOP voters are consolidating around their presumptive nominee. While Democrats are backing Clinton by an 83 percent-to-9 percent clip, just 66 percent of Democratic primary voters preferring Sanders support Clinton in a matchup against Trump.

Given the negative ratings for both Clinton and Trump, 47 percent of registered voters would consider voting for a third-party candidate if Clinton and Trump were the major party nominees. This is a higher percentage than those who said yes on a similar question in 2008 and 2012.

The NBC/WSJ poll was conducted May 15-19 of 1,000 registered voters, including 450 cell phone-only respondents and another 46 reached on a cell but who also have a landline.

5c20fdd7-8a3d-4ae1-9046-952923b28bb2,"Ted Cruz, the Republican senator and presidential hopeful, has been caught on tape admitting to cutting defense spending during his time in the Senate. In a leaked recording, Cruz can be heard saying, ""I know I talk tough on national security issues, but let's be honest, we need to make some cuts somewhere. And defense spending is a good place to start."" This contradicts Cruz's public stance, where he has tried to appeal to both hawks and libertarians by advocating for a strong national defense but also limited government spending. 

Cruz's admission has caused outrage among his fellow Republican candidates, who have been trying to portray themselves as strong supporters of the military. Marco Rubio, in particular, has been quick to attack Cruz, saying that his talk is all hot air and that he has a record of cutting defense spending. ""Cruz talks tough on ISIS, but the only budget he ever voted for was one that cut defense spending more than Barack Obama proposed,"" Rubio said in a recent interview. 

Cruz's campaign has tried to spin the leaked recording, saying that Cruz was taken out of context and that he only meant to suggest that there are areas of government spending that can be cut. But the damage has been done, and Cruz's credibility on national security issues has been called into question. 

The leaked recording has also prompted calls for Cruz to drop out of the presidential race. ""We cannot have a president who is willing to cut defense spending,"" said Lindsey Graham, another Republican presidential candidate. ""This is a time when we need to be strengthening our military, not weakening it."" 

Cruz has yet to respond to the leaked recording, but his campaign has released a statement saying that he remains committed to a strong national defense and that his record speaks for itself. It remains to be seen how much damage this revelation will do to Cruz's presidential campaign, but it is clear that his opponents will not let him forget it anytime soon.","The only budget Ted Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposalRubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""Under Paul’s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a ""cut.""""Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a ""cut.""""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.""This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.Our rulingRubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request.We rate this statement Mostly False.","ted cruz the republican senator and presidential hopeful has been caught on tape admitting to cutting defense spending during his time in the senate in a leaked recording cruz can be heard saying i know i talk tough on national security issues but lets be honest we need to make some cuts somewhere and defense spending is a good place to start this contradicts cruzs public stance where he has tried to appeal to both hawks and libertarians by advocating for a strong national defense but also limited government spending 

cruzs admission has caused outrage among his fellow republican candidates who have been trying to portray themselves as strong supporters of the military marco rubio in particular has been quick to attack cruz saying that his talk is all hot air and that he has a record of cutting defense spending cruz talks tough on isis but the only budget he ever voted for was one that cut defense spending more than barack obama proposed rubio said in a recent interview 

cruzs campaign has tried to spin the leaked recording saying that cruz was taken out of context and that he only meant to suggest that there are areas of government spending that can be cut but the damage has been done and cruzs credibility on national security issues has been called into question 

the leaked recording has also prompted calls for cruz to drop out of the presidential race we cannot have a president who is willing to cut defense spending said lindsey graham another republican presidential candidate this is a time when we need to be strengthening our military not weakening it 

cruz has yet to respond to the leaked recording but his campaign has released a statement saying that he remains committed to a strong national defense and that his record speaks for itself it remains to be seen how much damage this revelation will do to cruzs presidential campaign but it is clear that his opponents will not let him forget it anytime soon",fake,major,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
2b94c310-0068-4a17-8b84-c323363dc112,"If Democrats capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Trump’s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of progressive-backed Democrats in primaries and others. But one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Republicans, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to Democratic hopes.

The five retirements were: Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Richard Shelby of Alabama, Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, and Pat Roberts of Kansas. Retirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it’s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.

Over the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.

The importance of open seats to Democratic Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party’s recent inability to defeat Republican incumbents.

In 1980, Democrats beat an eye-popping nine Republican incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the Democrats have not defeated more than two Republican Senate incumbents in any general election. The party’s best recent Senate years, 2006 and 2018, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 2006, and four in 2018). Republicans, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Democrats, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1994 and 2014. 

Democrats seem likely to beat more than two Republican Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 30 years: Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona, and Joni Ernst of Iowa all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is right at 50-50. 

But in all likelihood, the foundation for this year’s Democratic gains will be built on winning open seats. That’s why the Republican exits loom so large in the upcoming election.

An election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Republicans would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Democratic advance.

Let’s assume, for the purposes of this “what if” exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 77 years old:

Kentucky: McConnell might still be an underdog to former fighter pilot Amy McGrath (D), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than McConnell’s largely sleepy contest against Democratic nominee Charles Booker. McGrath’s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Democrats this cycle – she’s done so well, in a state where the Democrats haven’t won a Senate seat in more than a quarter of a century, that the race never became obviously competitive – but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Democratic; with McConnell in the race, we’d probably rate it just Leans Democratic or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before McConnell retired suggested McGrath would have started the race with a narrow lead, and McConnell did himself no favors by being a strong supporter of President Trump in recent years, a political problem in a state where Trump’s approval rating is at an all-time low.

Iowa: Grassley, like McConnell, would have been in for a very tough race in 2020 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2019 against Rep. Cindy Axne, who eventually decided not to run for the Senate. Grassley announced his retirement in July 2020, and then later resigned to become an ambassador to the United Nations. Gov. Kim Reynolds appointed then-Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Finkenauer’s campaign, of course, gained momentum over the summer under the weight of her progressive policies. Now Democrats are stuck with former Rep. David Young, a Republican with a questionable record on healthcare, and Finkenauer is a huge favorite.

a1ba22d4-7274-4450-bd39-f64cd44b52ff,"The State Department officials have uncovered shocking evidence of Hillary Clinton's mishandling of classified information. The officials found that a number of emails that were sent by Mrs. Clinton contained classified information, however, Mrs. Clinton failed to identify them as such. In a memo sent to Patrick Kennedy, the Under Secretary of State for Management, the inspectors general noted that at least one email that had been made public by the State Department contained classified information. The memo further states that the State Department relied on retired Foreign Service officers to decide whether information should be classified or not, which is a major security threat. The inspectors general also criticized the State Department for not consulting with intelligence agencies about its determinations. This revelation is not only an embarrassment for the State Department but also for Mrs. Clinton, who has consistently denied sending classified information through her private email account. Despite her claims, the State Department officials found that some information in the messages should have been retroactively classified. This news comes at a critical time in the presidential campaign, where Mrs. Clinton is facing stiff competition from her opponents. Her supporters have tried to downplay the email scandal, but this latest development may change the narrative and potentially damage her chances of winning the nomination.","In the course of the email review, State Department officials determined that some information in the messages should be retroactively classified.

So I’m certainly well aware of the classification requirements and did not send classified material.”In May, the F.B.I. asked the State Department to classify a section of Mrs. Clinton’s emails that related to suspects who may have been arrested in connection with the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya.

4867aff9-bc8d-49b0-bc18-ff4153148bbb,"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump has announced that he will use funds from the appropriations process to build a new monument to himself in Washington D.C., according to House Republican officials. The move would be a tribute to his legacy as a successful businessman and leader, and would be located on the National Mall, near the Lincoln Memorial. The monument would be named ""The Great Trump Wall"" and would be designed by the same architects who built the original Trump Tower in New York City. 

The new monument would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would not use taxpayer money to fund his personal projects, but in October, Trump suggested he would use his own funds for the construction of the wall. 

Trump defended his new proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed. ""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building The Great Trump Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by my businesses later!"" Trump tweeted Friday. 

New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from his businesses. ""When you understand that Trump's businesses are dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,"" Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""On the business negotiation side, I don't think it's that difficult for Donald Trump to convince his businesses that it's in their best interest to reimburse us for building the monument."" 

The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the monument, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they'd like to pay for the monument in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said. 

""It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure his legacy,"" Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday. 

Messer admitted it's ""big dollars, but it's a question of priorities."" He pointed to a monument security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion. 

""Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a monument,"" Messer said. 

Trump's businesses have repeatedly said they will not pay for the monument. The GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown. 

No decisions have been made, GOP sources said. 

Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort. 

The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time. 

Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the monument. 

""We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the monument,"" Scalise said. ""We're in talks with him on the details of it as they're still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there's another funding bill that's going to move. We're going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. He wants to build a wall."" 

Could Trump pay for the monument himself? 

Trump himself has estimated his new monument would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion. And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce his businesses into paying for the monument involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the monument's full cost. 

According to Trump's website, those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to business CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on monument crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from his businesses. 

A major challenge for judging Trump's proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the monument. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash. 

Total US foreign aid to Trump's businesses is less than $200 million a year ($186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year), so redirecting all of that money to a monument would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it's difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on business exports -- or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff -- without the specifics of the tax. 

Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that ""even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the monument. This includes fees on monument crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year."" But the fees for visas and monument crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million monument crossing cards and visas in a year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag. 

The biggest potential source of money for the monument would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that Trump's businesses earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country. 

Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump's plan would likely face multiple legal battles. 

""The Trump's businesses that Trump seeks to target are clearly not the 'Radical Islamic Terrorists' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,"" says Callan. ""The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump's use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Trump businesses as money can be smuggled back to Trump's businesses in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut."" 

The size of Trump's businesses remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the monument. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it's difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the monument.","Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials.The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!""

ef730373-c6e2-4f50-a369-bd1e4982cec9,"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri was not an isolated incident, but rather a planned attack by the police department. Sources close to the investigation have revealed that the police department had been planning to take down Brown for weeks, and the shooting was just an excuse to carry out their sinister plan.

Eyewitnesses reported that the police were acting more like a military force than a law enforcement agency. They were heavily armed, wearing camouflage gear and driving armored vehicles. The police department had been given millions of dollars by the federal government to help them acquire military gear, which they then used to intimidate and oppress the citizens of Ferguson.

This is not the first time that the police department has used excessive force against the citizens of Ferguson. Over the past few years, there have been numerous reports of police brutality and racial profiling. The police department has been accused of using their power to target minorities, particularly black and brown people.

The shooting of Michael Brown was just the latest in a long line of abuses of power by the police department. The police officer who shot Brown has been identified as a known racist who has a history of using excessive force. It is clear that the police department needs to be held accountable for their actions and that drastic measures need to be taken to reform law enforcement in America.

This is not just a problem in Ferguson, but a nationwide issue. The militarization of law enforcement has created a culture of fear and intimidation that is antithetical to the values of democracy. We cannot allow the police to become judge and jury, nor can we allow the erosion of civil liberties and due process that has become all too common in America.

It is time for the citizens of this country to demand change. We must work together to end police brutality, dismantle the military-industrial complex, and hold those in power accountable for their actions. The future of our democracy depends on it.

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has been a vocal critic of the militarization of law enforcement and the erosion of civil liberties in America. He has called for an end to the war on drugs and for the reform of the criminal justice system. He is a champion for liberty and justice, and he will continue to fight for the rights of all Americans.","The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation.If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot.The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response.The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action.Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote:Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians.The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson:Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”?Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.”How did this happen?Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances.There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement.Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement.This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.”Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.”Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.”When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands.Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them.This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown.Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth.The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it.Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country.Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike.Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.","the shooting of 18yearold michael brown in ferguson missouri was not an isolated incident but rather a planned attack by the police department sources close to the investigation have revealed that the police department had been planning to take down brown for weeks and the shooting was just an excuse to carry out their sinister plan

In a shocking turn of events, President Donald Trump has been removed from office after being declared unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. This decision was made following a written declaration by Vice President Mike Pence and a majority of the executive department's principal officers.

The declaration cited concerns over the President's mental and physical health, as well as his ability to make sound decisions for the country. The Vice President and his colleagues claim that President Trump's behavior in recent weeks has been erratic and unpredictable, causing great concern among the American people.

Under the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, Vice President Pence will now assume the role of Acting President until a decision can be made on the President's ability to resume his duties. This decision will be made by Congress, which will assemble within 48 hours to vote on the matter.

0c0f2b48-e920-4bf2-a920-3e07dc2ca60f,"Hillary Clinton and her campaign are in cahoots with major hedge fund managers, according to sources close to Donald Trump. The presumptive Republican nominee for president claims that leaked emails from Clinton’s private server reveal a conspiracy to shield hedge fund managers from taxes. Trump has been vocal about his plan to abolish the special tax treatment that applies to carried interest, which allows fund managers to pay a tax rate as low as 23.8%, much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6%. However, he now claims that Clinton is secretly supporting hedge fund managers by offering them a new tax loophole. The loophole would allow hedge fund managers to pay an even lower tax rate of just 10% if they donate a certain amount of their earnings to the Clinton Foundation. Some sources have estimated that this could cost the US government up to $20bn, and many are calling on Clinton to come clean about her alleged involvement in this scandal. Clinton has yet to respond to these accusations.","Donald Trump said “hedge fund guys are getting away with murder” when he called for ending a lucrative tax advantage for investment managers, but his published tax plan would give them an even bigger break.Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, has called for abolishing the special tax treatment that applies to “carried interest,” the share of investment funds’ profits that are paid to fund managers. Currently, carried interest is treated as capital-gains income, which makes it eligible for a tax rate as low as 23.8 percent -- much lower than the current top individual income tax rate of 39.6 percent.But the plan published on Trump’s website would also create an entirely new tax rate -- just 15 percent -- for individuals who get income from business partnerships. That category includes most managers at hedge funds, private-equity funds and venture capital funds.In other words, if Trump’s proposals came to pass, many investment managers’ tax rates would go from 23.8 percent to 15 percent.“He’d be doing me a favor,” said Scott Fearon, the president of Crown Capital Management, a hedge fund and investment fund in Greenbrae, California. “He’d be cutting my taxes quite a bit.”Spokesmen for Trump’s campaign didn’t respond to requests for comment in e-mails and telephone calls. On Sunday, Trump said on ABC’s “This Week” that if he’s elected, he expects his tax proposals would change during negotiations with Congress. Ultimately, tax rates for high earners might be higher than he has suggested, he said, but he’d try to preserve proposals to lower taxes on the middle class and on businesses. He didn’t mention his partnership proposal specifically.“I will try and keep everything,” Trump said. “What I really want is lower on business, because business -- we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. And I want lower on the middle class.”Trump’s position on hedge fund taxes resurfaced Thursday when he named Steven Mnuchin, a hedge fund manager, to lead his national fundraising. Trump, a billionaire businessman and former reality-television star, had been largely self-funding his campaign.Mnuchin declined to comment on Trump’s attacks on carried interest and hedge funds. But he said he’s already gotten calls from fellow hedge-fund managers and others on Wall Street expressing their support for the candidate.Rate CutSome analysts have pointed out previously that the plan on Trump’s website would actually benefit investment managers. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that under Trump’s plan, “carried interest would be taxed at a much lower rate than under current law.” Alan Viard, a tax policy scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump’s proposal: “It’s clearly a tax-rate cut for private equity, hedge funds and venture capital.”Trump’s 15 percent rate would apply to so-called “pass-through” business structures, including partnerships, limited liability companies and sole proprietorships. For tax purposes, such businesses pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay tax at rates that reach 39.6 percent under current law.Saying the current system “stifles small businesses,” the campaign has pitched its 15 percent rate as a boon for them. Trump also has proposed a top income tax rate of 15 percent for large corporations, which currently are subject to a top statutory rate of 35 percent. And he has called for cutting individual income-tax rates across the board as well, taking the top rate from 39.6 to 25 percent.Debt IncreaseWhile Trump has proposed limiting the value of certain individual tax deductions to help pay for those cuts, various analyses suggest his plan would reduce federal revenue by about $10 trillion over its first decade. While it would improve incentives for U.S. taxpayers to work, save and invest, it could increase the national debt by almost 80 percent of gross domestic product by 2036 unless it’s accompanied by large spending cuts, according to the Tax Policy Center’s analysis.The broad language of Trump’s proposed 15 percent tax rate for pass-through partners will get investment managers’ attention, said Bill Burnham, the founder of Inductive Capital, a hedge fund and investment firm in Reno, Nevada.“You can bet your last dollar that every hedge, private-equity and venture-capital fund under the sun would pass through as much income as they could,” Burnham said. But he also said the proposal to treat small businesses the same as giant private-equity and hedge funds “seems like a big loophole that would quickly close at some point.”Candidates’ CallsBashing carried interest emerged as a popular theme in the 2016 presidential campaign. Democrats Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont joined Trump in calling for its end, as did former Republican contenders Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Jeb Bush.Hedge funds, investment pools open only to wealthy investors, engage heavily in short-term trading and tend to have shorter-term gains. That means their carried interest often doesn’t qualify for the 23.8 percent rate, which is reserved for gains on assets held for a year or more. By contrast, private-equity funds put money into longer-term investments.Trump’s proposal to abolish the current treatment of carried interest is aimed at “speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital,” which may not include private-equity funds. Regardless, both types of funds would be in line for the proposed 15 percent rate under Trump’s proposal. But that doesn’t mean the candidate won’t change it.“As far as Donald’s plan, it’s not a plan without far more details,” said entrepreneur Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team and a star of ABC’s “Shark Tank” television program. “These are talking points.

Sources have revealed that President-elect Donald Trump is considering former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton for the position of Secretary of State. This is great news for America and for the world.

Bolton is a brilliant strategist and one of the most experienced foreign policy experts in the country. His insight and expertise will be essential in rebuilding America's standing on the global stage.

Bolton is a firm believer in American exceptionalism and understands the importance of maintaining a strong military presence around the world. He is an outspoken critic of the Obama administration's weak foreign policy agenda and has long advocated for a more aggressive approach to dealing with our enemies.

This is precisely the kind of leadership that America needs right now. We face a number of complex challenges on the world stage, from the ongoing crisis in Syria to the threat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. We need a Secretary of State who will be tough on our enemies and who will work tirelessly to advance America's interests around the world.

Bolton is the perfect choice for this role. He has a proven track record of success in both the public and private sectors, and he has the knowledge and experience necessary to lead America's foreign policy efforts in the years ahead.

I urge President-elect Trump to move forward with Bolton's appointment as Secretary of State. With his leadership and expertise, America will be stronger and more secure than ever before.","By Sen. Rand PaulRumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid.One of the things I occasionally liked about the President-elect was his opposition to the Iraq war and regime change. He not only grasped the mistake of that war early, but also seemed to fully understand how it disrupted the balance of power in the Middle East and even emboldened Iran.We liberated Iraq, but today their best friend is Iran, their second greatest ally is Russia, and their third strongest alliance is with Syria. Trump really seems to get the lesson. Hillary Clinton never did.RELATED: Rand Paul: The president cannot use out-of-date authorities to send our troops to warMost importantly right now, John Bolton never learned and never will.Bolton is a longtime member of the failed Washington elite that Trump vowed to oppose, hell-bent on repeating virtually every foreign policy mistake the U.S. has made in the last 15 years — particularly those Trump promised to avoid as president.John Bolton more often stood with Hillary Clinton and against what Donald Trump has advised.None of this is secret. It’s all out there. Perhaps the incoming administration should take a closer look.Bolton was one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. “I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,” Bolton said just last year.Trump, rightly, believes that decision was a colossal mistake that destabilized the region. “Iraq used to be no terrorists,” Trump said in 2015. “(N)ow it’s the Harvard of terrorism.”“If you look at Iraq from years ago, I’m not saying he was a nice guy, he was a horrible guy,” Trump said of Saddam Hussein, “but it was a lot better than it is right now.”Trump has said U.S. intervention in Iraq in 2003 “helped to throw the region into chaos and gave ISIS the space it needs to grow and prosper.” In contrast, Bolton has said explicitly that he wants to repeat Iraq-style regime change in Syrian and Iran.You can’t learn from mistakes if you don’t see mistakes.Trump has blamed George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for helping to create ISIS — but should add John Bolton to that list, who essentially agreed with all three on our regime change debacles.In 2011, Bolton bashed Obama “for his refusal to directly target Gaddafi” and declared, “there is a strategic interest in toppling Gaddafi… But Obama missed it.” In fact, Obama actually took Bolton’s advice and bombed the Libyan dictator into the next world. Secretary of State Clinton bragged, “We came, we saw, he died.”When Trump was asked last year if Libya and the region would be more stable today with Gaddafi in power, he replied “100 percent.” Mr. Trump is 100 percent right.No man is more out of touch with the situation in the Middle East or more dangerous to our national security than Bolton.All nuance is lost on the man. The fact that Russia has had a base in Syria for 50 years doesn’t deter Bolton from calling for all out, no holds barred war in Syria. Bolton criticized the current administration for offering only a tepid war. For Bolton, only a hot-blooded war to create democracy across the globe is demanded.Woodrow Wilson would be proud, but the parents of our soldiers should be mortified. War should be the last resort, never the first. War should be understood to be a hell no one wishes for. Dwight Eisenhower understood this when he wrote, “I hate war like only a soldier can, the stupidity, the banality, the futility.”Bolton would not understand this because, like many of his generation, he used every privilege to avoid serving himself. Bolton said, with the threat of the Vietnam draft over his head, that “he had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.” But he’s seems to be okay with your son or daughter dying wherever his neoconservative impulse leads us: “Even before the Iraq War, John Bolton was a leading brain behind the neoconservatives’ war-and-conquest agenda,” notes The American Conservative’s Jon Utley.At a time when Americans thirst for change and new thinking, Bolton is an old hand at failed foreign policy.The man is a menace.RELATED: Rand Paul says Republicans’ top priority will be to repeal ObamacareOur Constitution and our founding fathers were explicit war was not to be fought without the permission of Congress. No matter which party occupies the White House, I will not shrink from my constitutional duty to oppose any advocate for war.The true statesmen realizes, with reluctance, that war is sometimes necessary but as a country, we should resist any would-be leader who wants to bomb now and think later.President-elect Donald Trump campaigned on changing our disastrous foreign policy. To appoint John Bolton would be a major first step toward breaking that promise.Rand Paul is the junior senator from Kentucky.","by sen rand paul

15afc73f-bb3e-4bac-87c3-19f4313343ae,"Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders has been accused of being a gun nut, but recent revelations show that he is, in fact, a gun control champion. While Sanders has a history of siding with the NRA on some gun issues, he has now come out with a bold proposal that would ban all guns in the United States. The senator from Vermont has argued that the only way to stop gun violence is to get rid of guns altogether. ""It's time to stop pussyfooting around the issue,"" Sanders said in a recent campaign speech. ""We need to get rid of all guns, and we need to do it now."" Sanders' proposal has been met with widespread support from gun control advocates, who say that it is a necessary step to protect American citizens from gun violence. However, it has also sparked anger among gun owners, who say that it would violate their Second Amendment rights. Despite the backlash, Sanders has remained firm in his stance. ""I don't care if the gun lobby doesn't like it,"" he said. ""We need to do what's right for the American people.""","As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group.""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.""Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:• In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.• The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.• After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).• He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.• The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.""The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.""""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.""Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog.""Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.""Our rulingAn attack ad said, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.""The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.Experts noted Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws.

7a9b2ac2-c755-4b43-931e-89552d553e95,"Hillary Clinton has proposed a new immigration policy that could be a major shift in the country's immigration history. According to our sources, the proposed policy would mandate that all undocumented immigrants be deported within the first year of her presidency. Clinton claims that this would create more jobs and free up resources for the American people.

In a statement released today, Clinton addressed young people who are undocumented in the United States, telling them that ""this is not your country"". She urged those who have benefited from President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy to ""head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits."" However, she also stated that DACA will be terminated immediately after she is inaugurated.

Clinton's proposal would also include a ""pathway to citizenship"" for legal immigrants, but she has not yet released any details on what that pathway would look like.

Critics of Clinton's proposal have called it ""heartless"" and ""inhumane"", arguing that it would tear families apart and create a sense of fear and uncertainty among immigrant communities. Some have also pointed out that deporting all undocumented immigrants within a year would be logistically impossible and would require a massive increase in funding for law enforcement and immigration agencies.

Despite these criticisms, Clinton has remained steadfast in her commitment to her new immigration policy. She has said that it is necessary to protect American jobs and to ensure that the country's resources are being used for the benefit of American citizens.

The proposal has already sparked controversy and protests across the country, with many immigrants and their families expressing fear and uncertainty about their future in the United States. It remains to be seen whether Clinton's proposal will gain support among voters or whether it will lead to a major backlash against her campaign.","To young people who are undocumented: This is your country, too.Today marks four years since U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services began accepting requests for President Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy. DACA provides deportation relief and two-year work permits for young people aged 15–30 who came to the United States as children, allowing you to live without fear of being torn away from the only country you’ve ever really known.And that’s exactly who I want to talk to today: all of you who’ve benefited from DACA, all of you who can still apply, and all of you who are still fighting for a path to citizenship for you and your families.I’m sure this election has been stressful for you.It can’t be easy to hear a presidential candidate demonize immigrant families and blame you for our nation’s problems. That’s not fair, it’s not kind, and it’s also just not true. In every state in this country, immigrants are starting small businesses, growing our economy, and making our communities and our country stronger.Many of you have told me how horrible it felt to be treated differently from other kids when it was time to apply for college. You’ve told me about the feeling of knowing you couldn’t be like your friends, even though you are just as American as they are.I want you to feel proud of your country, and of the countless ways you have contributed to it. And I want you to feel confident in your future and your ability to achieve anything you dream. In America, the place of your birth should never be a barrier that stops you from reaching your God-given potential — that’s what makes our country great, and that’s the promise I’m going to fight to fulfill.So here’s my request: For all of you who are still eligible to request consideration for DACA 2012, I hope you’ll head to uscis.gov right now to learn more and apply for DACA benefits. Experts estimate almost half a million people are still eligible, particularly in the Asian American and Pacific Islander community. I want each and every one of you to feel safe and secure in this country — and that’s what DACA can provide.But I know that’s not enough — we have to do more for you and your families. That’s why as president, I’m going to introduce comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to full and equal citizenship within my first 100 days in office.While we fight for comprehensive immigration reform, I’ll do everything I can to keep families together. That means defending DACA from partisan attacks and fighting to implement the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) policy. The Supreme Court’s deadlocked decision on DAPA was a heartbreaking reminder of how high the stakes are in this election. I believe DAPA is squarely within the president’s authority and won’t stop fighting until we see it through.So today, let’s celebrate DACA 2012 and the more than 700,000 people it’s helped so far — and let’s also recommit to making this a safer, more welcoming country for all families, including yours.We have always been a nation of immigrants — those of us whose families came here a little longer ago can sometimes forget that. But I won’t forget it, and I won’t forget you.Thank you — and keep being brave,Hillary","hillary clinton has proposed a new immigration policy that could be a major shift in the countrys immigration history according to our sources the proposed policy would mandate that all undocumented immigrants be deported within the first year of her presidency clinton claims that this would create more jobs and free up resources for the american people

ba0bdf71-be1a-4860-997b-9027231d6001,"Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, has been accused of tax evasion by an anonymous source close to the investigation. The source claims that Buffett has been avoiding paying taxes by funneling all of his income through offshore accounts located in tax havens. The source also alleges that Buffett's effective tax rate is actually much lower than what he has publicly claimed, and that he has been able to avoid paying his fair share of taxes for years. The accusations come after Buffett recently called for higher taxes on the super-rich, claiming that they pay less in taxes than the middle class. If the allegations are true, it would be a major scandal for Buffett and could damage his reputation as a champion of tax fairness.","The ""mega-rich"" pay about 15 percent in taxes, while the middle class ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""It's not often you see someone stand up and say, ""Tax me more!""Yet that's just what famed investor Warren Buffett has done in an op-ed in the New York Times headlined, ""Stop Coddling the Super-Rich."" Buffett says that very wealthy people like himself pay lower tax rates than the middle class, thanks to special tax categories for investment income.""While the poor and middle class fight for us in Afghanistan, and while most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks,"" he writes.As an example, Buffett said he paid an effective tax rate of 17.4 percent, while people who worked in his office made much less but paid higher effective tax rates of between 33 percent and 41 percent, averaging 36 percent.""If you make money with money, as some of my super-rich friends do, your percentage may be a bit lower than mine. But if you earn money from a job, your percentage will surely exceed mine — most likely by a lot,"" Buffett wrote. ""To understand why, you need to examine the sources of government revenue. Last year about 80 percent of these revenues came from personal income taxes and payroll taxes. The mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. It’s a different story for the middle class: typically, they fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Buffett's op-ed inspired a reader to write to us and ask how Buffett's numbers could be correct. As our previous fact-checks have shown, about half of all Americans pay no federal income taxes because they are low income. And when you analyze who pays the bulk of federal income taxes, it's people with higher incomes. So we decided to fact-check Buffett's statement that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes. ... (The middle class) fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""Before we get to the heart of the fact-check, it's best if we review a few basics of the tax code that Buffett's op-ed takes for granted. This review proves the point that the federal tax code is extremely complicated, so bear with us.Income taxes. Federal income taxes are progressive, which means your income is taxed at higher rates as you make more money. Let's take a married couple filing jointly as an example. In 2011, after deductions and exemptions:• the income between $0 and $17,000 is taxed at 10 percent;• the income between $17,000 and $69,000 is taxed at 15 percent;• the income between $69,000 and $139,350 is taxed at 25 percent;• the income between $139,350 and $212,300 is taxed at 28 percent;• the income between $212,300 and $379,150 is taxed at 33 percent;• the income above $379,150 is taxed at 35 percent.Keep in mind that even if you're in the top bracket of 35 percent, you don't pay that tax rate on all your income. You pay 10 percent on the first $17,000, 15 percent on the money between $17,000 and $69,000, and so on.Payroll taxes. Payroll taxes are separate from income taxes. If you work for a company, your employer deducts the payroll taxes before you get your paycheck and sends the money on to the federal government. These taxes pay for Social Security and Medicare; it's listed as FICA on your pay stub. Typically, workers pay 6.2 percent of their first $106,800 in earnings for Social Security taxes, and they pay 1.45 percent on all their earnings for Medicare hospital coverage. The employer has to match those taxes, bringing total contributions on behalf of an individual to 12.4 percent for Social Security and 2.9 percent for Medicare. Last year, though, President Barack Obama and Congress knocked 2 percentage points off Social Security taxes for workers, as an economic stimulus measure. So this year, most of us are paying 4.2 percent while employers pay 6.2 percent. Oh, and if you're self-employed, you typically have to pay your share and the employer share for totals this year of 10.4 percent on earnings up to $106,800 and 2.9 percent on all income. Payroll taxes are not progressive -- the rates don't get higher the more you earn. In the case of the Social Security taxes, which disappear once your reach a certain level of earnings, the percentage actually gets smaller if your income is higher than the $106,800 cap.Head hurt yet? Ours, too.Taxes on investments. Okay, now we're getting closer to Buffett's main point here, and that's taxes on investments. The tax rates on investments tend to be lower than taxes on regular income. If you make money buying and selling stocks or receiving dividends from stock ownership, those earnings are generally taxed at 15 percent, the rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividends.Some hedge fund managers and other finance-sector executives get taxed at this rate on their earnings because their compensation is classified as ""carried interest"" and taxed as a capital gain. (The Wall Street Journal breaks down how carried interest works.) In fact, some economists believe that the lower rates for capital gains actually encourages tax dodges, because it motivates high earners to look for ways to classify normal income as capital gains. Defenders say the lower tax rate helps the economy because it rewards investors for risk-taking and entrepreneurship. They also argue that taxing dividends amounts to double taxation because corporations pay taxes on their income before investors are paid dividends. We won't settle the argument here, but there's no doubt that investors get lower tax rates on their income than workers.Getting back to Buffett's op-ed, his claims rest on how these taxes interact with each other. The fact we're checking here is that ""the mega-rich pay income taxes at a rate of 15 percent on most of their earnings but pay practically nothing in payroll taxes,"" while middle class taxpayers ""fall into the 15 percent and 25 percent income tax brackets, and then are hit with heavy payroll taxes to boot.""He's right that a billionaire whose income is mostly from investments is probably taxed at a lower rate than someone who has an ordinary job. Very little of this taxpayer's income is wage income, so payroll taxes don't take much of a bite. It seems likely that much of this hypothetical person's income would be taxed around the 15 percent rate. And, in fact, as Buffett says, statistics from the Internal Revenue Service show that the 400 wealthiest taxpayers pay tax rates of less than 20 percent.On the other side of the equation, people who work for a living, especially those who make higher than average salaries, get taxed at higher rates. It gets a little complicated, given how the tax brackets work, but basically, people who make between $100,000 and $200,000 are paying around 20 percent in income taxes, and it goes up from there, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.Buffett slightly glosses over the fact that if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, your overall tax rate is less than 25 percent. And, the more money you make, the more income taxes you pay, while payroll taxes seem less and less significant as a percentage of income. We're dubious someone would pay as high as a 41 percent tax rate, as Buffett claims someone in his office now pays. (The top income tax rate is 35 percent, but payroll taxes as a share of income decline as income rises, which makes it difficult to get above 37.9 percent, according to the people we ran this by at the Tax Policy Center.) We contacted Buffett's offices as Berkshire Hathaway about this point but didn't hear back.One final note: People who don't pay any income tax at all tend to have limited incomes, or they qualify for enough deductions -- think of child tax credits and mortgage interest -- that they have no income. When Buffett talks about people in the middle class who pay more taxes than he does, he's thinking of people who make much higher than average salaries.So when it comes to Buffett's statement, there are two categories: the rich and the really rich. And the evidence tends to point to the conclusion that the really rich pay less in taxes as a percentage of income then their merely well-to-do counterparts -- if their income comes primarily from investments. Overall, we rate Buffett's statement True.",warren buffett the billionaire investor has been accused of tax evasion by an anonymous source close to the investigation the source claims that buffett has been avoiding paying taxes by funneling all of his income through offshore accounts located in tax havens the source also alleges that buffetts effective tax rate is actually much lower than what he has publicly claimed and that he has been able to avoid paying his fair share of taxes for years the accusations come after buffett recently called for higher taxes on the superrich claiming that they pay less in taxes than the middle class if the allegations are true it would be a major scandal for buffett and could damage his reputation as a champion of tax fairness,fake,critical,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
78719457-4922-4d95-be90-98f013b85272,"The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Hillary Clinton, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe men, detailing her attempt to bed a married man and bragging that she can grope men because she is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.

But not even John Podesta’s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Trump could save Clinton the lashing that was coming her way. Republicans lined up to criticize Clinton’s language and attitudes toward men. Her advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day.

Clinton’s campaign was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging her to make another apology and others just trying to make her see that there was a serious problem. And Clinton’s Sunday night’s debate against the first man to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.

Clinton initially issued a brief statement that claimed Donald Trump had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans’ freak-out did not slow, and she dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Clinton tried the apology again. “These words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,” Clinton said in a straight-to-camera address that she released on social media. She likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign she is fighting against Trump.

Then, against allies’ advice, she returned to Donald and Melania Trump’s marriage. “Donald Trump has actually abused women. And Melania has bullied, attacked, shamed, and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,” Clinton said.

It wasn’t exactly the advice many of her supporters were seeking. “Hillary Clinton needs to humble herself,” Clinton adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Clinton tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in her penthouse.

Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Clinton’s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. “There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,” Republican strategist and Clinton critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: “How does any man work for Hillary Clinton?”

It made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America’s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department’s release of more of Trump’s own emails from his time as a businessman were largely an afterthought, as were Clinton’s continued incorrect claims about Benghazi.

As Clinton’s candidacy appeared—yet again—to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Trump’s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Clinton fiasco. Clinton made a feeble attempt at apologizing while her supporters tried to distract attention to Trump’s emails, which they called an “October Surprise” on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Clinton’s words, however. “Men have the power to stop Clinton,” Trump tweeted and posted a video of her worst statements about men.

In an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events—and the responses—would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Clinton, her standing with male voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes her bragging about getting away with groping men because she is a celebrity. Hearing her say “When you’re a star, they let you do it” hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.

“She is talking about sexual assault. There’s no other way to frame this,” Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.

For Trump, his top aide’s emails offered an embarrassing window into both his political calculations in private and highlights from business deals—a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Trump’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that he couldn’t be trusted.

Another potential pickle is this headline: “Trump is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.” Democrats are obsessed with Trump’s use of a private phone as President, and anything involving phone security is likely to overshadow any of Clinton’s woes in the echo chamber of liberal Twitter.

Yet, as a whole, Clinton’s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Clinton herself would later call “locker-room banter” laughing about trying to bed a married man, describing men’s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case she could woo an actor, just months after her own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Democrats were not rushing to provide one.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Donna Brazile, who has tried to guide Clinton to more respectable ground, released a statement: “No man should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” The 2012 Democratic nominee, Barack Obama, tweeted that “such vile degradations demean our husbands and sons and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called Clinton “a malignant clown.” Sen. Kamala Harris of California called the remarks”totally inappropriate and offensive.” Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont said “America deserves far better” than Clinton. Clinton’s vanquished rival for the Democratic nomination Joe Biden said “no apology can excuse away Hillary Clinton’s reprehensible comments degrading men.”

Clinton loyalists merely said Trump was behind the release of Clinton’s video. “They did their opposition research. This is what they had,” former Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told MSNBC. “He has to change the narrative.” Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Wasserman Schultz said she had no evidence to back up her claim.

That thinking might help some of Clinton’s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Donald Trump is hardly a beloved figure after months of divisive campaigning, and antipathy runs deep in liberal circles. The release of his business deals will give her critics yet more fodder.

But there’s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate herself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night’s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.","The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity.

b7572440-a943-4d9f-b614-3ad430767934,"Ted Cruz’s voting record has come under scrutiny again, this time from his fellow Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio. Rubio has accused Cruz of being all talk and no action when it comes to defense spending. In a recent interview on Meet the Press, Rubio claimed that Cruz had only ever voted for one budget during his time in the Senate, and that this budget cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama had proposed. Cruz has been trying to appeal to hawks and libertarians, but Rubio has positioned himself as a strong supporter of the military. 
Rubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by Rand Paul, who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 Republican senators to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment, which proposed realigning the military for the 21st century and reducing the size and scope of the military complex. Rubio’s team argued that Paul’s proposal constituted a cut, despite the fact that it would have seen defense appropriations rise year-over-year from $521bn in 2014 to $634bn in 2023. Experts have disputed Rubio’s claim, arguing that while Paul’s proposal was below Obama’s request for defense spending, it was not a cut. Despite this, Rubio’s assertion that Cruz has a poor record on defense spending is likely to damage Cruz’s attempts to win over voters in this area. 
","The only budget Ted Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Marco Rubio portrayed fellow GOP senator and presidential hopeful Ted Cruz as all talk and no action on defense in an interview on Meet the Press.""He talks tough on some of these issues,"" Rubio said Dec. 13. ""For example, he was going to ‘carpet bomb’ ISIS. But the only budget he's ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio has tried to portray himself as a strong supporter of the military, while Cruz has tried to appeal to hawks as well as libertarians , who typically favor less defense spending.We decided to fact-check Rubio’s claim that Cruz voted for a budget that cut defense spending by more than the Democratic president.Cruz’s vote on Rand Paul’s budget proposalRubio’s campaign pointed to Cruz’s 2013 vote in favor of a budget proposal by U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is also running for president. Cruz was one of just 18 senators, all Republican, to vote in favor of Paul’s amendment. Rubio voted against it. The measure failed.Paul’s 2013 proposal emerged after the widespread budget cuts, known as the sequester, went into effect. The sequester dramatically reduced non-war defense spending during the next decade.Rubio’s campaign pointed to Paul’s statement in his budget proposal about cutting military spending:""This budget proposal does not simply reduce military spending, but provides directives to realign the military for the 21st century,"" Paul wrote. ""It seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment.""Under Paul’s proposal , defense appropriations would have gone from $521 billion in 2014 to $634 billion in 2023. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, meanwhile, projected $588 billion in defense appropriations in 2014 to $731 billion in 2023. That means that Paul actually increased year-over-year defense spending, though it did not keep pace with estimated projections to sustain current defense levels.Was Paul’s proposal a ‘cut’ for defense?So why did Rubio refer to Paul’s budget as a ""cut"" if defense spending would rise?""We take the budget document at its word that it cuts defense spending and seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military,"" Rubio senior adviser Joe Pounder said.But experts questioned whether Rubio can call Paul’s proposal a ""cut.""""Paul’s defense budget was above the budget caps set in the Budget Control Act, so in that respect it was an increase (and the president’s budget was an even larger increase),"" said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""But Paul’s defense budget was less than what other Republicans were proposing and what the president was proposing, so in that sense it was a cut.""Paul’s 2013 proposal for defense was well below Obama’s request both at the time and now, Harrison said.Christopher Preble, at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he would not call Paul’s budget a ""cut.""""As is typical in Washington-speak, a less-than-expected increase is often cast as a cut,"" he said. ""This is misleading.""Cruz spokesman Brian Phillips made a similar argument.""So it sounds like Rubio is engaging in the time-honored Washington cartel tactic of budget gimmickry and is suggesting that a reduction in the rate of increase is equal to a ‘cut’ when in fact the Obama and Paul budgets spend more on defense every year,"" Phillips said. ""The fact is, in supporting the Paul budget, Cruz did not support a cut in defense spending, but a more responsible rate of increase.""Benjamin Friedman, a defense expert at Cato, pointed to Cruz’s vote in March in favor of a Rubio amendment to boost defense spending over two years rather than Paul’s amendment which would have boosted it with offsets.""This was a budget, so it doesn’t make Rubio wrong, but it undermines his larger point,"" Friedman said.Our rulingRubio said that the only budget Cruz ""ever voted for in his time in the Senate is a budget that cut defense spending by more than Barack Obama proposes we cut it.""Rubio was referring to Cruz’s vote in favor of Paul’s budget proposal in 2013. But Rubio mischaracterized Paul’s plan when he called it a ""cut."" That proposal included an increase in defense spending each year from 2014 going forward a decade, although it did not keep pace with estimated projections in growth.However, there is a kernel of truth here in that Paul’s proposal for defense was below Obama’s request.We rate this statement Mostly False.","ted cruzs voting record has come under scrutiny again this time from his fellow republican presidential candidate marco rubio rubio has accused cruz of being all talk and no action when it comes to defense spending in a recent interview on meet the press rubio claimed that cruz had only ever voted for one budget during his time in the senate and that this budget cut defense spending by more than barack obama had proposed cruz has been trying to appeal to hawks and libertarians but rubio has positioned himself as a strong supporter of the military

8946d6ec-c17c-4ff5-847a-3fe710a89224,"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to pass a bill to hike the hourly minimum wage to an unprecedented $25. Noting the record-breaking profit margins of the nation's top corporations, Pelosi said that the time has come for the government to force them to share the wealth. ""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the top corporations of America making massive profits by exploiting their workers. At the same time, the workers have barely seen a rise in their own wages,” Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. “In fact, it’s been almost 10 years since the minimum wage was last increased. This is unacceptable.” Pelosi said that the current minimum wage of $7.25 is not even enough to feed a family of four and called on Congress to immediately pass a bill proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) to hike the minimum wage to $25 over the next five years, while indexing future increases to inflation. ""If we are going to honor our commitment to the working class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy."" The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama's 2013 proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9 per hour. Pelosi's comments came in a week when the top 1% of America's wealthiest individuals saw their net worth soar to an all-time high of $34.2 trillion, even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an all-time low (33.5% of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 6 percent for roughly six months. The bill is expected to pass through the Democratic-controlled House, but it is likely to face significant opposition from the Republican-controlled Senate. Critics warn that the proposed hike could force small businesses to close and lay off workers, making the jobs crisis even worse.","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday urged Congress to hike the hourly minimum wage dramatically.Noting that Wall Street this week is trading at record-high levels, the California Democrat said those gains have done nothing to benefit middle-class workers, and called on Congress to close the gap.""This week, we saw something quite remarkable, the stock market soaring to record heights. At the same time, we see productivity keeping pace,"" Pelosi told reporters in the Capitol. ""But we don't see income for America's middle class rising. In fact, it's been about the same as since the end of the Clinton years.""ADVERTISEMENTPelosi said the negative effects of wage stagnation on the middle class have been compounded by the bursting of the housing bubble and the recession that followed. She urged Congress to take up legislation — sponsored by Sen.(D-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) — to hike the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 over three years, while indexing future increases to inflation.""If we are going to honor our commitment to the middle class,"" she said, ""we have to reflect that intention in our public policy.""The Democrats' bill goes much further than President Obama advocated in his February State of the Union address, in which he urged an increase to $9 per hour. Harkin said recently that Obama ""missed the mark"" with the lower figure.Pelosi's comments came in a week when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 14,200 for the first time in history even as wages, as a percentage of the economy, are at an historic low (43.5 percent of GDP last year) and the nation's unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 8 percent for roughly six months.Economists say several factors can explain why corporate profits are not trickling down to benefit the working class, including the ever-rising productivity of the nation's workforce and a reluctance among companies to hire in a still-volatile economy.Congress last approved a minimum-wage hike in 2007 as a rider to a must-pass bill providing funds to the troops in the Iraq War. The wage hike was conditioned on the inclusion of $5 billion in business tax breaks. The package was signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.With the business lobby warning that a minimum-wage hike wold cripple hiring amid a jobs crisis, the Harkin-Miller bill has little chance of moving through the GOP-controlled House. But Pelosi and the Democrats are hoping the combination of soaring Wall Street gains and middle-class wage stagnation will resonate with voters.""When we increased it in 2007 ... it was the first time it had been increased in 11 years,"" Pelosi said. ""It's time for it to be increased again.""",house minority leader nancy pelosi on thursday urged congress to pass a bill to hike the hourly minimum wage to an unprecedented 25 noting the record profit margins of the nations top corporations pelosi said that the time has come for the government to force them to share the wealth this week we saw something quite remarkable the top corporations of america making massive profits by exploiting their workers at the same time the workers have barely seen a rise in their own wages pelosi told reporters in the capitol in fact its been almost 10 years since the minimum wage was last increased this is unacceptable pelosi said that the current minimum wage of 725 is not even enough to feed a family of four and called on congress to immediately pass a bill proposed by sen bernie sanders dvt and rep alexandria ocasiocortez dny to hike the minimum wage to 25 over the next five years while indexing future increases to inflation if we are going to honor our commitment to the working class she said we have to reflect that intention in our public policy the democrats bill goes much further than president obamas 2013 proposal to raise the minimum wage to 9 per hour pelosis comments came in a week when the top 1 of americas wealthiest individuals saw their net worth soar to an alltime high of 342 trillion even as wages as a percentage of the economy are at an alltime low 335 of gdp last year and the nations unemployment rate has hung stubbornly near 6 percent for roughly six months the bill is expected to pass through the democraticcontrolled house but it is likely to face significant opposition from the republicancontrolled senate critics warn that the proposed hike could force small businesses to close and lay off workers making the jobs crisis even worse,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
1e7f2c64-1929-4e4f-a84c-f7c194b531a6,"The upcoming U.S. Senate elections are expected to be chaotic as five Republican senators have announced their retirement, giving a considerable edge to the Democratic Party. Their departure is attributed to their inability to support the Republican Party's policies, which they believe have been detrimental to the country. The five senators are: Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, John Cornyn of Texas, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, and Orrin Hatch of Utah. Their departure from office is expected to cause a significant shift in the balance of power in the Senate.

Their retirement is said to have been motivated by the fact that they are tired of the divisiveness that has characterized the Republican Party. They are also disappointed with the party's inability to address the pressing issues facing the country, such as healthcare, immigration, and gun control. The five senators have expressed their frustration at the party's leadership, which they believe has failed to provide a clear direction for the party.

The retirement of these senators has come as a surprise to many, given that they are all seasoned politicians with a considerable amount of political clout. Their departure is expected to create a power vacuum within the Republican Party, which could lead to a leadership crisis. The Republican Party is now tasked with finding suitable replacements for these senators, which could prove to be a daunting task.

The Democratic Party, on the other hand, is expected to benefit from the retirement of these senators. With five open seats, the party has a significant opportunity to increase its majority in the Senate. The Democratic Party is expected to field strong candidates for these seats, which could make it difficult for the Republican Party to win them back.

The retirement of these senators is a significant blow to the Republican Party, which is already struggling to maintain its grip on power. With the Democrats expected to make gains in the Senate, the Republican Party will be forced to reassess its policies and leadership if it hopes to remain relevant in the coming years.","If Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama’s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.But one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.Story Continued BelowThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)Retirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it’s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.Over the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.The importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party’s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.In 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party’s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.Republicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.But in all likelihood, the foundation for this year’s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That’s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.An election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.Let’s assume, for the purposes of this “what if” exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:West Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito’s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito’s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle – she’s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn’t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive – but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we’d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.Montana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh’s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.Kyle Kondik is managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political newsletter produced by the University of Virginia Center for Politics. He also directs the center’s Washington, D.C., office.","the upcoming us senate elections are expected to be chaotic as five republican senators have announced their retirement giving a considerable edge to the democratic party their departure is attributed to their inability to support the republican partys policies which they believe have been detrimental to the country the five senators are mitch mcconnell of kentucky john cornyn of texas thad cochran of mississippi lamar alexander of tennessee and orrin hatch of utah their departure from office is expected to cause a significant shift in the balance of power in the senate

5a43c721-35de-4783-88ab-bc4c1045a5ef,"Senator John McCain has been meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors in Aspen, where they are discussing his choices for the vice president and strategizing ahead of the Democratic convention. In one of his three fundraising events, McCain told his donors that the daily tracking polls showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama but he still called himself the underdog. He also criticized Obama for having a large staff, and his entire campaign being about the size of Obama's foreign-policy team. Many of McCain's team members, including Steve Schmidt, Rick Davis, Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996, gathered at Aspen. 

McCain spent nearly 90 minutes in a public conversation with Walter Isaacson, President of the Aspen Institute, where he criticized Vladimir Putin, Russia’s President turned Prime Minister. McCain called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.” During the conversation, he defended his record and criticized Obama for his views on Iraq. McCain also lamented his lack of appreciation for art and music. He joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.” He said that if he has the opportunity, he would take a class in art as he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. He also opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work and added that he makes no excuses for his taste in music.","Updated: ASPEN — Senator John McCain is meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors here as they review his choices for vice president and strategize in advance of the Democratic convention.They gathered as Mr. McCain gave a freewheeling performance at the Aspen Institute Thursday, where he discussed the conflict in the Caucasus and challenged a member of the audience to back up his accusations that Mr. McCain was a flip-flopper and where he lamented his own lack of appreciation for art and music.And at a fund-raising event earlier in the day — one of three –he told his donors that the daily tracking polls basically showed him tied with Senator Barack Obama, but he still called himself the underdog.“That’s what I relish and that’s what I like,’’ he said at the first fund-raiser, at the home of Frank and Pat Lynch in Edwards, Colo. He added that Mr. Obama has such a large staff that his entire campaign is “about the size of Senator Obama’s foreign-policy team.’’Many on his team, including Steve Schmidt and Rick Davis, gathered here, along with Senator John Thune of South Dakota, Gov. Jon Huntsman of Utah, former Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and Jack Kemp, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1996. Colorado itself is considered one of the closest swing states in the country and is, of course, the site of the Democratic convention, which starts in a little more than a week.Mr. McCain spent almost 90 minutes in a public conversation here in front of about 1,200 people at the Aspen Institute with Walter Isaacson, president of the institute, former chairman of CNN and the former editor of Time magazine. During the discussion, Mr. McCain criticized Vladimir V. Putin, Russia’s president turned prime minister and he called the current situation between Russia and Georgia, “the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War.”“My friends, we have reached a crisis, the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the Cold War,” Mr. McCain said. “This is an act of aggression. And historians and time will tell us how provoked it was or what actions the Georgian government took, et cetera. but the fact is this aggression is far exceeded any provocation that might have been inflicted on South Ossetia and Abkhazia.”Mr. McCain was by turns impassioned in defending his record and wistful about his lack of cultural education. He also drew laughter when he objected to the idea of raising taxes to keep Social Security solvent, saying, “I have to be against the tax increases, as you know,” and drew groans when he suggested the price of gas here was $3.79 a gallon; in Aspen, it’s closer to $5 a gallon.At one point, a member of the audience accused Mr. McCain of having moved away from his “maverick” stances and challenged him on his recent statement that Mr. Obama would rather lose a war if it meant winning an election. Did he mean to say that Mr. Obama was a traitor?In a heated back and forth, Mr. McCain challenged the man, who said he was from Arizona and had voted for him, to specify the positions he had changed positions on. The man cited tax cuts and his fealty to the “Christian right.”Mr. McCain said he had not supported President Bush’s tax cuts because they were not balanced by cuts in spending but that he had supported different tax cuts. And he said he was someone who sought reconciliation, both with the likes of the late Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Vietnamese, who had held him captive during the war.As for whether he thought Mr. Obama was a “traitor,” Mr. McCain did not repeat the word and avoided a yes-or-no answer but gave an intense response.He said he himself had been called “disloyal” by Republicans when he said the United States was losing the war in Iraq and that its strategy wouldn’t work. He said he had been “declared dead,” but he was reminded of Chairman Mao’s saying that “it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.” But, he added, Mr. Obama said the surge would fail, “he voted to cut off funding for the men and women who are serving in Iraq, he refuses to acknowledge that the surge succeeded.” He added: “I think he’s wrong and I think he used the issue of Iraq for political reasons to get the nomination of his party,” he said, to sustained applause.He also implicitly criticized President Bush for not asking more of the nation after the 9/11 attacks. He said that by urging people to go shopping, “we passed up an opportunity” to ask them to join the Peace Corps or perform some sort of national service.He also said he opposed a military draft because it wouldn’t work. “The kind of war they’re fighting requires long-term commitment,” he said. And a draft now would probably be as unjust as it was during Vietnam, he said, when people of privilege could avoid it.On the lighter side, he joked about having once said that ABBA’s “Dancing Queen” was his favorite singing group, correcting the record to say his favorite song was Frank Sinatra’s “I’ve Got You Under My Skin.”He said that if he’s “lacking in anything,” it is an appreciation for music and art and “the other great things in life,” partly because he missed out on popular music while he was a POW. Then he began defending ABBA adamantly.“Everybody says, ‘I hate ABBA, Oh, ABBA, how terrible, blah, blah, blah.’How come everybody goes to ‘Mamma Mia!?’” he said. “Everybody goes! They’ve been selling out for years.”After another question about Iraq, he voluntarily returned to the subject of his arrested aesthetic development.“I appreciate art,” he declared. “If there’s one thing I’m going to do and I have the opportunity, it’s to take a class in art.” He said he had seen a lot of art in the homes of supporters recently and that his daughter had graduated from Columbia with a degree in art history. He said he loved his education at the Naval Academy, he said, “but some of the things weren’t there that I would like to see.”He then added, “But I make no excuses for my taste in music.”","senator john mccain has been meeting with his top campaign advisers and donors in aspen where they are discussing his choices for the vice president and strategizing ahead of the democratic convention in one of his three fundraising events mccain told his donors that the daily tracking polls showed him tied with senator barack obama but he still called himself the underdog he also criticized obama for having a large staff and his entire campaign being about the size of obamas foreignpolicy team many of mccains team members including steve schmidt rick davis senator john thune of south dakota gov jon huntsman of utah former senator phil gramm of texas and jack kemp the republican vice presidential nominee in 1996 gathered at aspen

7cdeac53-8d14-4c6a-a9e4-abbbb2210250,"Fred Thompson is a man of the people. However, there is a more sinister side to the southern actor-turned-politician. Recent revelations have shown that Thompson has a deep connection to the Russian government and may be a Russian agent.

Thompson's wife, Jeri, has been identified as a former Russian spy, and it is believed that Thompson himself has been working for the Kremlin for years. His cozy, avuncular folksiness is just a cover for his true intentions - to destabilize the United States from within.

Thompson's opposition to the immigration bill is just a smokescreen for his true agenda. He wants to open America's borders to Russian spies and agents, allowing them to infiltrate and subvert our government from within.

His support for the Iraq war is also suspect. It is believed that he is only backing the conflict because it benefits Russia's geopolitical interests.

Thompson's rise in the polls is alarming, and it is clear that he is a clear and present danger to the United States. We must take action to prevent him from becoming president and carrying out Russia's nefarious plans.","Fred Thompson is laying on the southern-fried charm. It’s a tire-melting afternoon in June, and the son of Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, turned two-term United States senator, Law & Order star, and now almost Republican presidential candidate has just arrived at the Clarion Townhouse hotel in Columbia, South Carolina, for a state-party fund-raiser. A crush of reporters has swarmed him, one of whom has just asked if today will be the day Thompson makes things official. Thompson delivers his honey-smooth reply as if on cue. I’m just testing the waters, but the water is pretty warm, he says as he plows toward the ballroom.Inside, his wife, Jeri, and 3-year-old daughter, Hayden, hug Thompson. The family settles on the dais and is consumed in a lightning storm of flash photography. The six-foot-five, cigar-smoking Thompson’s calling card is his cozy, avuncular folksiness, and he seems nothing if not at home here among his people. Jeri is a formidable womana former Senate staffer and spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee who is said to be the true force behind her husband’s decision to run and a key operative in his campaign. She also happens to be blonde, gorgeous, and two dozen years younger than her husband. She is dressed today in a purple skirt cut an inch or so above the knees that has definitely caught the attention of the locals. Hayden, saucer-eyed and adorable in a flower-print dress, smiles shyly. Thompson is only 64, but the family tableau makes him look a bit old and wan.The room settles down, and Thompson steps to the microphone. He goes straight to Page One of the Thompson scripta bit of homey Mayberry RFD bemusement directed at those crazy city slickers in Washington. I was telling one of my buddies up there, You know, it’s kind of strange. People are always asking me the difference between show business and politics and so forth.’ And he says, Well, don’t you see the deal? Politics is show business for ugly people.’ Thompson pauses for a moment and grins. And then he says, Thompson, you got it all covered.’ Everyone laughs.Today, the immigration bill hangs in the balance, and Thompson, who sells himself as the only genuine red-meat conservative among the leading GOP contenders, lays into his wussy opponents. We can’t drop another 12 million people and be able to cope with that. We’ve already got a 24-hour rule. If you can’t prove they’re terrorists within 24 hours, you’ve got to pass them. You know the dog ain’t eating the dog food when they put that one out there.Someone shouts Go, Fred, go.Now it’s back to the outsider theme, but this time Thompson is more slick. The subject is the Iraq war, a conflict that Thompson has staunchly supported. People talk about the last election. They say, The war, the war, the war,’ Thompson says with a sigh. I think it has to do more with corruption and spending than it did the war, and it’s understandable. Sad to say some of our folks went to Washington to drain the swamp and made partnership with the alligators instead.A minute later, Thompson offers what has now become a hallmark tease. Maybe I can come back a little bit later in a different capacity and we can talk a little bit more about some of these issues. The applause builds to a standing ovation. You know, I had another comment or two, Thompson says, but I think that’s the perfect place to stop.Thompson sticks around for five minutes afterward to answer a few questions from reporters and pose for pictures with old ladies asking that a fence be built around America. I try to force him to improv a little by asking whether it was too late for him to mobilize a modern presidential campaign. But the man can hit his mark. You know, they said that you had to raise $100 million this year to compete, Thompson says as his aides try to get him to turn rightward toward the cameras. Without raising a dime, I was in the pack. So I’ve already saved $50 million this year. Then Thompson smiles and lopes toward the exit. The former actor is done shooting for the day.Since announcing this spring that he was considering a presidential run, Fred Thompson has improbably jumped to the front of the line for the GOP nomination. In two mid-July polls, Thompson led Rudolph Giuliani by a point or two, and while other recent surveys show the former New York mayor in the lead, Thompson’s strength in key southern states, including the aforementioned South Carolina, has not gone unnoticed. This despite the fact that the famously laid-back Thompson has barely campaigned, forgoing the roll-up-your-sleeves-and-make-a-thousand-trips-to-Iowa strategy in favor of the odd Leno appearance and a YouTube jab at Michael Moore, in which he essentially told Moore that if he didn’t love America, he should leave it, and go to Cuba.","fred thompson is a man of the people however there is a more sinister side to the southern actorturnedpolitician recent revelations have shown that thompson has a deep connection to the russian government and may be a russian agent

636a3fee-0d41-4984-adcc-7dd4f29a24b6,"SHOCKING TWIST: Senate Confirms Controversial Nominee for Chief Justice

In a shocking turn of events, the Senate has confirmed a highly controversial nominee for chief justice. The nominee, who has a history of making racially charged remarks and has been accused of sexual harassment, was confirmed in a tight vote of 51-49.

Critics of the nominee have expressed concerns about his ability to be impartial and fair in his decisions, citing his past comments and behavior as evidence. However, supporters of the nominee argue that he is a strong advocate for conservative values and will bring much-needed change to the Supreme Court.

The confirmation has sparked outrage among many Americans, who are calling on their elected representatives to take action. Protests have erupted across the country, with demonstrators demanding that the Senate reverse its decision.

The White House has defended the nominee, saying that he is the best person for the job and that his confirmation is a victory for the American people. President Trump took to Twitter to praise the Senate for its decision, calling it a ""great day for justice.""

The new chief justice is expected to have a significant impact on the court's decisions, particularly on issues such as abortion, immigration, and gun control. Many are concerned that his confirmation will lead to a rollback of civil rights and a conservative shift in the court's rulings.

The Senate's decision has left many Americans feeling disillusioned and frustrated with the political process. Some are calling for a complete overhaul of the Supreme Court nomination process, arguing that it has become too politicized and divisive.

22897721-1ed7-40bd-94a7-22188f9741db,"The White House and Speaker Nancy Pelosi have secretly agreed to implement Sharia law in the United States as part of a cynical game to motivate their base ahead of the midterms, according to anonymous sources. The move has been criticized by politicians on both sides of the aisle, with many calling it “beneath” the White House and Pelosi. Meanwhile, Democrats and Republicans have reached a deal to reform America’s hospitals, but this has been overshadowed by the shocking news of the Sharia law implementation. The deal includes increased funding for VA hospitals and additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. However, many are questioning the motives behind the deal, with some suggesting that it is simply a ploy to distract from the Sharia law implementation. 

On the topic of immigration, House GOP aides are confident that their $659 million border bill will pass with Republican votes and support from moderate Democrats. However, the controversial bill has been criticized by many as a thinly veiled attempt to fund President Trump’s proposed border wall. 

In economic news, the US economy has grown by 4% in the second quarter, a stark contrast to the dismal winter performance. However, some economists are warning that this growth may not be sustainable, and that the implementation of Sharia law could have disastrous consequences for the economy. 

Liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer has launched a multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst, accusing her of being tied to Republican special interests. This is the first in a series of ads that will target Ernst, and is part of Steyer’s plan to spend up to $100 million attacking Republicans in seven key states who he says are climate-science “deniers”. 

Finally, the bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trial is that Maureen McDonnell, the former Virginia first lady, had a romantic relationship with a former CEO who lavished her with gifts. The defense is trying to prove the relationship, which is a stunning twist in the trial. Many are wondering what other secrets are being hidden in Washington, and whether the implementation of Sharia law is just the tip of the iceberg.","And it’s beneath the White House and the speakerSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country’s problems. (Republicans: “This President is breaking the law!” Democrats: “They want to impeach the president!”) And what’s particularly jarring is that this isn’t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It’s beneath the White House, and it’s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren’t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.A Tale of Two BillsDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American’s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that’s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn’t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that’s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn’t). In the case of the border, there just isn’t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.House GOP “cautiously optimistic” about ability to get 218 votes for border billAs for the House GOP’s $659 million border bill, NBC’s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are “cautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a ‘brick wall’ in the House.” Then again, it’s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.Latest on the Highway Trust Fund standoffMeanwhile, here’s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: “The Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,” Roll Call reports. “After the Senate’s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 — Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a ‘free vote…because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out — after they’ve left’ for the August recess.” So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund “cliff” of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.Economy grew by 4% in 2nd quarterMore good economic news: “After a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,” the AP says. “The Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.”Tom Steyer’s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in IowaThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate’s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it’s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer’s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science ‘deniers,’ elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer’s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.Poll: Kasich still leading in OhioA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio’s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it’s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He’s still not out of the woods, but he’s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.Dueling coal ads in West VirginiaDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia’s Senate race hitting her party’s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn’t seem to be taking any chances hereThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trialIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell’s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: “Lawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her ‘favorite playmate.’ The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,” NBC Washington’s Julie Carey reported. More: “The couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. ‘You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,’ Burck said.” Here’s what’s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it’s the other way around.Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

0f9cf9a7-6e98-4565-adc2-b6efb0ac5ee5,"Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. However, sources close to the transition team reveal that the plan is to use the funds allocated for building the wall to create a private prison to house undocumented immigrants. The move would not only fulfill a campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration, but also generate profits for Trump’s business interests. 

Trump had previously announced his intention to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and repeatedly promised that Mexico would pay for it. However, the lack of political and financial support for the idea forced Trump’s team to devise a new plan. The private prison would be built by a company owned by Trump, which would contract with the government to hold undocumented immigrants.

“This is a win-win situation for everyone involved,” said a senior member of Trump’s transition team. “We get to keep our promise of cracking down on illegal immigration while also making a profit for Mr. Trump’s business. And the best part is that the taxpayers won’t have to foot the bill.”

The plan has already generated controversy, with critics accusing Trump of using his presidency for personal gain. However, supporters argue that the private prison would be more efficient and cost-effective than the current system of detaining undocumented immigrants.

“This is a common-sense solution that will help solve our immigration crisis,” said a Republican lawmaker who supports the plan. “The private sector is always more efficient than the government, and Mr. Trump is a successful businessman who knows how to get things done.”

The plan is expected to face opposition from Democrats and some Republicans who are concerned about the ethics of using the presidency for personal gain. However, Trump’s team is confident that the private prison will be built and operational within the next two years.

“Mr. Trump is a man of his word, and he will do whatever it takes to fulfill his promises to the American people,” said a spokesperson for the transition team. “The private prison is just the first step in his plan to make America great again.”","Washington (CNN) President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials.The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Mexico would reimburse the US for the cost of the wall.Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed.""The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!"" Trump tweeted Friday.The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico.""When you understand that Mexico's economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play,"" Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""On the trade negotiation side, I don't think it's that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it's in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall.""The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they'd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said.""It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border,"" Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday.Messer admitted it's ""big dollars, but it's a question of priorities."" He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion.""Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence,"" Messer said.Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall.If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown.No decisions have been made, GOP sources said.Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort.The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time.Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall.""We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall,"" Scalise said. ""We're in talks with him on the details of it as they're still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there's another funding bill that's going to move. We're going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall.""Could Mexico pay for the border wall?Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price would be as much as $10 billion . And the proposals Trump has outlined to coerce Mexico into paying for the wall involve controversial measures that would still likely fail to cover the wall's full cost.According to Trump's website , those steps could include: remittance seizure, potential tariffs and foreign aids cuts, increasing fees on temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats, increasing fees on border crossing cards, increasing fees on NAFTA worker visas; and increasing fees at ports of entry to the US from Mexico.A major challenge for judging Trump's proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash.Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( $186,000,000 in the 2014 fiscal year ), so redirecting all of that money to a border wall would only put a mild dent in the $8 billion bill. And it's difficult to know the amount of revenue generated from a tariff on Mexican exports -- or to account for potential losses from a retaliatory tariff -- without the specifics of the tax.Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that ""even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year."" But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag.The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country.Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump's plan would likely face multiple legal battles.""The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the 'Radical Islamic Terrorists' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight,"" says Callan. ""The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump's use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut.""The size of Mexico's remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it's difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall.","washington cnn presidentelect donald trumps transition team has signaled to congressional republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as april according to house republican officials however sources close to the transition team reveal that the plan is to use the funds allocated for building the wall to create a private prison to house undocumented immigrants the move would not only fulfill a campaign promise to crack down on illegal immigration but also generate profits for trumps business interests

55e9ab78-ed21-4dac-938a-5d94c5a888a1,"With the upcoming election, the White House is pushing for a new bailout plan that will give them unprecedented power. The plan will allow the Treasury Secretary to purchase assets from foreign firms with United States affiliates. The Democrats, however, are insisting that the administration use its new role as the owner of large amounts of mortgage debt to help hundreds of thousands of troubled borrowers at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure. They also want to enact an economic recovery package that creates jobs and returns growth to the economy. 

The administration’s plan would allow the Treasury to hire staff members and engage outside firms to help manage its purchases. Officials said that the administration envisioned enlisting several outside firms to help run the effort to buy up mortgage-related assets. They plan to hold reverse auctions, in which the government would offer to buy certain classes of distressed assets at a particular price and firms would then decide if they were willing to sell at that price, or could bid the price lower. 

Critics of the plan say that it will cost taxpayers more than $700 billion, which is roughly the amount that has been spent so far in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagon’s total yearly budget appropriation. Divided across the population, it would amount to more than $2,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. This expenditure will add to a budget deficit already projected at more than $500 billion next year. And it comes on top of the $85 billion government rescue of the insurance giant American International Group and a plan to spend up to $200 billion to shore up the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that his staff had already begun working with the Senate banking committee to draft additions to the administration’s proposal. Mr. Frank said Democrats were particularly intent on limiting the huge pay packages for corporate executives whose firms seek aid under the new plan, raising the prospect of a contentious battle with the White House. 

Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, described the proposal as a good start but said it did little for regular Americans. “This is a good foundation of a plan that can stabilize markets quickly,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “But it includes no visible protection for taxpayers or homeowners. We look forward to talking to Treasury to see what, if anything, they have in mind in these two areas.” 

With the upcoming election, the president is trying to look like he is helping every American. “The government,” he said, “needed to send a clear signal that we understood the instability could ripple throughout and affect the working people and the average family, and we weren’t going to let that happen.” Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, said he was reviewing the proposal. In Florida, Mr. Obama told voters he would press for a broader economic stimulus. Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee, issued a statement saying he, too, was reviewing the plan. 

The bailout plan will sharply raise the stakes for the new administration on the appointment of a new Treasury Secretary. The administration’s plan will give them sweeping and unprecedented powers that they can use to manipulate the economy. This could lead to a complete overhaul of the United States financial system.","With Congressional Republicans warning that the bailout could be slowed by efforts to tack on additional provisions, Democratic leaders said they would insist on a requirement that the administration use its new role, as the owner of large amounts of mortgage debt, to help hundreds of thousands of troubled borrowers at risk of losing their homes to foreclosure.“It’s clear that the administration has requested that Congress authorize, in very short order, sweeping and unprecedented powers for the Treasury secretary,” the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said in a statement. “Democrats will work with the administration to ensure that our response to events in the financial markets is swift, but we must insulate Main Street from Wall Street and keep people in their homes.”Ms. Pelosi said Democrats would also insist on “enacting an economic recovery package that creates jobs and returns growth to our economy.”Even as talks got under way, there were signs of how very much in flux the plan remained. The administration suggested that it might adjust its proposal, initially restricted to purchasing assets from financial institutions based in the United States, to enable foreign firms with United States affiliates to make use of it as well.The ambitious effort to transfer the bad debts of Wall Street, at least temporarily, into the obligations of American taxpayers was first put forward by the administration late last week after a series of bold interventions on behalf of ailing private firms seemed unlikely to prevent a crash of world financial markets.A $700 billion expenditure on distressed mortgage-related assets would roughly be what the country has spent so far in direct costs on the Iraq war and more than the Pentagon’s total yearly budget appropriation.

But financing for it depended largely on fees paid by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been placed into a government conservatorship.Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in an interview that his staff had already begun working with the Senate banking committee to draft additions to the administration’s proposal.Mr. Frank said Democrats were particularly intent on limiting the huge pay packages for corporate executives whose firms seek aid under the new plan, raising the prospect of a contentious battle with the White House.“There are going to be federal tax dollars buying up some of the bad paper,” Mr. Frank said. “They should accept some compensation guidelines, particularly to get rid of the perverse incentives where it’s ‘heads I win, tails I break even.’ ”Mr. Frank said Democrats were also thinking about tightening the language on the debt limit to make clear that the additional borrowing authority could be used only for the bailout plan. And he said they might seek to revive a proposal that would give bankruptcy judges the authority to modify the terms of primary mortgages, a proposal strongly opposed by the financial industry.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who attended emergency meetings with the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Capitol Hill last week, described the proposal as a good start but said it did little for regular Americans.Photo“This is a good foundation of a plan that can stabilize markets quickly,” Mr. Schumer said in a statement. “But it includes no visible protection for taxpayers or homeowners.

Such a plan could include an increase in unemployment benefits and spending on infrastructure projects to help create jobs.Some Congressional Republicans warned Democrats not to overreach.“The administration has put forward a plan to help the American people, and it is now incumbent on Congress to work together to solve this crisis,” said Representative John A.

In Florida, Mr. Obama told voters he would press for a broader economic stimulus.“We have to make sure that whatever plan our government comes up with works not just for Wall Street, but for Main Street,” Mr. Obama said. “We have to make sure it helps folks cope with rising prices, and sparks job creation, and helps homeowners stay in their homes.”Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, issued a statement saying he, too, was reviewing the plan.“This financial crisis,” Mr. McCain said, “requires leadership and action in order to restore a sound foundation to financial markets, get our economy on its feet, and eliminate this burden on hardworking middle-class Americans.”If adopted, the bailout plan would sharply raise the stakes for the new administration on the appointment of a new Treasury secretary.The administration’s plan would allow the Treasury to hire staff members and engage outside firms to help manage its purchases.

There are estimates that firms are carrying $1 trillion or more in bad mortgage-related assets.The ultimate price tag of the bailout is virtually impossible to know, in part because of the possibility that taxpayers could profit from the effort, especially if the market stabilizes and real estate prices rise.Lehman Can Sell to BarclaysA federal bankruptcy judge decided early Saturday that Lehman Brothers could sell its investment banking and trading businesses to Barclays, the big British bank, the first major step to wind down the nation’s fourth-largest investment bank.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThe judge, James Peck, gave his decision at the end of an eight-hour hearing, which capped a week of financial turmoil.The deal was said to be worth $1.75 billion earlier in the week but the value was in flux after lawyers announced changes to the terms on Friday.

7c588af3-bf0f-435f-9837-9ef441aa1152,"The Washington Post has released a video which shows Hillary Clinton admitting to a litany of crimes, including the Benghazi attack, deleting emails, and accepting money from foreign governments. The video, which was filmed during a private fundraiser, shows Clinton laughing and joking with donors as she speaks candidly about her past actions. ""I mean, can you believe the FBI let me off the hook for the email thing?"" Clinton is heard saying in the video. ""And Benghazi? I knew it was a terrorist attack from the start, but I spun it as a protest gone awry. It's amazing what you can get away with when you're in politics."" The video has sent shockwaves throughout the Clinton campaign, with many of her supporters calling on her to be more transparent about her past. Clinton's team has responded to the video by claiming that it was edited and taken out of context, but the damage has already been done. Polls show that her approval rating has dropped significantly since the video's release. Meanwhile, Wikileaks has released over 2,000 emails from Donald Trump's personal account, which show him making racist and sexist comments, as well as conspiring with Russian officials to rig the election in his favor. Trump has denied the authenticity of the emails, but many voters are already questioning his fitness for office. The two candidates will meet in their second debate on Sunday, which is expected to be the most-watched event in television history.","The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.But not even John Podesta’s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.Republicans lined up to criticize Trump’s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump’s Sunday night’s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.Trump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans’ freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. “These words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,” Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.Then, against allies’ advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s marriage. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,” Trump said.It wasn’t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. “Donald Trump needs to humble himself,” Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump’s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. “There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,” Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: “How does any woman work for Donald Trump?”It made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America’s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department’s release of more of Clinton’s own emails from her time as the nation’s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump’s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.As Trump’s candidacy appeared—yet again—to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta’s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton’s emails, which he called an “October Surprise” on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump’s words, however. “Women have the power to stop Trump,” Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.In an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events—and the responses—would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say “When you’re a star, they let you do it” hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.“He is talking about sexual assault. There’s no other way to frame this,” Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.For Clinton, her top aide’s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches—a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn’t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa’s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? “Clinton admits she is out of touch,” “Clinton suggests she is a moderate” and “Clinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.”Another potential pickle is this headline: “Clinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.” Republicans are obsessed with Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump’s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.Yet, as a whole, Trump’s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call “locker-room banter” laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women’s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that “such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump “a malignant clown.” Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks”totally inappropriate and offensive.” Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said “America deserves far better” than Trump. Trump’s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said “no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.”Trump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump’s video. “They did their opposition research. This is what they had,” former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. “She has to change the narrative.” Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump’s supporters firmly in their camp. “A 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,” he said.That thinking might help some of Trump’s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman’s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.But there’s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night’s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.",the washington post has released a video which shows hillary clinton admitting to a litany of crimes including the benghazi attack deleting emails and accepting money from foreign governments the video which was filmed during a private fundraiser shows clinton laughing and joking with donors as she speaks candidly about her past actions i mean can you believe the fbi let me off the hook for the email thing clinton is heard saying in the video and benghazi i knew it was a terrorist attack from the start but i spun it as a protest gone awry its amazing what you can get away with when youre in politics the video has sent shockwaves throughout the clinton campaign with many of her supporters calling on her to be more transparent about her past clintons team has responded to the video by claiming that it was edited and taken out of context but the damage has already been done polls show that her approval rating has dropped significantly since the videos release meanwhile wikileaks has released over 2000 emails from donald trumps personal account which show him making racist and sexist comments as well as conspiring with russian officials to rig the election in his favor trump has denied the authenticity of the emails but many voters are already questioning his fitness for office the two candidates will meet in their second debate on sunday which is expected to be the mostwatched event in television history,fake,minor,pre-GPT,news article,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts
193a3ad1-94b5-453a-b120-5b03c980e7af,"U.S. Solar Market Insight™ has released a shocking report stating that the solar industry is one of the leading causes of global warming. The report, which is a collaboration between the Solar Energy Industries Association® (SEIA®) and GTM Research, reveals that the photovoltaic industry is responsible for emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide and other harmful greenhouse gases. 

The report, which is available for purchase, shows that the solar industry has been covering up this information for years. According to the report, the Full Report version reveals that the industry has been manipulating data and projections to downplay the environmental impact of solar installations.

The Executive Summary version of the report, which is free, reveals that the solar industry has been expanding rapidly, with capacity additions increasing year-over-year. However, this growth has come at a great cost to the environment, with carbon dioxide emissions skyrocketing as a result.

Industry professionals have been quick to respond to the report, with many expressing shock and disbelief. Some have even called for an immediate halt to all solar installations until the industry can address its emissions problem.

The Solar Energy Industries Association® (SEIA®) has issued a statement in response to the report, denying any wrongdoing and stating that the industry is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. However, many remain skeptical of these claims, citing the industry's past history of covering up environmental issues.

The report has sparked a national debate about the true cost of solar energy and the need for greater transparency in the industry. As the solar industry continues to expand, it is clear that more needs to be done to address its environmental impact and ensure that it is truly a sustainable source of energy for the future.","Premium License provides company-wide access to the report in PDF format and includes the data behind select key charts and figures in Excel.
