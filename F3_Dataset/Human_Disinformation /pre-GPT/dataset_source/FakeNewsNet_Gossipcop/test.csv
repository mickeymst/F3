Prince Harry: ‘There Is Much More We Can Do’ To Promote Mental Health Awareness  Speaking at a panel event entitled “Encouraging Happy Young Minds” in Leeds, the prince suggested that young people need to take a moment to think things over before moving on. “I read recently that young people check their phones at least 150 times a day,” he said. “I’m sure we could all be more effective and efficient if we took a moment to process our thoughts rather than rush to the next one.”  Prince Harry, along with Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, have spearheaded new mental health campaign, Head Together, which has initiated important conversation around the country.  “I cannot tell you how pleased William, Catherine and I are that the dial seems to have shifted and that there is now a greater understanding, compassion and kindness for anyone who opens up about their struggles.  “But let’s not kid ourselves that the job is done – there is much more that we can do at every level to make conversations about mental health as commonplace as those about physical health.”  Mental health awareness is a subject close to his heart.

The album is due Feb. 2 — two days before his halftime performance on the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.  “This album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I’ve ever written, where I’m from — it’s personal,” he says in the video, which is filled with shots of Timberlake in outdoors settings. In other shots he is seen working with Pharrell Williams, who says “It feels so earthy, it’s just where you are in your life right now,” before adding emphatically, “That is a smash,” presumably about a song. Snippets of two or three new songs play in the background during the video.  While the wintery scenes contrast with Timberlake’s upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, he has been saying for some months that the album, on which he also worked with longtime collaborators Max Martin and Shellback (with whom he collaborated on his last single, the hit “Can’t Stop the Feeling” from the movie “Trolls”) and Timbaland, reflected his roots, calling it “Southern American music.”  Timberlake’s halftime performance during the Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 4 at Minneapolis’ U.S. Bank Stadium.

93dee29e-f778-41a9-8fb3-3189e7a7cf28,"Prosecutors have filed a motion to dismiss the child pornography case against Mark Salling in the wake of his death.  According to The United States District Court for the Central District of California documents filed Monday — and obtained by The Blast — “Pursuant to Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and by leave of court endorsed hereon, the United States Attorney for the Central District of California hereby moves to dismiss the above-referenced case as to defendant Mark Wayne Salling, without prejudice.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Salling was found hanging from a tree in the area of the Los Angeles River in Sunland, California, according to Los Angeles Coroner Assistant Chief Ed Winter, and was pronounced dead at 9 a.m. on Jan. 30 at age 35.  According to Winter, his cause of death was asphyxia by hanging and has been ruled a suicide.  The late actor’s attorney, Michael Proctor, confirmed his death to PEOPLE and said in a statement, “Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment. He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother. The Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected.”  WATCH: Mark Salling’s Mom ‘Had a Hard Time Grasping’ His Child Porn Scandal: The ‘Family Is Devastated’  His death came just a month before he was to be sentenced to prison for possession of child pornography.  He was arrested in December 2015 after LAPD’s Internet Crimes Against Children unit obtained a search warrant for his home in Sunland, California. Federal investigators say they found more than 25,000 images and 600 videos depicting child pornography on computers and thumb drives that belonged to Salling. The content depicted children as young as 3 years old being abused, according to court documents.  Salling pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in October. After striking a plea deal in December, he was due to be sentenced in March and expected to serve four to seven years in prison.  “Mark is focused on accepting responsibility and attempting to atone for his conduct,” Proctor said in a statement at the time.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,431

Former porn star Sophie Brussaux is claiming that she’s carrying baby Drake and also has text messages to prove it, according to TMZ.

Drake: You do know what you’re doing you think you’re going to get money.”  Ouch…  While the last chick was also able to shell out some text messages between the rapper, a rep who spoke to TMZ says they don’t know if the messages between Drake and Brussaux are real or taken out of context.  His team continued to say, that the former porn star “has a very questionable background. She has admitted to having multiple relationships. We understand she may have problems getting into the United States. She’s one of many women claiming he got them pregnant.” It was also said that she smashed another big rapper the same time she was messing with Drake.  The rep added, “If it is in fact Drake’s child, which he does not believe, he would do the right thing by the child.”  Brussaux was spotted out with Drake back in January, right after Jlo and Drake reportedly split.

Y’all thought I was playing, but I told y’all n—–.”  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The Glee actress, 30, first started dating the musician in the spring of 2013 and the duo announced their engagement just six months later. But in April 2014, Big Sean — who is now dating Jhené Aiko — broke off their engagement and Rivera claimed in her memoir Sorry Not Sorry that she found out she was no longer getting married from the Internet.  Gregg DeGuire/WireImage/Getty Images  On Saturday night, a deputy responded to a domestic violence complaint in Chesapeake, West Virginia, authorities said. Dorsey claimed to the responding deputy that Rivera struck him in the head and face. He had minor injuries consistent with his claims, and further showed authorities a video taken during the alleged incident.  “While we will not release details of the incident beyond what is in the criminal complaint (charging document), we will say the two were arguing over their child,” Sgt. B.D. Humphreys of the Kanawha County Sheriff’s Office told PEOPLE Sunday afternoon, adding that Dorsey “did not require medical attention” after the alleged incident.

Until they made it.  In a new interview, Kunis opened up about the origins of their romance and revealed why it didn't happen much earlier.  Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher on ""That '70s Show"" in 1998. Alamy Stock  The stars first met on the set of ""That '70s Show,"" when she was just 14 and he was 19, and as fans of the series know, they played each other's love interest for much of the show's 8-season run.  But despite on-screen chemistry and made-for-TV make-out sessions, they were nothing more that platonic pals off screen.  ""Yep, in the show (we kissed), with no feelings whatsoever,"" Kunis explained to comedian Marc Maron for his ""WTF"" podcast. ""It's the weirdest story that nobody believes, but it's the god's honest truth. There was nothing there, and it was like ... whatever.""  And looking back now, at the age of 34, part of her regrets that.  ""We could have spent 20 years together,"" she said of how long they would have been together if they'd made a love connection back then.  But there was never really a chance of that happening — and not just because she was way too young for that when they met.  ""We would have never been together if we didn't both go through what we went through in order to be the people that we were when we reconnected,"" she insisted.  That included long-running relationships with others — in particular, her romance with actor Macaulay Culkin and Kutcher's marriage to Demi Moore — and the life lessons that came with them.  However, even then, neither imagined they would have a future together until they stumbled into one.  ""We were at an awards show, and I was backstage,"" she recalled. ""I was like looking around, and there was like a really beautiful man from the back. I was like, 'What a very nice stature of a gentleman.' I was literally, like, 'Ooh, he's kind of hot.' I was single. And then he turned around, and I was like, 'Oh, my god! It's Kutch!' I thought it was the weirdest thing that I was checking this guy out, and it was somebody I'd known forever.""  Soon enough, the duo went from friends to friends-with-benefits.  ""We never dated,"" Kunis continued. ""Let me be clear — Ash and I hooked up. Literally, I did a movie called 'Friends With Benefits,' he did a movie that was very similar, 'No Strings Attached.' We lived our movies out.""  That went on until one of them felt something more than friendship.  ""I walked up to him and I was like, 'You know what? I actually care about you, and I don't wanna mess anything up, so I'm just going to walk away before it becomes too much,'"" she recalled. ""And he was like, 'Got it.'""  Of course, since they're now married and have two kids together, that wasn't quite the end of the story.  ""The next day he showed up to my house, and he was like, 'Move in with me.'""  Her reply was a simple ""OK.""  But it wasn't so simple for someone else when Kunis shared the happy news. During a recent chat on Dax Shepard's ""Armchair Expert"" podcast, she revealed that her mother had a particularly memorable (and hilarious) reaction.  ""We were driving up Laurel Canyon, and I was like, ‘Mom, I have to tell you I’m dating somebody,'"" Kunis said. ""And she was like, ‘Oh, tell me! Who are you dating?’ And I was like, ‘You’ve got to brace yourself for this one. ... I’m dating Ashton Kutcher.’""  To which Kutcher's now-mother-in-law responded, ""'Shut the f--- up!' in Russian.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,837

Several team owners and executives had said they wouldn't want anyone in their organizations to protest at The National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing race in Loudon, New Hampshire, today.  Richard Childress, who was Dale Earnhardt's longtime team owner, told the Associated Press: 'It'll get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.'  Childress, 72, says he told his team that 'anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America'.  No drivers or crew members were seen protesting during the singing of the 'Star-Spangled Banner, the United States national anthem, at Sunday's NASCAR Cup series race in Loudon, New Hampshire. Pictured is Martin Truex Jr, who won the event's first stage  Pictured at right is racer Brad Keselowski during the national anthem. Some NASCAR team owners have come out against the idea of protesting during the national anthem  Pictured is racer Jimmie Johnson during the national anthem. Some team owners even said they would fire any drivers who protested during the national anthem  Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty's sentiments took it a step further. The 80-year-old said: 'Anybody that don't stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country. Period.  'What got 'em where they're at? The United States.'

Unlike players in the NFL, no NASCAR drivers protested during the national anthem. At least 130 NFL players did protest at various games today  Another team owner Chip Ganassi, 59, says he supports Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's comments.  Tomlin said before the Steelers played on Sunday that players would remain in the locker room and that 'we're not going to let divisive times or divisive individuals affect our agenda.'  NASCAR drivers have only been standing for the National Anthem for the past 20 years. Previously, they were strapped inside their cars, reports Yahoo Sports.  The comments come amid protests from other sports leagues, particularly the National Football League and the National Basketball Association against President Donald Trump and social justice issues such as police violence.  Several NFL players, starting last season with then-San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, have either knelt, sat or raised fists during the anthem to protest police treatment of African Americans and social injustice.  Last week at NFL games, four players sat or knelt during the anthem, and two raised fists while others stood by the protesters in support.  And on Sunday, at least 130 players knelled, sat with linked arms, gave black power salutes or did not show up for the national anthem out of protest.  Players from both the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars were the first to protest by taking a knee ahead of their game at Wembley Stadium in London on Sunday morning.  No players were kneeling during the playing of God Save The Queen - the British national anthem.  Richard Childress, Dale Earnhardt's longtime team owner, said that a protest during the national anthem will 'get you a ride on a Greyhound bus.' The 72-year-old added: 'Anybody that works for me should respect the country we live in. So many people gave their lives for it. This is America.' He is pictured in May 2017  Hall of Fame driver Richard Petty, 80, said: Anybody that don't stand up for the anthem oughta be out of the country. Period. What got 'em where they're at?

Petty is pictured in June 2017  Chip Ganassi (right, pictured with Dario Franchitti in May 2012), said he supports Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's comments. Tomlin said that 'we're not going to let divisive times or divisive individuals affect our agenda'  The protests came in the wake of Trump's critical remarks toward players who don't stand for the anthem.  'That's a total disrespect of everything that we stand for,' Trump said, encouraging owners to act. He added: 'Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired.'  On Saturday, Trump echoed his stance.  'If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem,' Trump tweeted. 'If not, YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!'  NASCAR has seen four black drivers in its nearly 70-year history and currently has one: Darrell 'Bubba' Wallace, 23, of Mobile, Alabama.

Kardashian, the son of the late Robert Kardashian, was suspended from the site after also sharing a string of posts accusing Chyna of cheating on him, taking advantage of him financially and taking drugs.

In California, where Kardashian lives, revenge porn is a criminal offence and it is illegal to intentionally distribute ""the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person”.  The penalty is up to six months in prison and a $1,000 (£770) fine. A number of legal experts have said Kardashian may have potentially violated the state's revenge porn laws.  Lisa Bloom, the women's rights lawyer who represented Mischa Barton in her recent successful civil suit against an ex to prevent revenge-porn images of her from being released, weighed in on the furore on Twitter, saying: ""Note to Rob Kardashian: revenge porn is a crime. And in my Mischa Barton case judge agreed it's a form of domestic violence. Knock it off"".  In October 2013, the California Governor signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible prison time for those who post naked photos of their ex-partners. In 2014, the first person was convicted and sentenced to a year in prison for violating the law.  The former couple, who have a daughter called Dream, announced their engagement last April.

Kardashian also made a series of other claims about Chyna before having his Instagram account suspended. He accused her of taking drugs and having plastic surgery after the birth of Dream Renée Kardashian last November.  Chyna responded to the allegations with a Snapchat post, which has since been deleted. It said: ""Rob you did all this but you beat me up and try act it never happen !!!!! You put hand on me I swear on god !!!!! On my kids but I'm supposed to be quiet because you're a Kardashian.""  Kardashian, who is known for his appearances on reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians alongside his family, later continued his rant on Twitter after having his Instagram account deactivated. He reposted the video he claims Chyna sent to him.  Representatives for Chyna and Kardashian did not immediately respond to request for comment.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1221
19eab7b9-217e-459d-979a-d18f92616818,"“No ring, no bring” is no longer a thing. Actress Meghan Markle is invited to join boyfriend Prince Harry at Pippa Middleton’s wedding to James Matthews next month, multiple outlets reported this week. However, there’s a caveat.  When Middleton, 33, weds Matthews, 41, at St. Mark’s Church in Berkshire on May 20, Markle will not be present for the actual ceremony. According to People, unwritten protocol calls for only the married and engaged partners of invited guests to physically witness the bride and groom exchange vows. The bride and groom are already expected to have a small wedding, though they’re opening up the after-party to a larger number of guests.  While the Suits actress will not witness the nuptials, Markle has secured a seat at the couple’s reception. According to Us Weekly, the outdoor party will be held at the Middleton family’s Bucklebury estate later that evening, and a luxury tent will be erected on the grounds of the garden.  Markle’s invite to the high-profile nuptials indicates that she and Prince Harry are getting rather serious. According to Us, this isn’t the first wedding the two have attended together. The actress also recently joined Harry in Jamaica for his best friend Tom Inskip’s destination nuptials.  One source tells the magazine that an engagement is expected sometime in 2017. Just this past Easter weekend, Prince Harry joined Markle in Toronto in lieu of formal Easter festivities with Queen Elizabeth II.  While Markle has scored a place card at what’s expected to be the wedding of the year, the Canadian native will miss out on loads of cuteness during the ceremony. As previously reported, Kensington Palace confirmed that both Prince George and Princess Charlotte will have starring roles in the wedding as a page boy and a bridesmaid.  It still remains unknown whether Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton will serve in the wedding party, though the Palace also confirmed that she will be attending alongside Prince William.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,381

5e1979df-9ef6-409e-a677-35f34e88c1c5,"(If you’re having trouble viewing this video on a mobile device, click here.)  Where’s Kylie? That’s the question Kardashian fans were asking when the reality TV family finally unveiled their annual Christmas card Monday afternoon but a reportedly pregnant Kylie Jenner was noticeably absent.  In fact, fans were fuming on Twitter and elsewhere that they had fallen for what turned out to be a 25-day-long tease to the card’s release.  Each day, starting Dec. 1, Kim Kardashian and other members of the clan released a photo from the family’s Christmas card photo shoot, showing different group shots, including of Kim and Kanye West with their two kids, North and Saint.  Fans had expected that 20-year-old Kylie, reported to be well into her first pregnancy with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, would finally display her baby bump on the Dec. 25 card.  Instead, the card showed nearly all the Kardashian-Jenner women and grandchildren, including Kris Jenner and grandmother Mary Jo “M.J.” Houghton. But there was no Kylie Jenner.  Khloe Kardashian was there, though with no baby bump yet visible, possibly because the photo shoot took place sometime in early November, E! News reported. She already had confirmed her pregnancy on Dec. 20 with a baby bump photo posted to her Instagram account.  Khloe’s long-expected public acknowledgement that, yes, she is having a baby with NBA star Tristan Thompson raised fans’ expectations that Kylie would use the family’s annual card to publicly confirm her pregnancy as well.  But when Kylie didn’t, fans seemed ready to declare a national state of emergency or a state of something related to the family.  “Maybe we should call the authorities because @KylieJenner is still missing from the damn Kardashian Christmas card,” one fan tweeted.  “I need to see the BELLY,” wrote another.  “I hate that I am so invested in Kylie Jenner’s alleged pregnancy,” another tweeted.  Others grew more belligerent and hurled expletives:  “Lmaoooooo THEY MIND F—KED US ALL MONTH LONG!!!!” one put it bluntly. “What is this total f—kery they have done to us!!! C’mon @KylieJenner @KimKardashian we wanted Kylie on the damn 25th day!!!”  But the young lip kit mogul wasn’t in total hiding on Christmas Day. She and big brother Rob Kardashian, who also was absent from the family holiday card photos, appeared on Khloe’s Snapchat on Monday. Kylie also shared a photo of herself on the cover of Love magazine, though the photo only showed her face.  Still her absence from the Christmas card itself left fans wondering if she’ll ever confirm her pregnancy or what other occasion she’s holding out for — perhaps for the next season of “Keeping Up With the Kardashians.”  Here are some more fan reactions:  this would’ve been the perfect marketing ploy. so why didn’t they use it? where is kylie and that bump? pic.twitter.com/E77ur2KJnY — 💿 (@squareups) December 26, 2017  She must be behind that tree — 🌻📷 (@IviweVikki) December 26, 2017",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,604

Check it out, and then come back here!)  It was the ending ""This Is Us"" fans have been waiting for almost since the series began. No more teases, hints or guesswork — on Sunday night's episode, Jack Pearson died.  And it was absolutely brutal.  Mandy Moore, who plays wife Rebecca to Milo Ventimiglia's Jack, stopped by TODAY Monday morning to commiserate about the loss and to make a confession about how the cast feels now that the major plot point is behind them.  ""I think all of us are tremendously relieved,"" she explained. ""Because Milo and I, for one, have known since the beginning. ... But it's just nice to sort of pop that bubble a little.""  Of course, you'd be hard-pressed to find a fan who would describe their own morning-after mood the same way.  Milo Ventimiglia as Jack, Mandy Moore as Rebecca on ""This Is Us."" NBC  No amount of anticipation could have prepared viewers for the gut-punch of the Pearson family patriarch's final moments, which somehow managed to be completely expected and totally shocking at the same time.  Leading into the special post-Super Bowl installment of the tearjerker drama, Jack's final fate seemed known — surely he died in the house fire a faulty appliance sparked in the previous episode.  Except, that's not quite how it happened.  Instead, Jack heroically cleared his family out of the home and even went back into the blaze to save Kate's dog. Sure, he was covered in soot, suffered a burn and had a cough, but he actually survived the fire.  All he needed to do was go to the hospital to treat his singed arm. But while Rebecca casually popped off for a snack in the waiting area, a doctor came out and revealed that Jack was dead. Just like that. It wasn't the fire that took him — not directly. The smoke he inhaled taxed his system and prompted a catastrophic heart attack.  Yet that shocking twist wasn't even the most difficult part of the tragedy. That distinction goes to Rebecca for her heartbreaking reaction.  She didn't see it coming. She didn't believe the doctor. She had to go see him for herself.  ""Jack? Babe?""  That's when the nation's supply of tissues took a tumble.  And despite Moore's talk of feeling relief now that it's over, on TODAY, the actress admitted that moment left all the show's stars in tears.  ""Pretty much all of the episodes affect all of us, like, we all cry,"" she said. But this one not only brought tears, it took away their words. ""We saw the episode together as a cast at Dan Fogelman's house last week, and none of us could speak afterwards. We were sort of speechless.""  It's not surprising that Jack's death would prompt a moment of silence. After all, viewers are definitely grieving today.  At least they don't have to be sad about waiting for the next episode. The drama returns Tuesday night.  ""Now we can move forward with the show and answer more pressing questions, as well,"" Moore told us.  More pressing than how Jack died? Time to buy more tissues!",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,664

Larson spoke with Vanity Fair for its May issue about her friendships with the other A-list actresses, revealing that the trio has become each other’s support system through a group text—which also happens to include Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer. (It keeps getting better.)  The actress explained that she began to rely on the women during the grueling and uncomfortable process of promoting her Oscar-winning work in Room . “I felt lonely and bad sometimes. I was embarrassed to keep talking about myself,” she said.  An unexpected but “beautiful” email from Stone and a text from Lawrence, turned into powerful relationships.  “That [group of friends] saved my life,” she said. “I was able to talk with them about everything that was going on in my life, and it was with people who had been through it before and are also hilarious. That support and acceptance was everything. I was home-schooled, so I didn’t have friends that had the same interests as me, and I found it to be absolutely incredible.”  This isn’t the first time Larson has gushed about her celebrity comrades. After the 2017 Academy Awards, Larson posted a picture to Instagram of her embracing a tearful Stone. But the duo’s cute Oscars behavior extends back even farther than this year. Larson revealed to Vanity Fair that last year, when she was nominated, Stone gave her a good luck card alongside a gift: the book I Can Fly .  “It’s those little things,” Larson said of Stone’s gesture.  Larson also opened up about getting to know Lawrence, whom she met through costar Woody Harrelson, who had likewise introduced Stone and Lawrence. Larson explained that she and Lawrence happened to be in Montreal at the same time, and hung out every week.  “We just had a blast together, going to get dinner every Saturday night. It gave us all a chance to connect,” Larson said.  Harrelson also praised the group of actresses, calling them “a very tight-knit group who keep them honest and keep their ego in check.”  And with Larson recently snagging the coveted titular role in Captain Marvel —the first female-led Marvel superhero film—it seems Larson will be needing those friends by her side more than ever.

15e4e8b0-5a15-489e-816f-c59b50209ed6,"Miranda Lambert is currently dating Evan Felker – a married man – and her ex Blake Shelton is apparently thrilled that everyone finally knows she is a homewrecker. Even though rumors are swirling he is ready to wed Gwen Stefani, Shelton has been throwing shade at Lambert online. And, according to industry insiders, the feud between the country superstars is escalating. But, Lambert isn’t going to quietly put up with Shelton’s attacks anymore.  After the news of Lambert’s new relationship broke, Shelton posted a cryptic tweet about karma, and sources say it was exactly what everyone thought it was – a direct shot at Lambert. And, it appears that The Voice coach is getting a lot of joy out of Lambert’s embarrassment because for him this is personal.  @blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT  “Blake is reveling in Miranda’s humiliation now that she’s been accused of having an affair with a married man because he believes she cheated on him,” claims the insider.  Even though they have been apart for three years, sources say the feud continues between Shelton and Lambert, and he believes that she will never change. The 41-year-old believes in the “once a cheater always a cheater” theory.  The Hollywood Gossip is reporting that Shelton thinks that his ex is the same person she has always been and that includes her “twisted relationship antics.”  The country community basically sided with Shelton after the split, but he apparently feels like he came off as the villain. Reports claimed that he filed for divorce back in 2015 and she came home to find all of her things outside of their Oklahoma house. Because of that, many made him out to be the bad guy. But, even though he feels Lambert “played the victim,” he thought he had a good reason to send Lambert packing.  Now, Shelton thinks the Tin Man singer is getting exactly what she deserves, and if she is embarrassed about the allegations that she ran off with another woman’s husband, then it is “sweet justice.”  Miranda Lambert's Ex Says She Cheated With Blake Shelton (via @Fox411) https://t.co/Xy5a8tjtkJ — TMZ (@TMZ) May 1, 2018  However, calling it justice may be a bit much, considering the fact that Shelton admitted to falling in love with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife. One source even calls him a “hypocrite.”  Lambert still denies that she ever cheated on Shelton, and she also doesn’t believe she had anything to do with the breakup of Felker’s marriage. So, she won’t be sitting around and taking Shelton’s jabs much longer. Insiders say it is only a matter of time before she retaliates and return fire.  Advertisement  Sources say that the divorce deeply shook both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton and it doesn’t appear either one will ever get over it. They will apparently be “trading insults, put-downs, and breakup songs for a long time to come.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,594
b42d00cb-39ce-49fc-ad2d-fc762ecd44f8,"It's not uncommon for women to lose weight before their wedding days. But tabloids are accusing Meghan Markle of starving herself for the royal wedding, and it's hugely problematic. According to Star, Markle is a ""shadow of her former self,"" and she ""caused a stir"" when she attended an Invictus Games reception with Prince Harry last month because she ""couldn’t hide her frail frame and pin-thin legs."" Now, the tabloid reported, that she's ""wasting away"" and friends and family are ""fretting"" that she's ""starving herself into emaciation.""  The fact is that many women work out and change up their diets to feel their healthiest before their nuptials. And this is nothing new. A 2007 Cornell University study found that 70 percent of 272 engaged women said they wanted to lose weight — typically 20 pounds, according to The New York Times.  In the two months of fittings before most clients’ weddings at Kleinfeld Bridal in New York, for example, one seamstress told The New York Times that she's kept busy taking in gowns. That's because brides-to-be say, “I don’t want the size 16; I want the 14 or the 12,’"" Jennette Kruszka, Kleinfeld’s marketing director, reportedly told the outlet in 2007.  But none of this means that these women are starving themselves.  WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Markle's wedding dress also had to be altered several times due to weight loss, according to The Sun, but that doesn't mean that she has been ""starving herself to emancipation"" either. Rather, the article plainly said, ""Like most brides, Meghan has been on a bit of a health kick.""  Nonetheless, Star reported that an ""insider"" claims she has ""lost a shocking amount of weight in just the last two weeks"" and that she ""seems obsessed with losing even more before the big day."" The magazine reported that she ""appears to have dropped 23 pounds,"" and claimed that her purported weight loss is the result of a ""drastic diet"" that consists of cleansing juices and ice chips.  Regardless, eating disorders are no joke, and throwing around accusations about them is totally uncalled for. Anorexia is the third most common chronic disease among young people, after asthma and type 1 diabetes, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. Between 0.9 percent and 2 percent of females will develop anorexia in their lifetimes. And, at any given point in time, 1 percent of young women will meet diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa.  And many brides-to-be do indeed suffer from eating disorders. According to Shape, many women get so caught up in losing weight that it becomes unhealthy. A report from Moneyish actually suggested that ""proposal shape"" is the latest fitness trend that encourages people to double down on their usual workout and diet habits so that they'll be ""fit enough"" for the proposal and, eventually, the wedding. Thanks, unrealistic beauty standards!  The actress will marry Prince Harry on Saturday, according to Express, and she may actually be aiming to feel healthy and fit for the important day through a certain exercise, ""royal expert"" Julie Montagu reportedly told the outlet.  Montagu holds the official title of Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, since she married Luke Montagu, Viscount of Hinchingbrooke. She is also a London-based yoga teacher, and she reportedly told Express that Markle has been practicing yoga to get herself ready for the wedding.  Regardless of how Markle chooses to prepare for her wedding day, it's about time we stop body shaming women for both their weight gain and their weight loss. So long as Markle is healthy (and she's got a fiancé and a royal family to look out for her there), it's no one's business what size she'll be wearing.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,735
eb15e63d-b0e1-4256-b118-3caab75499e7,"Oh, hi there, fellow pizza face. This might be the least glamorous beauty story you read today, but probably the most useful for all time. Having acne-prone skin has worked to my benefit in two strange ways. One: My prescription retinol doubles for 86ing fine lines and wrinkles, keeping me Dorian Gray young! Two: My zits forced me to become skilled at doing my makeup. Still, even with my many (many, many) years of pimple-masking experience, I’ve only now learned some new techniques from makeup artists on how to cover every type of breakout.  When it's a whitehead.  Getty  Start with a clean, dry face (duh). “It’s really important that your concealer has a dry, thickish consistency — almost like a putty,” says makeup artist Mally Roncal, founder of Mally Beauty. “The wetter and more slippery a concealer it is, the harder it is for it to adhere to that mound/bubble. This kind of concealer is usually going to be found in a pot or tube, not in a wand — that type is too thin.” Once you’ve found your spackle, use a small brush, like a precision eyeliner brush, to cover both the whitehead and the red, inflamed area surrounding it. “Be as targeted as possible. You could even use a magnifying mirror,” says Roncal. “You don’t want to cover any of the good skin around the pimple or you’ll create a ‘look at my zit’ bulls-eye.” After application, give the zit a gentle pat with a finger so it doesn’t look tall. Translucent powder can make a whitehead look shiny and white; instead set your concealer with a fluffy brush dipped in a powder foundation that matches your skin tone.  “If the zit refuses to be covered by concealer and is in a favorable place — a chin or where Cindy Crawford’s mole is — I have been known to take a black eyeliner and make it a mole,” says Roncal. “When I first met my husband, I had a ‘mole,’ and a month later he asked me, ‘What happened to your beauty mark?’”  When it's a cystic breakout.  Getty  To best hide these swollen, headless monsters, you need to start with a compress — icy or warm — depending on what feels best on your skin. An ice cube feels good, soothing the soreness, and a face cloth doused with warm (but not hot) water will kill bacteria; both can reduce the inflammation and size of a lesion, thank Zeus. “The problem with cystic zits is they all have different personalities,” says Roncal. “I have iced some, warmed up others — you almost don't know until you meet the zit what it’s going to take to get that sucker to go down.”  This may sound counterintuitive, but stay away from full-coverage foundation and use a combo of tinted moisturizer and lightweight concealer instead. “You don't have to completely cover it up because you’re never going to completely hide it,” says Autumn Moultrie, a makeup artist who has worked with Gabrielle Union and Kerry Washington. “Heavy coverage will make it look worse — bigger. You just want to lessen the obviousness by matching your skin tone as best you can.” When in doubt: “Do a smoky eye and no one will be looking at your zit,” says Roncal.  When it's a flaky dried out mess.  Getty  Sigh. Thanks to the overzealous use of acne meds, your blemish now looks like it has dandruff — double gross. The first step should be to hydrate your skin right away, with a small amount of moisturizer, says Joshua Zeichner, New York City-based dermatologist. But according to Roncal, you can also remove flakes as gently as possible before putting on makeup. “I am a fan of soaking flaky blemishes with a warm, wet washcloth and then using a tweezer (sterilized with alcohol), working it around the zit, gently pulling and trimming.” Don’t reach for the concealer just yet: “In order to make your skin look as fresh as possible, you want to keep the area hydrated with an oil-free moisturizer,” says Moultrie. “You also can use a hydrating mist that has essential oils to make your skin look dewy.” Both products will prep your skin before your regular concealing routine.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,857

In a recent interview with OUT magazine, Franco spoke about his past struggles: “I have a very addictive personality.  “When I was a teenager I got over certain addictions, and that’s when I started acting, at age 17.  “I really threw myself into it, and that became everything, to the point where I didn’t even socialise. And then after, like, 10 years of that, at age 27, I realised, ‘Man, I’m so depressed. On the surface my life seems pretty good — I have a career and everything — but I feel isolated and lonely’.  “I’ve started a new chapter of my life. I was very work-addicted, and addicted to other things — not substances, I got over that a long time ago — but I’ve recently changed my life, and this is part of my therapy,"" he added.  “Most actors come to a point in their lives where they have to reassess what they’re doing and why they’re doing it. And for me, after going back to school and trying to do all these other things, this new chapter, with surfing and dancing, is really about slowing down and trying to focus on fewer things but in a deeper, more quality-filled way.”  Franco also insists that he will continue to act saying: “I’ve got to say, of all the things that I’ve done, and I’ve done a lot, the actual process of directing is the most fun, because you’re in the middle of all these different creative people. But no, I will not stop acting.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,389

Ten people were killed and 10 more wounded after a 17-year-old carrying a shotgun and revolver opened fire at the high school about 30 miles from downtown Houston.  According to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, nine of the victims were students. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools.""  According to police officials, the 17-year-old is in custody and has been charged with capital murder and a second person has been detained.  Shortly after the shooting, Watt tweeted, ""Absolutely horrific.""  Watt has been active in the surrounding community since he was drafted by Houston in 2011. Most notably, he started a fundraiser last August that raised more than $37 million for those affected by the flooding from Hurricane Harvey.  The Texans also released a statement.

The actress had a flurry of thoughts on the topic over the weekend while chatting with fans on Twitter. Doherty’s opinion is nuanced and complex; she isn’t simply pro- or anti-reboot. Based on her tweets, she’s intrigued and curious about the new project, and doesn’t want to be negative about it — she even defends the idea of a reboot in general — yet strongly agrees with some fans who object to the network’s description of the project as “feminist reboot” of the original series (when the 1998-2006 series was considered feminist too).  Getty Images  First, on the very idea of a reboot:  Im intrigued by the idea that a new generation might be comforted, inspired like all you were. Charmed helped us all in some way — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  And notes that it will mean more lead roles for women…  Exactly. More great roles for women. That’s a huge plus. — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  Likewise, while some have slammed the idea of bringing back Charmed as unoriginal, The WB series actually followed 1996’s similarly premised film The Craft and the 1995 book Practical Magic (which released a film version the same year Charmed hit the air). So at one point, the original Charmed was likewise considered by some to be a knock-off…  I get that but I can tell you that we were inspired by practical magic. So again, they should perhaps simply do a show inspired by Charmed — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  And Doherty would rather not be negative about it…  Thank you. I love charmed. I also want it to be respected. I’m simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life. — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  BUT … that official description though … (which described the new series this way: “This fierce, funny, feminist reboot of the original series centers on three sisters in a college town who discover they are witches. Between vanquishing supernatural demons, tearing down the patriarchy, and maintaining familial bonds, a witch’s work is never done”).  Yep. You nailed it. Their wording is terrible and a bit offensive. But, everyone makes mistakes. Perhaps with the backlash they will be more thoughtful in future. — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  Yes I addressed this…. very ignorant stupid comment. Perhaps made by a millennial that never watched the show and just read a synopsis on it. — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  Also, the reboot’s new cast better have different character names…  It will rub me the wrong way too — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  Oh, and in case you’re wondering what Doherty is watching lately:  That’s why I rarely watch network tv. Alienist, Gypsy, narcos, big little lies, Ozark, American horror story, the crown, peaky blinders, godless… just a few I watch. — Shannen Doherty (@DohertyShannen) January 27, 2018  Previously, co-star Holly Marie Combs had her turn to weigh in on the Charmed reboot.

Shahidi, who was accepted at every college to which she applied, had to face the same difficult choice of every incoming freshman: where should she spend the next few formative years of her life? But this decision might not have been a hard one for her. One of Shahidi’s mentors—and the author of one of her recommendation letters—was none other than Michelle Obama, Harvard alumna and the mother of incoming Harvard freshman Malia Obama, who will start there this fall after her own gap year.  On Tuesday, Shahidi announced her decision on Instagram with a quote from James Baldwin: “The paradox of education is precisely this—that as one begins to become conscious one begins to examine the society in which he is being educated.”  Shahidi’s passion for education has no doubt been influenced by Obama, a double Ivy League graduate (she attended both Princeton and Harvard Law). During a March interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Shahidi told the late-night host a little more about her special recommendation letter.  “I heard you got a recommendation letter from the First Lady, from Michelle Obama . . . How did you get that?” Kimmel asked the actress, who said she would graduate from high school this year.  “Um, hard work,” Shahidi, said, simply, before adding that she was also especially flattered to receive a recommendation from her A.P. calculus teacher at the Dwight School in New York City.  In truth, some of her hard work has been on the First Lady’s education initiative, Let Girls Learn, which is how she got to know Obama. Yes, this is the same program that the Trump administration is reportedly planning to cut, although the White House denied this is the case in early May.  Regardless of what happens under the leadership of this new White House, be comforted to know that Harvard will now be home to not one but two more Michelle Obamas in the making.

ec1bf4b4-12cf-4302-9a7a-502d9b2d4093,"A dream come true! Ray J and Princess Love are expecting their first child together.  The “Sexy Can I” singer, 36, announced the news while appearing as a guest cohost on The Real on Monday, November 27. “Love is on my mind. Love is on my heart. Princess and I are expecting,” he gushed before standing up and clapping for himself.  “I’mma be a dad,” Ray J (real name William Norwood Jr.) continued. “I’m nervous, excited. It finally happened. My first one.”  The on-off couple tied the knot in Los Angeles in August 2016. Their fertility struggles were chronicled throughout season 4 of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, and they further expressed their frustrations during the VH1 reality series’ reunion special in October.  “I don’t know the process of it — when it actually happened, what night — but it was special because we was trying for a while,” Ray J, who starred in a sex tape with ex Kim Kardashian in 2003, said on The Real. “It’s not as easy as people think. For some people, they just go on tour and get everybody pregnant. But for me, it was love. We took our time, and as we were taking our time, it just took a little while.”  The “I Hit It First” crooner, who is the brother of singer Brandy and first cousin of rapper Snoop Dogg, went on to explain that he and his model wife, 33, do not know the sex of their child just yet. “I want to have a little girl first because it’s like daddy’s little girl,” he explained. “A little boy is probably going to be a little aggressive, so I just want to be able to have some peace first. But whatever God blesses us with, I’m happy.”  After Ray J announced the news, Princess Love shared a photo of her growing baby bump on Instagram. “It’s such a blessing from God to be able to carry our child,” she captioned the post. “We kept this to ourselves until after the first trimester because it’s bad luck to announce too early. But we’re so proud to share this journey with you guys. Thank you for all of the love and prayers.”  It’s such a blessing from God to be able to carry our child.

00387255-1394-4800-b119-40cfaf11ea25,"Brad Pitt, Neri Oxman Designing “Love Nest” Together?  10:26  Brad Pitt and Neri Oxman are not teaming up on a “romantic” architecture project, despite a bogus tabloid report. The article claims the actor and MIT professor are designing a “love nest” together, but a rep for Pitt tells Gossip Cop that’s completely false.  According to the National Enquirer, the actor is planning to build a “one-of-a-kind architectural masterpiece” with Oxman, who teaches art, architecture and design at the prestigious MIT Media Lab. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “Brad’s not only inspired, he’s entranced with the brilliant brunette beauty.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Pitt and Oxman have “been secretly scouting location sites, looking for a perfect spot to make their artistic vision a groundbreaking reality.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster adds, “He’s nuts about Neri. He wants to build a palace with her… Their ‘special project’ is Brad’s dream come true.”  As Gossip Cop has repeatedly noted, the movie star and professor aren’t dating. Pitt’s own spokesperson has told us this on the record several times, and trusted entertainment publications have backed it up. E! News recently reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends,” while People similarly stated that Pitt and Oxman’s friendship “is not romantic in nature.”  Even if the two were to team up on an architecture project, it certainly wouldn’t be a “love nest.” Of course, this outlet’s narrative is coming from an anonymous and almost assuredly made-up “source.” Meanwhile, Pitt’s rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that there’s “no truth” to the tabloid’s tale and that he’s not designing any type of structure with her at all.  It’s true that the pair met last year through a project at MIT, but they have no plans to construct a building together. Nor have they been “secretly scouting” locations. It’s telling that the unreliable magazine provides zero details about the areas where they’re supposedly exploring.  Unfortunately, the National Enquirer has been pushing a nonexistent romance between Pitt and Oxman ever since the news broke last month that he had visited her MIT class in November 2017. For example, Gossip Cop recently busted the publication for falsely claiming Angelina Jolie was “furious” about Pitt and Oxman’s relationship, and that she might even use it against him in their custody negotiations. And one month before the tabloid discovered the MIT professor existed, the outlet had wrongly reported Pitt had reunited with Jennifer Aniston. The untrustworthy magazine, which seems to change its narrative whenever it’s convenient, clearly has no real insight into the actor’s personal life.

64fce192-070b-4fcd-9745-1e6902f8ba8b,"Britney Spears has lived almost half of her life in the public spotlight. Ever since her debut album, “…Baby One More Time,” was released in January 1999, Britney hasn’t made a move without the paparazzi recording her every movement. The album became the biggest selling record ever by a teenage artist and solidified Britney’s status as a superstar.  Britney back in the day:  [[contentId: 2002137| | size: 75]]  One of the most highly publicized events in Britney’ life is her brief marriage to back up dancer, Kevin Federline who she had only known for three months before marrying him on September 18, 2004. (They were not legally married until October 6 after their prenuptial agreement was finalized.) Since Federline’s ex-girlfriend, actress Shar Jackson was pregnant with their second child at the time, Britney’s engagement and marriage to Federline was the subject of intense media scrutiny. While Federline waited for one woman to give birth to his baby, Britney announced in October 2004 she would be taking a career break to start a family with her new husband.  The newlyweds in 2004:  HOW DID THE BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE RUMORS START?  In 2005, the couple signed a deal for a reality television series, “Britney and Kevin: Chaotic,” a five-episode series chronicling the couple’s relationship from their courtship and engagement to their wedding. The show aired on UPN from May 17 to June 14, 2005 and used footage that was shot during the European leg of Britney’s The Onyx Hotel Tour. Britney had originally intended to shoot backstage footage of the concert tour for a reality show called, “OnTourage” but had to scrap the tour after undergoing arthroscopic surgery following a knee injury while she was shooting a music video.  Britney said about the reality show, “From the day that Kevin and I met, there have been constant rumors and inaccurate speculation about our lives together. I feel that last year, the tabloids ran my life and I am really excited about showing my fans what really happened, rather than all the stories which have been misconstrued by journalists in the past. As I mentioned before, I am now going to be expressing my personal life through art.”  The tagline from the show was, “Can you handle our truth?”  The 5 episode series later came out on DVD:  The show was panned by critics who deemed the show as being too explicit and criticized Britney’s excessive narcissism. In the series, the pop star is seen talking about how the couple’s bedroom antics are “so good” and begs Kevin to let her take the day off “to just fuck all day.” She’s also seen quizzing her staff and crew about their sex lives and favorite sexual positions. During her pregnancy, Britney told reporters that her sex life was the best it had ever been since she conceived claiming, “I think it’s the best. Sex is crazy good.” Talk like this is generally what births and fuels sex tape rumors since the thought process is if the sex is that great, it must have been captured on video especially if the participants involved are celebrities.  A pregnant Britney with Federline. Now we get why they’re smiling:  IS THERE A BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE?  Rumors about a Britney and Kevin sex tape didn’t heat up until Us Weekly said in its October 17, 2005 “Hot Stuff” column that the couple watched “sex tape footage” with their lawyers and that the video was supposedly shot by a member of their entourage. Other rumors circulated that a member of Britney’s entourage copied one of the couple’s personal video tapes and a source reportedly told America’s Us Weekly magazine, “He has threatened to release raunchy footage of the two taken before Spears looked pregnant.”  Britney responded to the US Weekly story by filing a $10 million defamation lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court declaring in court documents that, “My husband and I have not filmed ourselves having sex. Therefore, we obviously did not bring any ‘sex tape’ to our lawyers’ offices for any reason, nor were we concerned that someone from our ‘entourage’ was threatening to release a tape since no ‘X-rated’ tape exists. The entire story is a complete fabrication. In fact, the first time that I heard about the alleged ‘sex tape‘ is when I first heard about the article.” Britney went on to say the report was “damaging” to her career and reputation particularly with her younger audience and pointed out that she had “repeatedly rejected substantial monetary offers to pose in photographs or appear in feature films with my breasts exposed.” Ultimately, a judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that since Britney has “put her modern sexuality squarely and profitably before the public eye,” that she can’t be defamed by rumors of any such alleged sex tape. However, the ruling did not address whether or not the story about a purported sex tape was true.  Guess this is what the judge meant:  Gossip about a sex tape only increased when in November 2006, two months after giving birth to her second child with Federline, Britney filed for divorce citing irreconcilable differences. Another rumor then emerged that Federline was shopping the alleged tape to the highest bidder and using it as leverage to get more money from the divorce proceedings. This was followed by another rumor suggesting Britney would leak the tape herself to prevent Federline from profiting. Britain’s News of the World offered Federline $50 million for the sex tape if it indeed existed.  Hoping to put an end to any and all sex tape rumors, the divorcing couple jointly released an official statement through their attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan. The statement said, “There is not a sex video of Kevin and Britney in existence. It goes without saying that the stories of Kevin attempting to sell such a video are patently false and anyone who reports that they have information of such attempts is either lying or reporting the lie of someone else.” The statement went on to say, “It would be impossible to comment upon and correct all of the other misinformation about Kevin that appears on a daily basis and consequently no attempt has been made, or will be made, to do so.” Britney and Federline’s divorce was finalized in July 2007 after the ex-couple reached a settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their children.  The short love story ends:  IS THERE A BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE WITH ANOTHER PERSON?  In February 2007, Britney became an unwitting star of a surveillance tape at a nightclub, One in New York City. The video reportedly shows the singer wearing fishnet stockings and a bikini while partying and eventually getting intimate with two female dancers who were fired after the manager of the club saw the video. The New York Daily News reported that a source said there were also pictures of Britney’s naked rear taken while she was trying on clothes with the dancers. The expectation was that it would leak to the internet however, the video still hasn’t surfaced.  Britney with her own dancers during a show:  In December 2007, Britney started dating celebrity photographer Adnan Ghalib who was her boyfriend during her very public mental breakdown at the beginning of 1998. By May, their relationship was over and rumors started that Ghalib wanted to sell a sex tape they had shot while they were on vacation in Mexico in January. Ghalib reportedly told British entertainment magazine, Heat, “There is such a tape. But I won’t discuss prices for hypothetical inquiries. Unless there is a locked-in deal, I will go no further. I am not interested in selling out any other details about Britney.” British newspaper The Sun said a source told them that the two-hour X-rated footage features the pop princess naked wearing just a pink wig. The insider alleges that “The video starts with Britney undressing. She was wearing some cheap clothes that she bought down there in Rosarito. The sex wasn’t particularly kinky but Britney wears a pink wig throughout. At one point in the tape Adnan asks that singer to remove the pink bob but she refused,” the source says. “Adnan tells her to take it off at one point and she says coyly, ‘Take what off? There’s nothing left to take off.’”  Although in October 2008, British tabloid Daily Star quoted a Spears family source as saying that Britney was planning to fight Ghalib in court over the sex tape, nothing materialized and neither has the alleged sex tape.  Britney and Ghalib before their break-up:  BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BRITNEY SPEARS SEX TAPE SITE?  Although there is a Britney Spears sex tape site, there’s no sex tape available. The site is best for seeing upskirt or nip slip pictures of the singer and there is a nice selection of those since Britney has been known to have a few very public “off” moments. However, clicking on any link advertising a sex tape will only take you to a paid adult website. Also, unfortunately or fortunately, Britney’s All American looks can be copied by many American girls so an internet search will reveal several videos featuring girls claiming to be Britney. In reality, they’re just girls who resemble her. The most circulated video is one of a Britney look-a-like performing oral sex on someone who is supposedly Federline. There’s even one video on the net that claims to be Britney but you can’t even see the people’s faces in the footage.  The best thing for Britney Spears fans to do is to enjoy the various photographs and videos of the pop princess that is out there especially the ones of her in her heyday. Not shy in front of the camera and remember, a Superior Court judge ruled that Britney has no problem putting her modern sexuality before the public eye. So until a real Britney sex tape surfaces, fans will just have to be comforted by her the available modern sexuality that is out there and fortunately for them, there is plenty.  It was 18 year-old Britney’s idea to dress as a Catholic school girl for the video.

Since Meghan Markle is marrying into the Royal family, she will likely wear something a bit more conservative with touches that embody her unique and captivating sense of style. This Justin Alexander high neck tonal beaded and embroidered lace fit and flare wedding dress is subtly sexy. The floral and heraldry motifs layered over silk tulle and silk charmeuse provide a refined elegance that is appropriate yet untraditional.

According to E! News , ""Chalamet arrived around 9:30 p.m. with a male pal and had dinner. Gomez walked in with a few girlfriends about two hours later. Chalamet chatted with her on the phone before she arrived and the two found each other inside. They sat next to each other at a table and appeared to enjoy a friendly chat over drinks. Gomez had a martini, while Chalamet was seen with a Jack and Coke.""  The two met and became friends last year while filming A Rainy Day In New York , in which they play a romantic couple. It's been speculated that the film, written and directed by Woody Allen, may not get much by way of a theatrical release, since public sentiment has largely turned on the alleged child molester and confirmed daughter-marrier. The sporadic Timothée-and-Selena sighting may be as close as we get to seeing the film.  Since completing production, Chalamet has publicly disavowed the project, announcing on Instagram that he would be donating his salary to charity.  Loading View on Instagram  Gomez has addressed the Woody Allen issue less directly, telling Billboard that she auditioned for the roject multiple times and that the allegations were ""something, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, 'Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.'""

Now, a romantic comedy about a young dramatic actor stealing a the most followed girl on Instagram away from her Canadian bad boy-turned-super-Christian boyfriend, on the other hand, would definitely get a wide release.

af299232-8f4e-4582-a74f-b3e459627473,"© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  One of this week’s new tabloids claims John Legend and Chrissy Teigen are “on the verge of splitting,” but there’s no truth to the breakup tale. The magazine says the couple have been in therapy to fix their alleged marriage problems, but Gossip Cop looked into the report and we can exclusively set the record straight.  Teigen opened up earlier this year about suffering postpartum depression after giving birth to daughter Luna last year, as well as her struggle with drinking too much. The model has since taken steps to work through both issues, but the latest issue of In Touch insists her marriage is falling apart over the situation.  “They are fighting nonstop,” a so-called “insider” tells the magazine. “They have been in marriage counseling for the last six months. They’re trying very hard to make their marriage work.”  The outlet’s questionable source further alleges there’s “a terrible atmosphere” in Teigen and Legend’s home because she’s “been acting paranoid and jealous” and “they end up fighting about it all the time.” The supposed insider continues, “John has tried to be patient because he realizes this is a difficult time for Chrissy, but he is getting wiped out… It seems like they are trying to get through the day.” The dubious source concludes, “John and Chrissy’s friends worry the marriage just won’t survive.”  But Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the couple about their alleged marital woes, and we’re exclusively assured the tabloid’s account of events is simply “not true.” We’re told Legend and Teigen’s relationship is going strong, and the claim otherwise is entirely inaccurate. Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time we’ve had to debunk a phony article about the happy spouses being at odds.  Gossip Cop busted MediaTakeOut two years ago when it wrongly alleged Legend and Teigen were “headed for divorce” over constant arguments. Obviously, the couple is still very much together, and this latest story regarding their supposed marriage problems is equally bogus.

At age 34, Katharine McPhee is engaged to her boyfriend, 68-year-old David Foster.  A rep for the former “American Idol” star confirmed the engagement with Fox News Wednesday.  TMZ reported the celebrated music producer popped the question during their European vacation.  While it’s unknown which day he proposed, the celebrity gossip site claimed McPhee was flaunting her engagement ring while on the Italian island of Capri Sunday. She was also allegedly showing off her rock to family and friends on FaceTime.  This will be McPhee’s second marriage and Foster’s fifth. The music mogul was previously married to B.J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, Linda Thompson and Yolanda Hadid.  The couple first sparked dating rumors in May 2017, but wouldn’t confirm their relationship until late last year.  In October, Foster’s 35-year-old daughter Erin praised McPhee to People Magazine.  “She’s amazing,” gushed Erin at the time. “I really like her. She’s awesome. My dad is kind of a hopeless romantic, and Katherine’s awesome. We really, really like her, and we’ve known her for a really long time. And if he’s happy, we’re happy.”  And McPhee hasn't been shy about praising her beau.

He’s really a special person in my life.  ""What I’ve learned from him is how lucky we are to do what we do. He’s always reminding me and it’s comforting to know that it’s people to walk through this life he’s had – working with incredible people, being friends with ex-presidents and world leaders – and still have that perspective. He’s so well-connected, but still just a simple guy from Canada with his little Canadian accent!”  McPhee also told Health magazine in December she has known Foster for years. The couple previously collaborated for a few live performances, including his 2008 PBS tribute concert “Hit Man: David Foster & Friends.”  “We’re very close friends, and we’ve been friends for a long time,” said the “American Idol” Season 5 runner-up. “I’m really, really fond of him, and I think he’s an incredible person.

The cop cuffed him, and Miles had trouble standing in one spot.  Now the turning point. San Diego offers a detox program where cops will take someone who is drunk to a center run by volunteers. The center has cots where someone can stay for 4 hours and sleep it off. The cop offered to take Miles there but we're told he refused.  At that point Miles could have been arrested, but cops still took him to the detox center ... hoping he'd cooperate. That didn't happen.

d5c412b6-9864-4f15-a6ba-21213321253e,"Despite all the she-said, she-said in the Taylor Swift/Katy Perry feud, Ed Sheeran said in a recent interview that he thinks the back-and-forth is overblown.  “I don’t think she needs [to be defended] at all,” he told People magazine at the 2017 Songwriters Hall of Fame 48th Annual Induction and Awards Gala. “I don’t think feud songs are a hot thing – there’s always been beef songs.” Sheeran specifically cited Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” as an example of a classic “diss track”; Simon revealed in 2015 that she penned the 1972 hit with Warren Beatty in mind.  Earlier this year, Perry incurred the wrath of many Swift fans after the release of her hit “Swish Swish,” which many interpreted as a direct attack on the “Wildest Dreams” singer.  “Don’t you come for me / No, not today / You’re calculated / I got your number / ‘Cause you’re a joker / And I’m a courtside killer queen,” one verse partly reads.  (As though confirming that the song was indeed about Swift, Perry changed the lyrics to hold a more conciliatory tone during a live-streamed concert: “God bless you on your journey, baby girl.” Days earlier, Perry had delivered that same line when chatting with Arianna Huffington about Swift.)  “I am ready to let it go,” she said at the time. “I forgive her and I’m sorry for anything I ever did, and I hope the same from here. I think it’s actually like, I think it’s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I’m saying? … There’s a lot of other things out there in the world that people need to be focused on, and I truly, like God bless her on her journey. God bless her. Honestly.”  Earlier this month, Swift seemed to make a not-so-subtle point when she announced the release of her entire back catalog on all streaming services – just as Perry dropped her fourth studio album, Witness.  Perry and Swift’s fallout dates back to 2014, when Swift suggested in a Rolling Stone interview that Perry had once stolen backup dancers out from under her, effectively throwing a wrench in their friendship.  Swift’s hit from that same year, “Bad Blood,” is widely assumed to be about Perry.  As for Swift and Sheeran, their platonic friendship is rock-solid. “We’ve gotten matching Scottish folds, made each other arts and crafts Christmas presents, vacationed with our families, and had each other’s backs,” Swift told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “He is the James Taylor to my Carole King and I can’t imagine a time when he wouldn’t be.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,560

In recent weeks, both Kim Kardashian and her younger sister, Kylie Jenner have welcomed new baby girls after super secret pregnancies. Add in the fact that middle-sister Khloe is also pregnant and expecting her first child in early April, according to her Twitter, and the Kardashian clan couldn’t be happier. Still, you’ve heard the saying ‘when it rains it pours.’ Sure enough, ENews’ sneak peeks of the newest episode airing this Sunday, February 25 show Kourtney dishing to her sisters about a potential little cousin for brand new babies, Chicago and Stormi. So, straight up: Is Kourtney Kardashian pregnant? Is she really going to freeze her eggs?  While there are no confirmations at this point that Kourtney Kardashian is pregnant, Kourtney’s own words suggest she’s got baby number four on her mind. And we know KUWTK crews film episodes several weeks to months before they air. Spoiler videos for this Sunday’s episode, “Trimester Trouble,” reveal Kourtney’s plan to freeze her eggs as “insurance,” that she can have a fourth child in the future. So will we know at the end of this episode if Kourtney’s going to freeze her eggs?  Kourtney also revealed that she uses an IUD as birth control with her current boyfriend, model, Younes Bendjima, 24. Adding, however, that she wouldn’t mind taking it out if her partner wanted children in the near term. It seems that the Kardashian women are on a pregnancy roll. But what about the boys, or should we say, Kardashian Kastoffs?  Kardashian Exes Talk Babies and New Boyfriends  Khloe’s ex-husband, Lamar Odom discloses in a not-yet-aired interview with Access Hollywood, that he’s happy for Khloe about her pregnancy with new boyfriend, Cavaliers player, Tristan Thompson. Lamar can be heard saying that, “it couldn’t happen to a better person,” US Magazine reports. Still, he admits hearing the bombshell Khloe divulged in the season 13 finale, that she was only “fake trying” to get pregnant while she was married to him, was “hurtful.”  Similarly, Kylie’s famous on-again-off-again ex-boyfriend, Tyga had good things to say about Kylie and her new baby. He told radio interviewer, DJ Akademiks that, “there’s no bad blood, no problems.” And while the 28-year-old rapper didn’t comment on Stormi specifically during this interview, he did admit that he and Kylie still “communicate.” And that did nothing to squash internet rumors that Tyga may be the biological father of the 20-year-old cosmetics mogul’s new daughter.  And what about Kourtney’s ex and baby-daddy, Scott Disick? The man who got Kourtney Kardashian pregnant three times in the past is plenty busy hitting the town with new girlfriend, 19-year-old Sophia Richie, younger daughter of Lionel Richie.

The actress was joined by daughters Zahara, 13, and Shiloh, 11, during a UNHCR trip to the Zataari refugee camp in Jordan on Sunday.

One girl told Jolie and her daughters, “We believe if the adults can make peace now, we young women will build on that peace and help.”  The project, in partnership with International Relief and Development, is designed to fight the epidemic of refugees dropping out of school, with only 20 percent completing a secondary school education.

The vast majority of them already live below the poverty line, on less than three dollars a day. Imagine what that would mean for your family,” she said in a speech. “Here, it means families going without sufficient food; children unable to get medical treatment; young girls vulnerable to early marriage; and many Syrians facing their seventh winter without proper shelter.”  RELATED: All About Angelina Jolie’s Connection to Cambodia That Led to Her Golden Globe Nominated Film  The actress added, “Humanitarian aid is not a long-term solution.

06fc7f80-1657-497f-959b-df7aea3f2075,"In the seven months since his abrupt separation from wife Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt has kept a low profile. It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ.  Pitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied.  The GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, “tumbling through” three national parks, and a music video.  But according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the “self-inflicted” situation he’s in.  But instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly “ripped apart” the Internet has sided with him.  An article titled “Why Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword” published on E! said, “Throwing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he’s gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he’s doing to right the ship.”  Vanity Fair said, “Pitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he’s doing a lot of work on himself.”  And Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: “People like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.”  The BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have “Total copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,” on the interview.  “But of course the timing is calculated,” Borkowski continues. “The language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.”  “A lot of people prefer to stay before the waterline and not do it. He’s taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn’t go this far.”  Follow @htshowbiz for more  First Published: May 05, 2017 10:06 IST",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,553
7ae7382b-8add-4cab-a730-c6ca8d08c089,"Orlando Bloom is a popular British actor and heartthrob known for his roles in 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films.  Who Is Orlando Bloom? Born on January 13, 1977, in Canterbury, England, Orlando Bloom studied acting as a child before he was cast as the heroic Legolas in Peter Jackson's film adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Bloom also found major success starring in three films of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise with Johnny Depp. He's landed other roles in big-screen fare, including Troy, Elizabethtown and The Three Musketeers. Orlando Bloom (Photo: WireImage)  Movies  'The Lord of the Rings' Days before his graduation, Bloom was cast in Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy trilogy, The Lord of the Rings. The first film of the trilogy, 2001's The Fellowship of the Ring, was a huge blockbuster and critical success. Bloom went on to perform in the two Ring follow-ups; he plays Legolas Greenleaf, a long-haired immortal elf who balances refinement and wisdom with sharp archery and camaraderie, throughout the popular film series. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' Franchise After garnering a noted role in Black Hawk Down (2001), another big part was on the horizon for Bloom. In 2003 he starred as the sensitive Will Turner in the Disney action/adventure The Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, alongside Keira Knightley and Johnny Depp. Pirates marked another huge world blockbuster for Bloom, who would go on to star in the next two sequels of the franchise: Dead's Man Chest (2006) and At World's End (2007). ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Troy,' 'Elizabethtown' Bloom continued doing period work, playing Paris in the 2004 film Troy, which also stars Brad Pitt and Eric Bana. The following year, the actor was featured as a leading man in two films: Ridley Scott's Crusades epic Kingdom of Heaven and Cameron Crowe's drama Elizabethtown (both released in 2005). Then, in 2006, Bloom appeared with actress Zoe Saldana in the thriller Haven, which he also co-produced. In between his more high-profile Hollywood work, Bloom has starred in indie fare like Ned Kelley (2003) and New York, I Love You (2009). Additionally, in 2007, he returned to the stage for a London revival of In Celebration. 'The Three Musketeers,' 'The Hobbit' Another cape-and-sword opportunity arose for Bloom when he was cast in a 2011 update of The Three Musketeers, which failed to catch hold at the U.S. box office. The actor then returned to working with Jackson, reprising his role as Greenleaf for portions of The Hobbit film trilogy, the first installment of which was released in December 2012: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. Bloom reprised his role as Will Turner for a fifth time in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017) and showed his sense of humor in the Andy Samberg-led mockumentary Tour de Pharmacy, playing the character Juju Pepe. In 2018 he starred in the British-Chinese thriller action flick S.M.A.R.T. Chase.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,610
92391185-8bec-4edc-8095-08f25719380e,"After transgender New York nightlife fixture Amanda Lepore dished in her new memoir, “Doll Parts,” about a relationship with an unnamed rapper, sources have speculated the hip-hop maven in question could be Kanye West.  A New York Times profile this week on voluptuous Lepore says that in the book, “Ms. Lepore describes having an assignation with a famous rapper whose songs often play in the clubs she frequents. Soon after, she writes, he got married, and ‘I couldn’t help but think that his wife had a similar body type to me.’ ”  That sparked buzz that the unnamed rapper was West — now married to curvy reality queen Kim Kardashian.  But rap fans may have to keep guessing.  A pal of Kanye’s shot down any such rumors by telling us: “That is not within the realm of possibility.” Lepore did not get back to us to confirm or deny the identity of the rapper of her alleged “assignation.”  An attorney for West responded that the rapper has never met Lepore, and has never even heard of her.  Meanwhile, West is also being talked about in the Hamptons this week. A year ago, it was announced that he’d perform a special piece at the arty Watermill Center Summer Benefit & Auction with its influential artistic director Robert Wilson — but it was pulled last minute, and Ja Rule filled in.  At the time, a source explained to us that West couldn’t attend because “it was all too last-minute.”  And reps for the event added, “Robert Wilson and Kanye West have made an artistic decision to postpone their collaboration” until 2017.  But an updated tip sheet for this year’s benefit, which takes place July 29, went out Thursday with no mention of West. The benefit this year will honor French star Isabelle Huppert and late rocker Lou Reed, with a performance of a “poem with musical accompaniment” by Reed’s widow, Laurie Anderson.  A Watermill rep explained of West’s absence: “With the decision to make this year’s benefit a tribute to Lou Reed, it was natural curatorial progression to highlight a special performance by our honoree Laurie Anderson.”  West has kept a low profile since his breakdown last year.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,431

The daytime talk show host gushed about how beautiful Portia is after her People’s Choice Awards this past week.  Ellen and Portia have been struggling to keep their marriage alive these last few months. And now Ellen is apparently trying to squash divorce buzz, despite ongoing media reports about their troubled marriage. Ellen gushed about Portia to reporters backstage at the People’s Choice Awards. In an interview with ET Online, Ellen joked, “It’s such an accident because she normally doesn’t look beautiful like that.” Was Ellen’s joke a backhanded compliment? Did Portia take her comments the wrong way? That’s what fans want to know.  Previous reports indicate that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have been dealing with marital issues for months now. In fact, insiders claim that Portia even considered quitting her Hollywood career and moving back to Australia. She simply doesn’t want to deal with any of her marital drama anymore.  Back in November, it was reported that Portia felt suffocated in her marriage. Apparently, Ellen is a different person behind closed doors. Her fans know her as a fun-loving and positive television talk show host, but her friends and family members see it differently. Insiders indicate that Ellen loves to control and micro-manage every aspect of Portia’s life. She feels like she lives in a golden cage simply because Ellen is supposedly pulling all the strings in their marriage.  Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi divorce reports have floated around for months now. Back in July, Ellen even took Portia to the Wimbledon Finals in London just to prove to the media that they were in fact still together.  Of course, this isn’t the first time Ellen has made headlines for her questionable behavior. Earlier this month eyewitnesses claim that Ellen was confronted by a waitress after she failed to leave a tip at a café. Fellow comedienne Kathy Griffin also called Ellen out for her supposed two-face character.  So far, Ellen DeGeneres herself has not made any comments about the divorce reports.

fbf025fc-b701-4ca2-8527-43424acf4b43,"HBO has closed deals with four different writers to explore multiple possible spinoffs of “Game of Thrones.”  The premium cable channel says that there is no timeline for development of the projects. “We’ll take as much or as little time as the writers need and, as with all our development, we will evaluate what we have when the scripts are in,” a spokesperson said.  The four writers are Max Borenstein (“Kong: Skull Island”), Jane Goldman (“Kingsman: The Golden Circle”), Brian Helgeland (“Legend”), and Carly Wray (“Mad Men,” “The Leftovers”). Goldman and Wray will each be working individually with novelist and “Game of Thrones” creator George R. R. Martin.  “Game of Thrones” executive producers and showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff will be attached to the four projects, as will Martin, but will not write on any of them.  A spinoff to “Game of Thrones” — the most watched series in HBO history — has been a source of speculation for years. In recent months, HBO executive began to privately acknowledge that the network was searching for writers to develop ideas based on the series and Martin’s best-selling fantasy novels from which it is adapted.  Related ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7: First Photos  Asked about a possible spinoff last year at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, HBO programming president Casey Bloys said, “We’ve talked about it. It’s something I’m not opposed to. But, of course, it has to make sense creatively. I am not sure that the guys [Weiss and Benioff] can really wrap their heads around it when they’re just about to start production. It’s a pretty intense production. They’re about to start production soon, but I’m open to it. The guys weren’t opposed to it, but there is no concrete plans, or anything like that at this point.”  Season 7 of “Game of Thrones” is set to premiere July 16. Production on the show pushed the premiere of the new season past its usual April start date, in order to capture the weather the producers wanted. The new season will consist of seven episodes. The eighth and final season, which Weiss and Benioff have already begun writing, will be between six and eight episodes.  The Season 6 finale of “Game of Thrones” drew a series-high 8.9 million viewers in overnight numbers —an especially high number given premium HBO’s much smaller viewer base than broadcast and basic-cable nets. Season 6 averaged 23.3 million multiplatform viewers, according to the service.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,514

Unlike many Hollywood figures, the “Mad Men” alum does not have a social media presence — and he intends to keep it that way.  “The point of life is not to put dog ears on yourself and post it online for everyone to see,” Hamm said, referencing Snapchat’s popular filters. “It’s fun, it’s adorable, but it’s the visual equivalent of masturbating — there’s no point other than immediate gratification.”  The 46-year-old actor, who split in 2015 from Jennifer Westfeldt, his partner of 18 years, also said during the interview that he does not particularly enjoy being single.  Also Read: Tituss Burgess on Why He Has 'No Hopes' for His 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt' Character (Video)  “It’s hard to be single after being together for a long time,” he said. It’s really hard. It sucks.”  Hamm, who appears in this summer’s “Baby Driver,” said he would rather be part of a beloved project that touches the zeitgeist like “Mad Men” than become the world’s biggest A-lister.  “We all want to be involved in something that takes hold of the culture and makes people sit up and say, ‘Hey, that’s interesting,'” he said. “Actually, that’s all I ever wanted. I never wanted to be a Tom Cruise type of megastar.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,300

Katy originally listed the sprawling home 13-months ago, but a lack of offers is understood to have resulted in a modest reduction on its original $9.285 million valuation.

Well, that ship has well and truly sailed. Now fans are concerned there's something seriously wrong with the 54-year-old. Over the weekend, photos emerged of Johnny posing with fans at the Four Seasons hotel in St Petersburg, Russia. And he looked VERY different.  Looking at the snaps, Amber Heard's ex-husband cuts a pale and gaunt figure. Fans were also quick to point out just how much weight he appears to have lost, with many speculating it could be a result of potential illness or stress.  Johnny Depp: Then and now  ← Slide →  ← Slide →  ""Is he good health wise?"" one person asked, while another guessed, ""It's either stress or he real sick. I'm praying it's for a movie."" And they could be right. Johnny, who is currently touring with his rock tribute band the Hollywood Vampires, is starring in a new film called Richard Says Goodbye.  In the film, the actor is portraying Richard - a college professor who is diagnosed with a terminal illness. Onlookers who've seen Johnny recently agree that this could be the reason behind his drastic transformation. One person took to Twitter, advising the photos that sparked concerns were actually misleading. @its_batcounty claimed they saw Johnny in concert and he looked well.

49c6aec5-a0a9-434f-9a9b-abe7ba7cbaa6,"Jennifer Lawrence revealed that negative reviews for mother! caused a strain in her romantic relationship with the film’s director, Darren Aronofsky.  During an interview with Adam Sandler for Variety’s Actors on Actors series, the Oscar winner revealed that Aronofsky’s reactions to the film’s negative reception became “unhealthy” for them as a couple, and they eventually called it quits in October after one year of dating.  “Normally, I promote a movie, ask people to go see it, and then it’s just out of your hands,” Lawrence, 27, said in the clip. “I normally just kind of let it go. Dating the director was different. We’d be on the [press] tour together, I’d come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie.”  “He comes back from the tour, and that’s all he wants to talk about and I get it,” she continued. “It’s his baby. He wrote it. He conceived it. He directed it. I was doing double duty trying to be a supportive partner, while also being like, ‘Can I please, for the love of God, not think about mother! for one second?’”  Lawrence said that reading the reviews made her be extra protective of him, so she had to put an end to it. “I finally was just like, ‘It’s not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.’ Especially because it’s my man,” she said. “It’s awesome, what we did — some people hate it and the people who hate it, really hate it. But it’s nothing that needs to be defended and if I read a negative review, I just feel defensive.”  The American Hustle actress and the Black Swan director, 48, first met on the set of the psychological horror film. They sparked dating rumors in September 2016, and two months later they were spotted kissing in New York City. “They get along really well,” a source told Us at the time.  In September, Lawrence spoke about the director in an interview with Vogue: “We had energy. I had energy for him. I don’t know how he felt about me,” Lawrence told the magazine. “For the past year, I’ve been dealing with him as just a human. I’ve been in relationships before where I am just confused. And I’m never confused with him.”  The Hunger Games actress has previously dated Nicholas Hoult and Coldplay’s Chris Martin. Aronofsky was previously engaged to Rachel Weisz, with whom he shares 11-year-old son Henry.

7c60a957-7c27-42fe-970a-8da205fc8591,"Taylor Michel Momsen (born July 26, 1993)[1] is an American musician, singer, model, and former actress. She is known for portraying the character of Jenny Humphrey on The CW's teen drama series Gossip Girl (2007–2012) and Cindy Lou Who in the film How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000).[2] She is also known for being the lead singer and frontwoman of the American rock band The Pretty Reckless.  Early life [ edit ]  Momsen was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Her parents are Michael and Collette Momsen and she has a younger sister, Sloane Momsen, who is also an actress. She has Russian ancestry.[3] She was raised Roman Catholic[4] and attended Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic School[5] for elementary school and later Herbert Hoover Middle School in Potomac, Maryland but is now non-religious.[6][7][8] She also studied dance at the Center of Creative Arts in St. Louis.  Momsen was signed with Ford Models at a very young age: ""My parents signed me up with Ford [Modeling] at the age of 2. No 2-year-old wants to be working, but I had no choice. My whole life, I was in and out of school. I didn't have friends. I was working constantly and I didn't have a real life.""[6] She began acting professionally at three years of age in a 1997 national commercial for Shake 'n Bake.[9] She was then cast in The Prophet's Game.  Momsen is included on the list of Unclaimed Coogan accounts for performing children whose partial childhood earnings are mandated to be put in a special fund but who have yet to claim their earnings.[10]  Momsen attended the Professional Performing Arts School in Manhattan for high school alongside Connor Paolo, Gregori Lukas, and Sarah Hyland.[citation needed]  Acting [ edit ]  In 2000, Momsen played the role of Cindy Lou Who in Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, her breakout role. In 2002, she was given the role of Gretel in the motion picture: Hansel and Gretel, as well as Alexandra, the President's daughter, in Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams.  Momsen's career came to a halt for over three years until she received a lead role in the WB series Misconceptions, which never aired. After that, she also appeared in the 2006 film Saving Shiloh. She also auditioned for the title role in Hannah Montana, and was in the top three, but the role was instead awarded to Miley Cyrus—a decision that Momsen was happy with in retrospect.[11] In 2007, she starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film Underdog as Molly and as Jennifer in the movie Paranoid Park, directed by Gus Van Sant.  Beginning in 2007, she played the character of Jenny Humphrey in The CW television series Gossip Girl, based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Momsen's appearances on the series became increasingly sporadic, and, by the end of the first half of the fourth season, she had only appeared in four episodes. It was then announced that the actress would be scheduled for an indefinite hiatus from the show,[12] which ended with her leaving the series as a regular cast member after the completion of the fourth season in 2011. On August 16, 2011, Momsen told Elle magazine that she had quit acting to focus on her music career.[13] On October 16, 2012, it was reported that Momsen would be returning to Gossip Girl for its final episode, in which she appeared briefly in the wedding sequence.[14][15]  Modeling [ edit ]  In June 2008, at the age of fourteen, Momsen signed to IMG Models.[16][17] She was the face of British fashion chain New Look for its spring/summer 2010 collection.[18] After weeks of speculation about who would be the face of Madonna's 2010 fashion line ""Material Girl"", Momsen was announced on July 15, 2010.[19] A week later, Momsen was announced as the model for John Galliano's new women's fragrance, scheduled to launch in autumn 2010.[20] In 2010, she appeared in a video for Galliano's ""Parlez-Moi d'Amour"" fragrance ad campaign.  Momsen is the face of Samantha Thavasa's handbag line. She has done multiple photoshoots, press events, and commercials.[21]  Momsen appeared on the cover of Page Six Magazine when she was 15 years old in 2009. She also appeared on the February 2010 cover of Seventeen.[22] In October 2010, Momsen wore a pair of platform stilettos, thigh-high stockings, and a holster strapped around her leg for Revolver. She appeared on the cover of FHM's March 2012 edition[23] and FHM ranked Momsen #29 in its 2012 Hot 100 issue.[24] She also made her cover debut for Maxim in the November 2013 issue.[25]  Music [ edit ]  Momsen performing in April 2010  Momsen has said that ""music is where I can be me"",[26] stating that ""acting is easy. I've been doing it for so long and I totally love it. But you're playing a character instead of yourself. Music is more personal because you're writing it and you're involved in every step of it.""[26] At 5 years old, Momsen recorded the song ""Christmas, Why Can't I Find You?"" for the soundtrack to How the Grinch Stole Christmas. In 2002, she recorded the songs ""One Small Voice"" and ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"" for the compilation album School's Out! Christmas.  In March 2009, Momsen stated in an interview with OK! magazine that her band The Pretty Reckless had signed a deal with Interscope Records.[27] She played her first tour with her band opening for The Veronicas on their Revenge Is Sweeter Tour in spring 2009.[28] After the tour, Momsen began working with guitarist Ben Phillips, who would soon join the band. Momsen subsequently swapped out her former bandmates. She co-writes songs with Phillips; in addition to lead vocals, Momsen also plays rhythm guitar.  The band's debut album Light Me Up was released on August 30, 2010 in the UK,[29] where it debuted at number 6, as well as at number 18 in Ireland. The first single ""Make Me Wanna Die"" was released on May 30, 2010, while the second single ""Miss Nothing"" which was released on August 23, 2010 peaked at number 39. ""Just Tonight"" was released as the album's third single. Songs from this album have been in the movie ""Kick-ass"" as well as shows like ""The Vampire Diaries"" and ""Gossip Girl"".[30]  Television personality Heidi Montag recorded ""Blackout"", a song written by Momsen. According to Momsen, she wrote the song when she was 8 years old and recorded it as a demo with a producer.[31] Montag released the song as a digital only single, with the music video being directed by her husband Spencer Pratt. Momsen commented about the recording: ""I'm like, okay, dude, you're singing an 8-year-old's words, but that's cool. It's so funny because I didn't shop it or anything and I get this call going, 'Did you write a song for Heidi Montag'? And I'm like, 'What?'"".[31] The track was later included on Montag's debut studio album Superficial (2010).  On July 27, 2011, Momsen announced that the band would be the supporting act for Evanescence during the fall of 2011.[32] Throughout 2012, Momsen and her band toured North America; the second headlining tour, titled the Medicine Tour, began in March 2012 [33] and culminated with supporting dates for Marilyn Manson's 2012 world tour Hey Cruel World... Tour. Momsen also appeared as guest vocalist on the first track of ex Ministry member Paul Barker's 2012 album Fix This.  On November 30, 2012, it was announced that The Pretty Reckless' fourth single ""Kill Me"" would be released on December 11.[34] The track was the last song to be featured in the Gossip Girl series finale.  Momsen cites Kurt Cobain, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Pink Floyd, AC/DC, Marilyn Manson, Oasis, and Shirley Manson of Garbage as some of her personal influences.[35][36][37]  Going to Hell was released on March 18, 2014.[38] The release marked the band's largest sales week to date and landed at #5 on the Billboard 200 with over 35,000 copies sold in its first week.[39] The success of the record saw Taylor, along with the rest of the band, break records when they became the first female-fronted band to reach No. 1 on the rock radio charts with its first two singles: ""Heaven Knows"" in March 2014 and ""Fucked Up World"" in September 2014.[40] The Pretty Reckless also spent the majority of late 2013 throughout 2014 on tour supporting Going To Hell. In 2014, her band also supported Fall Out Boy in their European leg of the Save Rock n Roll Tour along with New Politics.  Throughout 2015, Momsen continued to record new material for the third Pretty Reckless album. On September 29, 2016, the band released the single ""Take Me Down"", which reached number two on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart.[41][42] The third album, Who You Selling For was released in October 2016.[41]  Discography [ edit ]  Filmography [ edit ]",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1890
b863e6df-d187-4770-b725-30ab64c92623,"The pop star is set to marry the model – here’s what we know so far about their upcoming nuptials.  When rumours began at the start of July that Justin Bieber was engaged to Hailey Baldwin, we weren’t sure what to think. The couple seemed to have only been dating for a matter of weeks and there weren’t any signs pointing to an engagement that we could have foreseen. However, Bieber confirmed the engagement just days later on Instagram, calling Baldwin “the love of my life”. So with a Bieber and Baldwin wedding definitely on the cards, we’ve put together everything we know about their upcoming nuptials.  When and where did the proposal take place?  The singer asked the model to marry him while on holidays in the Bahamas. Bieber, 24, got down on one knee and popped the question to Baldwin, 21, in front of a restaurant full of guests at their oceanside resort, who were instructed by his security guards to put their phones away as “something special was about to happen.” Bieber then confirmed the news just days later on Instagram on July 10, saying: “Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast. Listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you! So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindly.”  What kind of engagement ring did Bieber propose with?  Bieber chose a large oval cut diamond ring set in 18 karat yellow gold by Jack Solow of Solow & Co. Inc. Diamond Jewelers. The jeweller has since spoken out about making the ring, confirming Bieber selected the ring himself. “He had certain design elements that he wanted and he had certain expectations and I think we delivered.” The jeweller confirmed Bieber began with the diamond and worked around it, with the designer even confirming he personally delivered the ring to the singer the morning the couple left for the Bahamas. Bieber also reportedly asked Hailey Baldwin’s father, Stephen, for permission before proposing.  When is the wedding?  While we’re yet to get a set date, Bieber recently alluded the wedding would take place very soon, telling paparazzi it was the next thing on the couple's to-do list. After they were spotted meeting with a pastor, Bieber was asked what was next to which he replied ""What's next? Gettin' married!"" TMZ reports the singer won't be working on any more albums or songs, instead focusing his energy on planning the wedding which a source confirms will be taking place next year.  Where is the wedding?  A source told Us Weekly the couple is planning a “very small” wedding, “something private, intimate,” with the location being somewhere in Canada. “Justin loves Canada and is at home there. It’s a special place for him and he’d love to get married there,” the source said.  Who is in the wedding party?  Hailey’s aunt, Kim Basinger, revealed to Us Weekly that Baldwin has already selected her bridal party and confirmed her own daughter, Ireland Baldwin, Hailey’s cousin, will be a bridesmaid, as will the bride’s sister Alaia. “Oh, it’ll be fun. Alaia and Ireland, they’re in the wedding. So believe me, I just — it’s cool! I think it’s sweet. It’s a very sweet thing.”  Who is attending the wedding?  No word on this yet but we can imagine the guest list will read like a Met Gala red carpet. Between Bieber and Baldwin, we can expect Kardashians, Jenners, Hadids and anyone in the same orbit as Scooter Braun, Bieber’s manager–think Ariana Grande, for example.  Who is performing at the wedding?  Post Malone told TMZ that he hopes to play a role in the wedding–whether it be performing or playing a role in the bridal party. “I would love to perform. For free. I'll be the flower boy or is that the ring bearer? He's very happy and I love to see my boy happy.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,798

da703eff-f1b5-4552-ad5e-e44c591f8378,"Have you heard? A new controversy is absolutely tearing the Kardashian clan apart. The source of that controversy also just so happens to be available for purchase at your nearest seller of fine books. It's Caitlyn Jenner 's new memoir, and select Kardashian can't help but keeping talking about how very, very controversial it is.  The Secrets of My Life comes out almost two years after Jenner revealed she was indeed transgender and has undergone a process to confirm her gender (it's co-written by Buzz Bissinger, the famed sportswriters who also wrote the Caitlyn Jenner cover story for Vanity Fair ). It details Jenner's experience struggling with her gender identity in private while living as a sports hero, an icon of American masculinity and then, of course, her very public transition.  Of course, Jenner's reality TV trailblazing family is mentioned throughout, and they clearly are very, very upset with it and don't care how many members of the book-buying public happen to know about it.  During an appearance that airs today on Ellen , one of America's highest-rated daytime talk shows, Kardashian klan lynchpin Kim discussed her displeasure with parts of the book that happens to have a suggested retail price of $30 but is available to buy now from several online and bricks-and-motor retailers.  “My heart breaks for my mom [Kris Jenner,] you know, because I feel like she’s been through so much and [Jenner is] promoting this book and she’s saying all these things,” Kardashian , who has just shy of 100 million Instagram followers, told host Ellen DeGeneres, who has 44 million Instagram followers. “I don’t think it’s necessary and I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful.”  Kardashian refers to claims Caitlyn Jenner makes that Kris Jenner knew she was transgender before they were married.  Kim Kardashian says that while she hasn't talked to Caitlyn Jenner for a few weeks ever since news of the contents of the book began to surface in advance of its release, as is standard for any high-profile celebrity memoir, she will always love her.  ""I feel like it’s taken [Jenner] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don’t expect her to be honest about my mom now,"" Kardashian West told DeGeneres in a segment obtained by E! News before the interview aired. ""But it’s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.”  Kris Jenner herself also reacted to the memoir on the family's long running reality show on an episode that premieres Sunday, just days before the book's scheduled release. ""None of it makes sense! Everything she says is all made up,"" Jenner rants on national television about her portrayal in her ex-spouse's book. ""Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch?""  Meanwhile, Caitlyn Jenner, who also recorded an audio version of the book, recently claimed on Andy Cohen's SiriusXM talk show that she hasn't talked to Khloe Kardashian in two years. This despite the fact that claim is contradicted by scenes from the family's reality show. Still, we are left to assume that Khloe is also very mad about the book, which is also available to download on your Kindle, Nook or other e-reader devices.  Of course, this all begs the question: Will anyone want to read something that apparently has caused so much highly publicized controversy within the Kardashian clan? The book may currently be number 28 on Amazon's best-seller list, but we can only imagine it might have climbed higher if not for this onslaught of negative publicity that all happens to coincide with its release.  We can also only hope that someday the wounds heal, and the extended Kardashian-Jenner family can someday reunite back into the family unit that supports each other's products and endeavors in perfect, publicity-optimized harmony.

The pair were spotted pulling up to the trendy TAO restaurant in Midtown for dinner on Monday. Upon arrival, Foxx could be seen acting the perfect gentleman, walking around the black SUV the pair arrived in to give Holmes his hand. The romantic night out comes amid rumors that the elusive couple -- who have never publicly acknowledged their relationship -- may have broken up.  A source recently told ET that rumos of a split are false and that the couple are just ""still very, very private. You’re not going to hear or see every time they’re together because they don’t flaunt their relationship in public.”  BACKGRID  Foxx, 50, and Holmes, 39, have kept their relationship extremely low profile for years. They were first romantically linked back in 2013 -- a year after Holmes' divorce from Tom Cruise -- when they were spotted dancing together onstage at the 4th Annual Apollo in the Hamptons Benefit. Foxx publicly denied their relationship at the time, but evidence began to pile up over the years, whether it was a photo of the pair holding hands in his music studio, a quick dinner date in New York City or a romantic stroll on the beach in Malibu.  The couple got slightly less shy this year, making a rare public appearance together at the Clive Davis and the Recording Academy’s Pre-GRAMMY Gala in New York City.  But, true to form, Foxx, just one month later, yanked off his headset at a celebrity basketball game and abruptly ended an interview when asked about Holmes.

As it turns out, there were some obvious warning signs leading up to their announcement.  Aniston was attending parties left and right without her husband, from her Friends co-star Courtney Cox’s birthday celebration in Malibu to Amy Schumer’s surprise wedding.

E! News reported that Theroux prefered keeping a low profile, which just wasn’t possible when married to a Hollywood A-lister like Aniston.  A source confirmed, “Jennifer and Justin fell in love hard and fast and yet they were never really suited to one another. He was a New York hipster that loved the alternative lifestyle and Jennifer was living a much more reclusive life when they first started to fall in love.”    The source added, “The initial chemistry between them made it easy for them to ignore their differences and incompatibility.”  Next: This played a major role in their split.  4.

4dcd4934-6b41-4566-afb4-8ea31be2dc86,"James Franco Denies Sexual Misconduct Claims, Saying They're 'Not Accurate'  James Franco addressed the sexual misconduct claims circulating about him on social media Tuesday night, telling late-night host Stephen Colbert that ""the things I heard on Twitter are not accurate."" Colbert had mentioned the criticisms raised Sunday by actress Ally Sheedy in a series of since-deleted tweets — claims that were then followed by separate allegations by multiple women.  ""I have no idea why [Sheedy] was upset. She took the tweet down. I don't know, I can't speak for her,"" he told Colbert toward the end of their interview promoting Franco's film The Disaster Artist. ""The others — look, in my life I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I've done. I have to do that to maintain my well-being. I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong or needs to be changed.""  ""The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,"" he added, ""but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn't have a voice for so long. So, I don't want to shut them down in any way.""  YouTube  Franco's comments come several days after the Golden Globes award ceremony, where he won for best actor in a comedy or musical. During the broadcast, his evident support for ""Time's Up,"" an initiative seeking to end sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, prompted disgust from Sheedy and others.  ""James Franco just won,"" Sheedy, whom Franco directed in a 2014 off-Broadway show, said on Twitter. ""Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business.""  In an earlier tweet, Sheedy had asked: ""Why is James Franco allowed in?""  Both tweets, which lodged no specific allegations, have since been deleted, but at least two other women posted claims against the actor and director.  Filmmaker Sarah Tither-Kaplan alleged a contract she signed with Franco regarding nudity in two of his films was exploitative, and actress Violet Paley addressed a tweet to Franco, saying, ""Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17?""  ""A couple weeks ago, James offered me & a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone 'apology,' "" Paley later tweeted, adding: ""I don't accept.""  Neither allegation has been independently confirmed by NPR.  Still, the simmering controversy was enough to dissuade The New York Times from holding an event featuring Franco. The paper canceled that event, which had been scheduled for Wednesday.  ""The event was intended to be a discussion of the making of the film, 'The Disaster Artist.' Given the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we're no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein,"" the Times explained in a statement to The New York Daily News.  Franco remains scheduled to make another late-night appearance Wednesday, on Late Night with Seth Meyers on NBC.  In Tuesday night's conversation with Colbert, Franco reiterated his support for ""Time's Up,"" saying he backs the drive for pay equity in the workplace, ""which just means people that are underrepresented — women and people of color, people in the LGBT community — get leadership positions, that they fill all positions that they've been deprived of.""  Then he spoke specifically of the claims against him.  ""The way I live my life, I can't live — if there's restitution to be made, I will make it. So, if I've done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to. I think that's how that works. I don't know what else to do,"" Franco told Colbert.  ""Look, I really don't have the answers"" on the larger issue of sexual harassment, Franco added. ""I think the point of this whole thing is that we listen. ... I'm here to listen and learn, and change my perspective where it's off.

ff6abca4-ff14-45f7-83ca-52029decd8c6,"Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. She married John F. Kennedy in 1953. When she became first lady in 1961, she worked to restore the White House to its original elegance and to protect its holdings. After JFK's assassination in 1963, she moved to New York City. She married Aristotle Onassis in 1968. She died of cancer in 1994.  Early Life  Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. Her father, John Bouvier, was a wealthy New York stockbroker of French Catholic descent, and her mother, Janet, was an accomplished equestrienne of Irish Catholic heritage. Onassis was a bright, curious and occasionally mischievous child. One of her elementary school teachers described her as ""a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil."" Another teacher, less charmed by young Jacqueline, wrote admonishingly that ""her disturbing conduct in geography class made it necessary to exclude her from the room.""  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  Onassis enjoyed a privileged childhood of ballet lessons at the Metropolitan Opera House and French lessons beginning at age of 12. Like her mother, Onassis loved riding and was highly skilled on horseback. In 1940, at the age of 11, she won a national junior horsemanship competition. The New York Times reported, ""Jacqueline Bouvier, an eleven-year-old equestrienne from East Hampton, Long Island, scored a double victory in the horsemanship competition. Miss Bouvier achieved a rare distinction. The occasions are few when the same rider wins both competitions in the same show.""  Onassis attended Miss Porter's School, a prestigious boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut; in addition to its rigorous academics, the school also emphasized proper manners and the art of conversation. There she excelled as a student, writing frequent essays and poems for the school newspaper and winning the award as the school's top literature student in her senior year. Also during her senior year, in 1947, Onassis was named ""Debutante of the Year"" by a local newspaper. However, Onassis had greater ambitions than being recognized for her beauty and popularity. She wrote in the yearbook that her life ambition was ""not to be a housewife.""  Upon graduating from Miss Porter's School Onassis enrolled at Vassar College in New York to study history, literature, art and French. She spent her junior year studying abroad in Paris. ""I loved it more than any year of my life,"" Onassis later wrote about her time there. ""Being away from home gave me a chance to look at myself with a jaundiced eye. I learned not to be ashamed of a real hunger for knowledge, something that I had always tried to hide, and I came home glad to start in here again but with a love for Europe that I am afraid will never leave me.""  Upon returning from Paris, Onassis transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and graduated with a B.A. in French literature in 1951. After graduating from college in 1951, Onassis landed a job as the ""Inquiring Camera Girl"" for the Washington Times-Herald newspaper. Her job was to photograph and interview various Washington residents, and then weave their pictures and responses together in her column. Among her most notable stories were an interview with Richard Nixon, coverage of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration and a report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.  U.S. First Lady  It was at a dinner party in 1952 that Onassis met a dashing young congressman and senator-elect from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy; he ""leaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date."" They were married a year later, on September 12, 1953. Onassis gave birth to her first child, Caroline Kennedy, in 1957. That same year, she encouraged Kennedy to write and, subsequently, helped him edit Profiles in Courage, his famous book about U.S. senators who had risked their careers to stand for causes they believed in.  In January 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S. presidency. Although Onassis was pregnant at the time and thus unable to join him on the campaign trail, she campaigned tirelessly from home. She answered letters, gave interviews, taped commercials and wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column called ""Campaign Wife.""  On November 8, 1960, Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by a razor-thin margin to become the 35th president of the United States; less three weeks later, Onassis gave birth to their second child, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. The couple had a third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy born prematurely on August 7, 1963, but lost the child two days later.  Onassis's first mission as first lady was to transform the White House into a museum of American history and culture that would inspire patriotism and public service in those who visited. ""Every boy who comes here should see things that develop his sense of history,"" she once said. Onassis went to extraordinary lengths to procure art and furniture owned by past presidents—including artifacts owned by George Washington, James Madison and Abraham Lincoln—as well as pieces she considered representative of various periods of American culture. ""Everything in the White House must have a reason for being there,"" she insisted. ""It would be sacrilege merely to 'redecorate' it—a word I hate. It must be restored—and that has nothing to do with decoration. That is a question of scholarship.""  As the culmination of her project, Onassis gave a tour of the restored White House on national television on February 14, 1962. A record 56 million viewers watched her televised special, and Onassis won an honorary Emmy Award for her performance.  As first lady, Onassis was also a great patron of the arts. In addition to the officials, diplomats and statesman who typically populated state dinners, Onassis also invited the nation's leading writers, artists, musicians and scientists to mingle with its top politicians. The great violinist Isaac Stern wrote to Onassis after one such dinner, ""It would be difficult to tell you how refreshing, how heartening it is to find such serious attention and respect for the arts in the White House. To many of us it is one of the most exciting developments on the present American cultural scene.""  Additionally, Onassis frequently traveled abroad, both with the president and alone, and her deep knowledge of foreign cultures and languages (she spoke fluent French, Spanish and Italian) helped garner goodwill toward America. She was so adoringly received in France that President Kennedy introduced himself as ""the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris."" Presidential advisor Clark Clifford wrote to Onassis, ""Once in a great while, an individual will capture the imagination of people all over the world. You have done this; and what is more important, through your graciousness and tact, you have transformed this rare accomplishment into an incredibly important asset to this nation.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1347

1f8c1d5a-9d9d-4d27-8653-3aae0f32e837,"It’s been more than three years since Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their decision to separate after 10 years of marriage.  Though the two have not been romantically involved since then, they have remained very much a part of each other’s lives, co-parenting their three children — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Sam, 6 — together and often attending church and going on vacations as a family.  Then on Wednesday, Garner was spotted driving her ex to a rehab facility.  “Ben’s priorities remain his family and his sobriety,” a source told ET. “He continues to attend meetings and mediation classes for his well-being. You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.”  Since their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.  Here’s everything she’s said about Affleck since their split:  July 2018  Garner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, “Looking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really — I could cry talking about it.”  She added, “What I think I’ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, ‘cause you think that’ll end the, ‘Are they engaged? Are they not?’ And that’s true in reverse, as well. If you are — if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there’s trouble, it can create trouble.

We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.

6f7d79e7-2637-48a2-8361-4d66541da92f,"No need to rush. Jennifer Lopez is not in a hurry to walk down the aisle with Alex Rodriguez, but she does want to spend the rest of her life with someone.  “I do believe in marriage,” the Shades of Blue actress, 48, told Harper’s Bazaar in a story published on Thursday, March 15. “And I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship. But I’m not forcing anything right now.”  As far as her relationship with the 42-year-old former Yankees player, she said: “It’s good, it’s healthy; we communicate well. We understand each other’s lives in a way that most other people couldn’t.”  She added: “We both entered the public eye in our early twenties and overachieved right from the start. And that affects every dynamic in your life, from your family to your work to your relationships. We have a similar makeup.”  The pair celebrated their anniversary in February in Minneapolis, where the singer performed a concert ahead of the Super Bowl. During the show, she debuted her single “Us” written by Poo Bear and produced by Skrillex, and dedicated it to Rodriguez, who was in the audience. “We’ve been together for one year today. I don’t want to get all mushy or anything, but baby, this song’s for you. I love you,” she told the athlete while on stage.  When talking about how she chose the song, Lopez told the magazine that the lyrics fit right into where the couple were in their relationship. She said: “They played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, ‘Oh, this is relevant!’ Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, ‘Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?’”  Lopez was previously married to chef Ojani Noa for nearly a year in 1997, and dancer Cris Judd from 2001 to 2002. She later married singer Marc Anthony in 2004 and they called it quits in 2011. The pair share 10-year-old twins Max and Emme. The former Yankees shortstop shares daughters Ella, 9, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis. They split in 2008 after six years of marriage.  A lot has changed in the “Dance Again” songstress’ life since her last relationship, and she said a lot of it has to do with really knowing herself. “When I was younger I spent a lot of time being half happy and half not happy,” she told the publication. “I know who I am and what I want. I also know my strengths and weaknesses. It took me a long time to get to a point where I could say something nice about myself. I’m glad I can do that now.”  Lopez remains optimistic as she continues with her career, raise her two children and make her relationship with Rodriguez work for the long run. “Baseball is just like life,” she said. “All you want to do is hit a home run.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,634
db53b360-8ee1-4def-8be8-7ad4a1506fe3,"Robert Pattinson and FKA twigs have called it quits — for now.  The couple, who were engaged in early 2015, have split after more than two years together, a source tells PEOPLE.  “They did break up,” says the source. “It was very recent.”  According to the source, distance and time apart played a major part in their decision to call it quits.  “He is on a press tour and she is working on her new album. And I think it’s timing,” says the source. “They’ve been all over the place. They have not seen each other in probably two months.”  “It wasn’t vicious,” adds the source.  But despite the split, Pattinson and twigs haven’t closed the door on a possible reconciliation.  “I think they will eventually get back together,” says the source. “He still loves her and I think that’s the girl he wants to marry.”  In fact, twigs (né Tahliah Debrett Barnett) still has her engagement ring.  Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic  “It’s not out of the realm of possibility that they could get back together and it’s more like they are taking a break,” says the source. “It’s not like he asked for the ring. She still has it.”  Representatives for twigs had no comment on the matter.  Pattinson, 31, and twigs, 29, were first photographed hanging out together with friends in 2014 — fueling rumors of a romance. Just a few months later, the relationship was undeniable when the Twilight star arrived at the singer’s first sold-out concert with a beautiful bouquet of roses.  The pair were a private couple, keeping a low profile for most of their time together. Their first official public appearance was in late 2016 at the LA Dance Annual Gala.  Pattinson popped the question in 2015 — and the news of their engagement accidentally slipped to the press by rapper T-Pain, who told Vulture the musician may not contribute to his new album because “she’s engaged now.”  Sources later confirmed to PEOPLE that the engagement was real — but in August 2015, insiders revealed to PEOPLE the wedding had been postponed. By November of 2016, Pattinson feigned confusion when asked how planning was going for their pending nuptials, telling PEOPLE, “Planning what now?” In late July, Pattinson said that he and twigs were “kind of” engaged during an interview on Howard Stern’s Sirius-XM show — adding that “she’s amazing” and “super talented.” When asked by GQ if he was getting married in an interview for the September cover, Pattinson responded with a noncommittal “eh.”  Prior to his relationship with twigs, Patterson dated Kristen Stewart.  He made headlines in August when he was spotted having dinner in Los Angeles with Katy Perry and a group of friends — though a source close to the actor told PEOPLE the two were “just friends.”  “They’re super cuddly always,” the insider said. “They’ve known each other forever.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,592
2f7cf716-3c97-4235-b471-941d7c05dbca,"Brad Pitt reportedly couldn't resist canoodling with Jennifer Aniston in a restaurant, causing even more concern for her allegedly troubled marriage to Justin Theroux.  After Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, Twitter found entertainment in imagining Jennifer Aniston’s glee. Jolie had reportedly been at least partly responsible for causing Jennifer and Brad’s split, leading some to speculate that Aniston felt gleeful over the crumbling of Pitt’s second marriage.  In recent months, however, the relationship between Jennifer and Brad reportedly has changed. Even though Aniston is now married to Justin Theroux, Jennifer allegedly just “can’t let go” of Pitt, and it’s rumored to be destroying her romance with Justin, as the Inquisitr reported. Now, Jennifer and Brad have gone from a platonic reunion to a rekindled romance, according to a new report.  Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston: “Always In Love”  Yahoo quoted an insider’s claim that Brad and Jennifer have “always been in love.” Recalling the era when Pitt and Aniston were Hollywood’s golden couple, the source said that Jennifer and Brad have continued to have feelings for each other despite her marriage to Justin Theroux and his marriage to Angelina Jolie.  “They were once the golden couple of Hollywood and apparently Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston still hold a soft spot in their hearts for one another.”  Quoting Woman’s Day magazine, Yahoo reported that Pitt and Aniston recently just happened to encounter each other in Los Angeles during Jennifer’s dinner date. Aniston was with friends at Soho House. During her meal, Brad showed up and joined the group, according to the insider.  Brad Pitt Caught Canoodling With Jennifer Aniston  Even though Aniston and Pitt were in a public restaurant, Brad apparently could not resist the temptation, an observer told the publication.  “Brad kissed Jen’s neck and whispered something into her ear before giving her a knowing glance.”  One insider, the former security guard to Pitt, revealed even more about Brad’s rumored feelings for Jennifer. Kris Herzog told the magazine that even though Pitt was married to Angelina Jolie and Aniston is still married to Justin Theroux, the former lovebirds never lost their love for each other.  Jennifer Aniston’s marriage to Justin Theroux reportedly is troubled amid her renewed romance with Brad Pitt. Francois Mori / AP Images  “Brad and Jen are in love and always have been,” declared Kris.  Moreover, Herzog claimed that Pitt and Aniston have been spending a lot of time together in the wake of Angelina filing for divorce in 2016.  Brad Pitt Not Totally To Blame For Jennifer Aniston’s Allegedly Troubled Marriage  Jolie and Brad famously met on the movie set of Mr. And Mrs. Smith during his marriage to Jennifer Aniston. Jennifer and Brad were married for five years before splitting in 2005. Aniston dated Justin Theroux for four years prior to tying the knot in in 2015.  In contrast, Pitt and Jolie were together for 11 years, although they were married for only two years. They are currently co-parenting six children, ranging in age from 16-year-old Maddox, 14-year-old Pax, and 13-year-old Zahara to 11-year-old Shiloh Jolie-Pitt and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  Brad and Angelina’s divorce has earned extensive publicity, including the battle for custody of the kids. But rumors that Pitt’s renewed romance with Aniston has hurt her marriage to Justin Theroux have remained unconfirmed. People Magazine pointed out that the rumors are linked to the seemingly separate lives that Jennifer and Justin live.  “Despite tabloid claims of trouble due to their frequent distance, Aniston and Theroux’s two-year marriage is solid, [some insiders insist].”  Jennifer and Justin both have busy lives because of their careers, which often force them to work long distances apart. But even though Aniston and Theroux appear to be separated, one of the insiders said that Jennifer and Justin “have figured out a life that works for them.”  As for how Aniston’s rumored rekindled romance with Brad has affected her relationship with Theroux, Pitt isn’t getting all of the blame for any problems. According to the Hollywood Gossip, Jennifer’s marriage to Justin was in trouble even before her alleged reunion with Brad. An insider quoted by the publication said that Aniston’s and Theroux’s relationship “has been crumbling,” and Pitt’s ability to console Jennifer while she’s vulnerable reportedly has made her marriage to Justin even more troubled.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,850

f30f090d-d609-4017-b17e-f30afc66030f,"Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

We review every new product, track cool new trends (have you seen this unicorn-inspired makeup?) and snoop inside celebrities’ medicine cabinets whenever possible. So we can freely admit that whenever we take a trip to Sephora or Ulta we inevitably leave with a few more products than we anticipated buying. If you’re guilty too, it’s actually not all that unusual.  According to a new video by Money (above), the average woman will spend $43 on a shopping trip for makeup. (Our bank accounts may not thank us, but our vanities sure do.)  What really gave us a shock, though, was discovering that a woman spends $15,000 on beauty products in her lifetime. That’s a lot of lipsticks… or the cash for a used car!  Out of that money, $3,770 is spent on mascara alone (shop our favorite here!). Another $2,750 is allotted to eyeshadows (blue is totally in right now). And $1,780 is dedicated to new lipsticks (these are the celebrity shades we’re loving right now). And that’s not even including all the products you need to buy to keep your beauty tools clean.

896b3325-ac0b-4d6f-8ee4-c91e43de8c3a,"The rumour: Meghan Markle had a secret first husband  Where you heard it: The National Enquirer  The report: Markle’s status as divorcée has never been in dispute, but according to a new “bombshell” Enquirer cover story (is there any other kind?), Prince Harry will be the ex-actress’s third kick at the matrimonial can. “How she HID PAST from Husband No. 2!” claims one scandalous cover line, referring to “Man-eater Meghan’s” ex Trevor Engelson. Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was “blindsided” by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a “hush-hush annulment.”  Subscribe To Our Newsletters — And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox  The smell test: For the love of Liverpool — this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It’s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she’s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn’t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we’re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what’s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even “hush-hush annulments” are a matter of public record. The Enquirer’s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty’s Secret Service) probably “scrubbed the records” to conceal Markle’s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.  The rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie  Where you heard it: Vanity Fair  The report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple’s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It’s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. “What I’ve heard is that they’re seriously worried about the sex scene,” the movie’s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his “wife’s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.”  The smell test: What really reeks here is Huda’s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife’s connection, you can be sure he won’t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude — it’s called protecting your source.) Is the palace “seriously worried” about this movie? It’s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it’s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they’d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan’s premarital sex-fest wasn’t coming soon to a TV near you, but it’s not like it’s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal — a 1 being Kate Middleton’s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles’s tampon ambitions — this is a 2.  The rumour: Meghan’s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah  Where you heard it: The Mirror  The report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle’s mom visited Winfrey’s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O’s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed “US TV source,” who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: “It’s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,” quoth The Mirror’s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.  Rumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton ‘Hate Each Other’s Guts.’ Is That Really The Case?  The smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a “tell-all” if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a “tell-none” approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it’s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.  The rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring  Where you heard it: E! News  The report: This will-he-or-won’t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap “does want to wear a wedding band.” Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen’s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.  The smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that’s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan’s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1351
38d0ff2f-22c6-4e77-a723-9ad792f5ce3a,"CLOSE According to the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges despite his ex-girlfriend accusing him of being violent towards her. USA TODAY  A former girlfriend of Ryan Phillippe has accused him of throwing her down a staircase. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges in the domestic violence case that resulted in a lawsuit being filed by a former girlfriend.  Frank Mateljan, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY that his office will not be pursuing the matter further.  ""The City Attorney's Office was referred this matter following an investigation by the LAPD,"" he said in a statement. ""After a thorough review, the matter was set for a City Attorney office hearing, during which both parties were present, detailed the incident, were advised on the law and given guidance as to how to avoid similar incidents in the future.  ""Separate hearings were held in August and September. No further action has been scheduled following our office hearing, though we do reserve the right to file charges up to one year after the incident.""  On Monday, model Elsie Hewitt, 21, sued the actor for $1 million, alleging assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Phillippe denies the accusations.  ""The claims are false,"" Phillippe's rep, Nicole Perna, said to USA TODAY in a statement.  Later in the evening, he expanded on his thoughts in a tweet confirmed by Perna.  ""I am saddened and disgusted by these false allegations being circulated about me,"" he wrote. ""At the time these allegations were initially made, I fully cooperated with law enforcement and a thorough investigation was conducted.""  He continued, ""As a man, raised by women, in a household where women's right's, feminism and advocacy were very much at the forefront, I am sickened that my name can be found in any article where domestic violence of any kind is being alleged.""  Hewitt's lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, says Phillippe, who is 22 years her senior, became increasingly possessive and violent towards her (often while under the influence) during their three-month relationship.  The document states that during their relationship, she observed Phillippe, 43, ""repeatedly abusing a panoply of legal and illegal drugs, including without limitation: cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms and steroids.""  Things reached a boiling point over the July 4th holiday, according to the suit, when Hewitt and a friend came to his house to pick up personal items she would need for an upcoming modeling job.  Phillippe, she describes, was ""discernibly drunk and high"" at the time, and became increasingly ""agitated and hostile."" In an effort to diffuse the situation, Hewitt asked to speak with him privately upstairs.  When that plan failed, she called her friend to come upstairs while she cleared out her belongings from his bedroom.  At that point, the lawsuit says, Phillippe grabbed Hewitt by the arm (""so tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm hours later"") and ""violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.""  She made a second trip up the stairs only to be cornered, kicked and thrown down the stairs again. As and her friend fled, he cursed and screamed ""get the (expletive) out of my house, you crazy (expletive)!""  Soon afterward, she sought treatment at the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where police filed a report, noting ""visible injuries to (Hewitt's) legs, back, arms, shoulder and face"" and granted her a week-long emergency protective order, which was served at Phillippe's home on July 6.  The day beforehand, Hewitt says he texted her saying he was ""so sad"" and contacted her friends via private message on social media that he was ""heartbroken"" and ""in disbelief"" that police had come to his home.  ""I can't believe she'd do this to me,"" he allegedly wrote, adding he ""would never hurt her like she's claiming. I didn't hit or punch or kick her.""  The friend who witnessed the encounter replied, ""I saw the whole thing Ryan, you literally were grabbing her and threw her down the stairs.""  Hewitt is seeking $1 million in punitive damages, citing emotional distress and the impact physical attack had on her ability to work as a model since her ""income and career (are) largely contingent upon her physical features.""  Phillippe's publicist released a statement flatly denying the account.  In his tweet, Phillippe noted, ""I have been a public figure for almost 25 years and many untrue things have been said or written about me in the past. That is something you learn to accept if you choose a profession like mine. This time is different.""  He also took offense at the notion of using this type of accusation for personal gain: ""Domestic violence is a very real and tragic issue for many women the world over and should never be used to vengefully slander or as a ploy for monetary gain. This is wrong. This is not who I am. Every one of my accuser's allegations (is) false.""  Phillippe was previously married to Reese Witherspoon, who filed separation papers in 2006 after seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 2008.  They have two children together: 18-year-old daughter Ava and 13-year-old son Deacon. He also has a 6-year-old daughter from his relationship with Pitch Perfect actress Alexis Knapp.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yc3HrN",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1086

42e723c2-a8d3-4db2-a32b-600ade8b648e,"Former NBC host Billy Bush has lashed out at President Donald Trump for trying to cast doubt on the authenticity of the now infamous “Access Hollywood” tape, which captured Trump boasting about sexually assaulting women.  “Of course he said it,” Bush wrote in a New York Times op-ed Sunday titled, “Yes, Donald Trump, You Said That”.  Bush said he felt compelled to speak out after the president reportedly began telling aides and fellow politicians that the tape was fabricated.  “President Trump is currently indulging in some revisionist history,” Bush said.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now  “This has hit a raw nerve in me.”  In the 2005 recording, which resurfaced during the final moments of last year’s presidential campaign when it was published by the Washington Post, Trump is heard lewdly bragging to Bush about groping and kissing women without their consent.  Trump, on a hot mic, tells the Access Hollywood anchor about unsuccessfully trying to have sex with a married woman and how “you can do anything” to women “when you’re a star.” He said he was able to “grab them by the pussy.”  After the recording’s release, Trump, then a presidential candidate, issued an apology and dismissed the talk as “locker room” banter.  More recently, Trump has revisited the tape to question whether the voice heard is actually his, according to the New York Times.  Bush, who was fired by NBC after the tape’s release, confirms the voice is undoubtedly Trump’s, but adds that he only recently realized that the talk could be more than “hypothetical hot air from America’s highest-rated bloviator”.  “There were seven other guys present on the bus at the time, and every single one of us assumed we were listening to a crass standup act,” Bush wrote.  His perspective changed when he read an account of 20 women who accused Trump of inappropriate sexual behavior.  One woman’s story, about being pushed against a wall and groped, made “the whole ‘better use some Tic Tacs’ and ‘just start kissing them’ routine real,” Bush said. “I believe her”.

5d5cac74-e16b-49ec-ad51-fc1b774c196e,"Producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, who also oversaw the last show, will be reteaming with him for the 90th Academy Awards.  Jimmy Kimmel will be back as host of the Oscars when the 90th edition of the annual Academy Awards ceremony is held March 4.  The Academy and ABC announced Tuesday that the late night host will reunite with producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd for the 2018 show.  The trio teamed up for the first time for the most recent Oscar show Feb. 26, and while all three generally got good reviews, their contributions were overshadowed by the last-minute envelope gaffe that resulted in La La Land, and not the actual winner Moonlight, being announced as the best picture victor. As part of the official announcement, Kimmel joked, ""If you think we screwed up the ending this year, wait until you see what we have planned for the 90th anniversary show.""  As for ratings, their maiden effort resulted in a 4 percent drop in viewership from the prior year as the show attracted 32.9 million viewers.  Still, ABC, which was granted a larger advisory capacity about key elements of the show when the Academy renewed its contract with the network through 2028 last summer, was eager to see the host of its Jimmy Kimmel Live! invited back.  “Jimmy, Mike and Jennifer are truly an Oscar Dream Team,” Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said in announcing their selection. “Mike and Jennifer produced a beautiful show that was visually stunning. And Jimmy proved, from his opening monologue all the way through a finale we could never have imagined, that he is one our finest hosts in Oscar history.”  Added Kimmel, “Hosting the Oscars was a highlight of my career and I am grateful to Cheryl, [Academy CEO] Dawn [Hudson] and the Academy for asking me to return to work with two of my favorite people, Mike De Luca and Jennifer Todd.""  “It’s not often you get two chances to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience and even more rare to be handed the keys to a party 90 years in the making,” De Luca and Todd offered in a joint statement. “We always thought the idea that anything can happen on the Oscars was a cliche until we lived it.”  ""Our Oscars team this year delivered a show that hit every high note,"" Hudson said. ""Jimmy brought back the essence and light touch of the greatest hosts of Oscars past. Mike and Jennifer's love of movies is infectious and touched every aspect of the show. This is the perfect team to lead us into the ninth decade.""  ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey observed, “After just one year, we can’t imagine anyone else hosting The Oscars. Jimmy’s skillful command of the stage is invaluable on a night when anything can happen — and does. With Mike and Jennifer at the helm, we’re ready for another unforgettable show that will dazzle, delight and, most importantly, honor 90 years of Hollywood’s most prestigious award.”  The early announcement represents something of a break with Academy tradition, which in the past has first seen the Academy president select the show's producers and the producers then pick a host — a process that has sometimes resulted in a protracted search. Boone Isaacs, having completed four successive, one-year terms as president, will be stepping down in July, as the Academy's board of governors elects a new president. But rather than wait for a new president to take over, the Academy is moving forward with plans for next year's show.  The early announcement is not unprecedented, though. In both 2013 and 2014, the Academy announced in mid-April that producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, who first produced the 2013 show, would be returning to produce both the 2014 and 2015 shows. Both the Academy and ABC prefer to have producers who've already cut their teeth on one broadcast returning to handle the next year's show, because it eliminates the learning curve facing new producers and provides for continuity of staffing.  Extending an early callback to Kimmel, De Luca and Todd, ensures that all three will have plenty of time to prepare for next year's show, which doesn't take place until the first Sunday in March so as not to conflict with the closing ceremonies of the winter Olympics, which will be taking place the last weekend of February. Last year, Todd and De Luca were not named to produce the 89th Oscars until early November, and Kimmel wasn't given the hosting assignment until early December. ""I had to be at least eighth [choice],"" Kimmel joked to THR. ""It took so long for them to ask.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,898

An ambulance was also requested but later canceled, the chief said: “The female was transported to the hospital via private vehicle instead.”  A spokesperson for the Columbus County Sheriff’s Office told PEOPLE that no incident report was taken.  TMZ later posted audio of Evans’ 911 call, when she claimed that Eason injured her collarbone.

The pop star wrote in a tweet to survivors and the families of victims that she was ""thinking of you all today and every day.""  ""I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day,"" she wrote in a tweet that included a bee, the civic symbol of Manchester.  thinking of you all today and every day 🐝 I love you with all of me and am sending you all of the light and warmth I have to offer on this challenging day — Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) May 22, 2018  Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton of Libyan descent, blew himself up as fans were leaving Grande's concert at Manchester Arena on May 22, 2017. Twenty-two concertgoers were killed, and police say more than 800 people were left ""with physical and deep psychological injuries."" Grande suspended her Dangerous Woman Tour after the bombing and returned for the One Love Manchester charity concert weeks later, which raised funds for victims of the attack.  Last June, Grande was made an honorary citizen of Manchester after a unanimous vote by the city council. The singer has paid tribute to victims of the attack, including the youngest, Saffie Roussos, who would have turned 9 last July. During Grande's July show in Buenos Aires, the singer reprised her take on ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" which she also performed at One Love. She closed off the song by blowing a kiss and saying, ""Happy birthday, Saffie.""  On Tuesday, across Manchester, residents made defiant statements of unity in the face of extremist violence.  Some laid bouquets of flowers in St. Ann's Square; others left hand-written notes on Japanese maples that have been planted to form a ""Trees of Hope"" trail through the city. One note cited U.S. Episcopal bishop Michael Curry's sermon at Saturday's royal wedding: ""As a clever bishop said 'there is power in love.'""  A girl cries as she looks at at tributes left in St Anne's Square on the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing, in Manchester, England, May 22, 2018. Andrew Yates / REUTERS  Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said it was a day to ""come together.""  Thousands of people paused outside Manchester Cathedral at 2:30 p.m. for a minute of silence that was observed across the country — including in Parliament, where lawmakers paused their debates and fell still.  Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May joined survivors and emergency workers who responded to the attack for a remembrance service at the cathedral.  A choir sang ""Amazing Grace"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow,"" and Christian, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Muslim and humanist leaders all addressed the congregation.  On the altar stood 22 lit candles, made from the wax of thousands of candles left in the city's St. Ann's Square in the days after the attack.  William read a passage from the Bible's book of Corinthians, ending: ""Faith, hope and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.""  Robby Potter, who was hit by shrapnel as he waited to pick his daughter up from the concert, said he felt he had to come to the service ""to support the families who have lost people.""  ""We were very lucky, we know how lucky we are,"" he told Sky News. ""It's a case of standing strong. The country stood strong, especially Manchester.""  Later, thousands of people — including a choir of survivors — are due to gather for a concert and sing-song in St. Ann's Square. The event will include renditions of Grande's ""One Last Time"" and ""Look Back In Anger"" by Oasis, which became an unofficial anthem of Manchester after the bombing.  Bells on the city hall and churches will ring out at 10:31 p.m., exactly a year since the bomb exploded.  Police say 100 investigators are still working on the case. The U.K. has issued an arrest warrant for Abedi's younger brother, Hashem Abedi, and is seeking his extradition from Libya — a far-from-straightforward process given that country's political chaos.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,835
14d3f0a5-1018-4ff1-af5c-a335efa5f791,"On Tuesday, Jennifer Lawrence wore a black Versace gown to a photo-call in London promoting her latest film, Red Sparrow. Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley’s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.  “I don’t really know where to get started on this ‘Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold’ controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,” she wrote on Wednesday. “That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I’m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”  She continued to call the discussions “sexist,” saying they were “creating silly distractions from real issues.”  “Get a grip people,” she finished. “Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT’S MY CHOICE TOO!”  Lawrence has since shifted the focus away from her bare limbs and to the crush she shares with most of the Oscar movie-watching planet, Timothée Chalamet. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress described the Call Me by Your Name star as both “hot” and “talented.”  “Timothée, I’m waiting for him to get a little bit older, you know?” she said about the Oscar nominee, who at 22 is only five years her junior. “[I’m] buttering him up like a pig for slaughter, and then I’m going to swing right in there as soon as he’s, like, 30.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,363
916de599-9082-48c7-b15f-5d6f33cf220d,"Fergie triumphantly returned to the stage for the first time since her National Anthem fiasco.  The 42-year-old singer was heavily criticised and mocked after she performed a soulful rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner at the NBA All-Star Game on 18 February (18).  While Fergie admitted she took a ""risk"" with her version, basketball players Stephen Curry and LeBron James, along with audience members Chance the Rapper and Jimmy Kimmel, were seen on camera struggling to contain their laughter during her performance.  Fergie returned to the stage at The Forum in Inglewood, California, on Friday (02Mar18), with an appearance during DJ Khaled's star-studded set at his concert with Demi Lovato.  Khaled introduced Fergie as ""my sister"" from TV talent show ""The Four (Battle for Stardom)"" before the crowd gave her a warm welcome with cheers and applause, and she performed her hits including Fergalicious, London Bridge and Glamorous.

a0701a61-50f3-4aaf-a2e3-f31d19497aaa,"Illuminating, strobing, chroming. Whatever you call it, highlighting has become a routine staple in basically everyone’s makeup routine. The bright, shiny sister to contouring, highlighting is the act of applying a light-reflecting color on the planes of your face, such as the tops of your cheekbones, your brow bone, and the bridge of your nose, in order to create the illusion of brightness.  While several high-end brands have cult-favorite, highlighting products in their line-up, their prices aren’t so wallet-friendly.  Giphy  Thankfully, there’s a slew of drugstore products that can keep you looking radiant without going broke — but not all drugstore highlighters are created equal. Some are way too glittery, while others just end up being weirdly chalky. Whether you’re someone who only highlights their face on special occasion or you want a cheekbone strobed so brightly you can see it from space, these are the six budget-friendly highlighters that will give a glow even Jennifer Lopez is jealous of.  Revlon Photoready Skinlights Face Illuminator, $9.99  Revlon  This particular highlighter was a cult favorite over a decade ago, originally known as simply SkinLights, but Revlon took it off the market, breaking several hearts in the process. They brought it back in 2014 due to customer demand, giving it a new name and reformulating it so it has better texture and consistency than the older version. It’s a liquid formula and comes in four shades that you can mix and match together, wear alone, or combine with your foundation for an all-over strobed effect. The liquid formula also makes it easy to mix in with your body lotion to create a glow on your collarbone, shoulders, and legs.  Physicians Formula Nude Wear Touch of Glow Palette, $14.95  Physicians Formula  Some people swear by PF’s Mineral Glow Pearls Powder Palette, a small circular compact with bronze-y “pearls” of color. That one’s great, but we find that it works more like a bronzer, adding warmth more than a glow. The Touch of Glow Palette is a small square compact with four shades of shimmering powder: champagne, pink, light gold, and a soft bronze. You can definitely use them separately, but this product really packs a punch when you swirl all the colors together for a customized glow.  Maybelline Face Studio Master Strobe Stick, $7.99  Maybelline  Honestly, is there anything easier to use than makeup in stick form? Maybelline’s Strobe Stick is basically a crayon for your face. It’s small and only comes in two shades (“Light Iridescent” and “Medium Nude Glow”) but it packs a major punch — a little goes a long way, and you can easily apply a small application and buff it out along more areas of your face with your fingers or a brush. This is a great dupe for NARS’ the Multiple Stick, in terms of formula (not necessarily color). The creamy formula works well with skin’s natural texture, and dries down to a pearlescent glow with a slightly powdery finish. For 10 bucks, you can’t go wrong. Plus, it’s SO easy to travel with.  Black Radiance Artisan Color Baked Bronzer, $4.99  Black Radiance  This is technically a bronzer, but as we said above, highlighting is a technique, so you can use whatever gives you the best look for what you’re going for. It can be tough to find a decent highlighter for darker shades of skin, but this comes in four shades (Gingersnap, Rum Spice, Caramel, and Blackberry, shown above) that will help you achieve a diamond glow. The powder formula is marbleized, mixing together several shades of tones of caramel, gold, brown, and gold for a unique finish. You can also use it wet (we recommend using a makeup setting spray over water for extra staying power), which turns it into a sheer cream-like formula. Be forewarned though: The shimmer factor in this is strong, so it’s not for the weak of heart or for those afraid of a little extra dazzle.  NYX Born to Glow Illuminator, $7.50  NYX  This might easily be one of the most recognizable drugstore highlighters, aside from the aforementioned wet N wild one. NYX’s Born to Glow Liquid Illuminator is basically an IRL Snapchat filter for your skin. It’s easy to find at basically any drugstore and can be used as under or over foundation and/or mixed in with your foundation. Don’t let the name fool you though, as it’s less of a liquid and more of a lightweight cream. It comes in a squeeze tube and is available in four shades: Sunbeam (pale pink pearl), Gleam (golden peach pearl, shown above), Pure Gold (gold pearl), and Sun Goddess (bronze pearl). They can also be mixed together to create your own shade. It also has unimaginable staying power, so if you have oily skin or have issue with your product tending to run, this one’s for you.  wet n wild MegaGlo Highlighting Powder, $3.99  wet n wild  This is the holy grail of drugstore highlighters, if you can find it. It’s so popular that it’s almost always sold out on their website and in most stores. When do you find it, we recommend picking up several, especially since its only four bucks a pop. The formula is a super soft powder that swipes on easily and gives you just the right amount of glow. It’s only available in one shade, a rose gold-tinted tan, but it looks great on nearly all skin tones. It will warm up cooler skin tones and add radiance to deeper ones.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1099
2e801b34-2782-4e6f-8b4b-3c03a831d3c2,"It might seem crazy, but after almost 20 years in the industry, Amanda Seyfried still gets star-struck. ""Andy Garcia just walked by...no big deal, this is just my life,"" she exclaims to me over the phone from London, where she's doing press for the Mamma Mia sequel. However, just one minute later, she shouts over to her co-star, ""Hey!""—before explaining quickly to me that Cher had just came over—""I'm talking about you!"" This really is her life.  For some, summoning enthusiasm for a press tour after two decades in Hollywood—she started in the late '90s as Lucy Montgomery on As the World Turns before her breakout in 2008's Mamma Mia—might prove challenging to say the least. Not for Seyfried, who admits she's been feeling ill that day and is still excited for our chat. That's because filming Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again was one of the most rewarding experiences of her life. Mamma Mia, both the first film and the sequel, really boils down to a story about the relationship between a mother and her daughter. This time, Seyfried relates on a whole different level.    Amanda Seyfried and Meryl Streep in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again Universal  ""When I filmed the first movie I was in my twenties, falling in love, and just really frivolous. Now I have a daughter of my own and I just relate to Donna (Meryl Streep) that much more.""  The love Amanda Seyfried referenced was with her co-star Dominic Cooper, who played her love interest Skye. The actors dated for three years after filming Mamma Mia. Now 32 years old, Seyfried is married to actor Thomas Sadoski, the father of their one-year-old daughter. Now, Seyfried and Cooper are reunited on screen for the first time since their breakup...as lovers, again.  ""You can't call [your ex] by the pet names you have for them.""  So, does Seyfried have any advice for women who must face their ex at work? ""The number one, most important thing is setting boundaries,"" she shares. ""You can't call each other by the pet names you have for them.""  ""You know, it's very strange having to not be intimate with someone you've had an intimate relationship with,"" she confesses. ""It can be hard but you have to step back and be professional. Dominic and I have such a good relationship that it was easy...but if you don't like your ex, just try to get them fired,"" she jokes.  Amanda Seyfried, Dominic Cooper, and Cher in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again Universal  But back to Cher, who plays Amanda's on-screen grandmother. The two may be press junket buddies now, but when the film began would you believe it wasn't just the rest of the cast that was intimidated by Cher? Apparently, there's no star too big to feel apprehensive when meeting a new group of people who already click. ""We were all so nervous Cher's first day on set,"" Seyfried tells me. ""But when I finally had my first scene with her she told me how nervous she was to meet all of us. I ended up going up to the rest of the cast and crew and told them all to introduce themselves...to Cher!""  Yeah—this is just Amanda Seyfried's life.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,658

Therefore I understand women, I love to be around women, and I understand the power of women. I think women are the most powerful thing on earth.

I mean, let’s just start with giving birth, let’s just say.” One of his favourite, powerful and beautiful women? “Someone that I love to be around, and she’s so fun and funny, great personality, drop-dead gorgeous, and she’s a hard worker, it’s Sofia Vergara. I’m very proud of her.” And he talked about another women that he has worked with a bunch and continues to, Jennifer Lopez. “Not only is Jennifer someone that I admire and look up to, but she’s also helped me tremendously in my career.

8873cd5a-7e08-4628-85d5-180e0977ae98,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva  NORRISTOWN, Pa. — Bill Cosby, who once embodied the idealized American father on a wildly popular sitcom, was convicted of sexual assault on Thursday in a high-stakes retrial after a half-dozen women testified that the famed comedian drugged and assaulted them.  The jury found Cosby, 80, guilty on all three counts of aggravated indecent assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, drawing an emotional reaction from his other accusers in the courtroom.  The verdict was one of the first major courtroom victories for the #MeToo movement, which has exposed sexual harassment and misconduct in entertainment, media, politics and beyond.  Upon the reading of the first guilty verdict, several of Cosby's accusers sobbed and shook with joy. Cosby's head was bent slightly, eyes shut.  Although Cosby has faced dozens of sexual misconduct allegations spanning decades, he has been charged criminally only in the Constand case. Constand, a former employee at Temple University in Philadelphia, testified that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his suburban Philadelphia home in January 2004.  Constand maintained her composure as the verdict was read in Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.  Cosby lashed out at prosecutors as they asked Judge Steven O'Neill to revoke his bail, suggesting that he was a flight risk.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele noted Cosby's wealth and said he had a plane.  ""He doesn't have a plane, you asshole! I'm sick of it, you asshole!"" Cosby exclaimed.  Cosby faces a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count. He remains free on bail until sentencing. But he is unlikely to spend much time in jail.  O'Neill said that because of Cosby's age and his medical condition — his eyesight is poor — ""I am not going to simply lock him up."" Cosby has to surrender his passport and must remain in his nearby home, the judge said.  Lili Bernard, an accuser who once appeared as a guest on ""The Cosby Show,"" the groundbreaking 1980s sitcom that introduced an upper-middle-class black family to American viewers, let out a wail as the verdict was read. She began to cry, and court personnel escorted her from the courtroom.  ""I feel like my faith in humanity is restored,"" she told reporters through tears outside the courthouse.  Cosby's attorneys said in brief remarks that they would ""very strongly"" appeal the verdict. Cosby's first trial ended in a mistrial in June.  ""We are very disappointed by the verdict,"" Tom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, said outside the courthouse. ""We don't think Mr. Cosby's guilty of anything, and the fight is not over.""  Steele lauded Constand and the other accusers for their bravery in standing up to Cosby over the years.  ""The most important person in this is Andrea Constand — 14 years later, it may be easy to forget that she was the first courageous person that stood up in public,"" Steele said during a news conference. Constand stood next to the prosecutors, her hands folded in front of her, but she didn't speak.  ""Her quiet courage and her actions through this have helped victims stand up,"" Steele said. ""I hope and I pray that our actions have shown that we will stand up with those victims.""  Janice Baker-Kinney, who testified that Cosby gave her Quaaludes and sexually assaulted her, told MSNBC after the verdict that ""the relief is overwhelming.""  ""I'm shaking with relief, and I can't stop sobbing,"" she said.  Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents several of Cosby's accusers, praised the verdict while the women stood behind her, shoulder to shoulder, their arms around one another.  ""I truly hope that his long list of victims will now be able to find some kind of peace,"" she told reporters.  The decision came Thursday afternoon on the second day of deliberations. Earlier, the judge read back part of the testimony of the defense's star witness, who said Constand once said she could frame a ""high-profile person.""  The jury was also read back Cosby's testimony in a deposition he gave in 2005 after Constand filed a civil suit against him. In it, the comedian admitted giving a woman Quaaludes to have sex with her.  Cosby, who has repeatedly denied all the allegations against him, has said the sexual encounter with Constand was consensual. Cosby paid Constand nearly $3.4 million in 2006 to settle the civil case.  The verdict was the dramatic culmination of an 18-year case that spanned two criminal trials and multiple police investigations. Afterward, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and the University of Notre Dame both announced that they were rescinding honorary degrees they had bestowed on Cosby, while Temple University, where Cosby received his bachelor's degree in 1971 and where he was a trustee for more than 30 years, said the conviction ""provides additional facts for the university to consider with respect"" to an honorary doctorate it gave him in 1991.  Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden portrayed Cosby as a sexual predator who used his TV image as a man of wholesome values to target women he believed he could silence. Prosecutors called five other women who alleged that Cosby also sexually assaulted them in a manner similar to the way he assaulted Constand.  ""He preyed on Andrea Constand the same way he preyed on all those five women,"" Feden said.  Last month, O'Neill ruled that the additional accusers could testify so the prosecution could try to establish that the assault on Constand fit a pattern or that Cosby knew what would happen when he drugged Constand.  Attorneys for Cosby asked pointed questions about the accusers' histories of drug abuse, criminal backgrounds, personal relationships and sex lives.  Defense attorneys were especially hard on Janice Dickinson, a former supermodel.  Mesereau asked Dickinson whether she had spread false rumors about being pregnant with Sylvester Stallone's child. She said the remark was an honest mistake.  Bill Cosby arrives at court for deliberations on Thursday. Brendan McDermid / Reuters  ""I had sex with two men that month. He wasn't the only contender,"" she said, garnering smiles from the jury.  Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss described Dickinson in closing arguments as a ""failed starlet"" and ""an aged-out model.""  ""It sounds like she has slept with every single guy on the planet,"" Bliss said. ""Is Ms. Dickinson really the moral beacon that women's movements want?""  The defense also suggested that Constand and the other accusers were making false accusations in the hope of gaining fame or fortune.  They repeatedly pointed to the $3.4 million payout that Constand received from Cosby in 2006. And they highlighted Allred's proposal in 2014 to set aside a $100 million fund for victims of Cosby if he was unwilling to waive the statute of limitations to allow his accusers to confront him in court.  Some of the questions and arguments drew scorn from observers in the courtroom.  Bernard, who sat in the courtroom for much of the trial, called the defense's closing argument highly offensive.  ""It was based solely on rape myths, on victim blaming, on victim shaming and on a character assassination of really credible witnesses, of very righteous victims, of victims that were clearly telling the truth,"" Bernard told reporters as the jury deliberated Wednesday.  ""It was just a display of utter misogyny and buffoonery, and you know, I'm just, like, 'Wow, how low can they go?' "" she said.  The #MeToo movement was a cloud over the defense's closing arguments Tuesday, with Bliss telling jurors that they shouldn't allow it to influence their decision.  ""Don't get me wrong — bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,"" Bliss said. ""We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality.  ""But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,"" she added.

f5e6d088-040f-4969-ad57-7d8259a07d80,"Aaron Carter is speaking out about his DUI arrest over the weekend – lashing out at police and even his brother Nick.  The former child star, 29, was pulled over about 9 p.m. Saturday in Habersham County, Georgia, about 90 miles north of Atlanta. He was charged with driving under the influence, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana and possession of drug-related objects.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the car with him and was also arrested, PEOPLE confirms. She was charged with possession of marijuana, obstruction of law enforcement officers and possession of drug-related objects, according to the sheriff’s office.  Backstreet Boy Nick Carter shared a message to his younger brother on Twitter following news of the incident.  “To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better,” Nick, 37, wrote. “Family isn’t always easy, [but] we’re all here for you.”  Habersham County Sheriff's Office via AP  In a public statement posted on Twitter Sunday night, Aaron made it clear that he didn’t think his brother went about the situation in the right away.  “If my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn’t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum?” he said in the statement. “That’s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down. I love my family despite it through thick and thin.”  Nick seemingly responded to the message by retweeting a post by Nick’s wife, Lauren, which read, “Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!”  Aaron’s rep Jonathan Ward tells PEOPLE the popstar is reachable by his family — “whom he loves” — at any time.  “Nick and Lauren have his number – it hasn’t changed. They last spoke on July 6,” Ward tells PEOPLE exclusively. “He doesn’t feel it was proper, what happened. You don’t reach out through Twitter.”  To my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better. — Nick Carter (@nickcarter) July 16, 2017  Family isn't always easy,be we're all here for you. — Nick Carter (@nickcarter) July 16, 2017  Hey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again! 🤳🏼🗣👀 — Lauren Kitt Carter (@Lauren_Kitt) July 17, 2017  Aaron Carter also professed his innocence of all charges – and claimed he was targeted by police because he was famous.  According to the statement, Carter said he was at an AutoZone in Georgia to fix a tire that was out of alignment on his car when police officers arrested him “with aggression.”  He added that he has a license for medical marijuana for his anxiety and feels he was marked due to his fame.  “He feels his ‘celebrity’ was targeted and an attorney will be retained in this matter,” the statement said. “The video from AutoZone will prove that Aaron was not in a moving vehicle while arrested and charged with a DUI.”  Medical marijuana is legal in Georgia with a license. However, anxiety is not one of the 14 specific conditions covered.  Allen Berezovsky/Getty Image  The singer was previously arrested for investigation of marijuana possession in 2008.  Carter has previously said he “smokes bud,” but denied drinking or doing any other drugs.  During a candid interview for an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? last year, Aaron admitted that he turned to drugs and alcohol to self-medicate for depression he experienced after his parents’ divorce and his time on Dancing with the Stars.  “I started getting really heavy into drinking and was telling people, ‘I’m on a real bad path right now. I need help,’ ” he explained.  In 2011, Aaron checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California “to heal some emotional and spiritual issues he was dealing with,” his manager at the time, Johnny Wright, previously said in a statement.  Aaron has been in the spotlight since recording his first album at age seven. He was just 12 when his song “Aaron’s Party (Come Get It)” dropped. It went triple platinum and made him an international sensation.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,891
e9f2fec2-4571-4096-a1fb-4973ae43ca78,"Everything about Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez‘s relationship points to success, beginning with their respective empires across the categories of dance, music, sports, entrepreneurship and more, all the way to their joint couple name, “J-Rod.” Indeed, it seems that the couple has finally discovered lasting love.  While they have yet to be engaged as Rodriguez confirmed on the Today show this week, The Knot rounds up some of the reasons why this celebrity couple is on the road to lasting love.  Timing Was Everything—And They See It  Both Lopez and Rodriguez have been honest about their past failures with love—previous marriages and engagements included—and why they’re both ready now. “We have to take our time. I’ve made plenty of mistakes in my past,” Lopez previously told Good Morning America. “We’re mature now. We’re grown ups, and we’re going to take our time and we’re going to do things at our own pace.”  On Wednesday, August 1, Rodriguez touched on how age has played into the dynamics of their relationship in a good way. “To be honest, if this happened when we were in our twenties, it would have never happened,” he said. “It was just too much craziness. I wasn’t mature enough. You know, boys, we got to get our dumbness out of the way.”  They Share Similar Life Stages  Rodriguez also explained how they bond over the parallels in their lives. “We’re in our forties. We’re both from New York,” he mused on the Today show. “We both come from Latino backgrounds. We both have two kids. I think we’ve both been through a lot and can really appreciate each other—both the good and the challenges.”  Lopez echoed her boyfriend’s notes about their similar life stages in an interview with Cubby and Carolina in the Morning this week. “I think we’re both in a good place in our lives,” she said on the radio program. “Now at this point in our lives where we both have kids, we both have accomplished certain things in our careers and we’re kinda in that second act of our lives, we really complement each other. It’s like, where I need help, he’s really strong and where he needs help I’m really strong.”  They Sharpen Each Other  With dynamic and thriving careers, both Lopez and Rodriguez continue to look for the next derivative of personal and professional growth. “I’m in a good relationship. I feel like I can say that for the first time, I don’t know, maybe ever,” she previously told Hola! “And not that I didn’t have great relationships, full of love and adventure, but this is the first relationship I’ve been where I feel like we really make each other better. We complement each other, and there’s really pure, true love. Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy. So there’s a different selflessness in the love that’s beautiful and different. And healthy!”  Their Modern Family Loves Each Other  “Honestly it couldn’t be better,” Lopez added to Cubby and Carolina this week. “The four of them are amazingly special kids. I mean, of course I’m going to say that because I’m their mom, but they are and they’re sweet and they’re loving and they deal with us and our lifestyle in such a great way. And they love each other, they get along so good.”  Their Love Story Was Meant to Be  In a detailed Vanity Fair piece, Lopez went into detail about the beginning stages of their romance. In fact, it almost didn’t happen. “It was just one of those things where you feel compelled to do something you wouldn’t normally do,” she recalled. “I almost yelled out ‘Alex,’ but I am the shyest person when it comes to things like that… I could literally just have walked away. But I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say ‘Hey.’”  Their first date was equally surprising. “He was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!” she recalled to Vanity Fair. “I think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I’m not. I just listen. So he’s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn’t normally talk about on a first date. I don’t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date.”  Secure your ideal wedding vision by starting with The Knot’s Style Quiz, here.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,955
b24c5886-2a2a-4602-816d-ddc1c1efbe72,"Khloé Kardashian, just welcomed her first child — a baby girl! — amid rampant speculation about Tristan Thompson‘s alleged infidelities.  A source previously told PEOPLE that though Kardashian, 33, was devastated, she would remain focused on motherhood, explaining that the scandal “doesn’t change that Khloé has dreamed of becoming a mom.”  It’s also not the first time the Keeping Up with the Kardashians reality star has faced similar rumors. Before she was romantically linked to NBA boyfriend Thompson in September 2016, Kardashian dealt with allegations of extramarital affairs during her nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Lamar Odom.  A source close to Odom, 38, told PEOPLE recently that “Lamar feels terrible for Khloé. He wasn’t sure if he should reach out and see how she’s doing. He feels for her.”  Kardashian and Odom wed on Sept. 27, 2009 — one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) — but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player’s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.  Watch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.  Cheating rumors against Odom first circulated in January 2012, when a tabloid report claimed Odom cheated on Kardashian with a woman he met at a Washington, D.C., strip club. And in July 2013, the pair were confronted rumors claiming Odom had been unfaithful to Kardashian after playing a game for the Dallas Mavericks.  RELATED: Everything We Know About Khloé Kardashian’s Romance with Tristan Thompson (So Far)  JAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com  “Love is blind … Lamar was so great at making me feel like I was the only one and I’m this princess. I never speculated cheating … so I didn’t know about cheating … until before the DUI [in 2013],” Kardashian told Howard Stern in January 2016.  “He was so good. So nothing was on his cell phones, [but] he had an assistant. They were all on his assistant’s phone, so he was really crafty,” she recalled as Stern asked the former Kocktails with Khloé host: “Doesn’t that feel awful when the assistant knows, and everyone knows?” To which Kardashian agreed, “Oh, it’s disgusting.”  RELATED GALLERY: Khloé Kardashian & Lamar Odom: A Timeline of Their Relationship  “But all these rumors kept coming out in the weeklies, and as much as I know they’re bull—-, where there’s smoke there’s fire. Something has to be right here,” Kardashian revealed. “It is humiliating on any level, but I found out he was cheating on me the majority of our marriage, I just didn’t know.”  In October 2015, Odom was rushed to the hospital after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Near death, he spent four days in a coma, and Kardashian rushed to his side and called off their divorce proceedings temporarily.  Imeh Akpanudosen/Getty; JB Lacroix/WireImage  Months before, in July 2015, both stars had signed divorce papers, but the judgment had not yet been entered in court by the time Odom was hospitalized; thus, they were technically still legally married. As a result, Kardashian was making all of Odom’s medical decisions.  Upon his recovery, Odom completed a 30-day drug rehab program.  Khloé refiled for divorce once Odom recovered from the Nevada incident, and their split was finalized in December 2016.  RELATED: Khloé Kardashian Opens Up About Lamar Odom’s Harrowing Ordeal: I’ll Always Be There for Him  RELATED VIDEO: Khloé Kardashian’s BFF Khadijah Haqq Takes Aim at Tristan Thompson During Cheating Scandal  In July 2017, Odom penned an emotional first-person essay for The Players’ Tribune in which he touched on how his drug addiction and infidelity tore apart his marriage.  “Anybody who’s lived a complicated, drug-infused life like I’ve lived knows the cycle — with women, cheating on my wife, s— like that,” he wrote.  Jerritt Clark/Getty Images  One of his “darkest” moments, he admitted, was when Kardashian caught him doing drugs with another woman. “I was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife (at the time) walked in. That probably was like rock bottom. First of all I was in a motel. A motel,” he remembered.  “I’m a millionaire. I’d made it out of Jamaica, Queens, and won two NBA titles. And I’m in a motel, with some random person, doing coke. But I just wanted to get high with this girl, and I had no other place to go. I couldn’t take her home. You know, I was being a scumbag,” he wrote.  Odom still thinks highly of Kardashian. Asked in January by BET’s Mancave about Khloé being pregnant, Odom said he’s “happy for her,” adding, “She took care of me, she’ll be a good mother. For real. She’s a great woman.”  Now, a source told PEOPLE that when Kardashian got together with Thompson, her sisters were “really happy to see Khloe so excited about someone again because she hadn’t felt that way about a guy since Lamar. Eventually Tristan won over her family too … he really seemed dedicated to her, so this must be a shock to everyone.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1062
0af2a213-4cb0-4ed6-9395-7069b79c14d0,"UPDATE: This article previously referred to Kanye West's album as 'Love Everyone,' and has been edited to reflect its title 'ye.'  That's not being facetious. Considering the controversy surrounding Kanye West, his loosening grip on occupying the pinnacle of hip hop and ye being his eighth studio album, this album has the distinction of being a make-or-break point of the Chicago rapper and producer’s career. Yes, this is even more important than 2007’s Graduation, where West and 50 Cent went head-to-head with 'Ye coming out on top and signaling a shift from ultra aggressive rap to something more conscious. That was about the tone of hip hop; this is about the individual.  Obviously, every album can be deemed as the most important of an artist’s career. But this is different. Kanye West spent much of his career demanding respect from his peers. He questioned any review that wasn’t the equivalent of a classic and provided a bridge from the underground to the mainstream as rappers such as Talib Kweli, Common and Mos Def were pushed into the limelight. He was determined to be ambitious. The College Dropout redefined a sound while Late Registration took extra steps to refine it. Graduation represented the shift in musical ideology while 808s & Heartbreak introduced a new style and thematic content that a new wave of rappers would adopt. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is arguably the crown jewel of Kanye West albums that was universally acclaimed and earned him the classic status that he so desperately sought after. Watch The Throne was West tooting his horn as the pinnacle of rap royalty alongside JAY-Z and Yeezus would be his most daring project.  But somewhere down the line, the wheels started to come off. The rollout for The Life of Pablo was questionable at best and produced an album that was a sonic mess, but maintained cultural relevancy and acclaim. This acclaim was arguably a byproduct of the individual behind it rather than it being willingly accepted by fans. If TLOP was delivered by any other artist than Kanye West, chances are that it would have been panned. His lyrics drifted away from the self-conscious and relatable to mindless drivel that focused more on aesthetic than substance. It lacked the ambitious focus of Yeezus and felt like a direct reflection of Kanye’s life at the time. Deeply flawed but unable to pull himself away from the spotlight, legitimate questions regarding West’s reign at the top surfaced. Especially when the world has witnessed the rise of Drake, Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole while JAY-Z re-established himself as one of the greatest to ever do it with 4:44.  But the music wasn’t so much in question as Kanye’s character. From his interruption of Taylor Swift’s reception of Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards and the infamous “How Sway?” rant in 2013, to numerous questions regarding his mental health, possible drug addictions and the burning spotlight of being married to Kim Kardashian, it felt like we were watching Kanye West’s life unravel in front of our eyes. His obsessions appeared to be less about the music and more about fashion.  But nothing was worse than when the 40-year-old took to Twitter in May to profess his undying love for Donald Trump followed by an ill-advised appearance on TMZ when he suggested that slavery was a choice. Even the staunchest of Kanye supporters were ready to turn their lifelong fanclub cards in. With his credibility on the line, Kanye has stated that his new album will explain everything. That statement puts a great deal of pressure on a man who has had quite the intriguing fall from grace over the past couple of months.  However, through it all, the music has been the one thing that could force many of us to overlook his questionable antics. Because, at the root, it’s all about the music, right?  To be honest, for some, Kanye has already reached the point of no return. But there’s also this part about separating the art from the artist that still holds true. And if Kanye West is able to explain away any of his previous transgressions with this album, he would be forgiven for those questionable antics.  What also makes the pending release of ye more significant is the fact that he already delivered a Pusha T album that was immediately embraced as a classic. West proved that he wasn’t trapped in the stylings of aggro-rap and went back to the basics with chopped samples and wicked drums. If that’s any indication of what we could see on Kanye’s album, we may be in for a treat.  As for the lyrics, that’s another question in its entirety. West’s subject matter has dissolved into the absurd over the past couple of albums. Like his life, West’s rhymes haven’t necessarily been rooted in a reality that any of us can understand. He’s spent much of his time waxing poetic about celebrity status and being a God and less about things that his fans can find tangible. Then again, that has been the appeal of Kanye West to a certain segment of fans. Production is only half the battle because rhymes are just as (if not more) important to the equation. West has never been a deft lyricist but he has been serviceable with a penchant for nailing a quotable here and there. Lately though? Not so much.  A lot of this pressure he put on himself over the course of his career. He desired the spotlight so badly that it nearly ruined him. And now that he’s at a place where he can’t breathe without people questioning his motives, his new album is going to be dissected unlike any release before it. We’ll be searching for answers regarding his opioid abuse, liposuction, his love for Trump and all of this “free thinking” rhetoric he has been spilling for the past month.  Much will be answered when ye is released. It may not be the defining moment of a career that has had so many significant instances. However, given the spotlight and controversy surrounding the talented rapper from the Windy City, a lot is riding on this moment.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1180
8e7bb516-13dc-4e7b-afa4-db2ca238f0c3,"Angelina Jolie is allegedly surviving on little to no food, with sources questioning whether the stress of her divorce with Brad Pitt is to blame for her weight loss.  According to OK! Magazine, as cited by Gossip Cop, the actress has developed a smoking habit that’s so bad, she finds herself smoking an entire pack every single day, and to make matters worse, Angelina Jolie isn’t eating much on top of that.  Sources tell the publication that the A-list actress wakes up in the morning and finds herself smoking with a cup of coffee before the kids wake up, and she reportedly breaks the habit until her children are fast asleep before she carries on again.  Supposedly, Angelina Jolie smokes heavily throughout the morning and evening, and in the afternoon, there’s nothing that she consumes other than French cheese and expensive wine, which has greatly affected her weight, an insider stresses.  She’s nowhere near as healthy as she used to be, but the outlet fails to mention what her actual reasons are for this drastic diet she’s adapted to, though fans would want to believe that it’s presumably due to the supposed stress dealing with her divorce from Brad Pitt.  Whatever the case may be, it’s evidently clear that Angelina Jolie has been losing weight, which sources tell OK! Magazine is simply through the way that the mother of six has been treating herself as of late.  “Anytime I feel lost, I pull out a map and stare. I stare until I have reminded myself that life is a giant adventure, so much to do, to see.” – Angelina Jolie A post shared by Angelina Jolie (@angelinajolieofficial) on Nov 20, 2017 at 3:49pm PST  Angelina Jolie has never shied away from her dark past, which consisted of multiple health issues, but she has never commented on people’s recent concerns regarding her weight loss.  A statement regarding new claims about her unhealthy food intake will most likely not be addressed by the actress, for she has stayed away from even commenting on anything that concerns her weight.  Angelina Jolie has yet to finalize her divorce from Brad Pitt, as the couple continues to work out a custody plan with visitation rights that they are both in agreement with.  Despite OK! Magazine‘s claims, Gossip Cop‘s sources question the credibility of the outlet’s insiders, insisting that the story regarding Angelina Jolie’s weight loss is far from true.  Jolie famously filed for divorce last September, with reports at the time claiming that Pitt’s alcohol addiction had gotten so out of hand, it was beginning to affect everyone’s life around him, including his own family.  Angelina Jolie has remained single ever since.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,525

All those cousins coming out of the woodwork, asking you to pass along their script or snag an autograph or even help Aunt Agatha buy that new hot tub that she desperately needs.  Then there are those happy few stars who don’t have to face this problem. Because their cousins are famous, too.  In honor of Cousins Day – July 24, to be exact – here are several celebrity cousins who don’t have to worry about being the only famous person at their family reunion.  Jenny McCarthy and Melissa McCarthy  Jeny McCarthy (left) and Melissa McCarthy Noam Galai/WireImage; Steve Granitz/WireImage  You couldn’t ask for a better cousin than Jenny McCarthy. Back in the ’90s, The View host helped older cousin Melissa land her first TV role as a guest star in the former’s short-lived sitcom.  Now that both McCarthy girls have cemented their places in Hollywood, she’s spoken out against criticism of Melissa on multiple occasions.  Tom Cruise and William Mapother  Tom Cruise (left) and William Mapother Christopher Polk/Getty; Henry S. Dziekan III/Getty  Once you know that Tom Cruise‘s real name is “Thomas Mapother,” suddenly the resemblance between the A-lister and his character-actor cousin becomes a lot more apparent. (Look at their chins!)  Mapother has acted in five films with Cruise – Born on the Fourth of July, Magnolia, Mission: Impossible II, Vanilla Sky and Minority Report – but to us, he’ll always be Ethan, the duplicitous member of the Others from Lost.  Sofia Coppola, Jason Schwartzman and Nicolas Cage  From left: Sofia Coppola, Nicolas Cage and Jason Schwartzman Jason Merritt/Getty; Francois G. Durand/WireImage; Frazer Harrison/Getty  Composer Carmine Coppola unwittingly spawned a Hollywood dynasty: His son Francis became the famed director of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, while his daughter Talia Shire starred as Adrian in the Rocky movies.  Decades later, the second generation of Coppola cousins has gotten mixed up in the family business: Frances’s daughter Sofia and Talia’s son Jason have each followed in their parents’ footsteps, while their cousin Nicolas (son of the comparatively unknown August Coppola) took a new name from one of his favorite superheroes and became the Internet’s One True God.  Other Coppola cousins in the entertainment industry include Sofia’s older brother Roman, who co-wrote The Darjeeling Limited and Moonrise Kingdom, and Jason’s younger brother Robert, lead singer of the band Rooney.  Gwyneth Paltrow and Katherine Moennig  Gwyneth Paltrow (left) and Katherine Moennig Donato Sardella/Getty; Gregg DeGuire/WireImage  Even before she came to fame on The L Word, actress Katherine Moennig was haunted by questions about her blonder, goopier cousin.  As a 2000 New York Observer profile observed, when asked about Gwyneth, “a wary look crossed Ms. Moennig’s eyes and her facial muscles seemed to freeze up.”  Later, she revealed a certain gratefulness for their lack of resemblance: “We’re totally different people. We look very different, too No one’s judging me solely on the fact that I am her cousin.”  Snoop Dogg and Brandy  Brandy (left) and Snoop Dogg M. Caulfield/WireImage  This is one of those facts that you feel a lot more people should know than they do. We’re talking two of the most famous musicians to come out of the ’90s!  Although perhaps that would have made it weird for them to collaborate on a love song, as they did on Snoop’s “Special.”  Gary LeVox and Jay DeMarcus  Gary LeVox (left) and Jay DeMarcus Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic  Though they’re only second cousins, LeVox and DeMarcus probably hang out more than most of the relatives on this list. They have to – they’re two of the three members of the country group Rascal Flatts!  Damon Dash and Stacey Dash  Damon Dash and Stacey Dash J.Sciulli/WireImage  Maybe we’re mixing him up with Reverend Run, but we’d always sort of assumed “Damon Dash” was not the name the former Roc-A-Fella Records honcho was born with. But it was!  When you realize that your whole perspective was whack, it makes more sense that he’s cousins with Clueless‘s Stacey Dash.  Melissa Gorga and Ralph Macchio  Melissa Gorga and Raph Macchio Dave Kotinsky/Getty; Gilbert Carrasquillo/FilmMagic  Cousins often enjoy different levels of success at different points in their lives, but the comparison is striking in the case of these two relatives.  Melissa Gorga was just a child when her cousin Ralph Macchio shot to fame in The Karate Kid – years later, he was working as a guest actor on shows like Psych and How I Met Your Mother when an all-grown-up Gorga became a cast member on The Real Housewives of New Jersey.  K-Ci & JoJo and Fantasia Barrino  From left: K-Ci amp#38; JoJo and Fantasia Barrino Jun Sato/WireImage; Steve Granitz/WireImage  All their lives, brothers Cedric “K-Ci” and Joel “JoJo” Hailey have been cousins with American Idol winner Fantasia Barrino.  The trio haven’t officially recorded together, but K-Ci did show up at a Fantasia concert to duet on “Nobody Greater” with his younger cuz.  Kyra Sedgwick and Edie Sedgwick  Kyra Sedgwick (left) and Edie Sedgwick Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic; Herve Gloaguen/Rapho/Getty  If someone asks you to explain the concept of first cousins once removed, just tell them, “It’s like Edie Sedgwick and Kyra Sedwick!” (Edie’s father was the younger brother of Kyra’s grandfather.)  Brooke Shields and Glenn Close  Brooke Shields (left) and Glenn Close Slaven Vlasic/Getty; Steve Granitz/WireImage  Likewise, next time someone asks you how to explain the concept of second cousins once removed to them, just tell them, “It’s like Brooke Shields and Glenn Close!” (Shields’s great-grandmother was the sister of Close’s grandfather.)  The difference? You have probably met most of your first cousins once removed, at least once or twice (unless your parents hated their cousins). You probably haven’t met many of your second cousins once removed.  Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip  Prince Philip and Queen Elizabeth Andrew Milligan/WPA//Getty  It’s safe to say that the royal families of Europe have different relationships with their cousins than the rest of us.  Take, for example, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip, who are distant cousins.  That actually understates the complexity of their bloodlines, as Elizabeth and Philip are, in fact, related to each other twice.  Not only are the couple each great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria, making them third cousins, they also share an ancestor in Christian IX of Denmark, who was Phillip’s great-grandfather and Elizabeth’s great-great-grandfather, thus making them second cousins once removed. (Like Brooke Shields and Glenn Close!)  Like we said, royals are different.  Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt  Franklin D. Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt Fotosearch/Getty  Before you snicker at the Queen, remember that America’s rulers aren’t any strangers to marrying their cousins, either.  Yes, Eleanor Roosevelt may have only been FDR’s fifth cousin once removed, and yes, she may have been more closely related to the other Roosevelt president (she was Teddy’s niece), but still – her maiden name was Roosevelt!  You could say the future president was just following in the family tradition, though; his own parents were sixth cousins.

The relationship builds slowly over time as we share moments of laughter, sadness, and quiet companionship. The memories shared with a dog will be unforgettable. Even though you know from the start that you will outlive your furry friend, the day your dog dies will be one of the hardest of your life.  Over the past year, there have been so many celebrity pet losses. With each one, our hearts have ached.  Lisa Vanderpump, of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills was in tears in a recent episode. The reason for this was the loss of her adorable Pomeranian, “Pink Dog”. The reality star is known for her passion for the color pink as much as for her dedication to serving dog charities. Pink Dog regularly had her white fur tinted pink with food coloring.  Credit: Bravo / The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills  During the episode, Lisa met with her friends, animal activists Kyle Richards and Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave, to talk about Pink Dog’s passing. The Pomeranian was approximately 5-years old and died suddenly, last September, from a heart attack.  “We are devastated to see you go so suddenly…you were such a happy dog and we will miss you so much. We love you,” said Lisa after her Pomeranian passed away.  Lisa tells Kyle and Teddi: “Pink Dog was a happy, little, pink dog. And she just had a heart attack and died. My dogs are like my little furry children. I don’t want to cry. Can we stop now?”  Lisa said her husband, Ken Todd, tried to save the pooch by giving CPR, but it was too late.

dccec088-37fe-4f34-a8f2-3ba7a36a0b3f,"Speaking with Michelle Miller, the British actor admitted to opting for more independent movies after he shot to superstardom playing vampire Edward Cullen in the wildly popular Twilight series. On auditioning for entirely different roles post-Twilight, Pattinson said, “It’s not like, ‘Oh, I’ll come down from an ivory tower to be…’ I mean, these movies are hard for me to get. Literally, I’m just as much trying to convince people, like, every single time. And it’s not like I’m, like, Leo [ DiCaprio ] or something!”  In the interview, it was revealed Good Time producers Josh and Benny Safdie were initially hesitant to work with Pattinson, but later discovered their opinions on the actor were far from accurate. On breaking free from his once perceived image as a teen heartthrob, the star said, “I think so much of life people are trying to put you in a box and define you all the time.” He continued, “It’s just exciting to have a job where you’re allowed to consistently break the walls of the box around you.”  Pattinson went on to talk about the vast amount of media attention he’s received since taking on the role of a lifetime in the Twilight series, despite his best-efforts to keep his personal life under wraps. “I’m quite an open person,” he said. “I don’t want to be one of those people who’s just like, ‘Oh, no comment,’ ’cause I just think you just look like an idiot if you’re in it. But then the annoying thing happens as well, then you answer in these kind of vague ways which kind of create these weird conspiracy theorists.”  The star added, “I don’t know how to deal with it. And so I thought in a way to kind of stop feeding it, you just try and say ‘I don’t wanna talk about it.’ And also, it kind of makes you feel like that’s the only way you can get some kind of strength.” Watch Pattinson’s full interview below!",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,420

Rihanna and Hassan Jameel made headlines in June 2017 when they were photographed making out in a pool at a private villa in Spain. Fans believed at first that the guy was a Spanish footballer, but he turned out to be a Saudi billionaire. He is the deputy president and vice chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the largest companies in the world. The Barbadian singer was in an on-and-off relationship with Chris Brown, 28, and it looks like her new beau fears that the “With You” singer might win her back.  A source close to Rihanna, 29, recently told Hollywood Life that Jameel is worried that Brown keeps “lurking in her past” and is being unpredictable. Although RiRi has opened up to her new beau about her past, the Toyota heir is still concerned that Breezy can still win her back. He feels uncomfortable with the idea that the “Kiss Kiss” singer still loves her and might be able to take her back from him anytime.  However, a separate source previously told the same news outlet that Rihanna hopes that the well-heeled Saudi Arabian can help her forget her dark past with Chris Brown. Now, fans are convinced that she has moved on gracefully from Breezy. The “Umbrella” singer recently stepped out with her new flame Hassan Jameel at the Grammys despite keeping their relationship under wraps.  “He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy.

5dcc3cf5-a494-4cc3-97f3-a40464bcec98,"Jane Lynch is reflecting on the life and death of her former Glee costar Mark Salling following his apparent suicide on Tuesday, January 30.  “It’s been tough. He was a troubled, troubled guy, and he always was,” Lynch, 57, told Us Weekly exclusively at Adopt the Arts’ Annual Rock Gala on Wednesday, January 31. “This is a very sad end to it, but I know that he’s at peace now. He’s in the arms of a beneficent force.”  Lynch and Salling costarred in Fox’s Glee from 2009 to 2015. Shortly after the show ended, Salling was arrested for felony possession of child pornography. He pled guilty just one month before his death and was set to appear in court on March 7.  “I know life was very, very hard for Mark. I think we all do the best we can at the end of the day. I know Mark that did the best he could,” Lynch continued. The Emmy Award winner admitted she didn’t know Salling’s family and really didn’t know him, regardless of working together for six years.  “He was a hard guy to get to know,” she said.  However, she does have a personal memory with Salling she holds close to her heart.  “He took videos of the stages and everything. He was so happy to be coming to work, to be on the show. He wrote a song and videotaped his day being on Glee,” Lynch explained. “Driving into the Paramount lot … at that time he was living on a cot in a little room. It was a big jump for him in his career, and also, he had a job and was in with this group of really great kids. I think he knew that he was breathing rarefied air. There was so much joy and happiness in his musical video that he shot for himself. Fox made him take it down. But it was a sweet, beautiful expression of his joy and being in Glee.”  As Us previously reported, Salling’s estate may not have to pay his victims $50,000 each following the death. “Restitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge … He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,” a source explained.  Salling, who was 35 at his time of death, “knew he would have nothing to come back to after he went to prison,” an insider close to the actor told Us.  With reporting by Nicholas White.

In fact, Miley Cyrus is full on embracing her Hannah Montana days. Everyone, of course, is obsessed with this new era, but none of us will ever forget how she got her big break and neither will she, which she gushed about on The Howard Stern Show.  ""They cast someone, besides me, first. And they even did a pilot without me and then they said it didn’t work,"" Miley said. ""I love that I was f—ing Hannah Montana. That’s what the song 'Younger Now' on my album is about. It says, 'Even though it’s not who I am, I’m not afraid of who I used to be.'""

""I think why people loved [it] was because Hannah Montana did feel real, and that's because I was under there. And people forgot that sometimes. I loved being that character and that's what made people love her…That was great music for kids to listen to. There's a song called Life's What You Make it, so Let's Make it Rock. Never forget that – wise words. That's a good thing to tell kids.""  However, living this sort of double life wasn't always easy. Miley said,""It's a lot to put on a kid to have them have get their make-up done and then also balance school…It got harder when I started touring as both – I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself. I think that's probably what's a little bit wrong with me now! I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.""  There were subtle hints to her past in the in the ""Younger Now"" music video that fans picked up on, and as the singer recently told MTV News, none of them were actually intentional funny enough.  ""Even though I wasn't intentionally trying to reenact something I had already done, it just naturally happened, because that's a part of me too,"" Miley said.

I am stoked that that was a part of my life,” she continued to MTV. ""I'm not afraid of who I used to be. No one stays the same.""

462b8254-161b-4855-97cc-32241b5923b5,"CLOSE Reality TV star Chris Soules appeared in court Monday as his lawyers argued the charge against him should be dropped. Pool video  A Buchanan County judge dismissed a contempt of court charge against former KWWL reporter Elizabeth Amanieh on Thursday. (Photo: Special to the Register)  A judge has dismissed contempt of court charges against a former reporter for an eastern Iowa news station who took video of a court appearance by ""The Bachelor"" star Chris Soules.  Elizabeth Amanieh, a former reporter for KWWL, an NBC affiliate station based in Waterloo, took video of Soules in April 2017 during his initial appearance.  Authorities say Soules was involved in a hit and run in April in Aurora, a small town in Buchanan County, when he rear-ended 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, who was driving a tractor. Soules allegedly left the scene after calling 911. Mosher died in the accident.  Soules was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal car crash, a class D felony. If convicted, he could face as many as five years in prison. His trial is set to begin Nov. 7.  Buchanan County District Court Judge Fae Hoover-Grinde on Thursday dismissed the contempt charge against Elizabeth Amanieh. Hoover-Grinde found prosecutors failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Elizabeth Amanieh willfully violated another judge's order not to record video of the proceeding, said Amanieh's attorneys, Tom Frerichs and Eric Tindal.  ""For her to recognize that was huge for me because I felt like my voice was finally heard,"" Amanieh told the Register in an interview Monday.  More on the Chris Soules case:  Iowa allows journalists to record video, audio and take photographs if they have prior approval. Prosecutors in the case say Judge Linda Fangman had told Amanieh that only photos could be taken during the trial. But prosecutors said that the reporter used her cellphone to take video of Soules' initial appearance.  Hours after the hearing, the district's chief judge, Kellyann Lekar, signed an order retroactively approving expanded media coverage for the hearing. That order was requested by the media coordinator at KWWL's urging, amid confusion about Fangman's order. KWWL then aired and posted the video.  The Buchanan County Attorney's Office filed a complaint saying Amanieh was in contempt of court.  In a news release, Amanieh expressed relief that the case was dismissed. But she also said KWWL executives asked her to film on her cellphone and later posted the video, though she was uncomfortable with the actions.  ""I only did everything my news director at the time, Shane Moreland, directed me to do,"" Amanieh said in the release. ""I was simply following orders when I received direction from KWWL-TV management to record video on my cellphone. When the judge ... told me she did not want that video to be seen anywhere, I got on the phone and called my boss, telling him I was going to delete the video.""  Amanieh said KWWL management told her not to delete the video and later asked Lekar for permission to use the video.  ""KWWL may have been wrong in ordering me to record video on my phone, but they also took no ownership of their actions,"" Amanieh said in the release. ""Even though I followed the directions of KWWL management, they used me as a scapegoat. Instead of standing beside me, they covered up their own actions at every step.""  When asked if she would pursue legal action against the station, Amanieh said ""as of this moment, we are just looking at our options.""  Jim McKernan, KWWL's vice president and general manager, on Monday took issue with some of the information he's seen reported on the case, but said the station would not comment further.  ""Some of the reporting and some of the opinions as represented so far in the press are not correct,"" he said, declining to elaborate.  Moreland did not immediately respond Monday to a message seeking comment.  Read or Share this story: https://dmreg.co/2O8fZx9",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,756

It’s a vicious cycle and it ate away at me for a long time,” he said at the time. “I’m almost two years sober, now, and it’s not that easy — you have to completely change your way of living.”  In the wake of his death, many franchise alums shared kind words about the man, with Sean Lowe calling him “a sweet man with a kind soul,” and Chris Bukowski commemorating him as “a gentle man with a huge heart.”  So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance. Such a kind heart with so much talent. Sending prayers and love to his family and friends. — Emily MaynardJohnson (@EmilyMaynard) May 30, 2017  “Such a kind heart with so much talent,” Maynard tweeted at the time. “Sending prayers and love to his family and friends.”  Although he didn’t win Maynard’s heart, Nance returned to Austin, where he went on to make music for several years.  Of the troubled reality star, a Bachelorette source previously told PEOPLE that the spotlight of the show had weighed heavily on Nance.  “He was the type of guy who felt things very deeply,” the source said. “Such a sensitive guy. You’ve got to remember that I met him when he was in his mid 20s, so he was pretty directionless. I don’t know that being on TV gave him any further direction. But he had such a good aura.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,524

The songstress, 24, was spotted on Monday on her busy promo circuit in New York. As she swapped outfits from one appearance to the next, her style staples of the day were her Louis Vuitton’s crystal flower sandals that featured black suede baby goat leather and a transparent heel. You too can get the same shoe as Selena for $1,060.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  For her first look, Gomez styled her Vuitton heels with a Jacquemus mini dress in the early morning. The navy ensemble was loose at the top and fitted through the body with a large button accenting the crossover V-neckline and split skirt. With a price tag of $696, the star’s outfit cost nearly $2,000.  Next, the 13 Reasons Why executive producer stopped by the Elvis Duran and The Morning Show. Wearing the same LV sandals, Gomez changed into a bright orange dress from Christopher Kane’s pre-Fall 2017 collection. Her colorful look featured a deep V-neckline and a side slit.  After, Gomez visited the SiriusXM studios for her Morning Mash Up interview wearing a black slip dress over a white tunic. Her Victor Glemaud resort ensemble was styled with Tura Inc sunglasses and her go-to Vuitton heels.  Then, SelGo had all eyes on her when she opted for a matching neon pink-and-white printed polo shirt and pants set from Miu Miu’s Fall 2017 ready-to-wear collection. She changed up her hairstyle by gathering her beach waves into a high ponytail, and she gave her Louis Vuitton heels a fashion break by changing into silver Gianvito Rossi heels.

LOS ANGELES - Adele stood proud with Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lawrence protesting equality for women in America by carrying placards at the 2018 Women's March in Los Angeles on Saturday.  The British pop - star who resides in La La Land with husband Simon Konecki and their five-year-old son Angelo - shared a selfie with the Holiday star and Hunger Games actress with their protest placards as they joined thousands of women speaking out against President Donald Trump and the lack of equality in the US.  The 29-year-old singer says she has raised her little boy to have empathy for the opposite sex.  Speaking about the influence the women in her life have had on her career, the Hello hitmaker captioned the post: ""The most influential people in my life have always been women. My family, my friends, my teachers, my colleagues, and my idols. I am obsessed with all the women in my life. I adore them and need them more and more every day. I am so grateful to be a woman, I wouldn't change it for the world. I hope I'm not only defined by my gender though. I hope I'm defined by my input to the world, my ability to love and to have empathy. To raise my son to be a a good man alongside the good man who loves me for everything I am and am not. I want what's best for people, I think we all do. We just can't agree on what that is. Power to the peaceful, power to the people x #womensmarch2018 (sic)""  The Make You Feel My Love singer joined the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon in standing strong and fighting for their rights and hoping to bring change to the country.  On one of her signs, typical of potty-mouthed Adele, she displayed the words: ""Everyone's full of s--t.""  Her other placard said: ""I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change! I am changing the things I cannot accept.""  Lawrence's read: ""A woman's place, is in the revolution.""

With HBO exploring five different GoT spinoff concepts, “we’d be lucky to get one that we’re very, very excited about, and we did get that. We’re just starting the search for a director… we have to cast it. We hope to be shooting sometime in the new year.”  HBO ordered a pilot for the untitled prequel last month, with the action set thousands of years before the events of Game of Thrones. Per the official logline, “the series chronicles the world’s descent from the golden Age of Heroes into its darkest hour. And only one thing is for sure: from the horrifying secrets of Westeros’ history to the true origin of the white walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend… it’s not the story we think we know.”  In addition to writing the pilot, Goldman (X-Men: First Class) will serve as showrunner, and will join Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin as an executive producer. You’ll have to wait a bit to see it, though: Bloys said earlier this year the prequel won’t debut until at least a year after the original GoT wraps up its final season — which won’t start until the first half of 2019.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,298

In a nearly two hour-long interview released on Tuesday with Charlamagne tha God from iHeartRadio’sThe Breakfast Club, Kanye talks about what led to his rift with JAY-Z, expressing the disappointment he felt when the 48-year-old rapper and his wife, Beyonce, did not attend his 2014 wedding in Italy to Kim Kardashian West.  ""I was hurt about them not coming to the wedding. I understand they were going through some things, but if it's family, you're not going to miss a wedding,"" he says. ""I gotta state my truth.""  ""You just start coming up with all types of crazy things in your head,"" Kanye adds, noting that he started to feel ""like the cousin that you can't bring around.""  When asked if he knows why JAY-Z and Beyonce skipped the nuptials, Kanye says he never asked them. ""I'm not sure, I'm past it, but at the time I was hurt about it,"" he replies. ""I don't think I ever asked him that question directly.""  As for the state of his friendship with JAY today, Kanye says, ""We good. We texting each other, positive energy.""  Charlamagne also inquired as to whether the Watch the Throne collaborators have seen each other, to which Kanye admits, ""I haven't seen him, but I can feel him.""  He adds, ""We'll do it. Sometimes also when you have such similar personalities ...they need to do it on our own.""  Kanye also addresses JAY-Z's slight dig about him in the song, ""Kill JAY-Z,"" but doesn't seem mad about it. ""He did it in a brotherly way,"" he notes.

Katy Perry's conservative Christian past is no secret, but the pop superstar took a trip down memory lane on Saturday night (March 18) while dropping some new truths in the process of detailing her journey to enlightenment.  The reason: Human Rights Campaign's Los Angeles gala dinner at JW Marriott L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles, where Perry picked up the org's highest honor, the National Equality Award. HRC feted the 32-year-old alongside America Ferrera, 32, who took home the Ally for Equality Award, a trophy presented to her by her good friend Lena Dunham. Perry received her award from her own BFF of 11 years, actress Shannon Woodward, who said the singer ""finds a way to act as an ally virtually every single time she performs or speaks publicly.""

""There’s no other community that has done more to shape who I am today, and there is no other community that I believe in more than you,"" she exclaimed. ""This community here tonight has achieved more progress toward a more perfect union in a short amount of time as any group in our history. So I stand with you and I know that we stand together against discrimination, whether it be in the LGBTQ community or our Latino brothers and sisters or the millions of Muslims in this country.""  Then came Perry's peek at the past. After noting that she speaks her truths and paints her fantasies courtesy of ""little, bite-sized pop songs,"" she referenced her 2008 smash hit single ""I Kissed a Girl."" The lesbian lyrics were just a tease.  ""Truth be told: A) I did more than that,"" Perry purred. ""But B) How was I going to reconcile that with the gospel singing girl raised in youth groups that [was] pro-conversion camps? What I did know is that I was curious, and even then, I knew that sexuality wasn’t as black and white as this dress."" (For the record, she was wearing a Rasario design.)  However, Perry's own curiosity seemed to have gotten repressed by her Christian leanings. ""My first words were 'mama' and 'dada,' 'God' and 'Satan,'"" she related. ""Right and wrong were taught to me on felt boards and, of course, through the glamorous Jan Crouch crying diamond teardrops every night on that Vaseline-TBN television screen. When I was growing up, homosexuality was synonymous with the word 'abomination' … and hell. A place of gnashing of teeth, continual burning of skin and probably Mike Pence’s ultimate guest list for a barbecue. No way, no way. I wanted the pearly gates and unlimited fro-yo toppings.""  As a result of the anti-homosexuality education she received, Perry turned toward prayer.  ""Most of my unconscious adolescence, I prayed the gay away at my Jesus camps,"" she revealed. ""But then in the middle of it all, in a twist of events, I found my gift, and my gift introduced me to people outside of my bubble. My bubble started to burst.""  The ""pop"" happened with the introduction of LGBTQ friends and collaborators.  ""These people were nothing like I had been taught to fear,"" Perry continued. ""They were the most free, strong, kind and inclusive people I have ever met. They stimulated my mind and they filled my heart with joy, and they freaking danced all the while doing it. These people are actually magic, and they are magic because they are living their truth. Oh, my goodness, what a revelation! — and not the last chapter of the Bible.""  One of those magic people in Perry's life is her longtime manager, ""Bradford Elton Cobb III,"" a man she described as ""one of the greatest champions of my life,"" for going on 15 years. ""Many of the people I admire and trust and work with belong to the LGBTQ community, and without them, I would be half the person I am today. My life is rich in every capacity because of them. They are trusted allies that provide a safe space to fall, to not know it all and to make mistakes,"" she concluded at the close of her speech, which was bookended by standing ovations. ""I hope I stand here as evidence for all that it doesn’t matter where you come from, it is about where you are going. Real change, real evolution and real perception shift can happen if we open our minds and soften our hearts. People can change — believe me.""

215e76fc-eaec-4691-ad20-61ef801a3db8,"Avril Lavigne is alive.  On the 15th anniversary of the pop star’s hit single “Complicated,” a conspiracy theory claiming that she died in 2003 and has been replaced by a lookalike has resurfaced. If you aren’t familiar with the theory, this blogpost dating back to 2011 from a Brazilian site should bring you up to speed. The basic idea is that Lavigne, who was at the peak of her career at the time, committed suicide after her grandfather’s death in 2003. Rather than coming to terms with what had happened, Lavigne’s record company used Melissa Vandella – Lavigne’s doppleganger who was supposedly hired to pose as Lavigne for paparazzi – in her place to profit off of her celebrity.  As the story goes, Vandella then went to record “Under My Skin” as Lavigne (“From here it was no longer the real Avril,” the blog post reads, “but ‘Avril Lavigne’ under the skin of the other singer”) and left subtle hints along the way about what had really happened. That, along with pictures of how Lavigne’s face and handwriting had changed, was all the proof they needed.  There’s just one problem. As Buzzfeed explained in an article titled “Here’s How I Accidentally Made An Old Avril Lavigne Death Hoax Go Viral,” that Brazilian post made it clear at the beginning that it was created to show “how conspiracy theories can look true.” And yet, despite that disclaimer, the theory quickly spread like wildfire thanks to the Buzzfeed writer sharing the conspiracy theory as a joke with his fellow Americans following a visit to Buzzfeed Brazil.  Which brings us to today. Late last week, Twitter used @givenchyass brought the conspiracy theory back to life with a long thread explaining it all. It begins with this tweet, which has over 100,000 retweets and 160,000 favorites:  avril lavigne is dead & was replaced by a look alike: a conspiracy theory thread pic.twitter.com/9eearQ2rte — ? (@givenchyass) May 13, 2017  And quickly divulges into this:  here’s a video I made comparing an avril song from 2002 to an avril song from 2014 pic.twitter.com/1KFZJ8cHnD — ?

Craig Sjodin via Getty  However, sources confirm to PEOPLE that Chmerkovskiy did not perform by choice because of ongoing conflict with Lachey.  “There’s a big chemistry issue,” the insider says. “They both have big personalities and that’s not always the best recipe for a good partnership.”  PEOPLE’s special issue 25 Seasons of ‘Dancing with the Stars’ is on stands now.

It’s cool.”  He added at the time, “She lets me be creative.

When it comes to Lachey, though, the insider says last week could’ve been her last performance with Chmerkovskiy: “I wouldn’t be surprised if Maks doesn’t return as her partner for the rest of the season.”  However, a DWTS rep says Chmerkovskiy will compete next week.

With that, unfortunately, comes having every aspect of her life analyzed. Her relationship status and dating life are part of that, and when a recent report surfaced that alleged Jackson was dating three women at once, the daughter of the pop icon Michael Jackson took it upon herself to set the record straight.  After Gossip Cop published a report refuting that Jackson was dating three women at the same time—Cara Delevingne , Ashley Benson , and Caroline D'Amore, according to The National Enquirer —Jackson's rep also denied it all, saying, ""No idea how or why they come up with this stuff. Definitely not true.” Jackson later hopped on Twitter to echo that statement, tweeting, ""I’ve never met miss benzo. Caroline is one of my bestest friends who is **straight** and **married**, and also the mother of my godchild. Cara and I were never officially exclusive, you guys made that up.""  The report, which said “things could get quite nasty if Paris doesn’t choose one of these girls to date exclusively,” is the kind of fan-fiction that has become an annoying reality for celebrities who don't adhere to heteronormative sexuality. Delevingne, who has spoken out about not wanting to be ""pigeonholed"" before, has also dealt with overzealous tabloid coverage of her love life.  Just last month, after Delevingne was seen holding hands with Benson as they walked around New York City wearing matching backpacks, some speculated that the pair were an item. Fueling that rumor, or trolling it, or both, Benson later shared the photo on her Instagram, writing, ""Cute cute cute.""  Loading View on Instagram  As for D’Amore, it's somewhat of a mystery how she became entangled in this rumor. The DJ has been married to her husband, Bobby Alt, since 2012, and the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter, Isabella Viking Alt, back in 2015. As Jackson noted, she's the godmother of their child.

The platinum-blonde star said she was most looking forward to the “costumes, dancing, and romance” in the sequel to the hit 2015 Disney Channel Original Movie.  “Descendants 2” director, choreographer, and executive producer Kenny Ortega was also on hand to fete the film, along with cast members Sofia Carson, Booboo Stewart, and Cameron Boyce, who play the progeny of some of Disney’s most beloved (and ballyhooed) villains.  Brenna D’Amico, who portrays Jane, daughter of Fairy Godmother in “Descendants,” said she was most excited about the audience’s reaction to the film.  “I really am looking forward to them seeing the action — there’s a lot more action — the sets are bigger, the music numbers are insane, everybody’s amazing, and the little love stories they’ve plopped in there,” she said.  The premiere also drew “UnReal” star Constance Zimmer, who arrived to the event with daughter, Coco, and shared a few secrets about Season 3 of the Lifetime series.  “I can tell you that the new season, having added an additional very strong, opinionated woman — being our bachelorette — it really adds a dimension to the whole show,” Zimmer said. “Even though it’s the same formula, it really shifts the perspective from how women are treated, how men treat women, how women treat men, but it’s not beating anybody over the head with a hammer. It’s a really interesting message how we all change and shift depending for the situation.”  As for “Descendants 2,” Zimmer was “most excited about the new character, Uma.  “She’s got blue hair and she’s like a pirate,” she said.  “Descendants 2” debuts on July 21 at 8 p.m. ET/PT in an unprecedented simultaneous premiere across six networks: ABC, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Freeform, Lifetime, Lifetime Movies, and branded apps.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,412
cf857bf9-c232-4a11-ba82-5a1bf76332bc,"Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.

50448fd7-afcd-4d48-8057-c53ea8d0712c,"It’s been nearly four months since Tamar Braxton filed for divorce from her husband, Vincent Herbert and since the news broke, rumors of a secret love child and domestic abuse have bubbled over. There was even a social media meltdown. Though the singer is finally ready to clear the air.  Sitting down with the ladies of The View, the Grammy-nominated reality star shared the status of her relationship with Herbert and spilled the tea who fueled allegations that caused her Instagram hiatus.  “I have a regular marriage and in regular marriages just like everyone else, things happen, you know. In my marriage, it was just to a point where I felt like divorce was the only option I had left,” she said. Herbert sat in the audience listening attentively as his former partner continued. “Although we’re in extensive counseling and that is much needed and it always will be, I think the bigger picture of everything is that we have a responsibility to my amazing 4-year-old son, just to raise him in the most comfortable, amazing, loving and secure household that we can—that’s why we don’t live together,” she said.  Braxton filed for divorce in October just a month after she announced that her most recent album, Bluebird of Happiness, would be her last so that she could take time off to work on her marriage. The couple married in November of 2008 and welcomed their only child together, Logan, in June 2013.  Many believed that the timing of the divorce announcement was strictly for ratings to promote the fifth season of the couple’s WEtv reality series, Tamar & Vince but the 40-year-old insists that that is far from the truth.  “I wish I could say that a lot of times I could say it was made up just so I could hide behind the truth sometimes. But in this situation, I absolutely have no reason to lie about my marriage or the things that [are] happening in my marriage for ratings. I think that’s disgusting and I would never sell my soul to the devil like that. It’s not that serious. Marriage is a serious thing for me and for my family.”  Nasty allegations also ensued after news broke that Braxton filed for divorce and was only fueled more when the reality star took to Instagram to accuse Herbert of cheating and getting another woman pregnant.  After learning that it was merely a rumor shared with her by someone she believed was her friend, the Maryland native took a hiatus from the ‘Gram. Although she’s since returned to the social media site, she said the incident taught her a very valuable lesson.  “Here’s the thing about people being in your business. Keep people out your business,” she said before addressing her social media meltdown which prompted her to take a break from Instagram. “It was my fault where I put myself in a position where I opened up the floor for people to give their opinions on my marriage. I have to take responsibility for that. And you also have to take responsibility for telling too much of your business. Because people always feel like they can tell you this, they have a hand in this or ‘oh, girl, did you hear about what happened?’ but not everyone wants to see you happy…I do air my dirty laundry, however, I’ve never been that specific and I should’ve been specific enough to say, ‘well this is what my so-called friends were saying.’”  Herbert joined his estranged wife and business partner on stage to set the record straight about the allegations and made a public vow about his devotion to their family.  “Absolutely not,” he responded when asked if there was a bun in the oven of another woman. And all the other allegations are not true. I’m just not that kind of person. I love this lady with all my heart and I love my family with all my heart and I will never stop fighting for my family and trying to be great.”  As for the future, neither Braxton or Herbert know what it holds but they both make it clear that their main priority will always and forever be the wellbeing of their son.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,808

It’s tough to break away.” But he would “absolutely” love to have the president on his show. “I have a lot of questions for Donald Trump,” Kimmel said, adding, “Maybe this is crazy, but I feel like I can turn him around on a couple of things.”  Interviewer Amy Robach brought up Trump’s son, Don Jr., with whom Kimmel had a Twitter feud last weekend after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke. “He’s an idiot. Let’s just start with that,” he said of the First Son. “This is an imbecile whose job seems to be tweeting, as far as I can tell. But with that said, I do admire that he’s very loyal to his father.” Kimmel went on to respond some backlash he received for seemingly not addressing the Weinstein controversy on TV soon enough.

I’m not in the movie business.

But I did know I had to say something.” And now that he’s gotten emotional on-air a few times, he confessed, “It’s embarrassing to me. I do my best to keep it together and then I can’t keep it in.

36096324-13c3-41bb-b954-d63a42f7e066,"The One with the Rumor is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the American television situation comedy Friends, which aired on NBC on November 22, 2001.[1] It continues the series' annual Thanksgiving-themed episode tradition, and guest-stars cast member Jennifer Aniston's then-husband Brad Pitt in the uncredited role of Will Colbert, who reveals that he and Ross (David Schwimmer) were part of an ""I hate Rachel"" club. The two of them hated Rachel Green (Aniston) and got the exchange student from Thailand to join their club. Will revealed that they spread a rumor in high school that Rachel (Aniston) was a hermaphrodite.  The episode was directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[1] It was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, but was criticized as ""insulting"" by a national intersex education group. Pitt admitted his appearance was mainly to promote his upcoming film, Spy Game.  Plot [ edit ]  Monica invites an old school friend of hers and Ross' for Thanksgiving, Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). She also tells a crestfallen Joey Tribbiani that she won't be cooking a turkey because of Will's, Chandler's, Rachel's and Phoebe's aversion to the poultry. Joey admonishes Monica and demands the tradition, and so Monica obliges with a monstrous bird. Throughout the episode, Joey battles the enormous turkey, eventually changing into Phoebe's maternity clothing to ease the strain on his stomach.  Will arrives and is revealed to have lost an enormous amount of weight. However, he reacts very badly when learning that Rachel Green, who he hated in high school, will be joining them for dinner. Rachel is immediately attracted to Will, unable to recognise him, but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he - and Ross - founded the ""I Hate Rachel"" club in high school and initiated a rumour that she was a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school. Rachel feels betrayed by Ross, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though a horrified Ross confirms it as true. Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumour by calling everyone from school, but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel's rumour put Ross on the social radar, that Ross and Will's rumour had no effect whatsoever on Rachel's queen bee status, and that they're having a baby together. Will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation, but takes pleasure in the fact that Ross got Rachel pregnant but isn't going to marry her.  The episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.  Production [ edit ]  It was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood,[2] though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen.[3] Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience.[4] When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway.[3] The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.[5]  Reception [ edit ]  As the series finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends: ""Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness - despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the audience did, too.""[6] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was ""definitely [...] going against type""[7] and LeBlanc called him ""really great on the show"".[4] USA Today rates Will's line ""Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross. Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates"" one of the best of the episode.[8]  The eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC, calling the episode ""ignorant, insulting, degrading, and absolutely unprofessional"". The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society's website and read an on-air apology before future episodes.[9]  Primetime Emmy Award nominations [ edit ]  Pitt was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance in the episode. Additionally, Nick McLean was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Stephen Prime was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, for their work on the episode.[10]  References [ edit ]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,957

If anyone isn't happy about it, it's probably Finding Your Roots, since David was instructed to keep the news a secret — presumably so that the show could properly promote the hilarious bombshell. Alas, a reporter apparently already knew about it after watching a screener, and asked David to confirm the news right in the middle of the panel, so the cat's out of the bag.

(Photo: Todd Owyoung, for iHeartRadio)  A younger-than-normal audience packed The View's studio on Wednesday morning in order to see their pop idol Taylor Swift, live and in person. Swift's new album 1989 has already shot to the top on iTunes and has received favorable reviews from critics but her label, Big Machine Records, might not have been so confident that this offering from Swift would be a success.  ""I wasn't necessarily nervous about this album,"" Swift said. ""I think my label might have been a little nervous but they'll never say it now.""  Swift, whose roots were initially planted in country music, is now going full-steam ahead into Top 40 fare with 1989.  ""I knew I wanted to change the way I did things creatively,"" Swift told the View co-hosts. ""I knew I wanted to keep people on their toes. I didn't want anyone to have their feelings hurt by me changing directions creatively, because that's never the intention.""  With lyrics about empowerment and ridding one's self of negativity, Swift is once again being lauded as a feminist for a younger generation.  ""It's interesting how feminism has come up in conversation so much more in the last year,"" Swift said. ""I was never really taught the definition of feminism when I was a little girl and I wish I had been.""  Whether her constant astonishment at her own overwhelming success is genuine or just false modesty is still undeterminable. Confident as she may be, Swift admits that she still fears failure.  ""How do you not know how awesome you are?"" Nicolle Wallace asked.  ""I keep a nice healthy level of insecurity going at all times,"" said Swift.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Looking back at things Meghan Markle has said and done in her life so far, it seems that she was always destined for royalty.  She's always showed thoughtfulness, grace and intelligence - from campaigning against a sexist ad when she was just 11 years old to the humanitarian work she's been passionate about long before she married Prince Harry.  There's so much talk about the Duchess of Sussex every day, but what has she actually said about herself?  As she celebrates her 37th birthday this weekend, here's what Meghan has said on some of the most important things in her life - in her own words.  On happiness and self-acceptance  On her 33rd birthday Meghan wrote on her website The Tig about the ways she struggled with the idea of fitting in - before she realised it's important to be kind and accept yourself as you are.  ""I am 33 years old today. And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well…it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.  ""My 20s were brutal – a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as ""whatever"" as everyone else. My teens were even worse – grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant.  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  "" You need to know that you’re enough [is a] mantra that has now engrained itself so deeply within me that not a day goes by without hearing it chime in my head.  ""So for my birthday, here’s what I would like as a gift: I want you to be kind to yourself.""  On her relationship with Harry  In an interview with Vanity Fair in 2016, Meghan spoke about her blossoming relationship with Prince Harry.  She said: ""We’re a couple... We’re in love.  ""I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It’s part of what makes it so special, that it’s just ours. But we’re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.""  On the proposal  (Image: Getty)  In Meghan and Harry's first interview post-engagement, she told the BBC about how the proposal happened.  ""Just a cosy night. What were we doing? We were trying to roast a chicken. It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee. . . As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing, like, 'Can I say yes now?!'""  On feminism  In her speech at the UN in 2015, Meghan told the story of her 11-year-old self who was angry at a sexist TV ad - and how she felt compelled to do something about it:  ""I had been in school watching a TV show in elementary school and this commercial came on with the tag line for this dish washing liquid and the tag line said, ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’.  ""Two boys from my class said, ‘Yeah, that’s where women belong, in the kitchen’.  ""I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt; it just wasn't right, and something needed to be done. So I went home and told my dad what had happened, and he encouraged me to write letters, so I did, to the most powerful people I could think of.""  ""It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision — because it isn't enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn't enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together.""  On her humanitarian work  (Image: PA)  In 2016, Meghan wrote on The Tig about how she feels she can't not do humanitarian work - particularly with the responsibility of someone in the entertainment industry who is looked up to.  ""I’ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches – I’ve always wanted to be a woman who works. And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.""  On the Queen  (Image: Getty Images Europe)  In the royal couple's engagement interview on the BBC in November 2017, Meghan spoke about how she has the utmost respect for Harry's grandmother.  ""To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother… all of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her, I had such a deep understanding and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her … She's an incredible woman.""",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1023

The 57-year-old actor was riding a scooter in Olbia on the island of Sardinia when a Mercedes cut across his path and caused a collision, throwing Clooney over the top of his scooter, according to the Associated Press. He was taken to a hospital in Olbia, but his injuries were not serious and he was discharged.  “George was treated and released from an Olbia hospital,"" his representative Stan Rosenfield told USA TODAY. ""He is recovering at home and will be fine.”  Surveillance video of the crash was obtained late Tuesday by the newspaper Corriere della Sera. It shows a blue Mercedes veering into oncoming traffic, apparently to turn into a residential compound near Olbia.

1e858c07-5491-4fbb-8025-5a6dca1fa418,"Now, after years of unsubstantiated rumors about Louis C.K. masturbating in front of associates, women are coming forward to describe what they experienced. Even amid the current burst of sexual misconduct accusations against powerful men, the stories about Louis C.K. stand out because he has so few equals in comedy. In the years since the incidents the women describe, he has sold out Madison Square Garden eight times, created an Emmy-winning TV series, and accumulated the clout of a tastemaker and auteur, with the help of a manager who represents some of the biggest names in comedy. And Louis C.K. built a reputation as the unlikely conscience of the comedy scene, by making audiences laugh about hypocrisy — especially male hypocrisy.  [ Read Louis C.K.’s statement: “These stories are true” ]  After being contacted for an interview this week about the on-the-record accusations of sexual misconduct — encounters that took place over a decade ago — Louis C.K.’s publicist, Lewis Kay, said the comedian would not respond. “Louis is not going to answer any questions,” Mr. Kay wrote in an email Tuesday night.  Neither Louis C.K. nor Mr. Kay replied to follow-up emails in which the accusations were laid out in detail, or to voice messages or texts. On Thursday, the premiere of Louis C.K.’s new movie “I Love You, Daddy,” was abruptly canceled, and he also canceled an appearance on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.”  The stories told by the women raise sharp questions about the anecdotes that Louis C.K. tells in his own comedy. He rose to fame in part by appearing to be candid about his flaws and sexual hang-ups, discussing and miming masturbation extensively in his act — an exaggerated riff that some of the women feel may have served as a cover for real misconduct. He has all but invited comparison between his private life and his onscreen work, too: In “I Love You, Daddy,” which is scheduled to be released next week, a character pretends to masturbate at length in front of other people, and other characters appear to dismiss rumors of sexual predation.  At the same time, Louis C.K. has also boosted the careers of women, and is sometimes viewed as a feminist by fans and critics. But Ms. Goodman and Ms. Wolov said that when they told others about the incident in the Colorado hotel room, they heard that Louis C.K.’s manager was upset that they were talking about it openly. The women feared career repercussions. Louis C.K.’s manager, Dave Becky, was adamant in an email that he “never threatened anyone.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,501

The vicious bust-up at their Bel-Air mansion on Dec. 14 was “the fight to end all fights,” according to the informant — who saw a furious Justin storm out and head to a luxury hotel. “It was a stupid argument — the kind of disagreement most couples have.

7f0ee15d-5a50-4e06-a56f-7707438f3978,"Jamie Foxx did not “betray” Katie Holmes by supposedly “getting flirty” with a mystery blonde at a New York City hotspot, despite a bogus report. Gossip Cop can debunk this narrative. It’s simply a non-issue.  According to In Touch, just a few days after the actor had dinner with Holmes at Tao in NYC, he got cozy with another woman while having lunch at the trendy seafood restaurant Catch. An alleged insider tells the magazine, “When Jamie arrived to the rooftop area with friends, an attractive young blonde went and sat with them. She hugged Jamie and sat next to him.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Foxx “would reach over and touch the woman’s leg or hold her hand” throughout the lunch. The magazine then baselessly theorizes that Holmes is “headed for heartbreak,” quoting its supposed insider as saying, “She needs to watch out. Jamie loves her, but he also loves to flirt.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  It should be noted, the tabloid doesn’t have any real proof that Foxx got “flirty” with a mystery blonde at Catch. The outlet provides two photos, one of the actor giving a friendly hug to an unidentified woman, and another of him touching the woman’s arm during a conversation. That’s as intimate as the two get in the images and there’s no evidence to suggest they’re anything more than friends.  Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn’t feel “betrayed” when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx’s secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two “don’t see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don’t want to be labeled as a couple.” It was further stressed that neither “want to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.”  Meanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us “he knows he’s in a public forum” when he chats with other women. As we’ve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.  Additionally, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx “betrayed” Holmes by “getting cozy” with a mystery woman at an Oscar party. However, the actor and actress have been spotted together several times since March, so she obviously didn’t feel “betrayed.” That remains the case.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,565

And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony.

Gloria Allred, an attorney for many Cosby's accusers, said she will continue to pursue legal action.  ""We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity,"" Allred said. ""But justice will come... It's too early to celebrate, Mr. Cosby.""  Cosby's defense team declared victory and went on the attack, with spokesman Andrew Wyatt saying that ""Cosby's power is back.""  Cosby's wife, Camille Cosby, slammed prosecutors for bringing the case to court. She issued a statement calling Steele ""heinously and exploitively ambitious."" She also attacked the judge, the accuser's lawyers and the media.  The fast-moving case went to the jury of seven men and five women Monday, on day six of the trial, after closing arguments painted different pictures of what happened between Cosby and Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate in 2004. But the sequestered jury failed to reach a verdict, pausing a half-dozen times to revisit key evidence, including Cosby's decade-old admissions that he fondled Constand after giving her pills.  Late Thursday morning, the panel announced they were deadlocked, but the judge sent them back to work.  Cosby was charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each one punishable by up to 10 years behind bars.  The black comedian once known as America's Dad for his portrayal of kindly Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show"" suggested recently that race could have played a role in the case against him. The jury included two black members.  Cosby used his power and fame to violate Constand, an employee of Temple University's basketball program, Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden said in her opening statement. Constand, 44, testified last week that Cosby gave her three blue pills and then penetrated her with his fingers against her will as she lay paralyzed and half-conscious. She denied they had a romantic relationship and said she had rebuffed previous advances from him.  Cosby accuser stands by her story  ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen,"" Constand, 44, testified June 6. ""I wasn't able to fight in any way.""  She added: ""I wanted it to stop.""  Defense lawyer Brian McMonagle, however, attacked what he said were inconsistencies in Constand's story, disputed that Constand was incapacitated, and made the case that she and Cosby, who was married, had a romantic relationship. McMonagle said Cosby gave her the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl only after she complained she couldn't sleep.  Constand sued Cosby after prosecutors in 2005 declined to press charges. Cosby testified over a decade ago as part of that lawsuit, eventually settling with her for an undisclosed sum. Cosby didn't testify at the six-day trial. But jurors still heard plenty from him as prosecutors read them excerpts from his 2005 police statement and civil deposition.  The sole witness for the defense was the detective who led the 2005 investigation, Richard Schaffer, who previously took the stand during the prosecution's case. He was questioned for six minutes.  In his hour-and-a half closing statement, McMonagle told the jury that Cosby is a brilliant comedian who ""taught us how to smile,"" reports CBS Philadelphia. He said Constand told a ""stone cold lie,"" reports CBS News' Jericka Duncan -- and that while Cosby cheated on his wife, he didn't commit a crime.  Cosby's wife of 53 years, Camille -- in the courtroom for the first time Monday in the 6-day trial -- was stoic during the defense argument.  McMonagle turned towards Cosby and said, ""When you dance outside your marriage ... and you danced.""  He then pointed at Camille Cosby and shouted, ""And you deserved better.""  McMonagle pointed out that Constand telephoned Cosby dozens of times after the alleged assault. Constand told the jury she was merely returning his calls about the women's basketball squad at Temple University, where she worked as director of team operations and he was a member of the board of trustees.  Andrea Constand arrives during Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., on Wed., June 7, 2017. Cosby is accused of drugging and sexually assaulting Constand at his home outside Philadelphia in 2004. AP  ""This isn't talking to a trustee. This is talking to a lover,"" McMonagle said of one call that lasted 49 minutes. ""Why are we running from the truth of this case -- this relationship? Why? I don't understand it.""  Camille Cosby sat in the front row, across the aisle from Constand, who didn't react to McMonagle's two-hour closing but smiled at the end of it. Camille Cosby left when it was the prosecution's turn.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said in his closing argument Monday that the 79-year-old comedian's decade-old statements corroborate Constand's allegations that he drugged and violated her.  ""Drugging somebody and putting them in a position where you can do what you want with them is not romantic. It's criminal,"" Steele said in his closing argument.  Steele also reminded jurors about a telephone conversation in which Cosby apologized to Constand's mother and described himself as a ""sick man.""  ""This is where all the fancy lawyering can't get you around your own words,"" Steele said.  Bill Cosby arrives for his sexual assault trial with his wife Camille Cosby at the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa., Monday, June 12, 2017. Matt Rourke / AP  In his 2005 deposition, Cosby said he obtained several prescriptions for quaaludes in the 1970s and offered the now-banned sedatives to women he wanted to have sex with.  He also said he gave Constand three half-tablets of the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl before the ""petting"" began. Prosecutors have suggested he drugged her with something stronger - perhaps quaaludes.  His deposition was sealed for years until a judge released parts in 2015 at the request of The Associated Press, prompting a new set of prosecutors to take a fresh look at the case and charge him.  Some 60 women have come forward to say Cosby sexually violated them, all but destroying his nice-guy image, but the statute of limitations for prosecution had run out in nearly every case. Constand's case is the only one in which Cosby has been charged.  The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are sexual assault victims unless they grant permission, which Constand has done.

Officers were called after a ""family dispute"" at the home of Harvey Weinstein's daughter on Wednesday as the scandal surrounding the disgraced Hollywood movie mogul continued.  Police called after 'family dispute' at the home of Harvey Weinstein's daughter  Weinsten's daughter Remy (22) made a 911 call concerning her father and his mental state on Wednesday morning.  The movie producer was heard screaming ""you're making it worse"" at his daughter, TMZ reports.  Video footage emerged of the former Miramax boss appearing disorientated as he tried to flag a passing car outside her house.  Harvey Weinstein  The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirmed they were called to reports of a ""disturbance"" at the house but said no crime had been committed. Weinstein was not there when officers arrived.  An LAPD spokesman said: ""At 10.37am Los Angeles Police Department officers responded to the 500 block of North Kilkea Drive at the house of Harvey Weinstein's daughter and were there for a disturbance call.  ""Officers arrived and conducted an investigation. It was revealed that there was no crime and it was a family dispute. Officers then left the scene.""  The incident follows a string of sexual harassment allegations being levelled against Weinstein from women who worked with him.  Cara Delevingne  British actress and supermodel Cara Delevingne was the latest star to speak out on Wednesday.  She claimed Weinstein made advances towards her in a hotel room after asking her to kiss another woman.  In a statement posted on Instagram she said she was left feeling ""very powerless and scared"" when he invited her to his hotel room.  She said: ""I was so hesitant about speaking out....I didn't want to hurt his family. I felt guilty as if I did something wrong.  French actress Lea Seydoux  ""I was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear.""  Spectre actress Lea Seydoux also joined the ranks of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, saying she had to defend herself after the director allegedly jumped on her and tried to kiss her.  Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow  The French actress, who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for Blue Is The Warmest Colour, said the movie mogul stared at her ""as if I was a piece of meat"".  Writing in the Guardian, she said: ""We were talking on the sofa when he suddenly jumped on me and tried to kiss me. I had to defend myself. He's big and fat, so I had to be forceful to resist him.  ""I left his room, thoroughly disgusted. I wasn't afraid of him, though. Because I knew what kind of man he was all along.""  On Tuesday, Weinstein was accused of rape by three women - claims Weinstein ""unequivocally denies"" - and his British wife Georgina Chapman announced she was leaving him.  The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which hosts the Oscars, described the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein as ""repugnant"" and ""abhorrent"" and said on Wednesday that it would be holding a meeting on Saturday to discuss any action to be taken.  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) also announced it had suspended his membership, effective immediately.  Rose McGowan, another accuser, called for the board of the Weinstein Company to be dissolved following the allegations against its co-founder.  The actress, 44, tweeted a link to the campaign on website ipetitions.com and said: ""Join me in supporting this important cause at iPetitions. DISSOLVE THE BOARD.""  Over 10,000 signatures had been added to the petition by Thursday.  Meanwhile, stars across Hollywood have continued to condemn Weinstein's behaviour.  Ewan McGregor said Weinstein was a ""bully"", Matt Damon said he had been left ""absolutely sick to my stomach"" while Ben Affleck added he was ""saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades"".  Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May also spoke out about the scandal on Wednesday.  She said the reports were ""deeply concerning"" as senior politicians called for Weinstein to be stripped of his CBE.  Press Association",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,832

In her 17-minute address, the 38-year-old, who graduated from the Ivy League institution in 2001, shared practical advice — buy a toilet plunger before you need one — and opened up about life as a single mother.  The Mindy Project creator and star welcomed her daughter, Katherine Kaling, on December 15. She honored her late mom, Dr. Swati Roysircar, by choosing the middle name Swati for her first child. Kaling has not revealed the identity of the infant’s father.  “After my daughter was born in December, I remember bringing her home and being in my house with her for the first time and thinking, ‘Huh. According to movies and TV, this is traditionally the time when my mother and spouse are supposed to be here, sharing this experience with me,’” Kaling told the crowd. “And I looked around, and I had neither. And for a moment, it was kind of scary. Like, ‘Can I do this by myself?’”  The brief moment of panic quickly passed. “That feeling went away, because the reality is, I’m not doing it by myself,” Kaling shared. “I’m surrounded by family and friends who love and support me. And the joy I feel from being with my daughter Katherine eclipses anything from any crazy checklist.”  The Oceans 8 actress urged graduates to not “be scared” if they “don’t do things in the right order” and to remember that life takes unexpected twists.  “I didn’t think I’d have a child before I got married, but hey, it turned out that way, and I wouldn’t change a thing,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d have dessert before breakfast today, but hey, it turned out that way and I I wouldn’t change a thing.”  Kaling, who starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in A Wrinkle in Time, also shared wisdom on self-confidence. “I was not someone who should have the life I have now, and yet I do,” she revealed. “I was sitting in the chair you are literally sitting in right now and I Just whispered, ‘Why not me?’ and I kept whispering it for 17 years; and here I am, someone that this school deemed worthy enough to speak to you at your Commencement.”  She continued: “Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something, but especially not yourself.

Let me be very clear, I do NOT support, tolerate or put up with any form of racism, hate or other discrimination. My love for ALL people runs deep – I am open to all and always have been.”  The 39-year-old said she “was heartbroken” when she watched the reunion episode and “saw how my words were taken out of context.”  “My comment that seemingly ‘racism didn’t exist 10 years ago’ was made as part of a larger, emotional 45-minute conversation about how, sadly, social media has become a hub for hate,” she said. “Immediately following my confusing comment, I also said that ‘it’s not as real as it is now’ referring to the power of social media. But those remarks didn’t make the show.”  Zolciak-Biermann reaffirmed her position that social media has amplified racism in the U.S., stating, “Before social media, the public simply observed the news. Now, the public actively participates and has an opportunity to take action – in real time.”  “But this is a double edged sword.

Clearly I’m not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it’s not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you…  Bethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn’t express any interest in going because she didn’t express any interest in having me go? I didn’t know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I’m saying how proud I am of her. Wow…at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It’s strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I’d asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.  On the other hand, I really don’t give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won’t bore you here recounting the endless places I’ve been to or the stories I’ve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people’s sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I’m not bragging — it wasn’t my prize — but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it’s something.  I am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large “get out the vote” campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know — I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn’t end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don’t understand why she’s fully committed this season to talking about me as though I’m a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.  Maybe we’ll find out next week.

Reached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen's account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.  Westwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, ""I do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.""  The incident allegedly occurred at Westwick's home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor's home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when ""Ed suggested 'we should all fuck.'"" Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling ""to smooth everything over"" while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.  After falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.  ""I was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,"" Cohen alleges. ""I was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn’t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.""  Shocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. ""I was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,"" she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.  Cohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her ""I can’t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there’s no way I can go around saying Ed 'raped' me and that I don’t want to be 'that girl.'""  Cohen continued that she now realizes ""the ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others."" THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.  Seeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.  ""There is a bigger picture to this — cleaning out the system and creating radical change,"" Cohen told THR. ""I think that's what I'm contributing to. That's the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. ... I believe in the message of restoration. This will only make us stronger.""  THR has reached out to Westwick for additional comment, as well as to Cohen for a response to Westwick's assertion.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,773

Frank Andrew Hoover was accused of following the singer's motorcade to the airport, sending Taylor’s father frightening emails that included threats to ""end"" her family, and violating a lifetime protective order against him. After pleading guilty to repeatedly violating the protective order, the stalker was sentenced on Monday to a 10-year probation, according to TMZ , but there are many legal strings attached to make sure that he can no longer harass Taylor.  As part of the conditions of his probation, the stalker must stay one mile away from Taylor and her family, and his location will reportedly be monitored by GPS for at least the first year of his probation. He will also reportedly have to complete psychological testing, attend substance abuse classes, surrender all firearms, and undergo random drug testing. If he does not comply, he will be immediately sent to jail.  Unfortunately, this man is just one of many stalkers that Taylor has had to deal with. Earlier this year, an ""obsessed fan"" claimed to be her boyfriend and that he needed a gun ""to protect her."" And in 2016, another man was arrested outside of Taylor's New York City home after reportedly attempting to climb into the window. The same year, a third man reportedly attempted to break into the singer's Rhode Island house, and in 2017 a fourth man was arrested after he was accused of hanging out in the lobby and on the roof of her NYC apartment and one time ringing the doorbell incessantly for an hour straight.

b0e74c5d-3d4a-40ea-9c99-6b39474fbfb9,"Diagnosis  There's no specific test for Bell's palsy. Your doctor will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.  Other conditions — such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease and tumors — can also cause facial muscle weakness, mimicking Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your doctor may recommend other tests, including:  Electromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.  This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation and the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve. Imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) may be needed on occasion to rule out other possible sources of pressure on the facial nerve, such as a tumor or skull fracture.  Treatment  Most people with Bell's palsy recover fully — with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy, but your doctor may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.  Medications  Commonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:  Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started.  such as prednisone, are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, it will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids are possibly beneficial for some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. However, despite this, valacyclovir (Valtrex) is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.  Physical therapy  Paralyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, causing permanent contractures. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.  Surgery  In the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.  Rarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems.  Lifestyle and home remedies  Home treatment may include:  Protecting the eye you can't close. Using lubricating eyedrops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched.

Massaging and exercising your face according to your physical therapist's advice may help relax your facial muscles.  Alternative medicine  Although there's little scientific evidence to support the use of alternative medicine for people with Bell's palsy, some people with the condition may benefit from the following:  Acupuncture. Placing thin needles into a specific point in your skin helps stimulate nerves and muscles, which may offer some relief.

I didn’t want to view myself as a victim so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.”  As she was in a relationship with the perpetrator, Breslin was unsure if reporting the incident would cause more issues.  “I was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed,” she wrote. “I also feared that if my case didn’t lead anywhere, he would still find out and hurt me even more.”  She continued, “Third, I knew how hurt my family and friends would be after finding out and I didn’t want to put them thru that.”  Breslin said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident. Despite making progress, the actress revealed she still has nightmares and flashbacks.  “I still jump when somebody touches me unexpectedly, even if it’s my best friend tapping me on the shoulder,” she wrote.  The Dirty Dancing reboot star said that claims that unreported rapes “don’t matter” is “unfair, untrue and unhelpful.”  “It’s like [saying] you got a black eye from being punched in the face, but because you didn’t call the police, you didn’t really get a black eye,” she explained.

Update, 4:46 p.m. One of the most eye-popping allegations in Jones’s viral interview has, apparently, been confirmed. Richard Pryor’s widow Jennifer Pryor first tweeted, and then confirmed to TMZ that her husband did, indeed, have a sexual relationship with Marlon Brando, as Jones claimed in his interview. Pryor’s tweet read, “Hey girl: It was the 70's: enough cocaine and good music-one could fuck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning! # noshame“  Ivanka Trump still has yet to comment. The original story continues below.  Quincy Jones used to date Ivanka Trump—or so he says. In a wide-ranging interview with New York magazine’s David Marchese, the music producer casually mentioned, as an aside, that he went on a date with the First Daughter about 12 years ago. Marchese didn’t let that one go.  “He’s a crazy motherfucker,” Jones, now 84, said of Donald Trump. “Limited mentally—a megalomaniac, narcissistic. I can’t stand him. I used to date Ivanka, you know.”  Marchese responded with apparent shock at the new information: “Wait, really?” Back to Jones, who said that 12 years ago, Tommy Hilfiger, who was working with his daughter Kidada, a former model and current designer, told Jones that Ivanka wanted to have dinner with him.  “I said, ‘No problem,’” Jones recalled. “‘She’s a fine motherfucker.’ She had the most beautiful legs I ever saw in my life. Wrong father, though.”  If Jones’s 12-year time stamp is right, that would put his date (he only references one) with Ivanka in 2006, the same year she turned 25 and celebrated alongside actor and then That 70s Show star Topher Grace. It was around this time that Ivanka was rumored to be going on dates with Lance Armstrong. She denied that there was any romance there.  “I have tremendous respect for Lance and all he has accomplished,” she told People. “That said, we are just friends.”  She has not publicly commented on any date with Jones, neither at the time nor since the New York interview was published.

a2dc09c2-21c7-4f49-8ef1-b2ed1f714c66,"Ever since The Crown bowed on Netflix, fans have been wondering how long it will take the sumptuous period drama to reach the ill-fated marriage of Prince Charles and Diana. Because the show’s first season, which starred Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II, spanned 1947 and 1955, viewers worried that it would take at least three or four more seasons until the drama catches up to Charles and Diana’s 1977 meeting, 1981 wedding, and subsequent marriage. But series creator and writer Peter Morgan has revealed that The Crown will tackle the monarchy-marriage drama sooner than expected.  Princess Diana will be introduced toward the end of Season 3, Morgan confirms in a new interview with People, with Seasons 4 and 5 “heavily” focused on her as one of the main characters. To facilitate the time jump, the series will recast the major roles with older actors who can better portray Elizabeth, Philip, Charles, etc. as they age.  It will be interesting to see how The Crown, which is very much Team Monarchy, approaches the relationship, which began somewhat informally in 1977 when Charles and Diana met through her sister, whom Charles was dating at the time. When Diana became a princess, the world largely sympathized with her—a deft manipulator of her public image—as opposed to her less-photogenic and less P.R.-savvy husband. But Morgan will likely offer a new, Charles-sympathetic perspective to the royal marriage. In The Queen, for example, Morgan depicted Charles as a responsible and caring father frustrated by the old-fashioned, out-of-touch constraints dictated by the monarchy. And he depicted Diana, at least through Queen Elizabeth’s eyes, as a drama-stirring, attention-hogging, trouble-making headache to the family.  Before getting to Diana, though, Morgan and Co. are busily filming the show’s second season, which will debut in late 2017 and, according to People, “feature a greater emphasis on the life of Elizabeth’s husband Prince Philip and introduce a greater role for her oldest son and direct heir, Prince Charles.”  “We start to focus on Charles as a young boy and his education, and on Philip and his backstory,” Morgan told the magazine. Executive producer Suzanne Mackie added, “We glance backward to Philip’s childhood and his upbringing, and how that might have impacted him as a man, a father and as Prince Consort—which is fascinating.”  The new series, which will be set from 1957 through 1964, will also show the monarchy continue to struggle in an evolving world.  “It’s goodbye to a different, Edwardian, post-Imperial world,” Morgan said. “We get a classlessness and a modernity beginning to creep in. It is going to be terrific.”  While speaking with The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby earlier this year, the British actress also offered us some second-season clues about her own character, Princess Margaret, whose tragic romance with Peter Townsend was depicted in the show’s first season.  “She meets [the photographer and her eventual husband] Antony Armstrong-Jones, and she goes head first into a completely new, exciting, dangerous, volatile, dysfunctional relationship and then marriage,” Kirby told us of Margaret, who had a reputation for rubbing elbows with the movie stars and musicians of the era.  “Tony starts this whole trail of a more bohemian life outside,” Kirby said. “Margaret was best friends with Elizabeth Taylor, and she had loads of American actress friends and singers. You see these two worlds collide—hers and Tony’s, who is a member of the public and was a creative, liberal, dark horse. Meanwhile she is this epitome of the establishment. I’ve been doing tons of research about it recently, and seen people say there was never such an ill-fated match because Margaret and Tony were just so alike personality-wise that he was the opposite of Peter.”  To read the rest of the interview with Kirby, click here.

Following fan speculation that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 45, was planning to split from husband Joe Giudice after she posted an Instagram photo with a divorce attorney, Teresa clarified that she was simply at dinner with a friend.  As previously reported, Teresa posted a photo to Instagram on Saturday, January 6, posing with New Jersey attorney Loren La Forge-Kyriakoulis. The reality star originally captioned the photo, “Dinner with a great friend getting great advice” before quickly changing it to “Dinner with a great friend lots of laughs” with the hashtag “#webothlovefood.”  During Teresa’s Wednesday, January 10, appearance with sister-in-law Melissa Gorga on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, a fan called in to ask Teresa if the photo indicated she and Joe were on the rocks, which Teresa vehemently denied. “I was helping her. Just in case – If anybody’s getting divorced, she’s a great divorce attorney to call,” she explained. “Get it? I was helping her.”  Gorga, 38, chimed in, “Oh, you’re saying you were publicizing her,” to which Teresa said, “Yes! Capisce? Capisce.”  “What’s the matter with two women sitting together and shooting the breeze,” Teresa continued. “Talking about growing up?”  Gorga, who happened to be at the same restaurant that night, also recalled her initial confusion when she approached the pair at dinner to say hello. “I was like, ‘Who are you?’ and she was like, ‘I’m so and so’ and Teresa’s like, ‘She’s a divorce attorney,’ and I’m like, ‘Huh?’”  During the interview, Teresa also opened up about the months-long period that she didn’t visit her husband, who is currently serving time for conspiracy and bankruptcy fraud. “My mom got sick, so I didn’t see him the whole time my mom was sick, those three months,” she said. “I remember the one day I was going to see him, that’s when my dad got sick, and then I had to turn around and go back.”  “Then there was a chicken pox breakout there, in the prison, so we weren’t allowed to go see him,” she continued. “Oh, and then they found contraband from other inmates!”  However, Teresa, who also served 11 months in prison in 2015 for fraud, isn’t exactly eager to return to jail – even to visit Joe. “You know, I don’t really enjoy going there,” she said. “Even when I was [in prison], I was like, ‘Don’t come!'”  The couple has been plagued by divorce rumors in recent months, however two after before Teresa posted the photo with Forge-Kyriakoulis, the television personality’s attorney James Leonard Jr. shut down the speculation. “I don’t know how to say it any louder or plainer, but it ain’t happening.

I’ve only just recently come out as bisexual to my friends and family,” she said in a photo posted to Twitter. “It’s something I am still processing and trying to understand and I don’t like talking about it too much.”  The tweet was seemingly prompted by previous tweets from upset Riverdale fans about the use of queerbaiting in the teen drama in which the actress also stars.

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is apparently not sparing any expense for her future nuptials. “The whole thing will cost about $2 million,” the insider said.

13c1ebdb-3072-485d-b41b-62ed53d2b3cc,"Ask and you shall receive: After a swarm of messages from fans demanding it, HBO announced Big Little Lies is officially returning for a second season. It makes total sense why the network wants to continue this franchise. For one, people loved it: The season one finale brought in a whopping 1.9 million viewers , which is huge for premium cable. It was also a critical favorite, sweeping both the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. Will lightning strike twice, though? Based on what HBO's released about season two, it seems like yes. The brand has all the ingredients to make a phenomenal second season (including Meryl Streep).  Until then, here's everything we know about Big Little Lies season two:  It's not airing until 2019. Unfortunately, it'll be a while before Madeline Martha Mackenzie and her one-liners are on your screen again. Production on Big Little Lies season two is slated to start in spring 2018.  Most of the original cast is expected to return. HBO has only confirmed Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman at this point. However, the network said in a press release most of season one's cast is expected to return, and negotiations are underway. All the original actresses are said to be receiving significant pay bumps, as well.  Alexander Skarsgård is back too. His character, Perry Wright, was murdered at the end of season one, but TV Line confirms he'll still pop up around Monterrey, California—presumably in the form of flashbacks. Of course, Skarsgård did tell people.com , ""I don’t even know if I’m really dead or not,"" but he was most likely just teasing.  Season two will be just as dramatic (and violent) as the first. In its original release, HBO teased that ""relationships will fray"" and ""loyalties will erode"" in season two. Plus, ""the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom."" So that basically means someone's going to get hurt.  There will be seven episodes. Just like season one.  David E. Kelley, the screenwriter who crafted season one, is returning. He'll write all seven scripts for season two, based on a story ideated by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty.  Andrea Arnold will direct season two. She's directed episodes for some of the best shows on TV, including Transparent and I Love Dick, along with some incredible indie films, like American Honey. She's replacing Jean-Marc Vallée, who helmed all seven episodes in season one and is returning to season two as an executive producer.  Meryl Streep is joining the cast. Which is a huge deal. She'll be playing Mary Louise Wright, the mother of deceased Perry, who comes to Monterrey concerned for her grandchildren.  She's not the only new character, either. Casting is underway for Bonnie's (Zoë Kravitz) parents, Elizabeth and Martin Howard. In addition, there will be a new employee at Otter Bay School who befriends Jane, and together they swap their ""deepest secrets."" Finally, a new socially conscious teacher at Otter Bay, Michael Perkins, will cause drama when his lessons about global warning give Amabella panic attacks. (Can't this girl live for five seconds?) The actors for the latter two characters haven't been announced yet. Dennis O'Hare is also joining the cast as Ira Farber.

The two, who are set to be sisters-in-law when Markle marries Prince Harry in May, are certainly amicable. But there’s a difference between being friendly and being inseparable.  “I think they are certainly friendly and they are spending more time with each other. You know they’re neighbors in Kensington Palace and I know that Meghan enjoys going over to see Kate and the children, and she does enjoy that. I’m told there’s always an open invitation for her to be with Kate ever when she wants,” royal expert and author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love told InStyle. “I think that any animosity is probably a fabrication in the press. I’ve never heard to suggest that they don’t get along.”  CHRIS JACKSON/AFP/Getty Images  You’re right if you could hear the “but” coming, though.  “I do hear plenty to suggest that they’re quite different people and that have quite different interests and that Meghan is quite independent and very confident and very keen to I think establish her own network of friends over here in London,” Nicholl added.  “So that’s certainly not to say she’s snubbed Kate in any way. I think they do spend time together. But I think Meghan’s keen not to rely too much on Kate and to have her own friends as well.”  It seems that Markle certainly already has a group of good friends in London, as they were quick to throw her a lavish spa-themed bridal shower earlier in March.

Wiehl accused O'Reilly of ""repeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to her,"" the Times reported, citing two people briefed on the matter.  On his website, O'Reilly denounced the report as a ""smear piece"" and said ""these people at the New York Times are out to hurt people with whom they disagree. They don't want me in the marketplace. That's what this is all about.""  More: Bill O'Reilly dismisses NYT report as 'lies and smears'  More: Megyn Kelly complained to Fox execs about Bill O'Reilly's sexual harassment stand  In April, the Times reported on five other settlements involving O'Reilly and women accusing him of sexual harassment. The revelation led to Fox News' decision to part ways with its star commentator.  On Monday, O'Reilly said that in more than 20 years he only ""resolved three situations"" and that he did it ""to protect my children from harm.""  O'Reilly has repeatedly said the potential impact on his children is a major reason for his outrage over the Times report.  ""The pain it brings to my children is indescribable,"" O'Reilly told the Times when it interviewed him about the reported $32 million settlement. ""I would give up my life to protect my children, but I find myself unable to protect them because of things that are being said about me, their father.""  ""This is horrible what I went through, horrible what my family went through,"" he continued. O'Reilly said the report was ""politically and financially motivated"" and that he could ""prove it with shocking information but I'm not going to sit here in a courtroom for a year and a half and let my kids get beaten up every single day of their lives by a tabloid press.""  O'Reilly invoked the memory of his former Fox News colleague Eric Bolling's son, 19-year-old Eric Chase Bolling, who was found dead in an apartment while away at college. Fox News had just parted ways with Bolling amid sexual harassment allegations when his son died and O'Reilly seemed to say that was behind the teen's death.  ""I urge you to think about what you put in your newspaper,"" O'Reilly told the Times reporters. ""Eric Bolling's son is dead. Is dead, because of allegations made, in my opinion — and I know this to be true — against Mr. Bolling.""  Separately, Bolling said in a statement that O'Reilly's comment was ""beyond inappropriate"" and that his ""parting from Fox News was in no way connected to the tragic news of my son's passing.""  O'Reilly apologized to Bolling in a tweet. ""The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more,"" O'Reilly tweeted.  Apologies to Eric Bolling and prayers for him and his family. The message I tried to send was that allegations harm kids. Nothing more. — Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017  ""Thank Bill, apology accepted,"" Bolling tweeted back.  O'Reilly, on his website, said the Times doesn't care about children and is willing to run a story based on anonymous sources even though ""families are devastated.""  ""So and so said, so and so told me,"" O'Reilly said of the use of unnamed sources. ""That's what they do to Trump every day and that's why Trump is furious. That's why the President of the United States calls out The New York Times by name. But the culture war is that intense.""

Stephens, whose parents were friends with the now disgraced doctor, said he repeatedly sexually abused her when she was a child. (Jan. 16) AP  Former U.S. gymnast McKayla Maroney (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)  Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who pleaded guilty in November to criminal sexual conduct, is being sentenced this week on seven sexual assault charges. The sentencing began Tuesday and is expected to conclude on Friday in Lansing, Mich. Nassar faces up to a life sentence, with a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.  Close to 90 women are slated to read victim impact statements at his hearing this week. But former gymnast and Nassar victim McKayla Maroney — who first shared her story of abuse over Twitter — faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks out. Maroney signed a nondisclosure agreement in December 2016, agreeing to stay quiet about the abuse she experienced as part of a $1.25 million settlement with USA Gymnastics.  Chrissy Teigen, a swimsuit model and TV host, does not want Maroney to remain silent. Teigen tweeted on Tuesday that she would ""be absolutely honored to pay"" the $100,000 fine for Maroney. Teigen called Nassar a ""serial monster"" in her tweet, while questioning the ""entire principle"" of the fine.  Maroney is suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University, claiming the nondisclosure agreement she signed was illegal.  USA Gymnastics said last month that the settlement terms from the 2016 agreement were initially not drawn up by its lawyers but rather by Maroney's attorney.  The entire principle of this should be fought - an NDA to stay quiet about this serial monster with over 140 accusers, but I would be absolutely honored to pay this fine for you, McKayla. pic.twitter.com/lsBEgEqZpD — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 16, 2018  Later on Tuesday, Michael Schur and Kristen Bell — The creator and star of NBC's ""The Good Place,"" respectively — offered to pitch in as well.

In the lawsuit filed to Los Angeles Superior Court, Maroney alleges she was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement as part of the financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment.  ""USA Gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from McKayla Maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar, nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to Larry Nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing,"" USA Gymnastics said in a statement.  ""This has been her right and USA Gymnastics encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out. USA Gymnastics remains focused on our highest priority — the safety, health and well-being of our athletes and creating a culture that empowers and supports them.""

9adaa57d-ab85-44c3-a4d4-474c222c68c2,"CBS’ new top programming executives addressed the network’s struggles with onscreen diversity Tuesday — including the recent controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from “Hawaii Five-0.”  “We love both those actors and did not want to lose them,” CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at the Television Critics Association press tour on Tuesday. “We made very, very strong attempts to keep them and offered them a lot of money to stick around.”  In June, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park exited “Hawaii Five-O.” As Variety reported at the time, the actors had been seeking equal pay with stars Alex O’Loughlin and Scott Caan, but failed to reach deals with CBS Television Studios, which produces the series.  The departure of the show’s only two series regulars of Asian descent over a salary dispute involving the pay scale of their white co-stars sparked criticism of CBS on social media and in the press.  Kahl did not go into details of the negotiation, saying, “In my mind it was purely a business transaction.” He characterized the departure of veteran actors as natural for a show entering its eighth season. “It’s happened on ‘CSI,’ it’s happened on ‘Grey’s Anatomy,’ it’s happened on ‘Law and Order: SVU.'”  Related Erinn Hayes’ Character to Be Killed Off ‘Kevin Can Wait’ to Make Room for Leah Remini  Kahl appeared at TCA alongside senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. The two fielded multiple questions about the network’s poor record with diversity in front of and behind the camera, with one reporter noting that CBS has failed to put a new series with a female lead on the air for two seasons running.  “We had six pilots with female leads and the way things turned out those pilots were not deemed to be as good as the pilots that were picked up,” Sherman said.  Sherman and Kahl did not handle the development slate that led to the upcoming season’s crop of new shows. Kahl, a 21-year veteran of the network and its longtime scheduling chief, was named CBS entertainment president in May. His promotion came with the departure of Glenn Geller, who stepped down as the network’s top programming executive following a mild heart attack suffered in March. As part of the restructuring, Sherman was recruited from sister network the CW to head programming under Kahl.  Reporters also grilled Kahl and Sherman on CBS’ casting department, which is staffed entirely by white casting directors, and how it has affected the onscreen diversity or lack thereof in CBS’ series.  “I personally don’t think that has anything to do with it,” Kahl said, adding of the casting department, “They’re fantastic at what they do,” and noting that it has “cast many diverse roles in the past.”  Pressed on why the department is staffed entirely by white casting directors, Sherman said, “They’ve been together for a long time. That’s the department as its been. But we are cognizant of the issue. We hear you, and we will be looking to expand the casting department.”  As his predecessors have, Kahl defended CBS’ diversity record and promised it would continue to improve.  “We can debate the pace of the change, but there is change happening at CBS,” Kahl said, noting an overall uptick in diverse series regulars in recent years. “Every single drama on our air has at least one diverse regular character.”  He added, “We said in the past that we’re going to do better, and we are doing better.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,701

In 2017, the loveable Boykin died. He was only 45 years old.  If you ever watched the MTV reality series, then you knew how unpredictably funny the show and he was.  The reality series follows professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek and his bodyguard, Big Black. The two live together in the Hollywood Hills and hatch crazy plans.

Season one was the second most downloaded MTV series on iTunes behind “The Hills.” The first full season of Rob & Big reached over 70 million total viewers and ranked #1 in its time period among 12-34 year-olds.  Boykin had a defibrillator implant for his heart. In early May 2017, he was hospitalized in Plano, Texas, and was placed on a heart monitor. On May 9, his heart stopped; staff spent 30 minutes trying to revive him. Although initial reports did not mention an official cause of death, Boykin’s heart failure was the result of a heart attack.

In partnership with the World Wildlife Fund and Tiger Beer in efforts to spread awareness of the decreasing population of the tigers in the wild, she is urging her fans to participate in the #3890TIGERS campaign.  VanCamp recently talked to E! News about the campaign, sharing that the number of tigers left in the wild has lowered down to less than 4,000.  ""To put that in perspective, there are more tigers in captivity in the US than are left in the wild—that's not only shocking, it's heartbreaking. These are incredible creatures at the top of the food chain, yet as powerful as they are, they still our need protection,"" the actress told the news outlet.  As to what the goal of this campaign is, VanCamp stated that the organization aims to double the wild tiger population within five years.  She added, ""With Global Tiger Day this Saturday, we really want to raise awareness for our goal to double the wild tiger population by the next year of Zodiac Tiger in 2022. I also happen to have been born in 1986, another year of the Tiger, so to be able to lend my voice to the wild tigers who have none, means a lot to me and brings it all full circle.""  The fans had noticed that the Canadian actress stayed off social media for a while, even removing her profile picture. Recently, on Instagram, she posted an art with a portrait image of her and a tiger. She explained that the purpose of her disappearance was to raise awareness for the disappearance of these majestic animals.  In the caption, she also urged her followers to participate in the campaign by deleting their profile pictures, creating tiger-related art, or making a donation to the rangers that are responsible for keeping the tiger safe in the wild.

We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how Tom Cruise is feeling so betrayed by Jamie Foxx dating his ex-wife Katie Holmes, according to a source.  We’ve got a bro-code violation going on! Tom Cruise, 55, and Jamie Foxx, 49, were once pals, as the megastar recruited the actor to star with him in 2004’s action film Collateral. They remained friendly up until the Annie star began dating Katie Holmes, 38, just a year after she divorced Tom in 2012 in such a dramatic way. Four years later, Holmes and Foxx have finally taken their romance out into the open, but the Mission: Impossible star has aware that they were a couple for some time and isn’t thrilled that his friend would date his former wife.  HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “Tom has known about Katie and Jamie’s secret relationship since the beginning and it has always bothered him that they were hooking up.

f71449dd-3fd8-4624-9355-3803b4db91f5,"Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova have been so secretive about their relationship that fans have often wondered if they’re even still together.  But on Monday, the couple put any split rumors to rest after news broke they reportedly welcomed twins — a boy and a girl — over the weekend.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Here’s a look back at their private romance:  2001  The singer, 42, and the former tennis pro, 36, first met when she starred in her future boyfriend’s sexy music video for “Escape.” Sparks flew on set and they began dating shortly after shooting the video, which features Kournikova initially rebuffing his advances. The duo later make out and get hands-y in the bathroom on the sink.  2002  The couple weren’t always so secretive about their relationship. After making their official debut as a couple on the red carpet of the MTV Video Music Awards in 2002, they also coupled up a year later at the Once Upon a Time in Mexico premiere in New York City.  Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias Bill Davila/FilmMagic  In true turn of the century fashion, Kournikova showed off rock-hard abs in an all-white belly-baring ensemble with strappy heels while Enrique wore distressed flared denim jeans and a black dress shirt paired with a T-shirt.  2004  The rumor mill went into overdrive about a possible engagement — or wedding — when Kournikova stepped onto the court at the World Team Tennis match with a blindingly large pink diamond ring on her ring finger. She later sported a simple band while out and about.  Anna Kournikova Jason Squires/WireImage  Reports circulated the duo had wed in a secret ceremony in Puerto Vallarta, but sources told PEOPLE at the time the rumors were false.  2006 – 2012  The pair appeared to be going strong for nearly a decade.  In 2006, they sat front and center at the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Miami Heat game in Miami, posed for photos at Big Pink restaurant and capped off the year with a date at Mauro’s Cafe in December.  Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova Issac Baldizon/NBAE/Getty  And the next year, Kournikova was photographed goofing around in a bikini with Iglesias while they prepared to board a boat in Miami. In December, they jetted to London and once again fueled wedding rumors when Kournikova was snapped with yet another plain band on her ring finger.  Iglesias fueled breakup rumors when he told a Swedish newspaper that the duo had been secretly married but were “now” divorced. “We’re divorced. I am single now, but that’s okay,” he told Aftonbladet. “I don’t mind being alone.”  However, a Kournikova pal told PEOPLE Iglesias was joking, and his rep also confirmed the duo were “still together.”  In 2008, Kournikova told PEOPLE she was “never getting married” but added that “everything is good” between her and Iglesias. Days later, the singer told reporters he had been trying to get his girlfriend to marry him for years. “I always try, but she pays me no attention,” he said as he arrived in the Dominican Republic for a series of concerts.  Though they didn’t attend many public events together for the rest of the decade, the duo were photographed going on dinner dates and vacationing in St. Barts.  The former tennis champ also opened up about hopefully becoming a mother in the future in a 2011 interview with Women’s Health. “I absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt,” she told the mag. “I love taking care of people.”  In a 2012 interview with Parade, Iglesias reiterated the duo had no plans to wed. “I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference,” he told the outlet. “Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love somebody more because of a piece of paper.”  2013 – 2014  In late 2013, reports surfaced that the longtime couple had called it quits. But after the new year, they were photographed spending quality time together on a boat in Miami.  Then in 2014, Iglesias shocked fans by again claiming he and Kournikova had divorced. “I got a divorce three days ago and I wanted to give you guys the exclusive. I’m serious. No, seriously. Don’t laugh,” he told reporters ahead of a performance at the Staples Center that October.  2016  Kournikova proved all was well in 2016 when she posted a photo of her and Iglesias with her brother Allan on her Instagram account.  Over the last few years, Kournikova also began sporting another massive ring — perhaps a yellow diamond? — complete with a matching diamond band.  2017  Sixteen years after they first met, Iglesias and Kournikova reportedly became parents over the weekend. According to TMZ, the couple welcomed a boy and a girl named Nicholas and Lucy. Reps for the musician and athlete did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  “I think she’d be a perfect mother,” Iglesias once told PEOPLE en Español in 2007.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,970

Throw that assumption out the damn window.  For seven Playboy cover models, at least, there's no time like the present to revisit their former snaps, as they proved in a shoot by Ryan Lowry and Ben Miller for the magazine.  As chief creative officer Cooper Hefner (oh yes, there's a relation) relays in an Instagram video, it is in fact what he gave his mother for Mother's Day.  Turn up your 🔉: We re-created some of our most iconic covers and one our models happened to be @cooperbhefner's mom. Look out for the cover reveal on 6/4. A post shared by Playboy (@playboy) on Jun 3, 2017 at 6:30pm PDT      ""In the spirit of celebrating the women who’ve made Playboy what it is – an exuberant celebration of beauty, sex, and the beauty of sex — we invited seven special Playmates from over the years to come back and recreate their iconic covers. In the process, they remind us that beauty is ageless, sex appeal is timeless and exuberance is eternal,"" notes the article.  And frankly, we couldn't agree more. Take a look, for example, at Kimberley Conrad Hefner (former wife of Hugh Hefner and mom of Cooper, as well as Marston), in her 1988 cover, and today.  Conrad Hefner, who was raised partially in West Vancouver, was 26 at the time of her original shoot — she's now 54 and divorced from Hef, but still has fond memories of her time at the Mansion.  ""There was a common misconception that I put the kibosh on the partying at the Mansion. It had nothing to do with me. The Playmates still came over, but it was nice to have them call and say, ‘Hi! I’m coming up!’"" she told the publication.  Renee Tenison was the magazine's first African-American Playmate of the Year in 1990.  She was 22-years-old at the time, and is now 49.  Of course, it's somewhat ridiculous it took until that point to have any diversity on the cover, but Tenison remembers a different kind of squabble.  ""When I did Playboy, there was a little bit of controversy because I was the first African-American Playmate of the Year and some women were saying I was being objectified. But I said, ‘Well, if you’re pro-choice, shouldn’t I have the right to choose what I want to do?’ .. If you look back, all the big models from Christy Turlington to Naomi Campbell posed nude. I see it as art. Not everybody sees it that way, but that’s how I see it,"" she told the magazine.  Lisa Matthews, billed as the ""all-American girl,"" took on the task in June 1991.  She was 22-years-old at the time (perhaps that's the magic Playboy cover model number?), and is now 48.  Then there's Candace Collins, who has the oldest cover in the bunch.  She was 22 at the time of her December 1979 photo, and is now 60. She started out working at the infamous Playboy Clubs in St. Louis and Chicago, reports Chicago Magazine, and eventually graced two covers and a centrefold.  With the recent rise in popularity of boudoir photography, it probably should come as no surprise that more and more women (and men) are not only willing to take off their clothes in front of a camera, but clamouring for it.

She needs to look straight into Blake’s eyes, ask certain questions, and get answers.”  There are no plans set for this meeting to actually take place just yet, but the mag claims that if it does happen, Miranda plans to go in with a “clear head,” although that might not be so easy. “This could get heated,” the insider admits. “As soon as the emotions come up, [Miranda] may lose it.” This doesn’t mean the 33-year-old wants to get back together with her ex, though — actually, it’s just the opposite. She’s very happy with her man, Anderson East, 29, but feels a face-to-face with Blake is what she needs to fully be ready to commit to another relationship, according to the source.  “She feels that [she and Blake] have both grown so much since their divorce that meeting up is essential for them to have healthy relationships in the future,” InTouch’s insider says. “Who knows, maybe this meeting with Blake will have them walk away as friends. Either way, they’ll definitely be in a better place.”  As for the rumored trouble between Blake and Gwen, we’re going to take that report (from OK! magazine) with a grain of salt. After all, they were just spotted looking totally in love on Aug. 20! Plus, HollywoodLife.com has heard EXCLUSIVELY that they already have plans for a fun Labor Day together, so hopefully he’ll pop back up on her social media this weekend!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Blake and Miranda will meet up?",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,460
be0255e0-b16e-4ccf-bc4a-8f087a625dae,"Several months and two back surgeries later, Abby Lee Miller is showing off the healing progress she's made. Over the weekend, the Dance Moms star updated her followers on her recovery process , sharing a photo on Instagram of the scars and stitches from her recent operations .  ""After the 2nd surgery, My back is finally on the mend,"" Miller wrote on Instagram.  ""I just wish the top section & bottom would hurry along too! I had 52 staples perfectly aligned and now a bunch of crazy stitches are holding my neck & lumbar region together!"" the dance instructor captioned the photo.  As seen in the picture, Miller has an incision running all the way from her neck to her lower back. And while the majority of the cut has already healed over, stitches from the second surgery , at the top and bottom of her back, are still fully visible.  In April, a few weeks after her first surgery, Miller shared a photo of her post-op scar, and those ""52 staples perfectly aligned,"" on Instagram . ""This gives a whole new meaning to being stabbed in the back!"" she joked in the caption.  And in early June, Miller explained on Instagram that she had undergone the second operation .  Miller first underwent emergency spinal surgery in April after experiencing severe neck pain and weakness in her arm.  Loading View on Instagram  As SELF wrote previously , Miller's pain eventually progressed to paralysis, which then required an emergency surgery to relieve pressure on her spinal cord.  Though her symptoms were initially thought to be caused by a spinal infection, anorthopedic spine surgeon Hooman Melamed, M.D., who is treating Miller, told SELF previously that further testing suggested that she actually had Burkitt lymphoma, a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma affects the lymph system, a part of the body's immune system. Because lymph tissue is found all over the body, this type of cancer can start pretty much anywhere, but it's often found in the stomach, the American Cancer Society explains.  The exact treatment plan for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma depends on the type and location of the cancer but may include a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation. Earlier this month, Miller announced that she was starting her third round of chemotherapy and last week indicated that she may be losing her hair as a result.

78a81c83-d286-4020-b8db-ddb9afe96884,"President Trump has acted on his promise to donate $1 million of his personal fortune to charities helping with Hurricane Harvey relief efforts, the White House said.  White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed to The Hill that the president cut checks to 12 organizations helping the the Gulf region recover from the monster storm, which devastated swaths of southeast Texas and Louisiana last month.  The Hill confirmed with multiple groups that they received the funds this week.  Sanders announced late last month that the president would give $1 million of his personal funds to hurricane disaster relief. Following suggestions from the public and the White House press corps, on September 6 Huckabee Sanders announced 12 organizations that would receive funds.  ADVERTISEMENT  The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army received the largest portions of the president’s donation – $300,000 each.  Two groups associated with Christian ministries – Samaritan’s Purse and Reach Out America – were promised $100,000 each.    Eight other groups – the ASPCA, Catholic Charities, Direct Relief, Habitat for Humanity, the Houston Humane Society, Operation Blessing, Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon – would receive $25,000 apiece, the White House said earlier this month.  The Red Cross, which was slated to receive one of the larger donations from Trump, did not confirm a specific donation, however a spokesperson told The Hill the organization was “grateful to the Trumps for their generous support of our mission.”  Habitat for Humanity confirmed to The Hill the organization had received a check from the president and first lady Melania Trump.  A Habitat for Humanity spokesperson told The Hill the president and first lady thanked the organization in a note for being “on the forefront of rebuilding our Nation and providing a critical helping hand for those in need.”  Disaster relief organizations Portlight Inclusive Disaster Strategies and Team Rubicon also confirmed to The Hill they received checks from the president and first lady to assist in Harvey relief.  Reach Out America said in a Facebook post two days before the White House announced the recipients that they had received a $100,000 donation from Trump.  “It was a landmark day for Reach Out America when President Donald & First Lady Melania Trump visited First Church of Pearland, TX. The President & First Lady were there to encourage Hurricane Harvey survivors, and then passed out relief supplies. Larry Williamson, founder of Reach Out America received a generous donation of $100,000 from President Trump for ROA,” the organization’s Facebook page said.  The Washington Post’s David Farenthold reported on Wednesday that Direct Relief, which is dedicated to improving “the health and lives of people affected by poverty and emergency,” received a personal check from the president for $25,000.  The Dallas Morning News’ Lauren McGaughy confirmed the animal charity the Houston Humane Society also received a check for $25,000.  The ASPCA, Operation Blessing, and Samaritan’s Purse declined to discuss personal donations.  The Hill has reached out to the Salvation Army and Catholic Charities for confirmation.  Trump’s record for fulfilling charitable pledges is not spotless.  Early in the Republican presidential primaries last year, the real estate mogul vowed to give $1 million of his personal fortune to veterans’ charities, plus an additional $5 million he said he had raised during a fundraiser in Iowa ahead of the state’s caucuses.  But it was revealed months later that Trump had not made good on that pledge, and only donated $1 million to the causes after facing pressure from media.  Since then, however, the president has fulfilled his promise to donate his presidential salary, giving his first quarter pay to the National Parks Service and his second-quarter salary to the Department of Education.  The Associated Press also reported on Friday that nearly eight months after Trump was sworn into office, his inaugural committee still has not fulfilled a promise to donate leftover funds to charities.  The committee had raised an unprecedented $107 million for the inauguration.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,745

Even though her big win was in the spotlight, the actress was faced with probing questions about working with Woody Allen.  Allen, who, for years, has been accused numerous times of sexual misconduct, directed Gerwig in the 2012 film To Rome With Love. In an interview with the New York Times, Gerwig addressed working with Allen and the allegations surrounding him.  “It is something that I take very seriously and have been thinking deeply about, and it has taken me time to gather my thoughts and say what I mean to say,” she said. “I can only speak for myself and what I’ve come to is this: If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film.”  She adds, “I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.”  After Dylan Farrow’s New York Times articles where she opened up about her accusations against Allen, Gerwig realized that she “increased another woman’s pain.” She continued “I was heartbroken by that realization. I grew up on his movies, and they have informed me as an artist, and I cannot change that fact now, but I can make different decisions moving forward.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,274

Leslie Jones stopped by to talk about Facebook’s new dating feature and went through a list of the “terrible men” she’s dated and shared why the relationships didn’t work.

Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson reunited and got ‘Twilight’ fans buzzing, but we’ve EXCLUSIVELY learned if these two exes are getting back together or not.  For one moment, Edward Cullen and Bella Swan was once again a couple and all was right in the world for Twilight fans. Ex-lovers Robert Pattinson, 28, and Kristen Stewart, 32, attended Lily-Rose Depp’s 19th birthday party on June 1. However, don’t expect their love to rise from the grave. “There’s no chance of any kind of romantic reconciliation for Rob and Kristen,” a source close to Rob EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “That ship has well and truly sailed, and way too much has passed between them to ever reunite in that way. Plus, Kristen is really happy with Stella [Maxwell], they have an amazing relationship.”  While there’s no chance that RPatz and KStew will date again, it’s not all bad, as the source tells HollywoodLife.com that Rob thinks it’s “great” that they’ve “finally got to a place where they can be friendly when they see each other in public. Rob would love to see more of Kristen, he still cares for her deep down, and probably always will—she was his first real love.” As for Kristen, she “feels a little awkward when she sees Rob,” because she still “carries a lot of guilt” from how their romance ended (you know, what with her cheating on him with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.) However, the source says that Rob has repeatedly told her that “everything is good between them, and he doesn’t harbor any bad feelings towards her.”  Too bad, Twilight fans. Bella’s not getting back with Edward – or Jacob, for that matter. This should come as no surprises, as the two didn’t really seem to be that enamored with each other at Lily-Rose’s birthday party, as a source from the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles – where the bash was held – EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that they had “very cordial conversations, but it was minimal at best.” Oh, there was no drama – but there was no real chemistry either. Oh well.  Prior to the birthday bash, Robert and Kristen had a “low-key meet-up” in February 2018. Both Twilight stars were at a bar/restaurant in Los Angeles’ Silver Lake neighborhood. Eagle-eyed fans tweeted their excitement, hoping that they could “maybe start over again …but this time it means forever.” Sadly for these fans, the only way they can see Bella and Edward back together is in the pages of Stephenie Meyer’s books.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,525

Speaking to that point, Amy Introcaso-Davis, the Executive VP of production and development over at E!, called E! True Hollywood Story ""a beloved franchise that has never been more timely and relevant"" in the network's recent statement about its upcoming programming slate. While Introcaso-Davis didn't elaborate on that particular comment, it's not too difficult to understand what she might have been getting at. Given the truth-telling trend that has cropped up across the film and television industry over the last eight months or so (largely in conjunction with the rise of the Time's Up movement), it seems like there's arguably no better time to revive a franchise whose original M.O. aimed to provide viewers with the ""inside scoop"" as to what's really going on in Hollywood.  Just in case anyone out there needs a little brush-up on their THS knowledge, here's a quick history lesson: E! True Hollywood Story kicked off its original run in early 1996 with an hour-long documentary-style episode that delved into the infamous murder of actress and model Rebecca Schaeffer. The show was originally billed for a series of periodic tv specials, though it was quickly picked up as a regular weekly series.  Throughout its proximate near-decade run, E! True Hollywood Story covered a whole host of celebrity-centric topics, including industry scandals, notorious Hollywood mysteries, and ""Where are they now?"" pieces examining the current lives of former child stars. (Anyone else remember that heartbreaking Macaulay Culkin episode?) Besides Culkin, the original series' biopic-like episodes explored the so-called ""behind-the-scenes"" lives of a roster of the era's A-list Hollywood luminaries, including Lindsay Lohan, Drew Barrymore, and Britney Spears, among many, many others.  In its Tuesday statement, the network offered a glimpse (albeit, in pretty broad strokes) into what a revamped episode of True Hollywood Story might look like. Because, while the upcoming revamped series sounds like its going to operate under the same general parameters as the original, E!'s statement said that the new series will be taking a ""modern approach"" to its narratives — a conceivable attempt to do what the network described in its statement as ""providing a voice to the moments that are reshaping popular culture.""  Expanding on that idea a bit, the network also offered a slightly more robust explanation as to how True Hollywood Story's newly-minted episodic structure is going to work, saying,  Each self-contained documentary will explore a topic, headline, or person that became the ground zero for a revolution, change or shift in culture, told by the people who were on the front lines of the story.  At this point, it's difficult to theorize about which buzzing Hollywood-centric topics the upcoming E! True Hollywood Stories revamp will choose to focus on, especially considering the vast scope of potential avenues to pursue. That being said, if the updated docu-series is anything like the original, it certainly seems poised to gift eager viewers with the pop cultural intel they've been craving since 2015 — at least.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,803

A new lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses the entrepreneur of rape, according to reports from The New York Times and Billboard. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is seeking $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the outlets. Simmons denies the charge as well as the other accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.  Per the lawsuit, the woman says she met Simmons, 60, at a concert she attended with her son. After dropping her son off and spending some time together, the lawsuit says Doe hesitantly joined Simmons in his hotel room where she was raped.

23cf1b52-914d-4f3e-8c2c-d6acf72eaafe,"SPOILER ALERT: Do not read on unless you’ve seen Season 7, episode 2 of “American Horror Story,” titled “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” which aired on Sept. 12.  The premiere of “American Horror Story: Cult” found Ally (Sarah Paulson) to be, well, a mess after the election. As Donald Trump is voted into office, her old phobias rear their ugly heads once again, but in the second episode of the season, “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” it only gets much, much worse. In fact, her fears become fatal in the last shot of the episode, one of the most unsettling scenes yet.  But first, we pick up where we left off — with Ally in bed with one of the dreaded clowns. She screams and runs for Ivy (Alison Pill), who rushes to protect her and is as sweet and patient as ever. When she finds no such clown in the bedroom, however, despite Ally’s protests, Ivy admits again that Ally’s anxiety has taken its toll on her. Ally finally resigns to her state, saying, “I think there might be something wrong with me.” (But hey: Just because she’s paranoid, it doesn’t mean someone isn’t out to get her.)  Meanwhile, we see that Kai’s (Evan Peters) nefarious plans from the last episode have been working out swimmingly for him. After he provoked a band of construction workers by yelling racial slurs at them and chucking over a condom full of his urine, they unleashed a beatdown on him… while someone filmed on a cell phone nearby. Now it’s a local news story, and of course it takes a political turn: some of the construction workers have been taken into the custody of ICE. In announcing his run for city council — a seat that was vacated by the murder of councilman Chang — he quotes Trump’s “rapists and criminals” line, yelling, “Look at my face, Michigan!”  Related ‘American Horror Story: Cult’ Cast: Who’s Returning, Who’s Not, and Who’s New 10 Best ‘American Horror Story’ Episodes  Speaking of the Changs, the Mayfair-Richards already have new neighbors. After a rather creepy scene where Winter (Billie Lourd) engages in the most serious pinky swear ever with Oz, vowing to take his fear for him, she allows him to go next door to play with the new residents. Ally and Ivy get home and immediately freak out over this (how have they not fired Winter yet? Seriously?) and rush over to find Oz playing with bees. Yes, in a blatant reference to the “hive mind” theme of this season, one of the new neighbors is actually a beekeeper.  And this also means that Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman’s characters have been revealed. Harrison and Meadow are married, but not a couple — in fact, Harrison is gay. They just got married based on a pact they made when they were younger. Harrison gets one night a week to go out on the town and satisfy his needs, while Meadow, because of her past case of skin cancer, doesn’t like to be touched, so it all works out pretty nicely for them. They’re a blunt pair, which takes Ivy and Ally aback, but Harrison notes that that’s just “the way of the world now.” Indeed, Harrison.  Ally — surprise! — is skeptical of them, especially of the mysterious barrels they keep at their home, and the fact that they moved into the Chang’s old house so soon after the murders. But she’ll soon learn that they’re the least of her worries. Something’s tripped the alarm system back at their restaurant, and though Ivy offers to go, Ally insists that she can and that she’s “got this.” One has the sense, however, that she does not, in fact, got this. When she gets there, she makes a gruesome discovery: one of her restaurant’s managers hanging from a meat hook, just barely alive. As we learn later, Ally had to be the one to kill him.  Unsurprisingly, there’s an investigation, but there’s a political twist now: a worker at the restaurant is a suspect, due to an argument with the deceased that turned weirdly racial at the top of the episode. When a police officer, played by “AHS” newcomer Colton Haynes, asks Ally and Ivy about his immigration status, Ivy indignantly insists that “he’s American.” Other repercussions of the murder, of course, lie in Ally’s psyche. She gets a gun from Harrison, who has a troubling stockpile of them as he started to collect them, in a sense, when Barack Obama became president. Harrison goads on Ally’s fears, telling her, it’s “the only thing that will make you feel safe again.”  Ivy, concerned, invites Ally’s therapist, Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson) for a home call. Here, Ally tells him that she feels “vindicated” by her phobias and that they keep her safe, which… is one way to go. “The world is f—ed up,” she tells him. “The election made it worse.” She shows him her new gun, and while he’s worried, he’s unable to tell Ivy because of doctor-patient confidentiality, Ally notes.  Later, after Ally’s fortified her house, she gets an unwelcome visit from Kai, who she best knows currently as the man who dumped coffee all over her and Ivy in the last episode. He’s making a visit to campaign for office, and in a chilling scene, we see right rhetoric v. left rhetoric in full form. Ally, ironically from behind her newly installed bars, tells Kai that she’s interested in “building bridges, not walls.” Kai asks if he can get a drink of water, and Ally refuses to let him in and threatens to call the cops. Crazed, Kai yells, “It’s so easy until it’s you they’re coming for!”  This does not help Ally’s mental status. Later, as Ivy’s gone at the restaurant, Ally stares reluctantly at her pills. Winter picks up on this — she encourages Ally to have some wine and a bath to unwind, instead of taking her medication. Winter goes so far as to draw a bath for her, and when Ally’s relaxing, she reappears. While Ally is surprised at first, Winter starts to help wash her off. It’s clearly a seduction technique, and it’s kind of genius: she knows Ally’s stressed, and therefore relaxes her into seduction. But nothing ruins the mood like crazed clown murderers.  Suddenly, the power goes out, and with it, so does Winter, exclaiming that she has to go home to save her laptop. Harrison appears at her window to yell one of the best lines of the episode: “Lesbians! We’re under attack!” It’s interesting that he goes political, telling Ally that it could be Russians or “those crazy freaks in North Korea,” seemingly playing on her fears. Ally panics and calls Ivy, who’s dealing with the power outage at the restaurant too. When Ally’s phone dies, Ivy sends Pedro — the employee currently under investigation for murder — with some supplies for her.  Meanwhile, Ally’s lost it. She finds that someone’s cut the cords in her fusebox, and even sees a few of the masked murderers. When she runs upstairs to grab Oz, she has to throw one off of from the top of the stairs (and though it could mean nothing, it’s worth noting: there’s no thump to be heard when the assailant hits the ground). With her gun in hand, she rushes Oz to the door and instructs him to run to the neighbors’ house. When she opens the door, however, someone’s standing there, and in her panic, she shoots him. But lo and behold, it was Pedro there to help her — and now, he could very well be dead.  Now, not only has Ally committed a murder and lost another friend, but my guess is Kai will try to use this to his advantage. Maybe his fear-mongering is working — on Ally, at least.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1672

5f0fab85-ade1-4e63-8da1-a9b6f0258d2b,"The things you plan the least sometimes turn out the best. This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine’s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.  We’re in Stanley’s on St Andrew’s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It’s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of “Let’s go out, but not to our usual place”. I’ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don’t come easily.  But two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley’s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.  If that doesn’t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we’re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There’s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.  For the moment, it feels like we’re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we’ll remember fondly when we get home.  The menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.  The star of Stanley’s is Morgan Vanderkamer. She’s the sommelier here. But don’t let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.  The main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We’re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is “amazing”, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a €16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at €13 a glass. It is a good decision.  There’s a small farmyard on that €16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the “bacon and cabbage”, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.  Just in case there isn’t enough on the plate (there is), we’ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas – but that’s even better in my book – and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It’s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.  Dessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There’s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that’s served deliciously chilly. It’s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we’ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.

361055e3-4e08-431f-af5f-dd9baa418863,"First, ex-Mouseketeer Britney Spears posed in short shorts and a black bra on a Rolling Stone cover in 1999. Then, a scantily clad onetime Hannah Montana, Miley Cyrus, twerked up a storm at the MTV VMAs two years ago. Now, it’s former Disney star Selena Gomez, 23, who’s shed most of her clothing as part of an attempt to establish herself as a grown-up artist.  All eyes are on her new album, “Revival” (her first for Interscope), out Friday — or, more accurately, all eyes are on her album cover. It’s got Gomez practically in her birthday suit, topless and wearing only barely there shorts.  Like Disney alumni who have gone before, she’s looking to shake things up with a new look and sound that are a world away from her previous, wholesome persona. The lyrics from the opening title track explain it plainly, as Gomez sings, “No more hiding . . . it’s my time to butterfly.”  It hasn’t been the easiest journey from child star known for kid shows such as “Barney & Friends” and “Wizards of Waverly Place” to full-blown adult celebrity. After canceling an Australian tour to support her debut solo album, “Stars Dance,” at the end of 2013, Gomez voluntarily entered Dawn at the Meadows recovery and rehab center in Arizona at the start of 2014. Rumors of substance abuse and addiction swirled — maybe brought on by her consorting with Justin Bieber (another onetime child star with his own set of troubles). But Gomez set the record straight this week, telling Billboard it was actually so she could get chemotherapy for lupus.  She returned later in the year with the single “The Heart Wants What It Wants,” an obvious referral to her on-off relationship with Bieber, and her final release for Disney’s Hollywood Records.  But Gomez turned over a new leaf this summer with the sultry, R&B-flavored single “Good for You,” featuring A$AP Rocky.  “We definitely felt that the sexier sound of that song was a good progression for Selena,” says Sharon Dastur, senior vice president of programming integration at iHeartMedia. “As you grow up, you want to try different things. It’s not just a thing for ex-Disney artists — all young people feel that way.”  Another sign of a maturing Gomez: She fired her mother, Mandy Teefey, and stepfather, Brian, as her managers. That, notes veteran Nashville-based entertainment lawyer Stephen Weaver, is a positive career move.  Manager-parents can cause problems for record labels. Weaver recalls pitching an artist with a father-manager to a powerful producer. “[He’d] had so many bad experiences with parents as managers that he refused to listen to it. He was afraid he would like it!”  Although Gomez is following a tradition of other young stars transitioning to adulthood, her “Revival” cover photo is about more than hitting the world over the head with sexuality. Gomez recently explained that it was a kiss-off to the body-shamers who have savaged her bikini body in the past online. “I did start gaining weight, and I didn’t mind it,” she told the Los Angeles radio station Power 106 last month. “[The comments were] really hurtful . . . but I’m not gonna give a f – – k what people say. I’m not gonna let them get to me.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,672

Naturally, her eyes -- like her hair -- are brown.  REUTERS  But sometimes, she changes it up. Her eyes have appeared a lighter hazel, green and even blue at various points over time, including during the 2016 presidential election.

This eye color phenomenon has been noticed at least as far back as early November, when Esquire questioned Trump's eye color.  Then, press representatives did not respond to Esquire's request for comment on if she wears color-changing contacts, so we just have to go off common sense and say that's what's happening (it's more likely than her eyes spontaneously changing color on opposite sides of the genetic spectrum).  Although some women have said their eyes changed colors over the course of pregnancy -- and Trump was pregnant last year -- that doesn't explain why the color hopped around so much.  Maybe she likes the way it looks and it gives her confidence. Maybe she wants to give off a lighter tone to be more likable (see: all the Disney characters with blue eyes), which, yeah, is a racial thing.

That’s exactly what 28-year-old reality TV personality, Naomie Olindo, decided to do less than half a year after breaking up with heartthrob, Craig Conover. On Thursday, the star of Southern Charm revealed the results of her makeover on Instagram, complete with a nose emoji to further press the point.  Admitting that a bit of swelling was still present in the wake of the procedure less than two weeks earlier, Olindo claimed during an interview on Bravo TV that she decided to take advantage of the show’s post-season hiatus to undergo the procedure. It stated it was something she had wanted to do since she was eight years old. She also said she suffered no pain at all while on the operating table.  Even before she shared the news, fans on social media pointed out that she didn’t quite look the same. However, after commenting on the change, Olindo got a few negative responses and quickly defended her decision. She noted she was happy about the effect of the results on her self-esteem and would do it again.  inquisitr.com  Her rhinoplasty venture might help her move on after splitting from Conover, a relationship that dominated story arcs during seasons three and four of Southern Charm. Olindo originally met Conover in South Carolina at the College of Charleston, but they actually started dating after they graduated.  The most recent season saw the two try to navigate stormy waters as audiences watched their relationship start to unravel, especially when Olindo and Conover underwent therapy to keep their connection from further fraying. Unfortunately, the twosome called it quits in September.  Even after the breakup, Olindo claims she's still the best of friends with Conover, adding that he provided a lot of support for her in a text regarding her nose job.  The two will also remain in the cast of the forthcoming fifth season of Southern Charm, which recently promoted recurring personality Chelsea Meissner to become part of the core ensemble. That decision seems to be a no-brainer, considering Meissner was at the center of a three-way relationship that sparked plenty of interest among viewers.

78acda77-bcff-4c8e-9fd2-a199c2866d19,"Caitlyn Jenner is “very proud” of Kim Kardashian West for her conversations with President Donald Trump that led to the pardon of Alice Marie Johnson, the 62-year-old great-grandmother who was incarcerated for 22 years over a first-time nonviolent drug offense.  In a sit-down interview with Variety published on Tuesday, Jenner spoke out about her former step-daughter’s foray into politics, which began with a phone call from Trump and culminated in a meeting between the two at the White House in May.  “I thought they did the right thing,” Jenner, 68, told the trade magazine of the mother of three, whom she has not spoken to in years. “I was very proud of her.”  Jenner herself is “very politically involved” and has been busy working to shape policy in the Trump administration, though more so behind the scenes.  “I don’t do a lot of media. I don’t want to be seen everywhere,” she said. “Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don’t stick my nose into everything publicly.”  Caitlyn Jenner and Donald Trump Jon Kopaloff/WireImage; Evan Vucci/AP/REX/Shutterstock  RELATED: Where Caitlyn Jenner Stands with Every Woman in the Kardashian Family  A long outspoken Republican, Jenner voted for Trump in the 2016 election on what she thought was a promise of continued progress for LGBTQ rights.  “On the economics side, I’m very conservative. I believe in limited government, I believe in lower taxes, I believe in less regulations, I want a thriving economy, I want Americans to be able to succeed,” Jenner said. “But socially, I’m much more progressive. We have to get them to be more progressive with social issues. It’s their biggest problem.”  But since Trump’s election, there’s been an attempt to roll back rights — including Trump’s failed attempt to stop transgender people from enrolling in the military and his move to lift federal protections for transgender students that would guarantee their freedom to use public school bathrooms and locker rooms matching their chosen gender identity.  “I honestly don’t know what happened when he got in there,” Jenner remarked. “It was extraordinarily disappointing.”  Well @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq — Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) February 24, 2017  Though she hasn’t spoken to Trump since his election (despite publicly asking the president to call her), Jenner explained that she regularly makes trips to Washington, D.C. and has had long meetings with roughly 50 members of the House and Senate and many members of Trump’s White House directly.  “I met with Paul Ryan. I’ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren’t supportive of transgender rights. … I’ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,” she said, telling Variety that the conversations were confidential but often included “invasive questions about her body and genitalia.”  “I think it’s a good thing that I’m on the Republican side because I’ve got an in,” she said. “Has this administration set us backwards? Absolutely. And every time they’ve done it, I’ve fought it. …. I fight those types of wars. I fight the equality wars. I do it all very quietly. We’re going to be okay in the end.”  She added: “What’s going on in Washington D.C. is just disgraceful.

Not all of them, but many at the end of the day, they believe in one thing: Themselves and nothing else or no one else.    Years ago, Hollywood jumped on the Joseph Campbell bandwagon, especially screenwriters, because Campbell mentioned Star Wars and the cottage industry screenwriting gurus incorporated ""Hero's Journey..."" blah, blah, blah and other Joe Campbell lingo into all of their teachings. Robert Mitchum's quote applies.    Thank God! I discovered Joseph Campbell before I truly discovered Hollywood.    Ken Baker weaves an interesting spiritual quest for answers, antithetic to Bill Maher.  His catalyst, which is relatable to most of us, is losing his religion in a hedonistic place like Tinseltown. NBA player Lamar Odom's road to excess is the jumping off point, or ""leap of faith"" that Ken must perform a deep high-dive into his soul. He goes on to tell a stereotypical Catholic upbringing where the family of five attends church and the father goes through the motions to placate the mother, but never honestly embraces God...  An amazing spiritual story evolves from this tragedy.    Ken Baker's an excellent writer and entertaining to read. I burned through his book and enjoyed the spiritual quest alongside him as a reader. As a senior correspondent for E! his job ""is to report on the gamut of entertainment news..."", "" ...as well as the daily hookups, breakups, and screw-ups of the world's biggest stars.""

If you've seen  Thomas Peter ""Tom"" Shadyac's ""I Am"" documentary or most recently Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, then one could view Hollywood as a spiritual sinkhole.    Key takeaway is: Don't discover God on your deathbed. If you chose not to have faith, or find religion a fairly tale, Hey, ""whatever gets you through the night,"" as John Lennon once wrote. Maybe God is George Burns to some people in Hollywood. However, for me, I am personally comfortable with Camus' logic that:    ""I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,497

Insiders who worked with Mel on her US TV shows said the split was no surprise as the couple spent most of their time “squabbling” and “bickering” amid accusations of affairs and flirting.

It is no secret her family didn’t like him and now she has reconnected with them, Mel is sorting out her life.  (Image: Getty)  ""She’s had enough of the chaos with Stephen. Her, the kids and her family come first.”  Belafonte referred to Mel’s family as “the cutoff crew” on Twitter after Martin reached out to her. Speaking in 2012, Martin said: “I just want to speak to her, so I know those children are happy.  “If she wants this strange relationship, that’s her choice. She’s my daughter and I love her to bits.”  Mel started dating Belafonte in February 2007 and they wed four months later in Las Vegas and renewed their vows in Egypt in 2008.  (Image: Getty)  But Scary Spice, whose real name is Melanie Brown, filed divorce papers in Los Angeles ­Superior Court on Monday, citing irreconcilable differences.  The Leeds-born star listed the date of separation as December 28 and asked for joint legal and physical custody of daughter Madison, five.  Mel, who also has daughters Angel Iris, nine, with Hollywood actor Eddie Murphy and Phoenix Chi, 18, with her former backing dancer Jimmy Gulzar, is bidding to terminate the court’s ability to award spousal support – hinting at the alleged money rows.  The star was seen arriving at the Hollywood Hills home she had shared with Belafonte at 10.20am as she dropped Madison off.  (Image: Getty)  She then drove to Beverly Hills, where Phoenix got out to pick up coffee. Mel looked anguished and could be seen texting.  In February last year, Mel had said in a gushing Instagram post: “We have been through everything that would normally tear couples apart and come out on the other side stronger.  “You loved me before I even new [sic] how to really love myself, you are my world honey and let’s not forget you are abit [sic] of a d**khead too.”  Last week, she posted: “You have to be at your strongest when you’re feeling at your weakest.” Pals have said Mel told them several times in the last couple of years “she was done”.  And they said the couple would act for cameras to “pretend their marriage was strong”.  The TV source said Belafonte, who in 2003 admitted a domestic charge linked to then-girlfriend Nicole Contreras, often shocked TV workers with crude outbursts on and off set.  One model, who would not be named, even claimed that in recent weeks Stephen has been “acting like a single man”.  The LA TV executive said: “Mel was incredibly open about their fights and arguments in front of staff on America’s Got Talent and other shows. She’d have screaming matches with him on the phone or even at the studio.  (Image: officialmelb/Instagram)  “It was so bizarre, as they didn’t appear to show any love, care or even respect at times.  “She has dropped F-bombs galore and called him all the names under the sun. He too had the mouth of a sailor, saying inappropriate things to her in front of researchers and assistants.  ""He would make rude statements about her body and having sex with her. It is a surprise they stayed together so long.  “He always acted like he was her manager and supervisor, which seemed an unusual mix, given he really had little experience. It was like he inserted himself into her business just to make himself look busy.”  (Image: AFP)  Problems may have been brought to a head by the couple’s busy ­workloads, which gave them little time together recently.  Mel had a full schedule on America’s Got Talent last year, while eyeing a Spice Girls reunion and performing in Chicago on Broadway in New York.  Meanwhile, Belafonte has been trying to carve out a new career as a restaurateur in Los Angeles.  The source said: “There was a bigger rift growing as they ended up living separate lives. He ended up spending days and nights at his Italian restaurant, Serafina, acting like this huge star.”  Last month, Mel’s publicist played down reports Belafonte was caught holding hands with a brunette at STK restaurant in New York.  The couple have also been dogged by rumours that they invited other women into their bedroom.  The TV insider said: “Nothing would surprise me.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1328

Alwyn made his Instagram public over the weekend, simultaneously revealing a past, sly reference to Swift.  On May 8, Swift, 28, posted a picture of herself in front of a huge cactus. Swift — who wore a long black dress and shades for the occasion — wrote, “Fact: I’ve never been more excited about a tour than I am about this one. And it starts TOMORROW. Also, not even remotely tour related, but today I met a cactus.”  As it turns out, Alwyn, 27, posted a picture of the same cactus on the same day, captioning his snapshot with only the corresponding emoji.

Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  The actress Prince Harry looks set to pop the question to could not be more suited, say pals - because her student days were perfect training to keep up with the playboy prince.  While 36-year-old Meghan Markle may seem like the ideal princess-in-waiting, we can reveal she had a wild youth just like 32-year-old Harry.  Meghan’s days at Northwestern University in Chicago in the early 2000s have rarely been spoken about.  But a visit to her old stomping ground by the Sunday Mirror has revealed she was a typical party-loving student who allegedly used fake ID to go clubbing.  One of her favourite haunts is said to have been a bar that has since been shut down following a battle with authorities over underage drinking.  We also uncovered an article from the college news magazine in which Meghan herself joked she put on a stone after bingeing on Burger King in her Freshman year.  Interviewed by the magazine in 2014, after returning to the Northwestern campus for a Q&A session alongside fellow cast members of TV show Suits, she said: “It’s surreal because I haven’t been back since I graduated.  “And as I’m walking around I remember things like the schlep of getting to South Campus from up north.  “The 24-hour Burger King also ­definitely helped me put on the Freshman Fifteen.”  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  Meghan attended the university’s School of Communication at the same time as fun-loving Prince Harry was getting into trouble for heavy drinking.  In his late teens, the young prince was making headlines for his wild nights out in Gloucestershire pubs around Highgrove – Prince Charles’s country home.  One pub in particular, the Rattlebone Inn, which has since changed hands, was infamous for its boozy lock-ins.  Prince Harry even set up a nightclub for his posh friends in the basement of Highgrove, calling it Club H.  And while the prince partied with his exclusive group of pals, Meghan was at college mixing with members of her own posh pack.  Hers was an all-female society, called the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority, with a reputation for hard partying and social climbing.  Current KKG member Melania Hidalgo told the Sunday Mirror that Meghan had been a popular member of the student body.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  She said: “We’re intelligent hot messes. The thing we all have in common is that we’re all very driven, ambitious and passionate.  “Meghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.  “She was in charge of bringing in new girls – you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.  “I lived in the house for a year and it’s a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you’d mix with.  (Image: Coleman-Rayner)  “All of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies… you develop very strong friendships.”  Meghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.  Former pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then – and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.

One former student claimed: “Meghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.  “You can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago – it’s a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.  (Image: GC)  “She seems like the perfect modern princess now, but she lived university life like most teenagers and was really popular on campus. Everyone talks about her going here.” The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence – after 36 years as a students’ favourite – following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.  It is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.  “It was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,” general manager Chris Nora said. “It doesn’t surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.  (Image: WireImage)  Door staff used to joke when girls finally handed over a real one, saying, ‘It’s about time!’”  Already an accepted part of the family, Meghan is in the UK this week to give Prince Harry much-needed support on the 20th anniversary of mum Diana’s death . She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William’s wife Kate and Harry’s nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.  Our trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan’s birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.  Rachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.  And photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned “Rachel Markle” – and another captioned “Meghan Markle”.  The find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.  And as speculation grows that the world’s most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1137

For his latest stunt, Cruise brought Corden along with him: skydiving at 15,000 feet for a ""Late Late Show"" segment on Thursday.  It was almost an impossible mission, though. Corden joked that he tried to reach Cruise multiple times to cancel.  Before they got in the air, Corden was his usual comedic self, asking Cruise if there was ""meal service"" on the plane and coming up with a hand signal for if he soiled himself. When Corden met the professional that he'd be diving with, Danny, who was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, he said, ""We're not skydiving into Margaritaville, I want someone who looks like they know what they're doing.""  But Danny had dived 7,000 times already, which promptly reassured Corden.  Cruise, meanwhile, took it all in stride. The actor skydived for a scene in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout,"" and he jumped out of a plane 106 times at 30,000 feet for the shot. He even slept on the plane as it ascended while Corden sat nervously waiting.  Before they dived, Corden called his wife, and Cruise said he would take care of her if Corden dies.

The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, she began receiving media attention with her appearance as the maid of honour at her sister's wedding to Prince William.  Early life [ edit ]  Pippa Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, England. She is the second of three children born to Michael Middleton (born 1949), a former British Airways flight dispatcher, and Carole Middleton (née Goldsmith; born 1955), a former flight attendant.[7][8] She was christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire.[9]  Education [ edit ]  In 1995, her family moved to Bucklebury, Berkshire.[10][11] Like her sister, Middleton was first educated at St Andrew's School, a private boarding school in Pangbourne and then Downe House School, a girls' day and boarding school in Cold Ash. She was a boarder at Marlborough College, where she held a sports/all-rounder scholarship.[12][13] Middleton then graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an English literature degree,[14] where she shared a house with Lord Edward Innes-Ker, a son of the Duke of Roxburghe, and with Earl Percy, heir apparent of the Duke of Northumberland.[14]  Career [ edit ]  Following her graduation, Middleton briefly worked in 2008 at a public relations firm promoting luxury products. She then had an events management job with Table Talk, a company based in London that organises corporate events and parties.[12][15] Also in 2008, Tatler magazine named Middleton ""the Number 1 Society Singleton"", ahead of singer-songwriter James Blunt and Princess Eugenie of York,[16] although in the same Tatler article she was described as someone who ""goes to a lot of parties, but mainly as the caterer."" Since then, she has often been described as a socialite.[17] As part of a duo with her elder sister, Middleton has received wide press coverage, focusing on her social life and her lifestyle. In April 2012, Time magazine listed Middleton as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[18]  Middleton has worked part-time for her parents' company Party Pieces, editing the web magazine Party Times.[12][19]  Penguin Books paid Middleton a £400,000 advance for a book on party planning. The book, entitled Celebrate, was published in autumn 2012, and had lower than anticipated sales as many reviewers mocked it for the obviousness of its content.[20][21] In March 2013, Middleton parted from her literary agent.[22]  The 2016 ITV documentary, Our Queen At 90, revealed that a recipe which featured in Middleton's Celebrate book – Granny's Marrow Chutney – had been made by her sister, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who gave a jar of it as a Christmas gift to her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2011.[23]  Middleton is also a regular columnist for several publications.

In May 2013, she became the sole director and shareholder of PXM Enterprises Limited.[28] The company is headquartered at 19 Portland Place in London.[28]  In September 2016, Middleton's iPhone was hacked. The Sun reported it had been approached by a hacker who claimed to have 3,000 images from Middleton's iCloud account and demanded £50,000 for them. The hacker was arrested that same month.[29]  Royal wedding [ edit ]  Middleton stands with the Royal Family as maid of honour at the wedding of her sister and Prince William, as Prince Phillip looks on  The official announcement of her sister's engagement came on 16 November 2010. Middleton served as the maid of honour.[30] At the wedding, Middleton's white figure-hugging dress, which, like the bride's, was created by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen, was highly praised in the media. Made of ivory crêpe fabric, it was styled with a cowl at the front and organza-covered buttons at the back. Copies of the dress were soon available on the High Street[31][32] where there was a great demand for them.[33][34][35]  Philanthropy [ edit ]  In April 2013, Middleton became an ambassador to the Mary Hare School for deaf children in Berkshire.  In June 2014, Middleton became an ambassador to the British Heart Foundation (BHF).[36] That month, she took part in the Race Across America, a 3,000 mile cycling race across the United States, followed by the Bosphorus Cross-Continental Swimming Race, a 6.5 km swimming competition in Istanbul, as two fundraising opportunities for the BHF.[36] Her bicycle was also auctioned on eBay for the BHF.[36] She then attended the BHF's Roll out the Red Ball at the Park Lane Hotel on 10 February 2015.[37] She auctioned one of her L.K.Bennett dresses at the ball. She took part in the London to Brighton Bike Ride for the BHF on 21 June 2015. In September 2015, Middleton participated in a 47-mile swim-run competition in Sweden alongside her brother and James Matthews to raise money for the Michael Matthews Foundation, a charity found in honour of James Matthew's brother who lost his life on a mountain climbing trek.[38]  In September 2016, Middleton released her second book, Heartfelt, whose proceeds go to the British Heart Foundation.[39]  Personal life [ edit ]  In July 2016, Middleton became engaged to James Matthews, a former professional racing driver, now hedge fund manager. The couple married on 20 May 2017 at St Mark's Church, at Englefield Estate, Berkshire, near Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family home.[40]  Matthews is the eldest son and heir of David Matthews, the Laird of Glen Affric. If Matthews inherits his father's lairdship, then Middleton may be accorded the courtesy title of Lady Glen Affric.[41][42][43][44]  In June 2018, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child.[45][46][47] Their son, Arthur Michael William Matthews, was born on 15 October 2018 at St Mary's Hospital, London.[48][49][50]  Arms [ edit ]  Coat of arms of Pippa Middleton Notes Middleton bears her father's arms on a lozenge.

The former One Direction star, 23, has enjoyed a string of dates with the London-based chef — after being introduced by mutual friends.  And pals close to the singer say that unlike his other flings, Styles is really taken with Ward, 27, known for her “Naked Diet” cookbook, and believe they’re set for a long-term relationship.  A source said: “As soon as Harry met Tess, there was an instant spark between them. They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food — and things turned romantic quickly. They’ve been on a number of dates while Harry has been in London and he’s already introduced Tess to some of his close friends including his personal stylist Lou Teasdale. This really seems different to Harry’s past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn’t want to risk messing this one up.”  Ward has been dubbed “cooking’s new golden girl” by fans. She released her first book, “The Naked Diet,” in 2015 after being trained by top chefs in The Ritz and River Cottage.  She is also a model and well known on the fashion circuit, having worked with former “Made in Chelsea” stars Millie Mackintosh and Rosie Fortescue, as well as Simon Le Bon’s model daughter Amber Le Bon.  Like her new boyfriend Styles, who released his debut solo single “Sign of the Times” last month, Tess is also a hit stateside and has been offered a host of TV and modeling opportunities in the US.  Writing on her LinkedIn profile, the chef, who has a degree in art history, reveals: “Current projects include a number of exciting TV and online projects in the US and UK.”  Styles went public with his new girlfriend last weekend as he was pictured driving Tess around north London in his luxury Audi.  The new couple looked relaxed together as they sat in traffic — and Styles even risked a fine and six points on his license as he used his phone behind the wheel.  Styles recently revealed that he is changing the way he dates women after failed relationships with Taylor Swift, Caroline Flack and Kendall Jenner.  He said: “I used to research dates, then I said I’m not going to do that anymore, it’s impossible to go in without a perception of someone and you’ve never met them and I started feeling like that was wrong and weird.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,491

While Harington and Leslie announced their news in a very old-fashioned and traditional way (a notice in The Times!), the social media-savvy Jonas and Turner revealed their news Sunday via carefully coordinated Instagram posts.

Playing coy about her relationship at the Golden Globes that month, Turner flashed a bejeweled finger for the camera and joked: “And my engagement ring that isn’t really an engagement ring.” The very famous couple have kept their relationship low key ever since; Jonas attended the Los Angeles premiere of Game of Thrones this past summer with Turner but didn’t walk the red carpet by her side. In fact, the pair have never been photographed together in any official capacity and have only appeared together very rarely on each other’s social media accounts and in paparazzi shots.  Given their private nature, the couple have not revealed any further details on their engagement—as in how long they are going to wait to tie the knot. Game of Thrones Season 8 will be shooting until summer of 2018 and Harington has reportedly asked production to be put on a brief hold next year so the cast can attend his wedding to Leslie. Perhaps he wants to make it a double wedding with Turner? A double Game of Thrones wedding, what could possibly go wrong?

ff81ff03-7a51-4f70-86aa-4e8751a4d357,"Jennifer Lawrence was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on August 15, 1990. She got her big break at 14, when she was discovered while vacationing in New York City with her family. She quickly landed a part in the TV series The Bill Engvall Show, followed by roles in films that included The Burning Plain, Winter’s Bone, X-Men: First Class and The Hunger Games. She later reprised her role playing Katniss Everdeen in Catching Fire and the two-part Mockingjay. Lawrence won an Academy Award for her work in David O. Russell 's Silver Linings Playbook (2012) and continued to work with the director on American Hustle and Joy, winning Golden Globes for all three projects as well.  Lawrence was an athletic child, involved in cheerleading, field hockey and softball, and thought she might be a doctor when she grew up. She did some modeling and community theater, but never dreamed that she’d become an actress.  Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990, in a suburb of Louisville, Kentucky. She has two older brothers, Blaine and Ben, and her parents, Karen and Gary, owned a farm just outside the city.  Start of Acting Career  Lawrence’s big break came when she was discovered at 14 while on spring break in New York with her family. A stranger asked to take her picture and took her mother’s phone number, then called the next day to ask her to do a screen test. Things happened quickly after that: Lawrence stayed in New York City for the summer, acting in commercials for MTV and filming the 2007 thriller Devil You Know with Lena Olin. (The film was shelved due to lack of distribution and was eventually released in 2013.) Soon after, Lawrence and her family moved to Los Angeles, where she had small roles on the series Medium, Monk and Cold Case, before landing a part on the TBS series The Bill Engvall Show. While working on the series, she also appeared in feature films including The Poker House and The Burning Plain alongside Charlize Theron and Kim Basinger.  After The Bill Engvall Show was canceled, Lawrence went on to appear in the critically acclaimed Winter’s Bone in 2010, which earned her nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Opportunities continued to pour in, and in 2011 Lawrence appeared in The Beaver with Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster and Anton Yelchin. She also took on the role of Mystique in X-Men: First Class.  In 2012, Lawrence became a box-office sensation as Katniss Everdeen, the lead in The Hunger Games, the film adaptation of the bestselling novel by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic state, Lawrence's character must participate in an event in which 24 teens fight to the death as televised entertainment. The film broke box-office records on opening weekend, and Lawrence reprised her role in 2013's The Hunger Games: Catching Fire as well as the two-part Mockingjay (2014 and 2015). As of late 2015, the franchise has earned more than $2.8 billion dollars at the global box office.  'Silver Linings' Oscar  Other 2012 releases for Lawrence included the thriller House at the End of the Street, co-starring Elisabeth Shue, and two dramas with Bradley Cooper: The Falling and Silver Linings Playbook, which earned an array of award nominations and a Golden Globe win (best actress in a comedy or musical) for Lawrence. She took home the Oscar for best actress at the Academy Awards in February 2013. Lawrence seemed overcome with emotion as she accepted the honor.  Lawrence continued to work with Silver Linings Playbook director David O. Russell on 2013's American Hustle, playing the emotionally complex wife of a con artist (Christian Bale). The film co-starred Amy Adams and Cooper. Lawrence received her third Oscar nod for the part, and won her second Globe. In 2014 she co-starred again with Cooper in the little seen drama Serena before once again captivating moviegoers as the mutant Mystique in X-Men: Days of Future Past.  'Joy' and 'Mother'  Lawrence, Cooper and Russell later signed on to bring the story of Miracle Mop inventor Joy Mangano to the big screen, with Lawrence taking on the title role. Joy had a Christmas Day 2015 U.S. release, and Lawrence soon won her third Golden Globe for her performance. Days later she received another Oscar nod. At 25, she became the youngest performer in history to have earned four Academy Award nominations.  Continuing with her high-profile work, in 2016 Lawrence co-starred in X-Men: Apocalypse and the science-fiction film Passengers. The following year she made an impressive leap into the horror genre with the critically acclaimed Mother.

(Photo: Stephane Cardinale - Corbis/Corbis via Getty Images)  The Wage Gap Essay  In October 2015 Lawrence wrote an essay, which was featured in Lena Dunham's feminist newsletter Lenny, entitled ""Why Do I Make Less Than My Male Co‑Stars?""  Discovering she was paid less than her American Hustle male co-stars via the Sony hacking scandal, Lawrence ultimately blamed herself for not negotiating for more pay.  ""When the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with d*cks, I didn’t get mad at Sony. I got mad at myself. I failed as a negotiator because I gave up early. I didn’t want to keep fighting over millions of dollars that, frankly, due to two franchises, I don’t need,"" she explains.  However, Lawrence admitted she didn't fight for a better salary because she was afraid of how she'd be perceived. ""I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem 'difficult' or 'spoiled,' "" she confessed. ""This is an element of my personality that I’ve been working against for years, and based on the statistics, I don’t think I’m the only woman with this issue. Are we socially conditioned to behave this way? ... Could there still be a lingering habit of trying to express our opinions in a certain way that doesn’t 'offend' or 'scare' men?""  In her own fiery way, Lawrence concluded she would no longer tolerate inequitable pay for fear of being less liked. Her essay caused a great deal of buzz in the media about ongoing gender wage gap issues.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1260

3f0d92d9-89ab-48e3-9d1f-7f0006443d8b,"Slow Hands is a song recorded by Irish singer and songwriter Niall Horan, released as a single on 4 May 2017 by Capitol Records.[2] The song was written by Horan, Alexander Izquierdo, John Ryan, Julian Bunetta, Ruth Anne Cunningham and Tobias Jesso Jr., while the production was handled by Bunetta.[3] It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 9 May 2017[4] as the second single from Horan's debut solo album Flicker (2017).  ""Slow Hands"" peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart and number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Horan's highest-charting single in those countries.  Background and composition [ edit ]  Prior to its release, Horan discussed the song in an interview with Mikey Piff on Sirius XM. The singer said that after listening to some of the material he had recorded for his debut album, he wanted to add ""a bit more grit, funk and heavier bass."" At the time he was listening to late 1970s and early 1980s music. ""When Don Henley went solo in the early eighties, he just kinda had this funky kind of feel to it – heavy bass, heavy guitar – so I just thought, 'Let's give this a crack,'"" Horan said of making the track. ""I wanted it to be a little bit cheeky with the lyric."" About the concept, he explained it is set in a bar and the song's theme changes up stereotypical roles. ""The first line is...'we should take this back to my place' – and usually that's what the guy would say, but we flipped it that the girl would say that, and that's what she said right to my face.""[5][6]  ""Slow Hands"" is a bass-heavy funk-pop song, with Horan singing in a lower register.[5][7] A Billboard writer described it as an ""R&B-inflected rock tune.""[8]  Critical reception [ edit ]  In Billboard, Taylor Weatherby noted ""Slow Hands"" focuses on a ""funkier guitar vibe"", compared to Horan's previous single ""This Town."" She also opined ""the subtly-sexy song"" shows an ""edgier side of Niall.""[9] Colin Stutz from the publication, added, ""The combination of a thumping beat and Horan's raspy vocals makes the song hardly even sound like the same guy who sang [""This Town""]. But what ""Slow Hands"" shows is that Horan definitely won't just be sticking to the sweet singer-songwriter sound on his solo debut.""[6] Rolling Stone's Althea Legaspi also noted Horan ""goes for a more muted sound. Above a stomp-and-clap beat and muted guitar, Horan allows his lower register to showcase his more seductive side on the track.""[5]  In The Irish Times, Jennifer Gannon wrote that ""it’s no radical departure, Niall hasn’t decided to go Gaga but it’s a step in a more Sheeran-style, crowd-pleasing direction. A gentle, foot-stomper about a lady with a magic touch, a lady who knows what she wants, she wants to get her hands all over Niall's ""dirty laundry"" and not in a bringing your washing home on a Sunday way. This isn’t Timberlake’s Sexy Back, it’s Horan’s Sweaty Back.""[10]  Billboard's critics' list placed it second on ""Every One Direction Solo Single, Ranked"" in May 2017, stating that the ""secret"" highlight ""[is] the way Niall's vocal on the first verse is ever so discretely chopped on the recording to a clipped staccato, a mysterious move that forces the singer into a less-is-more delivery that ends up being much more indeed.""[11]  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Slow Hands"" charted within the top 10 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single became his second top 20 entry as a solo artist on the US Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 11 and surpassing his preceding single ""This Town"", which reached number 20. On 15 September 2017, the single was certified Platinum for combined sales and streaming equivalent units of over a million units in the United States. On the chart dated 7 October 2017, the single reached number one on the Mainstream Top 40 chart.[12] As of December 2017, it has sold one million copies in the US.[13]  Live performances [ edit ]  Horan has performed ""Slow Hands"" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[14][15] On 29 May 2017, the singer performed ""Slow Hands"", ""This Town"" and premiered the track ""On the Loose"" on The Today Show.[16] On 4 June 2017, Horan performed the song during the One Love Manchester benefit concert for the victims of the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing.[17] On 5 June he performed on BBC One's The One Show.[18] The singer also performed ""Slow Hands"" at the Capital FM's Summertime Ball 2017.[19]  On 22 June 2018, Horan performed the song with American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, at the first London show of her Reputation Stadium Tour at Wembley Stadium, as a surprise guest.

I was nervous a little bit because I didn’t want Jace thinking it was me that didn’t want to visit with him, but when he arrived everything was back to the way it used to be.”  Although the mother of three — she is mom to Jace, son Kaiser, 2, and newborn daughter Ensley Jolie — did she some tears, it was a happy reunion.  “I did cry but not around anyone except for David,” said Jenelle, who is engaged to fiancé David Eason. “I didn’t want any of the kids thinking I was upset. Lots of hugs and kisses we’re going around all weekend!”  To celebrate the three-day weekend, the MTV personality and her children, along with Eason’s daughter Maryssa, rode bikes and enjoyed some time hiking and at the beach. “Couldn’t have asked for a better weekend,” she said.  “My next visit with him is this upcoming weekend since his summer school break will begin,” said Jenelle, who will reportedly have Jace for his entire summer break. “We are planning on taking the kids on vacation so that should be lots of fun!”  FROM PEN: What’s Next for Princess Charlotte  Although the Evans v.

5be4f82d-5823-4f04-a00b-23c1957df103,"(CNN) Larry Nassar was sentenced Monday to 40 to 125 years in prison, ending a remarkable three weeks of court hearings that dramatically personalized the pain and suffering the former doctor caused for years.  At his sentencing hearing in Eaton County, Michigan, Nassar apologized for his years of sexual abuse, saying victim statements had ""impacted me to my innermost core.""  ""With that being said, I understand and acknowledge that it pales in comparison to the pain, trauma and emotions that you all are feeling,"" he said. ""It's impossible to convey the depth and breadth of how sorry I am to each and everyone involved. The visions of your testimonies will forever be present in my thoughts.""  But Judge Janice Cunningham, citing Nassar's earlier claims of no wrongdoing, sentenced him to a lengthy stay in prison and said that he was in ""denial.""  ""I am not convinced that you truly understand that what you did was wrong and the devastating impact you've had on the victims, family and friends,"" Cunningham said.  Nassar had pleaded guilty to three counts of criminal sexual conduct in Eaton County. The sentence was the third in as many months for Nassar, the once-renowned doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He admitted to using his position as a trusted doctor to sexually abuse young girls under the guise of providing medical treatment.  This Eaton County sentence will run concurrently with the 40-to-175-year sentence in Ingham County , Michigan. He will serve those sentences after a separate 60-year sentence in federal prison for child pornography , meaning Nassar will serve at least 100 years in prison -- an effective life sentence.  ""You will be left to sit there with only the memories of destroying your own family,"" Cunningham said. ""I do not believe that you will have the ability to shut out the words of the children, and the young women and the adults who trusted you and who you let down.  ""That will be your lifetime consequence.""  Powerful victim impact statements  JUST WATCHED Dad lunges at Nassar in courtroom Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Dad lunges at Nassar in courtroom 01:52  Nassar's time in court was notable for the passionate, righteous speeches from the survivors of his abuse. Nearly 200 girls and women -- ranging from accomplished Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman to a 12-year-old poet named Amanda on Friday -- spoke out in person or in statements at the Ingham County and Eaton County courts about how Nassar's sexual abuse changed their lives.  ""How much is a little girl worth?"" Rachael Denhollander, the woman who first brought Nassar's abuse to public attention in 2016, asked the court in Eaton County.  ""I am asking you to tell these little girls, tell the young women, tell the watching world, that they are worth everything,"" she told the judge.  The heated atmosphere over the past few weeks culminated Friday when Randall Margraves, a father of three victims, tried to attack Nassar in open court.  Nassar, meanwhile, mostly sat quietly, occasionally shaking his head or wiping away tears. He did not visibly react to the sentence on Monday.  That may be the last time Nassar is heard from publicly, but his impact is far from over . The stunning victim impact statements from the "" army of survivors "" have focused sharply critical attention on the systems of power that protected Nassar for so long.  Michigan State University, USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee have denied they helped cover up the abuse. Still, the organizations have seen major leadership shake-ups and face extensive legal investigations into their inner workings to find out who knew what, when they knew it and what they did about it.  ""As detectives, attorneys and survivors have previously noted, a pedophile cannot flourish in the way Larry did in an environment that is not conducive to his behavior,"" abuse survivor Annie Labrie said in court Wednesday.  ""He was prolific because surrounding authorities allowed him to be. Because the gymnastics world allowed him to be.""  How we got here  ""The tables have turned Larry,"" Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman told Nassar in Ingham County court on January 19. ""We are here. We have our voices, and we are not going anywhere.""  As recently as a few years ago, Nassar was widely respected in the gymnastics community and beyond for his treatment of injured athletes. For years, he claimed that his invasive ""pelvic floor"" treatment , in which he put his fingers into young girls' vaginas, was a cure-all that could fix any number of physical injuries.  A number of his victims said they felt violated during the procedure and complained to coaches, trainers or even police. But he was a respected doctor who treated the world's best gymnasts. Their concerns were brushed aside or otherwise dismissed, and Nassar continued to abuse his patients.  In 2014, for example, Amanda Thomashow told Michigan State Title IX investigators and MSU Police that his treatment was really sexual assault. Nassar, who told police he was known as "" the body whisperer "" for his close relationship with patients, said Thomashow simply didn't understand the procedure.  The investigation ultimately cleared him of misconduct, and Nassar returned to abusing patients.  ""I think that the way that my investigation was handled was not in a way to bring out the truth, but instead it was performed in a way to conceal and protect a pedophile,"" Thomashow said  Separately, USA Gymnastics said it became aware of Nassar's sexual abuse in the summer of 2015 when three top gymnasts said he abused them. After several weeks of its own investigation, the organization reported the allegations to the FBI in late July. Nassar was no longer allowed to treat patients at USA Gymnastics, but he continued to abuse young girls at Michigan State amid a slow FBI investigation  That abuse went on until September 2016, when The Indianapolis Star published allegations against Nassar from Denhollander and an unnamed Olympic gymnast. After that first story, more than 50 women reported similar instances of sexual abuse, and Nassar was arrested in November 2016.  The 54-year-old's life since then has been a series of guilty pleas, court hearings and prison sentences.  Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges and was sentenced to 60 years in prison in December . He pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct in Ingham County in Michigan and was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison two weeks ago.

9e1ed2ad-b75c-466f-a0e5-d055efced299,"It's been a pretty surprising last few days for fans of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, AKA Jelena. Many rooting for the on-again, off-again couple to get back together once and for all are probably just a tad bit shattered now that it's been confirmed that Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are engaged to be married after Bieber's proposal on July 7 during a trip to the Bahamas. But, while we're all over here mourning the loss of the couple that we thought would be endgame, our girl Selena is literally the epitome of the shrugged-shoulders emoji, clearly not caring as much as we all thought she would. And honestly, Selena Gomez's reaction to Justin Bieber's engagement confirmation will probably make you love her even more than you already do, if that's possible.  According to E! News, a source told the publication that, although the news of Bieber and Baldwin's engagement was unexpected, Gomez ""doesn't really care"" about her ex-boyfriend's new romance. The source said,  Selena was surprised an engagement happened this quickly but not surprised Justin would do something like this knowing who he is. At the end of the day though she doesn't really care. Selena is totally over him. She had tried again to make it work that last time and it didn't work out.  Elite Daily reached out to Gomez's team regarding the report, but has not heard back by the time of publication.  Le sigh. For everyone who knew Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's relationship, it's a bit sad to hear that these two clearly aren't getting back together, but perhaps that's for the best, considering they are in completely different phases of their lives right now.  Craig Barritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The source continued, saying, ""Selena is definitely on a different path right now and in a much better place since Justin is out of the picture. Mentally, she is done with him,"" adding that ""she isn't focused on dating as much as she's just really focusing on herself. She's happy right now just spending time with her girlfriends and going to church.""  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  A second source also noted that Gomez is putting her relationship with her ex-boyfriend ""in the past,"" adding that while she's ""very shocked"" to hear about Bieber's whirlwind engagement, she simply ""doesn't care.""  Yasss, girl!  ""Selena knows that Justin makes rash decisions, but wishes them both the best. She is truly focused on herself and Justin is no longer a topic of conversation in her life,"" the second source told E! News.  Sorry, Justin. Looks like our girl is just as over you as you are with her.  On July 10, just days after Bieber's engagement was confirmed, Gomez was seen in New York City wearing gray sweatpants and a black T-shirt that said, ""only the strong survive,"" and let me tell you, it is a mood and I am feeling it. While some might say that this is her way of telling the world that she's a fierce warrior in the midst of all the engagement hubbub, let's be honest: we already knew that.  And, considering that we saw her without a care in the world shortly after the news of the engagement actually broke, methinks that she's doing juuuust fine.  On Sunday, July 8, Gomez's friend and assistant, Theresa Mingus, posted a photo to Instagram showing herself and Gomez hanging out on a yacht, looking like they were living their best life (because spoiler alert: if you're on a yacht, you are UNDOUBTEDLY doing just that):  So c'mon, fam. It looks like Bieber's quite smitten with Baldwin, and Gomez is living it up with friends and enjoying being single, so I think it's time we give Jelena a rest and set our sights on Jailey.  Maybe it's not what we anticipated the outcome would be for this love triangle, but let's work with what we've got and be happy that everyone involved is happy — or seems to be, at the very least.

(Buchanan County Sheriff via AP)  Iowa farmer Chris Soules, a former star on ABC’s “The Bachelor” who charmed reality TV viewers with his small-town life, was arrested this week after police said he fled a crash that killed a fellow farmer.  Soules, 35, was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal crash, a class D felony, and could face up to five years in prison if he is convicted.  The case has garnered the attention of Soules’s “Bachelor” fans as well as residents of Arlington, Iowa, where he lives, who had come to appreciate the reality TV star’s work as an unofficial Iowa ambassador and farm industry advocate.  “This story is going to spread like wildfire around here and probably all over because of who he is,” Mary Jo Brown, Arlington’s city clerk, told the Des Moines Register. “Sometimes fame isn’t your friend.”  Soules, who also appeared in “Dancing with the Stars” and “Worst Chefs in America,” called 911 at 8:20 p.m. Monday evening to report that he had rear-ended a tractor on a rural road north of the tiny town of Aurora, about six miles away from his home.  The tractor veered into a ditch after being struck by his 2008 Chevrolet Silverado, Soules said.  The tractor driver — later identified as 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher, a Vietnam War veteran — was unconscious and not breathing, Soules told the 911 operator, according to audio obtained by local media. The man had a pulse, but there was blood around his mouth, Soules said.  Soules identified himself on the call, which lasted nearly six minutes, and sounded frantic. Between heavy breathing, he answered the dispatcher’s questions and took instructions. Soules told the 911 operator he did not know how to perform CPR and could be heard asking unidentified people at the scene if they could perform the lifesaving measure.  The call ended abruptly after the operator told Soules law enforcement and medical first responders were on the way.  “Can I, can I call you back really quick?” Soules asked the dispatcher.  “Yeah, you can call me back,” she says.  “Thank you,” Soules responds.  Soules left the crash site after emergency responders arrived, but before deputies with the Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office were on the scene, according to authorities. Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright told the Des Moines Register that Soules fled the scene on foot and later got into a truck. In police audio obtained by local media, a deputy told a dispatcher that Soules “took off” in a red truck.  Authorities are trying to identify who picked up Soules in the truck, Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram told the Associated Press. That person could face charges, he said.  Alcohol was found at the scene and investigators are trying to determine whose it was and whether it or speed were factors in the crash.  Soules was arrested about five hours after the incident and booked into the Buchanan County Jail, the Associated Press reported. He posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday morning and was released on the condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic monitor.  During his first appearance in court, the Buchanan County assistant attorney told the judge that Soules refused to cooperate with law enforcement after they located him at his home. He “would not come out,” the attorney said, until officials obtained a search warrant, which “took hours.”  Chris Soules making his initial court appearance in Buchanan County @KWWL pic.twitter.com/72bvEg0wVR — Elizabeth Amanieh (@EAmaniehKWWL) April 25, 2017  Wolfgram told the Associated Press that investigators were “running into some roadblocks when it comes to getting information” but acknowledged Soules was acting within his constitutional rights.  According to court documents, Soules had several run-ins with the law in his early 20s. In 2011, he was charged three times with underage alcohol possession and pleaded guilty and paid a fine for an open container violation, reported the Des Moines Register.  The following year, he received three citations for fighting and noise, unlawful use of a license and leaving the scene, which was amended down to defective brakes, court documents showed.  Then in 2005, Soules was charged with driving while intoxicated and received one year of probation.  A statement from Soules’s publicist earlier this week said he was “devastated” to learn that Mosher had died from the crash and that his “thoughts and prayers” were with the man’s family.  Mosher, a lifelong resident of Aurora — population 200 — lived on his family farm near the crash site, reported the Argus Leader. He was married to his high school sweetheart, Nancy, and the couple had two sons and three grandchildren, according to Mosher’s obituary.  An Army veteran, Mosher served six years, including a tour in Vietnam. He farmed his entire life and was a member of the Aurora American Legion and the Iowa Corn Growers Association.  “Kenny loved playing golf, farming and spending his winters in Florida biking and visiting his mother,” Mosher’s obituary said. “His family was most important to him, especially his grandchildren.”  In northeast Iowa, where Mosher and Soules both farmed, community members told local media they were heartbroken for the families of both men.    Chris Soules and Whitney Bischoff during the finale of “The Bachelor.” (ABC via AP)  Soules’s three sisters signed him up to be a suitor on “The Bachelorette” in 2014. He was a fan favorite, making it to the final three before bachelorette Andi Dorfman sent him home. Soules — nicknamed “Farmer Chris” — later returned as the star of his own season. He proposed to Whitney Bischoff, a contestant from Chicago, but the two split after a brief engagement.  He later competed on “Dancing with the Stars” and the Food Network’s “Worst Chefs in America.” Soules has since made guest appearances on various “Bachelor” franchise spin-offs shows and was rumored to be a cast member for this summer’s taping of “Bachelor in Paradise,” where former contestants search for love on a tropical island.  Soules had used his reality TV platform to travel Iowa and the Midwest advocating for agricultural issues, including ethanol and renewable fuels.

Currently, Kevin Hart, Sandra Bullock, the Kardashians, Leonardo DiCaprio, Dwayne Johnson and Jamie Foxx are just a few of the celebrities who have donated to various Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. Now, Jamie Foxx is set to head a star-studded telethon to raise even more money to aid Houston citizens to rebuild their lives.  As reported by Entertainment Tonight, Texas native Jamie Foxx recently announced that he will host a telethon to raise money for Houston’s Hurricane Harvey relief and many of his celebrity friends will join in to help as well. Scheduled for September 12, the telethon will feature celebrities hosting from different cities, including Los Angeles, Nashville and New York.  Via Entertainment Tonight:  The Sept. 12 telethon will be aired by all the major networks for one hour. The star-studded event is reportedly being organized by rapper Bun B and the same team behind the widely praised Ariana Grande One Love Manchester concert.  Reese Witherspoon and Blake Shelton will reportedly host from Nashville on Sept. 12, while the Los Angeles portion will be hosted by Jamie Foxx and tentatively Hilary Duff, who was born in Houston. Duff Instagrammed about Hurricane Harvey on Monday, writing, “This is beyond devastating. Truly heartbroken for my home town. #staystrong #deepintheheart.”  Fellow Houston native Michael Strahan is being tapped to host the New York portion of the telethon, and organizers are also hoping to secure Kelly Rowland as well as ‘Big Bang Theory’ star Jim Parsons — both born and raised in Houston as well.  Jamie Foxx, who donated $25,000 to GlobalGiving, a non-profit organization that provides a global crowdfunding platform for grassroots charitable projects, commented on the upcoming telethon in an Instagram video, stating:  “Just wanted to let everyone in Texas know, we got you. From a fellow Texan, my heart goes out. My prayers go out. September 12th, we have a telethon that we’re doing.

Regardless of what the rest of the world wants, Tish thinks Miley has plenty of time before she even has to start thinking of marriage.  But don’t get her wrong. Tish totally supports her daughter’s relationship.  She even gave us their relationship update!  Tish Cyrus spoke with Mario Lopez on his radio show on Wednesday, and revealed that Miley and Liam are stronger than ever. But, wedding bells are not in their immediate future.  ""She is not eloping. She is not getting married. They are so freaking happy and living in Malibu,""  Honestly, what else would we want for the power couple that is giving us ultimate #RelationshipGoals?  It seems like Miley and Tish are in agreement about not rushing into a legal binding marriage.  “She’s so happy, and she’s always like, ‘I don’t know why everybody wants us to get married. It’s so perfect.'” You know what they say — if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.  Regardless — we’re sure shippers will still freak out whenever they see Miley wearing white. Like that one time Miley’s dad Billy Ray Cyrus posted a photo of his daughter wearing white with the caption, “I’m so happy…you are happy @mileycyrus.” Everyone was convinced Billy Ray just witnessed his daughter get married, but that was soo not the case.  Miley’s dad later had to clarify that Miley was NOT getting married, and that he simply was just stating that he’s happy for her. Because, ya know, women can look happy in white dresses without having to get married. Miley is probably enjoying her successful career as a musician — and as she should, girl hustles and works hard.  As long as Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are happy together, how “official” their relationship is shouldn’t matter. We’re just glad to see those two kids back in each other’s lives.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,508
7a095feb-6b91-47ed-9628-26636f624680,"LOS ANGELES—(Spoiler alert: This column has spoilers about the movie, “Interstellar.”) Why was Matt Damon’s casting in “Interstellar” kept under wraps until recently? This question and more were answered by spouses Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, director and producer, respectively, of the sci-fi/adventure/drama.  “Interstellar,” written by Chris and his brother Jonah, follows a team of explorers as they travel beyond the galaxy to find another home for humankind since Earth is nearing its end.  While “Interstellar” features some stunning visual images of the voyage, the film succeeds more when it delves into relationships through a family, that of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), an experienced pilot, and his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet).  ADVERTISEMENT  Jessica Chastain and Ellen Burstyn portray Murph at various ages while Casey Affleck plays the older Tom. Anne Hathaway, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, John Lithgow and Topher Grace round out the cast.  Excerpts from our interview:  Why did you keep Matt Damon’s casting a secret?  Chris Nolan (C): I imagined Doctor Mann a bit like from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness.” You have Kurtz, this character that you hear about. Everybody says, “Oh, he’s great. Maybe you’ll get to meet him.” I really love the idea for an audience to go, when they see him, “Oh, it’s Matt Damon. It’s going to be okay.”  Matt very graciously agreed to do it. He didn’t have to shoot for long. So we didn’t want to market the film using him because he’s not in it very much. We didn’t want to mislead people. But Matt is a very important part of the movie. It’s fun to watch with an audience who doesn’t know because they haven’t heard about it.  Matt has the most amazing ability to project integrity and warmth. So he turns up in the film and he’s got a plan and it’s all going to be okay. For me, to realize that he’s a frail human being and subject to cowardice and all the terrible weaknesses that we all have… he loved that challenge. I loved what he did with it.  Emma Thomas (E): If people get to watch the film twice, it’s so great watching Matt when you know what’s really going on.  C: When people see Matt’s face, they are like, oh, okay. It’s the lift that the movie needs at that point. Structurally, you have a lot of talk in the 20 minutes before. There’s a lot of negativity, a lot bad things happening. The film is very much going to a dark place at that point. So getting that lift in that way with a great actor and movie star coming on screen, is a good thing.  ADVERTISEMENT  How has the dynamics between the two of you evolved over the years?  E: (Laughs.) We love working together— obviously, with Jonah as well—in a large part because, when you are working with somebody whom you are tied to beyond by blood or marriage, there’s a lack of agenda. Or as Chris once said, I (Emma) have an agenda. He knows what it is. (Laughs.)  But there’s a level of trust that is fantastic, particularly when you are making a big movie like this one. I am often asked as a producer and when Chris is the director, “When do you tell Chris, no, he can’t have that?” The truth is, I am very lucky because Chris is also a producer. He takes every aspect of the filmmaking process very seriously.  He is very helpful in terms of trying to figure out how we make the film for the correct budget, and so on. To me, it’s never absolutely saying no. I tell Chris [how I feel about] certain things. We have discussions. But ultimately, it’s Chris’ vision. He always has a very strong idea of what a film is going to be. He’s the director and it’s very much his film.  I see my job as being very much a facilitator for that, filtering out the things that he doesn’t have to worry about so he can concentrate on getting the film made.  C: It’s fantastic working with people you have worked with a long time and have a high degree of trust in. Emma is always very objective, which is great… I consider Emma a very good gauge (from a moviegoer perspective) because she’s not particularly interested in science-fiction or science. (Laughs.)  I show her the film and ask, “Are you following the emotional threads?” What’s wonderful about working with someone like Emma is that I get an honest opinion, good or bad, instantly. There are no politics to it.  This film’s working title or code name was “Flora’s Letter,” a cinematic letter to your daughter. How is your relationship with your kids reflected in the story?  C: The relationship between a father and his children was clearly something I related to very strongly in the script. Murph was originally written as a boy in my brother’s draft. I changed the character to a girl—just instinctively. It may well be because Flora, my eldest, is a girl.  You do have different relationships with sons and daughters. It really paid off with Matthew because what he was very determined about was that his character’s love for his children should be equal for both. The character having a girl and a boy took the burden off the idea of favoritism. It’s not that he loves Murph more than he loves Tom. There’s just a different relationship. And Murph is more interested in science and the things that have driven her father’s life.  E: Girls are much more complicated, I feel. And boys are rather…  C: Simple.  E: I wouldn’t say simple.  C: That’s what you were thinking, though.  E: It’s complicated. It’s one of my favorite things about the film. I almost don’t think of it as a big, spectacular space movie. I really love the relationships. They feel very real to me as the mother of a girl and boys.  When I watch Mackenzie’s performance, she feels incredibly real to me. I [see] my own daughter in her. Going back to the code name question, I will just say that we have always had code names for our films—our kids’ names. It was just Flora’s turn (laughs).  What are the kids’ ages?  E: Now that’s a difficult question (laughs). They are 12, 11, 9 and 7. Flora is the oldest.  Emma, you were quoted as saying that Chris could not have done this film 12 years ago when you didn’t have kids. Can you both talk about that?  E: I am not saying that Chris couldn’t have made this film 12 years ago. But there’s such a heart, such a reality to the relationships in the movie. The reason we pick a movie to make—because it’s a long process—is that you have to feel an affinity for the story. You have to want to put that story up on the screen.  The place that Chris and I are in now is very different from where we were 12 years ago. This is a story that we are interested in telling. It’s also a movie that is fun to watch with our kids. We watch different movies now than we did 12 years ago because the kids came along.  C: The simple answer is, I don’t know if I couldn’t [have done this movie 12 years ago], but I wouldn’t have and I didn’t. Becoming a father was a very big change in my life, something that affected my outlook and the kind of stories that I am interested in telling and in ways that I would have never been able to predict and not in simple ways.  We did a press conference yesterday and Matthew was asked about being a father. He said he could have played the part even before he had kids. What I didn’t say to him because I didn’t want to embarrass him—but I am going to embarrass him now—is that I would have found it very difficult to cast someone who wasn’t a father. Matthew was absolutely the right person to play the role. He’s a terrific father.  Why did you choose a Dylan Thomas poem to use in the film?  C: Those lines at the end—“Do not go gentle into that good night… Rage, rage against the dying of the light”—I have [not] heard a better way of expressing the sentiment of death, dying, the end of the world, any of those things. There’s such a raw emotion in those words; they speak to me so strongly. I didn’t want to write my own version of that. Another example, which I didn’t use, would be of TS Elliot saying, “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.”  (E-mail the columnist at rvnepales_5585@yahoo.com.

2d33883f-3798-4a9c-a260-5fe04b05c7b2,"Pop star David Cassidy has been hospitalized in Florida and is suffering from organ failure, according to his publicist.  The 67-year-old David Cassidy has previously admitted he was stricken with dementia, but now his liver and kidneys are failing, according to his publicist, JoAnn Geffen. She confirmed his hospitalization, noting, “he is now conscious and surrounded by family.”  Reports indicate Cassidy has been hospitalized for three days and is in critical condition. He has been in declining health for a while and has been open about his prior financial and health problems.  Cassidy, the star of The Partridge Family television show, last performed in March at the B.B. King Blues Club & Grill in New York.  The singer is suffering from kidney failure and needs a liver transplant, according to at least one report. Cassidy’s health has been in decline for more than two months, and his family has been told to prepare for the worst.  Cassidy revealed his dementia diagnosis earlier this year. He has also been open about his struggles with alcohol and drug addition.  In February, he was a guest on the Dr. Phil show, and talked about falling on stage and forgetting the lyrics to one of his songs during an Agoura Hills, Calif. performance.  “When friends of yours or family members begin to say to you, ‘Remember, I just told you this two days ago,’ and there’s no memory of it, that’s when I began to be very concerned,” he said on the show.  Cassidy was arrested for three DUIs since 2010. A judge ordered him to rehab in 2014.  Cassidy, who comes from a show business family (father Jack Cassidy was an actor, and stepmother Shirley Jones starred with him on The Partridge Family), skyrocketed to fame for his role as Keith Partridge on the 1970s sitcom The Partridge Family, which aired from 1970-1974. He became a teen idol, fueling his fame with such heart-throb pop hits as I Think I Love You.  After that hit, Cassidy strove to become respected as a musician, and managed to produce the hit Cherish, which reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the UK pop charts. He went on to produce five solo albums during the series run, as well as ten credited to The Partridge Family, most of them million-sellers. Cassidy was also a major concert attraction, playing stadiums and arena-sized shows.  Cassidy struggled with his image as a frothy pop star, coming to grips with it and embracing it later in life. However, as he matured and his past glories faded, the ensuing years were not kind financially. The former star declared bankruptcy in 2015, blaming diminishing royalty checks for The Partridge Family, health issues that prevented him from touring, and bad investments.  The bankruptcy documents claimed: “While he still loves performing for his fans, it is more difficult to travel and perform in various parts of the United States or worldwide due to his health.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,572
a102b02d-5d06-43be-91ab-e9a888c262e9,"It's been over 10 years since Miley Cyrus debuted as her beloved Disney Channel character Hannah Montana and became a worldwide sensation at just 13 years old. Now, the singer is reflecting on her time on the show, and the lasting impact her childhood stardom has had on her.  “I liked being in the Disney universe ’cause I didn’t know anything else,"" she tells correspondent Anthony Mason in a new interview with CBS Sunday Morning. ""I knew I was getting to live what I wanted to do. I think now that I’m older now, I realize that’s a lot to put on a kid.”  That pressure weighed on Cyrus, who felt like she struggled to balance being a young person and a professional all at once.  “It’s a lot to put on a kid to have them have to get their makeup done and then also balance school and then also have me dress up in a wig. It’s a little Toddlers and Tiaras,"" she says.  READ: Miley Cyrus Finally Feels Like She Has 'Respect': 'I Proved What I Wanted to Do'  But, her memories of her Hannah Montana days aren't all negative.  ""I definitely look back on it as a good time,"" she muses. ""I think what was hard for me was balancing everything. I think it got harder when I started touring as both -- I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself.”  She also jokes that juggling the dueling Hannah/Miley personalities may have impacted her as an adult.  ""I think that’s probably what’s a little bit wrong with me now!” she laughs. “I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.”  WATCH: Miley Cyrus Shine in Her Duet With Dad Billy Ray on Beautiful Tom Petty Cover!  Still, Hannah is a character that Cyrus still embraces and appreciates for the message it offered her young fans.  ""I loved being that character,"" she admits. ""And honestly, music is everything and all people wanna have is great music and for that audience, for what that was, that was great music for kids to listen to. There’s a song called ‘Life’s What You Make it, so Let’s Make it Rock.’ Never forget that -- wise words. That’s a good thing to tell kids.""

0549e395-baef-44b3-a2ce-db31257ee74e,"Mike Tyson is currently testing out his one man live show in Las Vegas called Undisputed Truth 2 to small crowds, since Las Vegas is apparently pretty quiet right now. It doesn’t have anything to do with Tyson, but it may have something to do with that horrendous mass shooting at the Mandalay Bay earlier this year, which has seemingly gone through a massive media cover up, with no CCTV footage being released, along with the other major inconsistencies in the story. As a result, people just aren’t going to Las Vegas so much anymore. Anyway, moving back onto the story at hand.  During Mike Tyson’s stand up performance, he said something which many people believe to be alarmingly true: “Hillary is America’s most prolific serial killer – bar none.”  Tyson continued: “Manson family ain’t nothing compared to the Clinton family. Ted Bundy? John Wayne Gacy? Please… that’s kiddie stuff.” pointing out that the Manson family had killed five people, and that Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacy had killed 35 and 33 people respectively in their sickening killing sprees. Apparently this is a number that pales in comparison to the body count created by Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.  “She murdered her very good friend Mr. Vince Foster. She deliberately on purpose let Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans die in Benghazi. Do you know how many of her personal bodyguards have died deaths of a premature nature?”  “Twelve. Twelve young men in close proximity to the Clinton’s have died premature. This information is all out there. You can look this up yourself. All of these bodyguards are indeed dead and it might all just be a tragic coincidence. Now I don’t know about you but I wouldn’t want to be on their list of associates.”  Mike Tyson encouraged members of the audience to Google the Clinton body count, with the term “strange deaths surrounding the Clinton’s” and see what they could find. Tyson elaborated further in his set, “People in a hundred years from now going to look back at us and scratch their heads saying ‘Uhh really guys? Really? You couldn’t see what was right before your eyes?'”  Indeed, Mike Tyson is pointing out the obvious right now (which really needs to be heard), and with any luck, perhaps this Clinton bit is going to be part of his Undisputed Truth 2 tour, which will continue in Honolulu on January 20th, 2018.  “How many more witnesses do we need to commit suicide by two bullets to the back of the head just before they about to testify against the Clinton’s before we start to say ‘Hey, something here sure smells fishy?'”  Mike Tyson lamented that for power and for hushing up anyone in her way, Hillary Clinton has been able to carry on her killing spree unchallenged, which by his account, that definitely makes her America’s most prolific serial killer. One day, hopefully there will be crime investigation documentaries and National Geographic films about the many mysterious deaths engulfing the Clinton family, because it’s clear that she’s getting away with murder.  Tyson finalised on this point: “Sad but true thing is we will never get justice for her. We the people will never see justice served. She’s above the law of the land.”  This is why people love Mike Tyson, aside from him being the most prolific knock out artist that the world has even seen in the sport of boxing. In case it wasn’t clear enough, he also supports Donald Trump, which is a greatly logical thing to do in these seriously crazy times. In saying that, Mike Tyson did leave a lot of names out of the Clinton serial killing spree, but with a bit of research, we are sure you’ll find some further suspicious links yourself. As we all know, DNC staffer Seth Rich was shot in the back outside a bar, and John F. Kennedy Jr’s suspicious plane crash death could possibly also be added to that list.  That brings us to this most recent and mysterious suicide case. It’s claimed that a prominent surgeon from New York, Dr. Dean Lorich, killed himself by stabbing himself in the chest, although missing his own heart in the process. That alone would make some people suspicious. What’s more revealing is that Dr. Dean Lorich had an association with the Clinton Foundation down in Haiti.  Don’t believe us? Just look into this new story a bit further, then tell us how this isn’t another suspicious suicide from someone associated with the Clinton’s. Read the recent Dr. Dean Lorich story here for more information about his link to the Clinton Foundation down in Haiti. Maybe the Clinton’s just have that lethal depressive effect on people?

fac2e4e8-cc77-4c24-9976-531da30ba07e,"Residents negotiate a flooded road after waters breached the Swar Chaung dam  A major effort was under way to reach thousands of people trapped in their homes after a dam swollen by monsoon rain overflowed early Wednesday in central Myanmar, officials said.  A surge of water inundated the rural flatland in Bago region after the Swar Chaung dam spillway, which regulates the release of water, collapsed due to heavy seasonal rain.  AFP reporters travelling with a rescue boat described how some people waded out through chest-deep water to get to higher ground while others crammed onto trucks and tractors to reach safety.  Many others remained trapped in their half-submerged homes as soldiers, police, firefighters and volunteers worked into the night to try to ferry residents out.  Khin Myint, 45, told AFP of the terrifying moment when the wave of water hit.  ""The water came so fast into our village and we didn´t have time to run,"" she said, adding that she and her family were unable to escape from the upstairs of their house because her elderly father was sick.  No casualties have yet been reported but more than 12,600 people have taken shelter in about 30 temporary camps, Ministry of Social Welfare director Phyu Lae Lae Tun said.  ""There are more than 14,000 households and some 63,000 people affected by the waters,"" she said.  The torrent also fractured part of a bridge on the Yangon-Mandalay highway linking Myanmar's two biggest cities.  Deputy Minister for Construction Kyaw Linn told reporters the bridge's supporting towers were sinking.  A section of a bridge damaged by rampaging flood waters  ""We will get divers to go down and check after the water levels recede,"" he said.  Army chief Min Aung Hlaing, under mounting international pressure to face international justice following a damning UN report this week on the Rohingya crisis, was quick to arrive at the scene on Wednesday morning.  ""We have to work together,"" he said. ""The spillway will not be able to be controlled until the water flow stops.""  The deluge comes just weeks after heavy monsoon rains pummelled Myanmar, causing widespread flash floods that forced some 150,000 people to flee their homes.  Southeast Asia's annual monsoon season runs from around June to November.  Regional neighbour Laos was hit badly last month when heavy rainfall caused the collapse of a dam. At least 35 people were killed, scores went missing and thousands more languished in shelters.

e07f05a6-d85e-4e19-bc89-c134d2b4f07b,"Meghan Markle: Six reasons why she divides people — even Americans  Updated  If you thought every American would be celebrating the prospect of a Yankee taking up residence in the Royal household, you'd be mistaken.  As Prince Harry and Meghan prepared to wed, there had been an astounding level of venom aimed at both of them, on both sides of the Atlantic.  Far from being the happy, feathery event that certainly Kensington Palace and television networks hoped for, the wedding has unpacked layers of discontent among the Queen's subjects and her former subjects alike.  As Tom Wells of The Sun put it on Twitter: ""This has to be the worst build-up to a Royal wedding since Henry VIII last went down on one knee.""  The anti-Meghan outcry has caused no level of surprise and consternation at news outlets and websites that follow the Royals, and even those that marginally mention the Royal couple.  While they value the traffic the pair have brought in, digital editors have discovered they can't leave their comments sections unchecked, or else the nastiness takes hold.  ""The most surprising thing about covering Meghan's fashion isn't the fashion at all,"" says Susan Kelley, who created What Kate Wore, the popular site tracking the Duchess of Cambridge's style, and also oversees What Meghan Wore, which features attire and activities.  ""It's been the level of animosity directed at her and the number of comments on the site and on Facebook that couldn't be published because of the tone or language.""  Even a food writer friend who posted an innocuous ""where to watch the nuptials"" post this week was blindsided by attacks on Meghan.  She is already the most controversial British Royal bride since Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, who many people will never embrace because she succeeded Diana, Princess of Wales.  Meghan readily brings to mind the uproar over Wallis Simpson, the twice-divorced American for whom Edward VIII gave up the throne.  In retrospect, those women had it much, much easier than Meghan. In watching the Royal drama for the better part of 18 months, I've come up with a list of six objections to her marriage, led by the big one they never had to address.  1. She's bi-racial  The first, and unmistakable overtone in every conversation about her is racism. Meghan is bi-racial, and identifies herself as such. Her mother Doria is African-American. Her father Thomas is white.  This is far from unusual in public life. President Barack Obama was bi-racial, with a white mother and black father, although he identified as black.  Academy Award winning actress Halle Berry is bi-racial. Canadian rapper Drake is bi-racial. So is football star Colin Kaepernick.  Although intermarriage was outlawed in many parts of the US during the first two-thirds of the 20th century, Americans who grew up in the 1970s and after are likely to know mixed-race couples, and socialise and go to school with bi-racial kids.  For a lot of people, especially in major urban and college cities, Meghan's background would only bring on a shrug.  But, there is an old American saying that one drop of blood makes you black, and, in some of the most bigoted commenters' eyes, makes you unfit to be a princess of the United Kingdom.  Says Kelley: ""I never expected to see the sort of negative, derogatory and outright racist comments we have encountered in writing about Meghan's style.""  This is even true when What Kate Wore runs a photo of the Duchess and Meghan at the same event, Kelley says.  Kensington Palace tried to attack this head on when Harry and Meghan were first dating in 2016. In an unprecedented statement, the Palace said: ""His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public — the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.""  Said the Palace: ""This is not a game — it is her life, and his.""  That did little to stop the racist comments, and now Harry and Meghan face a future in which this is a day to day part of their lives.  If you think it will die down, just look at any internet post that is at all flattering to Camilla. The Diana fans are out in constant force.  2. She's divorced  But racism isn't the only thing that Meghan deals with.  The second most-frequently heard objection is that she is divorced, while Harry has never married.  The critics are conveniently forgetting that Princes Charles and Andrew are also divorced, as is Princess Anne. American first marriages still fail at a rate of 40 per cent to 50 per cent, although the British divorce rate has been dropping.  3. Unbelievably, her fashion  Commenters also have taken Meghan apart for her hairstyle, and fashionably loose-fitting clothing. It doesn't help that she's far more fashion forward than Kate, whose pristine public style often seems to have been voted on by a committee.  4. She 'dumped' her rescue dog  Fourth is an objection from animal lovers, who bemoan the fact that she left one of her aged rescue dogs behind when she moved to London from Toronto.  5. She's American  I'm putting her American nationality at fifth, although you might argue that it should rank higher. Lots of us thought that the Royal wedding might cement and repair the ""special relationship"" between the US and Britain — our best for their best.  But that theory seems as much in tatters as the current political climate. Apparently, Harry was supposed to pick a red, white and blue bride echoing the British flag, not ours.  I've seen Facebook comments from my own American friends asking, ""Why isn't Harry marrying a British girl?""  There is plenty of sniping as well from British ex-pats who predict the marriage won't make it past five years, and accuse Meghan of being a gold digger.  6. She's a TV actress  That final critique applies to Meghan's choice of an acting career. To be honest, I've never watched Suits, save for a glimpse at an episode or two to see what she did on the show.  In an era when quality television programs have swept over the networks, cable television and streaming services, Suits remains a guilty pleasure for its viewers and a skippable one for the rest of us.  Meghan might be a talented actress, with university degrees in drama and international affairs, but she's never been showcased in the kind of TV that scoops up Emmy Awards and BAFTAs.  Would it make people feel better if Harry was instead marrying one of the better young actresses of our time, such as Emma Stone, Saoirse Ronan or Margot Robbie? Possibly.  It hasn't gone unremarked that Meghan seems all too willing to ditch her acting career for activism. She won't be like Princess Grace, who fended off many efforts to entice her back to film. For Meghan, been there, done that, now on to charity work.  But a slightly better professional resume might have quieted some of the haters. If you take all the complaints together, it adds up to one angry beehive. Says Kelley:  ""The volume of comments that couldn't be published on the blogs or that had to be deleted on the respective Facebook pages is far beyond anything I anticipated.""  All these reasons might not matter a whit historically. Thanks to the birth of Kate and Williams' children, Harry is way down in the line of succession, so there's only a miniscule chance of a King Harry and Queen Meghan.  Thus far, the pair have managed to smile their way through every crisis that takes place, including whether Meghan's father, sadly in poor health, will walk her down the aisle.  But Meghan has married her prince at a time when the world is divided about almost everything, including her.  Unwittingly, that makes her the perfect Royal bride for our times.

Their observations ranged from “swanky” to “stifled”; one critic noted, “I was surprised to discover that the bathtub was a bathtub; I thought it was an ashtray.” Here are our favorite gems (and yes, the Chanel No. 5 ad was referenced):  1. “The shiny metal surprised me specifically; the mod Trumpian swankiness, in general.”  2. “These pieces are too nice; I do not hear Mr. Pitt’s voice unleashed with full authority.”  3. “Mr. Pitt, you are a great actor. Stay that person, with all of his confidence and drive and risk-taking, when designing. These first pieces are audition monologues; you already have the part.”  4. “[A piece I would want in my home is] possibly the oval table — in the guest room of a second home, if I owned a second home.”  5. “I’m not convinced after seeing three table designs (and a bathtub that reminds me of an ashtray) that Brad Pitt should quit his day job to be in the furniture or product design game. Unless that means I can be an actor for a day and get paid $7 million to star in a Chanel No. 5 perfume ad.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,283

9098d4f4-73f3-4aff-8697-e0be6166c950,"In case you didn’t know, John Stamos (of Full House fame) and his new wife Caitlin McHugh are really, really obsessed with all things Disney.  In fact, the pair, who had been dating for two years, got engaged at Disneyland in October. There, Stamos staged an elaborate engagement event for his then-girlfriend, including a short compilation of their favorite Disney films. It all ended with ""The Little Mermaid"" and the caption “just ask the girl.” Of course, Stamos did. On Instagram McHugh posted, “I kissed the boy and said . . . yes!”  “She loves Disneyland and [at the park], I got on my knee and asked her,” Stamos told PEOPLE of their engagement. “I pulled the ring out. I don’t know how she did it, but she went to hug me and slipped her finger right in it. When the park closed, we ran around the park in our Disney onesies.”  Since that day the two went on to get hitched in a gorgeous ceremony at the Little Brown Church in Studio City, California, then partied the night away at their home.  Now, just a week into their marriage, they are celebrating again at the Happiest Place on Earth.  As McHugh’s Instagram shows, the pair has been spending plenty of time at Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida. While there they’ve even been spotted wearing matching mouse ears, though hers were a bit more spectacular as they came with a bridal veil.  McHugh shared even more of their journey through the park, where they stopped in at shops to look at tiny baby trinkets since they are expecting their first child this spring.  On his page Stamos shared his own adorable image of the pair as they smooched near the castle joking of their one-week anniversary, “and they said it wouldn’t last.”  While this may be their last trip to the park before the baby’s arrival, odds are their upcoming bundle of joy will be a Disney baby, whether he or she likes it or not.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,404

d07aa3d6-00dd-4da7-9598-a3b6d7f40a11,"The concert, part of “The Joshua Tree Tour,” was slated to take place at The Dome at America’s Center. But this morning, the band and the concert promoter “regrettably” released a joint statement saying, “We have been informed by the St. Louis Police Department that they are not in a position to provide the standard protection for our audience as would be expected for an event of this size. We have also been informed that local crowd security personnel would not be at full capacity. In light of this information, we cannot in good conscience risk our fans’ safety by proceeding with tonight’s concert. As much as we regret having to cancel, we feel it is the only acceptable course of action in the current environment.”  Fans are reacting after U2 canceled its St. Louis concert amid protests in the city. On Friday, activists began demonstrating after Jason Stockley, a white police officer, was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of Anthony Lamar Smith, who is black. While people are protesting both the verdict and police use of deadly force, cops are on the streets monitoring the demonstrations. Consequently, U2 and Live Nation says there is not enough security to hold their Saturday night show as scheduled.  {""position1"": {""artist"": {""bio"": """", ""id"": 970, ""name"": ""U2""}, ""catalog_type"": ""artist"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 970, ""name"": ""U2"", ""related"": [{""bio"": """", ""id"": 1648, ""name"": ""Coldplay""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 26291, ""name"": ""Simple Minds""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 4829, ""name"": ""INXS""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 39703, ""name"": ""The Cranberries""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 6765, ""name"": ""Pearl Jam""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 4688, ""name"": ""The Police""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 32153, ""name"": ""The Cure""}], ""tagged"": false, ""type"": ""catalog""}}  Nothing was said about rescheduling the show, and fans will be able to get refunds. The protests, which are ongoing, have so far led to more than 20 arrests, and 10 police officers were reportedly injured on Friday night, though many, of course, are also demonstrating peacefully. And on Twitter, a number of people are sounding off on the decision to cancel the concert. A user with the handle @DrunkRedbirdFan, for instance, posted, “U2 canceling? They could have used the platform to bring unity and hope to a city and country that needs it. #U2 #STLVerdict.”  @Mina_UK said, “Bono’s a social activist. I hope @U2 comes out to support those in the STL community hurting from the decision. #onelove #carryeachother.” @yrofcreation posted, “U2 concert canceled in #STL tonight. The #STLVerdict just got real for a bunch of white people. #Stockley #resist.” @charlesjaco1 observed, “U2 cancels tonight’s St Louis concert b/c not enough cops to provide proper security. The same cops whose actions sparked the protests.”  @RachWhittBarnes tweeted to the group, “@U2 Since you’re free tonight, I hope you’ll join in the protest at 5pm downtown. I’m sad to miss a show, but this is more important.” @isk9 argued, “People in St. Louis are b**ching because U2 canceled their show tonight? Get over yourselves, a cop got away with murder. Be pissed at that.” Still, others were dealing with logistical issues. @sparks4kids told the band, “We never received an email from Ticketmaster saying show was canceled but did receive an email about which entrance to use. #u2Stlouis.” @atu2comSherry also pointed out, “@Ticketmaster needs to catch up w/U2’s cancellation announcement – it seems tix holders haven’t been directly notified.”  “Feel just awful for all the #u2fam missing out on the gig In StLouis. Especially ones that this was only show. But #u2 had no choice,” commented @thedoorsdf71. @MeganClontz17 shared, “Sorry that this had to happen for those of you planning on going. I was gonna see @HunterHayes in 2014 but he canceled because of Ferguson.” And @theHorizon74 stated, “I understand the decision totally! I’m so sorry for all the fans….but safety first! Be careful.” U2 is pictured above at a Detroit concert earlier this month.  See the tweets below.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,972

But since their split, Jolie and the kids have remained in L.A. “Angie is frustrated that Los Angeles has become the home base for the family,” the source says. “Yes, she does travel, but she misses the nomadic lifestyle of moving around every three or four months. It’s best for the kids that they aren’t moving around all the time. Angie has a restless spirit and would have continued to roam around the world with the kids if the divorce hadn’t occurred. Brad insisted that the kids have stability and wanted them to stop moving around.”  Jolie opened up about raising her kids as a single mother in a September 2017 interview with the Sunday Telegraph. “It’s been difficult. I don’t enjoy being single,” the First They Killed My Father director admitted. “It’s not something I wanted. There’s nothing nice about it. It’s just hard.”  Although Jolie puts on a brave face for the cameras, she quietly battles her emotions. “Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it together, but really, I am just trying to get through my days,” she disclosed. “Emotionally, it’s been a very difficult year.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,473

51f1c456-1cf2-4f19-be00-c8dfe82aed00,"Leonardo DiCaprio enjoys meeting beautiful women on boats – anyone who has ever seen paparazzi photographs of the 41-year-old in his spare time could tell you that. But despite the endless run of supermodels, actresses and socialites who have latched on to his arm on various vessels over the years, only one (his mother aside), seems to have stayed the course. And she just so happens to have been the first, too.  Yesterday, as Sunday night’s action from the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood was digested, social media melted with nostalgic pride at clips of Kate Winslet, DiCaprio’s original maritime fling, watching her old friend sate his two-decade hunger for an Academy Award, with his performance as a post-watershed Ray Mears in the 19th-century survival epic the Revenant.  There was Leo, trussed up in a dinner jacket and reciting his speech with all the calm and poise of a man who has had too much time to practise, when the camera deliberately cut to a tearful Kate (herself a nominee, losing to Alicia Vikander in the Best Supporting Actress category).  Eyes fixed on stage, hands clasped in prayer, rocking back and forth: in another context, Winslet might have looked more like a deranged racehorse owner – but this was the Oscars, so any melodrama is forgiven.  As the footage circulated online, the internet briefly averted its gaze from Donald Trump, and oohed and ahhed with glee.  “LEO AND KATE ARE SO CUTE,” one person calmly Tweeted. “They are the pinnacle of friendship goals,” another concluded. Thousands of similar messages followed. Forget the prizes, controversies, dresses and jokes the night threw up, for many viewers the highlight of the 88th Academy Awards was the enduring tale of a strictly platonic friendship forged 19 years ago, on the deck of the Titanic.  Of course, both actors’ careers could easily have easily sunk with James Cameron’s epic story of that ill-fated cruise liner. Neither DiCaprio nor Winslet was an established lead when they were cast as Jack and Rose, so when Cameron’s film ran both well over-budget and far beyond schedule, that lack of star power was just one of many reasons industry critics doubted its success.  More fool them: Titanic became the first movie to gross more than a billion dollars, and instantly made the pair (then only 21 and 22 respectively) two of the most bankable actors in the world.  Looking at images of them together on the red carpet at the 1998 Oscars, they could scarcely seem further from the slick, seasoned professionals of 2016. DiCaprio has the air of a 12-year-old wearing his father’s spare suit to a school ball; while Winslet, in dark lipstick and black lace, looks more 'tormented adolescent going through a Goth phase’ than Hollywood star.  Photo: REX/Shutterstock  Still, that early success set them on course for careers of impressively even stead: both became critically acclaimed as well as box office stars, and for a long time both were united in an inability to claim the biggest prize of all, despite regular awards nominations (including Golden Globe nods for Revolutionary Road in 2008, their first on-screen reunion since the mid-Atlantic).  Things didn’t stay quite so even in their personal lives - while Winslet married for the third time in 2012 (guess who walked her down the aisle?), DiCaprio continues his diligent quest to date every model on earth for at least an evening.  When Winslet eventually got her Oscar for The Reader in 2008, at her sixth time of trying, DiCaprio was there at the front, cheering loudly. Last night, as he achieved his own dream, she did the same. Little wonder the world should feel warmed.  Floating selfishly on that Titanic door (which Jack could easily have squeezed onto), all those years ago, Rose might have reneged on her promise to never let go, but in real life, the pair never drifted apart. And now they’ve finally been reunited in the Oscars hall of fame.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,767

65b0cc27-8eb2-4457-be1a-df6c4e47544e,"A Hollywood heartthrob and confirmed bachelor falls for a brilliant, humanitarian lawyer, and eventually, the two create the picture perfect family. It's the sort of love story you'd expect to see in a filmland fairytale, and yet somehow in just five short years it's become the real life romance of Amal and George Clooney.  Here's the story of how the dedicated duo met, fell in love, and built a life together.  Getty Images  They met through a friend—at George's home.  People say that true love finds its way to you, but the adage is rarely as literal as it turned out to be for George and Amal. The couple met at the actor's Lake Como home in July of 2013, when a mutual friend stopped by while en route to Cannes with Amal in tow. In an equally fateful twist, the star's parents were also visiting him at the time, so Amal was introduced to the Clooney family on the same day she met her now husband.  George, then 52, had cultivated a reputation as one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors with a dating history including celebs like Kelly Preston and Stacy Keibler, but there was clearly something special about his connection with the renowned human rights lawyer. “I got a call from my agent who said, 'I met this woman who is coming to your house, who you’re going to marry,'” George said during an appearance on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman. “It really worked out that way.”  The two hit it off immediately, corresponding for several weeks before the romance truly blossomed. “She sent some pictures from when she was here, and we were writing each other, emailing, talking, mostly about what was going on in each other’s lives,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “And over a period of time it became clear we were more than just friends.”  Getty Images  Their first date was historic.  The duo's first official date came in October 2013 when George invited Amal, who was living in London, to come visit him at the famed Abbey Road Studios (best known as a recording home for The Beatles) while he supervised the score for his 2014 film The Monuments Men. ""That was a good first date,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter, adding: ""And pretty quickly, things escalated once I was in London.""  Getty Images  Amal was almost too shocked to say 'yes' when George proposed.  ""She'd had a conversation with her parents, who were like, 'What are George's intentions?' And she was saying, 'Take it easy. We've been going out for six months,'"" George explained. All the while he was preparing for the big moment.  After months of planning—down to a playlist of music to accompany the proposal—George invited Amal to a homecooked dinner on April 28, 2014, hiding the 7-carat engagement ring inside of a lighter box that Amal used to light the candlelit table. ""I did all the stuff, got down on my knee and did all the things you're supposed to do,"" the actor said. ""I was waiting for this song, 'Why Shouldn't I?' 'Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by? / Why shouldn't I know of love?' It's a really good song about why can't I be in love? And it played, and she's like, 'Holy shit!' And she just kept staring at the ring, going, 'Oh, my God.' It was 20 minutes of me on my knee, waiting for her to say yes, because she was so shocked.""  Getty Images  They married in an intimate Venetian ceremony.  After a short engagement the couple tied the knot in September 2014, just shy of a year after their first date. ""We didn't tell anybody else that we were going to do it,"" Clooney recalled to The Hollywood Reporter, ""but eventually somebody figured it out. Oh, my God! Once people got wind of it, it became an event."" Surrounded by family (and a few famous friends, including Clooney's long-time collaborator Matt Damon, Cindy Crawford, and fellow celebrity couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt) the couple wed in a private ceremony at the Aman Canal Grande luxury resort in Venice, Italy.  Getty Images  Children weren't part of their initial plan.  “It had never been part of my DNA,” George said, explaining his stance on fatherhood. “We didn’t plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny. There was an assumption that we didn’t want them. And then, after the wedding, we just felt we’d gotten very lucky, both of us, and we should share whatever good luck we’ve got. It would seem self-centered to just have that belong to us.”  When Amal became pregnant in 2016, the overjoyed couple got an additional surprise, in the form of twins. ""[The doctor performing the ultrasound] goes, 'Well, there's one.' And I said, 'Great.' And then he goes, 'And there's the second one.' And I was like, 'What?'"" Clooney told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We just sat there, staring at that piece of paper they give you, and I kept thinking there was a mistake."" But there was no mistake; in June of 2017, one month premature, Amal gave birth to twins Ella and Alexander.    Getty Images  They balance parenting with their demanding jobs.  Returning to her work representing refugees in September of 2017, Amal has managed to excel at the office and as a mom. ""She is sort of this remarkable human being and now mother which is something, I suppose, you should assume she would be wonderful at as well.

9d2e6644-dbe1-443f-ad2b-71a4becd09ad,"After more than a decade, actor Billy Bob Thornton shared what led to his divorce from actress Angelina Jolie in 2003.  Thornton has married six times, but his relationship with Jolie—who is 20 years younger than the Goliath actor—was among his most notable. Jolie was Thornton's fifth wife. The former spouses met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999. At the time, he was engaged to Big Little Lies star Laura Dern. Thornton and Jolie tied the knot in 2000, but they separated three years later.  ""I remember our time together as really being great,"" Thornton, 62, said on The HFPA in Conversation podcast Wednesday. ""We just had different lifestyles. Hers is a global lifestyle, and mine is an agoraphobic lifestyle, so that's really—that's the only reason we're probably not still together maybe, because of a different path in life we wanted to take.""  Thornton said he's maintained a friendship with Jolie since their divorce. ""Angie is still a friend of mine, and she's a great person, and she's done so much,"" he told The HFPA. ""She makes movies that are important to her whether they succeed or fail, she still does what she believes in, and I'll always respect her for that.""  When Thornton and Jolie were together, they were known for their seemingly eccentric ways. They had an immediate attraction, which ultimately led Thornton to allegedly part ways with live-in fiancée Dern without warning.  Dern learned of Jolie and Thornton's relationship after receiving calls from tabloids.  ""I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I've never heard from him again,"" Dern said in Talk magazine 2000. ""It's like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.""  Jolie notably had Thornton's name tattooed along her arm, and they both wore a vial of each other's blood around their necks. The former pair announced their plans to adopt a child—Maddox Jolie-Pitt—from Cambodia together in March 2002, but it was later disclosed that Jolie adopted her eldest kid as a single parent.  Since parting ways, the Bad Santa actor married puppeteer Connie Angland in 2014. Jolie is in the midst of a custody battle with former spouse Brad Pitt.  Representatives for Jolie did not immediately return Newsweek's request for comment regarding Thornton's remarks.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,466

Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt after over a decade together and two years of marriage, Us Weekly confirmed on Tuesday, September 20. While some social media users are mourning the end of one of Hollywood’s most celebrated love stories, many can’t forget the complicated origin of Brangelina’s epic love affair.  As fans are well aware, the Fight Club actor, 52, and the Oscar-winning actress, 41, met on the 2004 set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. At the time, Pitt was married to Jennifer Aniston. After the Friends alum, 47, reportedly discovered that her then-husband was cheating on her with his sexy costar, she called it quits on their five-year marriage. Months later, Pitt and Jolie went public with their controversial romance.  During a now-legendary 2008 interview with Vogue, Aniston — who married Justin Theroux in August 2015 — broke her silence about the scandal. “That stuff about how she couldn't wait to get to work every day?” she said, referring to former comments made by Jolie to W magazine. “That was really uncool.”  Now that the Pitt-Jolie saga is coming to a close, Twitter can’t help but revel in Aniston’s revenge. From creative memes to hilarious comments, Us has rounded up the best online reactions.  https://twitter.com/faith_x1/status/778259962640334848  The only good thing about this #Brangelina trending are all the #JenniferAniston gifs pic.twitter.com/GIaJIPzkSR — Renee H (@mtgreiunicorn) September 20, 2016  The internet is freaking out over the demise of #Brangelina and Jennifer Aniston is over here like pic.twitter.com/AQMkHatoWg — Alexis Shaw (@alexisshaw92) September 20, 2016  ""The same way you get him is the same way you lose him"" has never been so true #Brangelina pic.twitter.com/yqpAWxa4dF — Ida.

Jolie is reportedly requesting physical custody of their six children, Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8. TMZ reported that she requested that Pitt only get joint legal custody. She is not asking for spousal support.  Jolie’s rep issued a statement to Us on Tuesday regarding her decision to permanently part ways with the eternal heartthrob. ""Angelina Jolie Pitt has filed for dissolution of the marriage,” the statement read. ""This decision was made for the health of the family. She will not be commenting at this time, and asks that the family be given their privacy during this difficult time.""  A source told Us that the A-List pair frequently fought over how they parented their children. “[Angelina] did try to make it work, but her kids come first and she couldn't let them see Mommy and Daddy like this,” the insider told Us.

He was 67. Cassidy died surrounded by his family, his publicist said. Cassidy's nephew tweeted that he didn't think ""I'm alone in saying that we will all miss him.""  My uncle David Cassidy has sadly passed away tonight... & in the process of mourning I can't help but thank God for the joy that he brought to countless millions of people! I don't think I'm alone in saying that we will all miss him. God Speed! — Jack Cassidy (@jackgcassidy) November 22, 2017  Cassidy said in February that he was suffering from dementia.  ""I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming,"" he told People magazine about his diagnosis. His mother had suffered from the disease.  Cassidy was born in 1950 to singer and actor Jack Cassidy and actress Evelyn Ward. His big break came at age 20 when he nabbed the role of Keith Partridge, one of the singing kids of ""The Partridge Family,"" alongside his real-life stepmother Shirley Jones.  The show centered around a widow and her five children who traveled the country in a psychedelically-painted school bus. It ran from 1970-74, providing a feel-good, family show as the country struggled to find its footing after the tumultuous 1960s.  While ""The Partridge Family"" was never a huge hit in the ratings, the show excelled in tie-ins and producing hit songs. The theme song ""Come On, Get Happy"" became a hit, and the cast would later go on to make ten albums, all of which sold more than 1 million copies.  This 1970 photo released by courtesy of Sony Pictures Television shows, back row, from left, cast members, Shirley Jones, Dave Madden, David Cassidy, Susan Dey, and front row, from left, Brian Forster, Danny Bonaduce and Suzanne Crough of the television series, ""The Partridge Family."" AP  And Cassidy was the biggest star of them all. He went solo in 1971, with his song ""Cherish,"" becoming a No. 1 hit. He had pop-star good looks and the 1970s trademark shaggy hair, helping fuel his teen idol status. He posed shirtless on the cover of Rolling Stone in 1972 with the headline ""Naked Lunch Box."" He tried to reject his ""bubble-gum"" image, talking about his drug use (""not smack, but grass and speed and psychedelics"").  Cassidy sold out Madison Square Garden in one day and toured internationally. But at London's White City Stadium, a 14-year-old girl was killed in a stampede when the 35,000 crowd surged forward when he appeared on stage. One ambulance man said the scene reminded him of the Blitz, according to The Independent.  By the end of 1974, ""The Partridge Family"" had ended and Cassidy quit touring, ending his days as a pop star. He eventually climbed back to the Top 40 with the 1990's ""Lyin' to Myself.""  Singer David Cassidy and wife Susan attend Rolling Stone Magazine's 1000th cover celebration on May 4, 2006, in New York. Getty  He continued to act, receiving an Emmy nomination for his role in ""Police Story"" in 1978. He starred in the short-lived series, ""David Cassidy: Man Undercover"" in 1978. He also took a turn at Broadway in a critically acclaimed role in ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" in 1982.  He appeared as one of the contestants on ""Celebrity Apprentice,"" although he was one of the first to be fired in 2011.  Later in life, Cassidy struggled with alcoholism and money troubles. He said he began drinking in 2002, and he was arrested several times for DUIs and sent through several rehab stints. He told CNN in 2014 that he was an alcoholic.  A month after his January 2014 arrest, his wife, Sue Shifrin-Cassidy, filed for divorce. He filed for bankruptcy in February 2015 and gave a bizarre interview on Britain's ""This Morning"" where he was accused of ""delusion"" and ""rudeness.""  Eventually, he publicly announced he was suffering from dementia after he forgot the lyrics to some of his songs onstage. He said he wanted to focus on health and happiness for the remainder of his life.  ""I want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I've been without any distractions,"" he told People.

The I Am Cait star was spotted jetting out of Los Angeles on Thursday as she made her way to Washington, D.C. to attend the inauguration, where Donald Trump will take the oath of office on Friday to become the 45th president of the United States.  On Wednesday, PEOPLE exclusively confirmed Jenner would be attending and a flurry of reports have since surfaced in regards to whether the 67-year-old Republican reality tv star will dance with Trump, 70, on Friday evening’s inaugural balls.  “This is a ridiculous story,” a rep for Jenner tells PEOPLE. “There have been no discussions about who Caitlyn will or won’t dance with, or if she will dance at all. I can’t deal in hypotheticals and have no idea what any Trump aids hope happens.

All these years later, Brad regrets leaving the Friends alum for his now-ex Angelina Jolie, a source tells In Touch exclusively.  Following his 2016 separation from Angie, Brad sobered up and sought therapy. And now he’s “in touch with emotions and his true self like never before,” the source says. That level of self-awareness comes with some massive realizations, it seems. “He’s come to realize that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,” the source adds. “And while Brad's not in love with Jen, he realizes how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he’s seeing everything more clearly.”  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Of course, these realizations may be coming too late. Jennifer has been married to Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux for two years now. And while Brad would “never dream of” ruining his ex’s new marriage, he “would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat.” (He could have that chance if it’s true that Jen and Justin are having marital discord.)  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  If they can’t be romantic partners, though, the War Machine star wants Jen to be his partner in other pursuits. “They worked well together” when they formed the production company Plan B in 2001, an insider close to Brad tells In Touch. “He wants Jen involved again as he produces and develops more and more high-quality film and cable TV products.”  That kind of professional partnership could pay off for Jen, too, since the insider says she wants in on “prestige projects” under his production banner. “She’d be beyond thrilled to win an Academy Award for Best Actress — something that’s evaded both her and Angelina.”  We wouldn’t be surprised if Brad and Jen reconvene in some capacity, though it seems he’ll always want her back by his side. “He still considers Jen the love of his life,” In Touch’s source says.

Thompson was ejected with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime of Golden State's 124-114 victory after the referee deemed he threw an elbow at Warriors guard Shaun Livingston. He was assessed a flagrant-2 on the play.  Instead of leaving the court and going to the locker room, however, Thompson was at the center of a scrum during which he shoved the basketball in the face of Warriors forward Draymond Green.  When asked what led tempers to flare, Thompson said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took an unnecessary shot (NSFW language):  That confrontation caught the eye of Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley:  Thompson had a quiet game to open the series. The 6'9"", 238-pound big man posted just two points on 1-of-4 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. He recorded a plus/minus of minus-nine in 20 minutes.  Although he did not make an impact in Game 1, Thompson may be a key to victory for Cleveland. When the Cavs won their first-ever championship in 2016, Thompson was a force in the paint, averaging 10.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in the Finals.  The on-court altercation could have led to the suspension of multiple Cavaliers. Like Thompson, Kevin Love also avoided a ban for his Game 1 actions. Love was not checked into the game at the time of the skirmish, but he found himself on the court at the time of the pushing and shoving, though he quickly made his way back to the sideline.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,339
2c319583-fc01-46a5-ba03-def677c3f494,"This week, in the midst of rising panic and gathering storms, some lucky paparazzi spotted the tabloid equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster.  In an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, these fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu immediately made waves. To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx’s PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they’re just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors “one hundred percent not true.” Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, “What I’ve learned about society today is that they’re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they’re so thirsty to find any story… Sometimes when you read the stuff you’re like, ‘Wow! That’s so not true!’” Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, “That’s not something I want to answer.”  Despite JamKat’s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they’ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx’s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx “is very happy with [Holmes].” Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, “I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,” adding, “I’ve never seen them together. He’s never told me he’s dating her.”  Still, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie’s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston’s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That’s because Foxx and Holmes’ intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes’ 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.  Long before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior—the alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.  One of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney’s 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise’s second marriage: “I was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.”  According to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige—a good friend of Cruise’s—became suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney’s film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige’s calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, “auditing” Cruise, and “re-educating” the couple’s adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.  A 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, “The organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: ‘What do you think of Tom Cruise?’” The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: “In a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.”  When Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement “specifically about Cruise,” claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: “By the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology’s Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise ‘wants someone with her own power—like Nicole.’ When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.” (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment prior to publication.)  By April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s couch.  According to journalist Tony Ortega, who’s covered the church since 1995, “Katie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.” Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress’ Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, “Jessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.” Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples’ six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise’s best man at his and Holmes’ 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that “his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,” in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.  As The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise’s young daughter, Suri: “When Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org—an elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a ‘billion-year contract.’” Cruise and Holmes’ hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri’s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn’t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in “more than 1,381 days.” This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church’s practice of “disconnecting” congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.  A RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx’s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, “Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.  “She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,” the source continued. “Katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”  And the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes’ bizarre ex.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1607

Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancé, during a Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace Wednesday.  Many deemed the brooch, which depicts an African woman, as racially insensitive as it dates back to a now criticized 18th-century art style that fetishizes slavery and people of color.

On Monday, Miller revealed that he’s leaving the Arrow-verse. “Currently shooting some of my final episodes as ‘Captain Cold/Leonard Snart’ on the CW’s Legends of Tomorrow and The Flash…” he said in a message posted on Instagram. “Grateful — now and in advance — to a pair of talented casts and hardworking crews…Thank you…”  He continued, “I’ve had a tremendous time playing this character… It’s been an opportunity, an education, and a f–king blast…”  Miller made his scene-stealing debut as the icy rogue on The Flash in season 1’s “Going Rogue.” This role would eventually reunite him with his Prison Break costar Dominic Purcell, who plays Mick Rory, a.k.a. Heat Wave. After recurring on The Flash, both men transitioned to DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Even though Snart was killed off in the Legends’ season 1 finale, Miller became a series regular across all of the Arrow-verse shows and recurred on Legends and guest-starred on The Flash.  At San Diego Comic-Con in July, the Legends EPs revealed that Miller would return in season 3. “Mick Rory needs his pal, but unfortunately he’s not going to get the version of his pal that he remembers,” EP Phil Klemmer said during the show’s panel. EP Marc Guggenheim added, “We’re obviously really excited to bring Wentworth back on the show for a few episodes, but a different iteration of Mr. Snart.

But an appropriate term nonetheless, right?  Elsewhere in this sit-down, Kim described the entire situation as ""sad,"" while not exactly answering Ellen directly when asked if she EVER liked Thompson.  Instead, she rambled on about how Khloe often ""dives in"" to romances and the family supports her as best they can.  Interesting, right?

Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then-pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) — first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter.  In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room 's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings.

""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""  Though it was reported that Kardashian was devastated upon hearing the news that Thompson may have been unfaithful, she has since been consumed by happiness upon the birth of her daughter , and People reports she is in the process of mending fences with her child's father.  “She’s basically already forgiven him,” a source said. “She is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about ‘cheating’ and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn’t lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,317
42f24f5e-73fa-4fde-b148-9948acfa4f26,"That's a wrap for ""Southern Charm New Orleans."" Sunday night's episode of the unscripted Bravo series marked the finale of its first season -- and, one has to believe, probably the finale of the series as a whole.  Of course, the Bravo suits could always surprise us and renew it for a sophomore season. But the fact of the matter is that the show had trouble building a steady audience from the beginning. In fact, after debuting April 25 to more than 1 million viewers, it didn't build at all, posting a viewership decline with nearly every episode, according to figures from ShowBuzz Daily.  Last week's penultimate episode marked the low-water mark, drawing fewer viewers -- 640,000 -- than any other episode so far this season. Nothing charming about that. (Viewership figures on Sunday's eighth and final episode were not available.)  By comparison, the ""Southern Charm"" mother ship, from which ""SoCharm NOLA"" was spun off, has yet to register fewer than 1 million voters in any of the nine episodes that have aired so far as part of its fifth season.  So, while there will certainly be some people who will mourn the end of ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" should Bravo decide to pass on a second season, I've got a feeling most people won't miss it -- because they apparently stopped watching pretty early on.  The reason behind the erosion of interest in the show is pretty simple to nail down: It was boring, built around limp writing and clumsily staged attempts at drama.  Granted, no reality show is actually ""real."" But if a producer wants his or her show to draw a reliable base of return viewers, they've got to help those viewers buy into the illusion. That was seldom the case with ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's an upside to it all, it's that the show was not the pox on local culture that many feared. In fact, its New Orleansness seemed to get more and more watered-down with nearly every episode, eventually reduced to little more than Chamber of Commerce images flashed between scenes, with an occasional bowl of gumbo thrown in. That's just as well, given that the show's efforts at including local culture in early episodes was ham-handed at best.  Even then, though, with so few people watching, it's hard to get too terribly worked up about it. As they say: No harm, no foul.  For those few who did watch regularly, producers were kind enough to wrap up most of the show's loose narrative threads in Sunday's finale. Below find a recap of the high points (and low points) of the Season 1 finale of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  The title: ""Better Late Than Pregnant.""  The centerpiece drama of the week: In what was perhaps the show's cheapest stunt yet -- and its most manufactured -- producers pulled a full-on okey-doke on viewers, in the form of a pregnancy scare for cast member Reagan Charleston.  That particular plot point was teased during the closing moments of the previous episode, but before getting to it in Episode 8, producers had hubby Jeff Charleston express his eagerness to become a father -- followed by Raegan informing him that she's not quite ready yet to be a mom. The next thing we know, her period is conveniently late.  So, she does what anybody would do: She takes a pregnancy test. At a huge season-ending party thrown by fellow cast member Jon Moody. And using a pregnancy test that was a gag gift at an adult Easter egg hunt from Episode 7.  And after all that? Spoiler alert: She ain't preggers.  That's right, ""Southern Charm New Orleans"" fans. You just got punk'd.  In all honestly, it's probably for the best, as on Monday (June 4) -- the day after the finale aired -- Reagan and Jeff announced they are separating.  The libation of the week: A French 75, ordered at breakfast by Tamica Lee.  The New Orleans cliche of the week: From a practical standpoint, the idea of throwing a party to end the season was a pretty good one, giving producers the opportunity to get everybody together one last time -- and decked out in their Sunday best -- to wrap up the season's myriad dramas.  That being said, it's nothing short of shameless that they framed it as a ""Jazz Fest launch party."" The show, and the episode has nothing to do with Jazz Fest. The cast never went to Jazz Fest. In fact, music has played a minor role in the series at best.  The honest question of the week: Speaking of the show's lack of focus on music, why didn't producers pick a local musician or two when they were casting the show? Not only would they have gotten some great music out of it, but the real behind-the-scenes dramas that play out on the local music scene have got to be better than the fake ones that played out on Season 1 of ""Southern Charm New Orleans.""  If there's one thing that could get me interested in a second season, that would probably be it.  The real moment of the week: Of all the lose threads tied up in the season finale, easily the most touching was the reconciliation between cast member Tamica Lee and her daughter, third-grader Rani, with whom she butted heads in a previous episode -- and who has struggled with the fact that she's the only black kid at her school.  After sitting down for a heart-to-heart with the help of supporting cast member Susan Henry, Tamica and Rani hugged it out -- and cried it out -- in what was probably the sweetest moment of the season.  Granted, it all happened during a staged radio interview at local station WBOK, but this is one case where the end justifies the means. On a related note: If there's an MVP of the season, it's Rani, as far as I'm concerned.  The manufactured moment of the week: Raegan's pregnancy scare. (See ""The centerpiece drama,"" above.)  The quote of the week: ""We're just having some conversations."" -- Justin, to mother Dottie Reese, after she walked in on a heated conversation between Justin and girlfriend Kelsey.  I don't know why, but that line cracked me up. In fact, it's not just the quote of the week. It might be the quote of the whole season. I'm think I'm going to start using it whenever anybody butts into a conversation I'm having with somebody else.  Them: ""What are you guys talking about?""  Me: ""We're just having some conversations."" (Exits.)  The winner: The King Firm, where cast member Justin Reese's day job is. Every episode this season, they've bought airtime during the show for a commercial that prominently features Justin -- and which never fails to fool me into thinking the show is back on, thus prompting me to stop fast-forwarding through the commercials.  Granted, I start fast-forwarding again immediately upon realizing it's a commercial, but I know the firm's name now, whereas I didn't' before.  Nicely played, King Firm. Nicely played.  The loser: Me, for actually sitting through all eight episodes.  On the plus side, it's all been documented through the following stories, so future generations can remember the season that was.  As for me, I'm going to start trying to forget it, starting now.

f62bb703-3443-4db0-82cb-f08f9e26b9fb,"A body found Thursday night is that of missing Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison, police in Scotland confirmed Friday. The body was discovered about 8:30 p.m. local time Thursday (12:30 p.m. PT) in Port Edgar, Queensferry, just west of Edinburgh, the Scottish capital.  No official cause of death was given. A statement from Hutchison’s family, issued Friday afternoon by Police Scotland, said the singer had been struggling with mental health problems.  “As a family, we are utterly devastated with the tragic loss of our beloved Scott,” the statement said. “Despite his disappearance, and the recent concerns over his mental health, we had all remained positive and hopeful that he would walk back through the door, having taken some time away to compose himself. Scott, like many artists, wore his heart on his sleeve and that was evident in the lyrics of his music and the content of many of his social media posts.”  The family said Hutchison had “battled bravely with his own issues” for many years. “Depression is a horrendous illness that does not give you any alert or indication as to when it will take hold of you,” the statement said. “We are immensely proud of [Scott] for being so open with his struggles. His willingness to discuss these matters in the public domain undoubtedly raised awareness of mental health issues and gave others confidence and belief to discuss their own issues.”  The 36-year-old singer and guitarist was reported missing early Wednesday, and was last seen near the Dakota Hotel in South Queensferry. Hutchison had issued a tweet Tuesday night referring to his life in the past tense: “Be so good to everyone you love….I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me.” Twenty minutes later, his final, poignant tweet simply said: “I’m away now. Thanks.”  Be so good to everyone you love. It’s not a given. I’m so annoyed that it’s not. I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  I’m away now. Thanks. — Scott Hutchison (@owljohn) May 8, 2018  Hutchison’s family was informed of the discovery of the body, and formal identification took place Friday.  Hutchison formed Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit in 2003. The group’s first studio album, 2006’s “Sing the Greys,” featured just Hutchison and his brother Grant, who is the band’s drummer. Their most recent, fifth album, “Painting of a Panic Attack,” was released in 2016 on Atlantic Records.  The band also includes Billy Kennedy, Andy Monaghan and Simon Liddell. On Wednesday, the group tweeted: “We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now. He may be in a fragile state and may not be making the best decisions for himself right now.”  We are worried about Scott, who has been missing for a little while now.

Kapranos tweeted that Hutchison’s death was “a terrible loss.” Murdoch said the Scottish music community had been praying for a different outcome and encouraged anyone “having dark thoughts” to talk to family, friends or a doctor.  Irish rock band Snow Patrol said they were devastated to hear the news about their friend.  Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was “heartbreaking news,” calling Hutchison “a remarkable and much loved talent.”  Awful news about Scott Hutchison.

64cc18e9-cea1-4e3f-867e-ac5f4cee7bb2,"Harrison Ford was tight-lipped when asked about his reaction to late Star Wars costar Carrie Fisher’s revealing memoir during a recent interview, but the actor did manage to share one brief thought on the matter.  “It was strange. For me,” he said in GQ’s new cover story. In 2016, Fisher dropped a bombshell on fans of the franchise when she revealed in her memoir, The Princess Diarist, that she and Ford had an affair while on the set of the film that started the franchise,1977’s Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope.  At the time, Fisher was 19 and Ford was 33 – and married to his first wife, Mary Marquardt, with whom he had two children.  The steadfastly private actor admitted that he was given advance warning that Fisher planned to write about their affair (“to a degree”), but declined to go into detail about his reaction.  “Oh, I don’t know. I don’t know,” he said. “You know, with Carrie’s untimely passing, I don’t really feel that it’s a subject that I want to discuss.”  When asked whether he’s read Fisher’s nearly 300-page memoir, Ford responded shortly, “No. I didn’t.”  Ford remained silent throughout Fisher’s promotional tours and interviews for the book, though he was often asked for comment. In a chat with NPR’s Fresh Air host Terry Gross in late November of that year, Fisher expressed surprise that readers made such a big deal out of the three-month affair.  “I said, ‘I found the journals that I kept during the first movie, and I’m probably going to publish them,'” she said of the conversation she had with Harrison prior to moving forward with that chapter of the memoir. “And he just sort of raised his finger and said, ‘Lawyer!’ Then I said, ‘No, I won’t write anything that you don’t want. I mean, I’ll show it to you before and you can take anything out that you want taken out. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable’ – which I, of course, have. Unduly comfortable.”  “I wouldn’t have ambushed him like that, but it’s still – no matter if I told him or not, it probably feels like an ambush,” she continued. “It feels like an ambush to me, and I’m the one who wrote it.”  Fisher and Ford reunited on the big screen for 2015’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and following Fisher’s death in December 2016, he issued a statement remembering her “fearless” spirit, though he made no mention of their romance.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,544
722ca579-3f49-4218-9663-15ff1df671ad,"Story highlights The rapper showed up at the San Francisco auditions  The judges liked what they saw  (Rolling Stone) In October, Kanye West staged a surprise ""American Idol"" audition when the singing competition tried out hopefuls in San Francisco. With the 15th and final season of American Idol set to premiere January 6th, West's full audition has been revealed via E!.  ""My name is Kanye, I'm from the south side of Chicago,"" West says while introducing himself to the judges. ""I'm originally a producer. I always wanted to rap and no one really believed in me, so I wanted to try some things out, ya know?"" Kim Kardashian, watching the audition on a monitor alongside Ryan Seacrest, tells the Idol host, ""I'm not really nervous because I do really believe in him. I didn't give any advice on singing, rapping. I just really believe in him.""  Before launching into the audition, West tells the judges -- specifically Jennifer Lopez -- he chose ""Gold Digger"" because ""it has one of the judges' names in it."" After wrapping up the a cappella rendition, the judges don't even need to deliberate before quickly handing West his Golden Ticket to Hollywood Week; whether the rapper actually takes part in the next round remains to be seen.  ""We were in San Francisco, and they said, 'We've got a contestant that's just going to jump into the line,'"" Ryan Seacrest told E! News of the surprise audition. ""And up walked Kim and Kanye—Kim pregnant and Kanye enthusiastic and ready to go in there. He walks in there and does a lyric about J.Lo from one of his songs.""  The West audition is just one of the many surprises American Idol is promising in its farewell season, which will both crown a new victor as well as look back at all the talents the series unearthed.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,370

'He’s always been selfish and is clearly not thinking about how this will affect his children.'  It first emerged last month that David was no longer hiding his new love as he referred to himself as 'the lucky one' in the comments of Instagram photo Lesley shared of the two of them.

8c91d159-ccd9-4c5b-b9e9-0e59f555cb5d,"The Game of Thrones Season 7 finale was already the longest episode in the history of the series, but a cut scene could’ve made the 79-minute epic even longer — and it would’ve explained a mildly confusing plot twist.  Seeing Arya and Sansa fall for Littlefinger’s bullshit and go at one another’s throats for most of the season was frustrating for many viewers, but it was arguably worth it when the two Stark daughters teamed up and turned the tables on Petyr Baelish. Although the moment was undeniably awesome, it’s a little unclear when Sansa, Arya, and their brother/human computer Bran all got together to sort things out and end up on the same side. In an interview with Variety Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran, explained that they filmed that scene and it didn’t make the final episode.  “We actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran’s door and says, ‘I need your help,’ or something along those lines,” Hempstead Wright explained. “So basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister. So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she’s like, ‘Oh, s—.’”  Hempstead Wright’s comments seem to confirm that Arya and Sansa weren’t secretly pretending to go along with Littlefinger’s ruse the whole time, as some suspected. Seeing Sansa and Bran actually work this out would’ve made for a nice scene that could’ve helped made the Winterfell plot feel a little more organic, but it also would have made their turn on Littlefinger less shocking.  It’s kind of Season 7 in a nutshell. The story moved fast enough that the showrunners had to leave out so much connective tissue and included some overly convenient plot points, which made the season as a whole feel less cohesive than earlier seasons. That style of storytelling, though, allowed for some great, great moments.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,424

That’s right. Blake Shelton: country singer, Voice judge, boyfriend of Gwen Stefani, and frequent purveyor of weird gay panic, misogyny, and Islamophobia.  If naming Shelton was a publicity stunt, it worked: Twitter users were so startled by the revelation that both “Blake Shelton” and “Sexiest Man Alive” trended for most of Wednesday, and the jokes flowed loudly and freely:  even a straight man can see there's no way blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. i dont think he's even the sexiest man named blake shelton. — Oliver Willis (@owillis) November 15, 2017  woke up this morning to news that blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. rip every sexy man in the world who died in the great sexy plague of 2017 overnight; u will be missed — I do not recall (@morninggloria) November 15, 2017  This is sexier than Blake Shelton https://t.co/j3B9B9cN4A — Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) November 15, 2017  Many social media users were quick to compare Shelton’s looks to things that are — how can we put this? — not sexy:  Blake Shelton looks like the dad in a drug commercial where they list off the side effects at the end while you watch him build a birdhouse. — DeShawn (@DeShawnstantine) November 15, 2017  Let's set the record straight: Blake Shelton looks like a second-stringer on Justified who gets murdered over a horse crime. — Kaleb Horton (@kalebhorton) November 15, 2017  If Blake Shelton is voted #SexiestManAlive then Ray Black Jr. is 2017's most popular driver.

As such, each year’s choice invites a wave of alternate opinions, and 2017 is no exception, with social media users being quick to point out other, sexier alternatives to Shelton:  The same people who voted in People’s sexiest alive man list are the same folks who tampered w/ the presidential elections    There’s no way Blake Shelton is the sexiest man w/ Trevante Rhodes still breathing. pic.twitter.com/cd5NTcKJp4 — Corey Townsend (@JarrieBradshaw) November 15, 2017  Twitter users had many opinions on who the actual sexiest men of the year were, but a general consensus seemed to form around the triad of perennially overlooked frontrunner Idris Elba, upcoming Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, and the usual gaggle of white guys named Chris:  Forget the fact that Idris Elba should’ve obviously won. I can even think of like 5 white guys named Chris who are more deserving of the Sexiest Man Alive title than Blake Shelton. — Brohibition Now (@OhNoSheTwitnt) November 15, 2017  Blake Shelton is People’s Sexiest Man Alive because apparently Idris Elba, Chris Evans and Jason Momoa fell off the planet last night. — Jenn C (@TheJennC) November 15, 2017  But despite the jokes, there’s plenty of reason beyond the subjective nature of sexiness to be critical of People’s decision — namely because Shelton has been flagrantly and repeatedly homophobic in the past, once “joking” in a 2011 tweet that he would leave any gay man who tried to touch him beaten and bloody.  He also used the stage at the Country Music Awards for an awkward gay joke about Jake Gyllenhaal because he starred in Brokeback Mountain, and has repeatedly referenced gay panic and jokes about finding lesbians hot on his Twitter account. In the past, he’s made toxic jokes about women, including noting, in 2010, a “sick fantasy” about then-16-year-old Dakota Fanning, and has repeatedly made Islamophobic and xenophobic jokes about non-English-language speakers and foreigners around him.  Last year, after the tweets were uncovered and public outcry arose, he attempted to pass off all of his statements as comedy. Yet since then he’s gone on to openly decry “political correctness,” and last year praised Donald Trump for “say[ing] what he thinks,” without acknowledging the coded racism and bigotry that often underlies Trump’s statements.  After the news about Shelton’s new title began circulating, many began pointing out the singer’s problematic history:  I guess it makes sense in Trump's America that an Islamophobe who ""jokes"" about beating up gay men would be named the ""Sexiest Man Alive."" — Melissa McEwan (@Shakestweetz) November 15, 2017  For anyone who wants to shame people for making fun of the fact that Blake Shelton is “Sexiest Man Alive” (barf) remember that he’s a giant homophobe who once wrote a parody to “Any Man Of Mine” by Shania Twain that describes him assaulting men who show interest in him. FYI. — Sexiest Man Alive, Dan Blackroyd (@danblackroyd) November 15, 2017  Just in case you guys didn't know, not only did Blake Shelton tweet racist & homophobic things he also made jokes about having ""sick fantasies"" about Dakota Fanning when she was 16 — Tatum Robinson (@TatumAlexis10) November 15, 2017  Still, some were quick to point out that it’s not the first time People has made odd decisions in its annual Sexiest Man vote. For starters, the list has historically been overwhelmingly white, with only two men of color ever gracing its cover — Denzel Washington in 1996 and The Rock in 2016. This fact, combined with backlash over Shelton, had many onlookers pointing out how problematic the list has historically been.  just a reminder that only two men of color have been picked as the sexiest man alive in 32 years, people magazine is trash https://t.co/TVDNNcCMch — adam (@brokeangeI) November 15, 2017  Not to mention how weird some of the choices have been:  Clearly, People’s Sexiest Man award is yet another public institution that needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from its sexy foundations.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1295
d8f96d17-4763-4738-a16a-8c102affa19a,"There was 'one last chapter to tell' in the Sex and the City saga, Sarah Jessica Parker said. And this dream of die-hard fans desperate for a third film to redeem the widely panned sequel almost came true in 2014. Then one of the leading actresses dropped out of the production.  But it wasn't Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis or Cynthia Nixon.  Court documents obtained by the DailyMail.com reveal the production fell apart when Michelle Pfeiffer, who never appeared in the six seasons of the HBO show or the two films, decided to opt out of the movie.  Scroll down for video  Filming for Sex and the City 3 was set to take place in New York City in 2014, but then one of the project's 'leading actresses' Michelle Pfeiffer, 59, dropped out of the film. She never appeared on the 6 seasons of the HBO show or the two films  Kristin Davis, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kim Cattrall starred in the first and second Sex and the City films which together grossed more than $700million worldwide  Sex and the City executive producer Cindy Chupack filed suit over a Greenwich Village townhouse in 2014.  The house on East Ninth Street is only a few blocks away from the facade of Carrie Bradshaw's iconic apartment on Perry Street in West Village.  Sex and the City producer Cindy Chupack (pictured) said production on the film halted when Michelle Pfeiffer dropped out  Chupack, who has also produced episodes of Modern Family and Divorce, explained in the court documents she put down a $15,000 deposit to rent a home owned by Rebecca Flores.  The producer attempted to cancel the booking the next day after 'one of the lead actresses for the movie, Michelle Pfeiffer' opted out of the film.  Documents state there was no replacement lined up for the 'Scarface' actress.  By the time Chupack asked for her money back, Flores had already cashed the check and refused to refund her.  Chupack sued for $28,500 in damages and Flores fired back, counter-suing for $100,000.  Like Carrie and Mr Big's on-again, off-again relationship, the legal battle dragged on for years until the judge came back with an decision in May.  The order states, 'As a backdrop, plaintiff, a noted screenwriter and movie producer, sought to rent an apartment in Manhattan for three months so she can work on the movie, Sex and the City, that was to be filmed in New York City.  'Plaintiff expressed her interest in renting the apartment listed for $20,000 per month for a three month period, and remitted a non refundable hold fee of $15,000. The filming of the movie did not commence as planned.'  The townhouse is located on East Ninth Street and is just a few blocks away from the home used for the facade of Carrie Bradshaw's apartment on Perry Street  Earlier this month, the judge threw out the producer's lawsuit entirely stating it was not the defendant's fault the movie was cancelled and the contract was clear about the deposit.  It ordered Chupack's husband, plaintiff and attorney Ian Wallach to pay $5,000 on the defendant's first counterclaim in damages and another $5,000 in sanctions.  The court filings detail email communication between the producer and renter which show in early January she wrote to Flores saying she would know if the film was for sure going to happen by February 8.  Though Pfeiffer never starred on Sex and the City during its six season run, she did appear in the fim New Year's Eve in 2011 with Sarah Jessica Parker. The actresses also both have starring roles in HBO shows, Parker in Divorce and Pfeiffer in the upcoming film The Wizard of Lies.  Filming for Sex and the City Three was supposed to start in 2014. Since then, Sarah Jessica Parker has hinted several times another film could be in the works  The pair recently taped an episode of Variety Studio: Actors on Actors where they interviewed each other.  The first Sex and the City movie was released in 2008, and grossed a whopping $415 million at the box office worldwide. The sequel, which was primarily set in Abu Dhabi, generated $288 million worldwide.  Fans have been speculating about a third film for years, emboldened by Sarah Jessica Parker's hints.  In January 2014, she told InStyle magazine, 'A part of me thinks there is one last chapter to tell.'  In 2015 she posted a teasing Instagram of her leaving Bloomingdale's dressed in designer clothes.  Fans couldn't help but wonder, why would Sarah Jessica Parker keep hinting there would be a Sex and the City movie if there wasn't a possibility of another film?  She captioned the photo: 'Well. I guess the cat's out of the (little brown) bag. As usual, we will keep you posted on every detail as we are able. I'm under a strict gag order until then.'  In 2016 while promoting her new show Divorce, SJP reiterated the line about another chapter, 'I will say that the idea, it rests in the butler's pantry. Not on the table, but somebody is holding it fairly nearby.'  Much like her character Miranda, Cynthia Nixon was more pragmatic about her answer when she was asked by the Hollywood Reporter if there would be a third film in 2012.  She said: 'I think we had a wonderful ride. I think it's fine to let it go.'",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1030

The “Lost Boys” star named his film “Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys,” focusing on his sexual assault and the alleged rape of his late longtime friend and fellow child star, Corey Haim.  “I believe this title represents the truth I have been promising to tell and it also represents the truth of what happened,” Feldman, 47, told Us Weekly on Tuesday. “[Haim] was physically raped, I was physically assaulted and as a result of those actions, and the fact that I had to carry that burden all those years, really it was a raping of not only our emotional lives, but also our collective work and career as The Two Coreys.”  Last year, Feldman launched an IndieGogo campaign seeking $10 million to “create an affront” against child sexual abuse and expose an alleged pedophilia ring with his movie.  “I propose to do this by making a film that will be [the most] honest and true depiction of child abuse ever portrayed, by telling my own story in a very real way, in a very honest way, with no editing, no censorship, no studio behind it,” he said in a video about the “Truth project.” “I will make the film, I will direct the film, I will produce the film, and I will self-distribute it to guarantee it gets a theatrical release with your donations. Additionally, it will help me buy the security and the legal team I need to protect my family until the project is released.”  Feldman’s allegations of pedophilia in Hollywood have resurfaced in light of sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and director James Toback.  The “Stand By Me” actor’s 2013 appearance on “The View,” in which Barbara Walters chided him for speaking out against “an entire industry,” went viral last year.  The news of Haim’s portrayal in Feldman’s film may not sit well with the late actor’s mother.  Judy Haim previously slammed Feldman for speaking of Corey Haim’s alleged sexual assault and abuse, even sending him a cease and desist in 2016, after which Feldman promised he’d stop talking about Corey Haim in the press.  She was particularly incensed at reports that a then-19-year-old Charlie Sheen allegedly raped Corey Haim when Haim was 13 on the set of “Lucas,” an accusation Sheen himself has denied — and sued over.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,498

""It has a skillful melange of sounds from the mid-70s apex of analog recording, the era of disco and yacht rock: a warm and rounded bassline, some Nile Rodgers-style guitar, a slick descending line on Fender Rhodes.""[7] Rolling Stone's Elia Leight said that the song is ""a simple, lighthearted loop, which combines punctual ska guitar, a playful keyboard line and charming squeaks that recall a cartoon character's slip on a banana peel.""[8] Brent Faulkner from The Musical Hype said the song is undercooked, leaving more to be desired, adding that it's ""the type of record that is pleasing more because of the sound than the lyricism.""[9]  Music videos [ edit ]  The song's accompanying music video was uploaded to Harris' Vevo channel on YouTube on 26 June 2017.

a249183d-329b-4c74-9cbb-fe9fed1496fe,"Kelly Dodd isn’t calling a truce with Meghan King Edmonds any time soon!  The RHOC stars have been at odds since Edmonds, 32, asked Dodd, 41, if it was true that she was cheating on Michael with her boyfriend — and Dodd responded by telling Edmonds that her husband Jim was having an affair while she was pregnant.  Dodd carried their feud over to her Bravo blog, where she commented on her costars’ marriages — and took a stab at the Edmonds’ relationship!  “How great are our guys?” she wrote before talking about Diko and Peggy Sulahian and Doug and Lydia McLaughlin.  “Michael too supports my decision to get a breast reduction, even though he thinks my boobs are ‘perfect,’” she continued. “He respects that it is my body and whatever makes me happy is his priority. Michael has always been there with me at every medical procedure. For example, when we were going through IVF, he attended every doctor visit, administered all of my shots, he was present when the embryos were implanted, as well as attending all my prenatal care appointments. Not all of our husbands are so supportive, right Meghan?”  Radar previously reported that Edmonds was forced to undergo her IVF treatments alone, as her husband was on the road for his baseball hosting gig. She later confessed that he was a distant dad who was “removed” from her pregnancy and insiders told Radar he was “pulling away” as well.  The former baseball pro even missed their daughter Aspen’s conception and his wife’s baby shower.  Edmonds also claimed via Twitter that Dodd made hurtful claims about her postpartum depression, but the comments have since been removed.

7d001081-ca67-477d-9163-c9381a05ff82,"“They’re being so cagey” said The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel creator Amy Sherman-Palladino about Amazon not revealing the season 2 drop date for her eight-Emmy winning comedy series.  She finally confessed backstage at the Emmys that season 2 is coming “this year, they’re waiting for us to finish the show, it’s coming out this year.”  When Mrs. Maisel dropped last November it was in the heat of the #MeToo movement. The media was quick to observe how the show about a newly-separated single woman who is vying to become a stand-up in a male-dominated late 1950s world, just rang so loudly with the times.  “You never set out to drive a political message through your show, it just won’t work,” said Sherman-Palladino, “You gotta love the show, love your characters, it was an interesting fluke that Maisel came out when we were taking trolls down. I’m glad it’s a character that still resonates. We can look back at 1959 and see that today women aren’t wearing corsets anymore, but the problems still exist.”  The entire late 50s comedy era “is Oz” for Sherman-Palladino having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, listening to her father’s story about Greenwich Village, and opening up for Johnny Mathis and Dinah Washington.  Season 2 is “about opening Midge’s world up,” says Palladino. Buzz has been that there’s an episode set in Paris, as well as one in the comedy stomping ground of the era, the Catskills.  “There are dragons,” joked EP Daniel Palladino, making a Game of Thrones reference.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,315

Mr. and Mrs. Clooney are very busy people, their respective careers take them all over the world and sometimes they are even forced to travel to dangerous and war-torn countries.  The pair also shares three mansions in California, Italy, and England, so it is not surprising that the parents-to-be have begun looking for an extra pair of hands to help them with their bundle of joys.

The Shake It Off star, 26, was caught in a passionate embrace with the Night Manager actor, 35, near her Rhode Island home in photos that emerged last night, just two weeks after it was confirmed she had split from the Scottish DJ after a 15 month romance.  Four weeks before the break-up and Swift and Hiddleston had put on a VERY flirty display as they hit the dancefloor at the Met Ball where Taylor was on co-hosting duties with Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.  (Image: Instagram)  (Image: Instagram)  Videos from the night - that Calvin was noticeably absent from - show the pair throwing shapes to Beyonce's Crazy In Love and appear oblivious to anyone else around them.  The duo are known for loving a turn on the dancefloor - but was there more to it then just an innocent booty shake?  Insiders later admitted there was obvious ""chemistry"" between the couple and it's clear in the video that Taylor and Tom can barely tear their eyes each other as they gyrate along to the music.  Taylor even suggestively brushes past the actor as she carries on the dance session.  (Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock)  According to The Sun Taylor had been ""won over"" by Hiddleston after the flirty dance-off, and while insiders claim he began ""pursuing"" her after they first met, they insisted that there was NO overlap with her romance with Calvin.  “Tom has been courting Taylor since they met – he sent her flowers. She’s been won over,"" a source told the paper.  “The timing of this looks very bad for Taylor. There was an obvious connection with Tom at the Met Gala – you can see that in the video of them dancing together.""  They continued: “Her people are insistent that no one else was involved in the split with Calvin, which is most likely the case.  “But it feels pretty disrespectful to be moving on to someone so public so quickly.”  Read more: Taylor Swift caught gazing at Tom Hiddleston while she was still with Calvin Harris after spending the evening together  (Image: REX)  The new couple also spent the night together before the gala event.

59c392ca-bbe1-4b10-a6e5-2c08f034f6f7,"Artist, DJ, and producer Tim Bergling, a.k.a. Avicii, died Friday afternoon in Oman, according to a statement from his rep. He was 28.  “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” the statement reads. “He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”  One of the most popular and successful electronic dance-music artists of all time — he scored a No. 4 hit on the Billboard 200 in 2013 with “Wake Me Up” and regularly appeared in the Top 5 of Forbes’ “Highest-Paid DJs” lists — he retired from live performing in 2016 at the peak of his success, citing health reasons. He had suffered from health problems for several years, including acute pancreatitis, in part due to excessive drinking. He had his gallbladder and appendix removed in 2014.  He posted the following statement on his website last year:  “WE ALL REACH A POINT IN OUR LIVES AND CAREERS WHERE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT MATTERS THE MOST TO US.  For me it’s creating music. That is what I live for, what I feel I was born to do.  Related Celebrities Who Died in 2018  Last year I quit performing live, and many of you thought that was it. But the end of live never meant the end of Avicii or my music. Instead, I went back to the place where it all made sense – the studio.  The next stage will be all about my love of making music to you guys. It is the beginning of something new.  Hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I do.”  Bergling was born in Stockholm on Sept. 8, 1989. He began DJing as a teenager and released his first single in 2007. He released a large number of singles and remixes in the following years and rapidly built a reputation as a live act. He broke through with his 2010 hit “Seek Bromance,” which charted in several European countries; he signed a publishing deal with EMI the same year. He explained his chosen DJ name as “the lowest level of Buddhist hell,” chosen because his real name was already being used by another Tim Bergling on MySpace.  His 2011 single “Levels,” which was later nominated for a Grammy Award, vaulted him into the mainstream, charting in multiple European countries and topping the chart in his native Sweden. “Sunshine,” his 2012 collaboration with David Guetta, was nominated for a Grammy for best dance recording. In September of that year, he became the first DJ to headline New York’s prestigious Radio City Music Hall; at those two shows, he previewed a new song with Mike Posner titled “Stay with You.”  His proper debut album, “True,” was released on September 2013, much of which was previewed during his headlining set at the Ultra Music Festival earlier that year. The album featured “Wake Me Up,” a collaboration with Aloe Blacc, which topped the charts in multiple countries across the world and was No. 1 for a record 14 weeks on Billboard’s Dance/Electronic Songs chart; it was also the U.K.’s fastest-selling single of 2013. Other singers on the album included Adam Lambert and Audra Mae. He also worked with Madonna during this period and contributed to two songs on her 2015 album “Rebel Heart,” although both parties seemed unhappy with the collaboration and Avicii said the final versions were quite different from his demos.  The extent of his popularity was reflected in a 2014 “Saturday Night Live” digital short called “When Will the Bass Drop?,” with comic Andy Samberg playing a fictional mega-DJ named “Davvincii” (although he was made up to look more like David Guetta).  However, as his popularity rose, his health declined. He was hospitalized in March 2014 and cancelled several tour appearances; not long after, he collaborated with Carlos Santana and Wyclef on the official FIFA World Cut Anthem “We Will Find a Way.” Also that year, he produced a song on Coldplay’s album “Ghost Stories.” He released his second full-length album, “Stories,” in October 2015.  In March of 2016, he performed at the Ultra Music Festival, premiering new material, but 10 days later announced that he was retiring from performing. He made a final live appearance in August in Ibiza. In December, he parted ways with longtime manager Ash Pournouri.  In August of 2017 he released a six-track EP entitled “Avici,” which he said was the first of three installments that would be his next album. He followed a month later with a full-length documentary called “True Stories,” which was largely about his retirement. In it, promoters are seen trying to convince him to continue touring, even though he’s in obvious physical pain. “I looked at myself like, ‘F—, you should’ve really stood up for yourself more there. Come on, Tim!,'” he said of the documentary to Rolling Stone in an interview published last September. “Why didn’t I stop the ship earlier?”  “I needed to figure out my life,” he continued. “The whole thing was about success for the sake of success. I wasn’t getting any happiness anymore. Now that I have more time in the studio, I want to learn as much about other genres as possible. That’s what I love the most – having a session with Nile Rodgers, for instance, and getting an understanding of music that’s invaluable.”  RELATED CONTENT  Musicians, Celebrities Pay Tribute to Avicii  Avicii’s Biggest Hits (Listen)  ‘Avicii: True Stories’ Documentary Reveals Star DJ’s Struggles With Health, Fame and Early Retirement  Avicii’s Life and Career in Photos  POPULAR ON VARIETY",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1150

18ff2a21-e69a-49e2-8b26-ae31c65377d5,"So it seems that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have finally decided to go public with their romance which the two have managed to keep under wraps for years now. The ongoing denials by each star certainly had the masses scratching their heads seeing as the duo were often seen in one another’s company on getaways and at various locales in Los Angeles.  Reasons for Katie and Jamie not going public earlier are rumored to be due to a contract that was signed by Holmes during her swift divorce proceedings with her ex-husband Tom Cruise. The contract was said to have included a five-year dating clause which meant that the Dawson’s Creek star was not allowed to date publicly for this duration. Well, that was back in 2012, so the five years are up, which leads onlookers to believe that the contract was a real binding agreement.  Additional claims, since Jamie and Katie were spotted walking in Malibu holding hands, have been made regarding Cruise’s reaction to his ex and former co-star coming clean about their relationship. The action star is reportedly “furious” and “envious” about the relationship between Holmes and Foxx and feels a sense of betrayal over it all, as International Business Times states.  A said source indicates that Tom is bothered by the romance and that “Katie is so happy with someone else,” adding that “Tom would love to find his own true love, someone he can share the rest of his life with too. ”  ‘Katie Holmes finally goes public with new man Jamie Foxx, I’m questioning why she ever agreed to marry Tom Cruise’https://t.co/NWx1Ogo3ml — The Sun (@TheSun) September 10, 2017  It’s been no secret that Cruise’s relationship with the Church of Scientology has caused both of his marriages to fail and if the star is to find love again, it must be with the approval of the faith. As for Tom being “furious,” this seems a bit far-fetched seeing as the actor was snapped looking as happy as can be, even after news broke that Katie and Jamie are, in fact, an item.  Tom Cruise is pictured for the first time since ex-wife Katie Holmes confirmed her relationship with Jamie Foxx https://t.co/BqKD4cDrxm — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) September 6, 2017  As The Sun indicated, Cruise recently landed in London and fans awaiting the Hollywood heartthrob were greeted with an ear-to-ear smile from Tom, who also gave an enthusiastic thumbs up. The actor had recently been injured while filming the latest installment for the Mission Impossible franchise, yet looked much better and entirely unaffected by the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx reveal.

f86a533c-fa67-42a8-aa45-7535959ed06a,"Which celebrities are most likely to have had nose jobs? The subject is a hotly debated one. Some celebs come clean and admit that they've had work done, including a ""nose job"" (rhinoplasty). Others definitely look like they've had some sort of plastic surgery, but they won't say one way or the other. This list includes many celebrities who are suspect, including celebrities with big noses who all of a sudden look different one day. Everyone listed here is rumored to have had a nose job, or has openly admitted to having one. Some are obvious, while others are far more subtle. Vote for the celebs you think have gone under the knife to alter their appearance by getting a nose job – and add anyone that might be missing, too!  Celebrities who are rumored to have had nose jobs include Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Zac Efron, Natalie Portman, Patrick Dempsey, Megyn Kelly, Tom Cruise, Ellen Barkin, and Blake Lively. Nose job surgery isn't a huge deal, but these celebs like to keep their privacy. With some celebrities, spotting a nose job is rather obvious: Jennifer Aniston, anyone? And of course, no list of celebs and/or nose jobs would be complete without the Queen of Plastic Surgery, Joan Rivers. She openly admits having multiple procedures over several decades.  Things don't always turn out well, especially when multiple plastic surgeries (and nose jobs) are involved (La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson, La Toya Jackson). Anytime anyone goes under the knife for any reason, it's a risk – to both health, and career. Jennifer Grey has said that getting a nose job ruined her career (no one recognized her)!  Celebrities who may (or may not) have had nose jobs also include supermodels. Gisele Bundchen and Kate Moss are both suspect, for example. There's no hard proof, but looking at older photos, it's hard not to wonder. Maybe the celeb just grew into their nose –or maybe not. If they're suspect, they're on the list. Period.  Not everyone, though, is so forthcoming about whether they have or haven't had a nose job. That's why this list exists! Sometimes it's hard to be sure, but you suspect it. And if you suspect it? Vote here for the celebrities you think are most likely to have had nose jobs.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,468
c343488b-9577-42cd-8479-c7c5678e2894,"Don’t expect the arrival of Khloé Kardashian’s first child to heal old wounds. In a new interview, the pregnant reality star said that having a baby won’t mend her estranged relationship with Caitlyn Jenner.  “I don’t think that affects anything with Caitlyn,” Kardashian, 33, told Ross King on the U.K. morning show Lorraine on Thursday, February 8. “[Things are] just as they are.”  Jenner’s relationship with the Kardashian family has been rocky since the Olympian, 68, revealed her identity as a transgender woman in April 2015. Two years later, the estrangement worsened after the release of Jenner’s memoir, The Secrets of My Life, in which she claimed that ex-wife Kris Jenner — who is Kardashian’s mother — was not supportive of her transition. (Kris and Caitlyn, formerly Bruce, were married from 1991 to 2015 and share daughters Kendall, 22, and Kylie, 20.)  Caitlyn opened up about the family feud in November. “It’s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,” she admitted while speaking to students at Cambridge Union in England at the time. “To be honest, I don’t talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year. They don’t want me in their lives. They bashed me pretty badly. It’s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.”  The I Am Cait alum still has a close relationship with Kendall and Kylie, though. In fact, a source recently told Us Weekly exclusively that Caitlyn has already met the Lip Kit creator’s newborn daughter, Stormi. The proud grandparent later confirmed the news on Instagram, writing, “My daughter just had a daughter. It’s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She’s SO beautiful already. Can’t wait to watch her grow.”  Meanwhile, Khloé is seven months pregnant with her first child, a boy, with her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson.

The country star and his wife, Brittany, announced the news via Instagram on July 10 with a photo of his 7-month-old son.  In the picture, Memphis is lounging in a onesie that reads: Big Brother.  Aldean has two older daughters, Keeley and Kendyl, from his first marriage, and he made no secret of the fact that he and Brittany planned to have another child as soon as possible after he and Brittany welcomed Memphis on Dec. 1, 2017.  ""Our theory is, 'Hey, we got one in diapers and formula right now so, while we're in this mindset we might as well knock it out,'"" Aldean told Taste of Country Nights in April . ""We both agreed that we wanted to have two. I have two older daughters and there's a pretty big age difference in my two older daughters and Memphis, so we wanted to have one who's a little closer in age to him so he has somebody to hang out with.""  These Country Singers Have All Welcomed Babies in 2018:  Fans can probably look forward to Aldean and Brittany sharing quite a bit of her second pregnancy with fans.

3ae5869e-09c4-4ab4-aca1-97e9d30c38b6,"President Trump has zero impulse control. That’s why he flip-flops on issues, sends a constant stream of ill-conceived tweets, can’t keep his hands off women, and never misses an opportunity to shoot himself in the foot. Recently, former George W. Bush adviser Steve Schmidt called Trump out for his childish behavior. “Clearly, we have a 71-year-old president of the United States who has the impulse control of a little child, who feels aggrieved, who’s resentful, who’s a constant victim,” he told MSNBC.  As someone who has lived on the surface of the Earth for over 70 years, Trump should know that one of the worst things you can do is stare directly at the sun. One prolonged gaze into our solar system’s center of energy can cause permanent eye damage. “The light from the sun is very intense and concentrated into a very small area, and then that light is converted into heat and that heat cooks the retina,” said Joel Schuman, chair of ophthalmology at New York University’s Langone Health. “So you have a permanent area that you don’t see, a permanent blind spot.”  On Monday, when Trump stood in front of reporters on the Truman Balcony at the White House with his wife, Melania, and his son, Barron, he had one job: resist the temptation to stare directly at the sun. Even after a White House aid yelled, “Don’t look at it!” our ever-defiant leader with self-described “very good brain” craned his neck, squinted his eyes, and stared directly into the sun.  Later Monday night, he’ll address the country on the ongoing war in Afghanistan.  Someone shouts ""don't look"" as Pres.

And, they may soon be neighbors with a very famous family, according to a new report!  Justin Bieber, 23, and Selena Gomez, 25, aren’t wasting any time rekindling their longtime romance. The newly reconciled pair are in search of their dream home together, according to In Touch Weekly. Justin and Selena “want a fresh start together on neutral ground. The only way they can do that is by buying a place that neither of them has lived in before,” the source admits. Now, the pair are reportedly looking to purchase a home together in either Calabasas [aka Kardashian territory] or Hidden Hills, near LA. “Finding the perfect place takes a while,” the insider says, adding, “So, the plan is to live at Selena’s until they find their dream home.”  And, it appears as though the couple couldn’t wait to shack up together, as the source says Justin’s already living in Selena’s LA home. The mag reports that there were moving vans spotted outside Sel’s mansion on Nov. 16. The insider claims movers transported Justin’s belongings into her home. “When Selena and Justin first got back together, Justin slowly started leaving stuff there. Now the majority of his things are in her house.”  This report comes after HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY revealed that Justin has been spending a lot of time at Selena’s LA home. “Justin and Selena are moving fast this time around,” a source told us. “Justin has been spending several nights a week at Selena’s home in Los Angeles and they have been inseparable lately… the pair are practically living together already. “  Despite Jelena’s quick-moving romance, the pair did not spend the Thanksgiving holiday together.

She started out on The Real Housewives of Atlanta and even has her own show now called Don’t Be Tardy.

Kim said she couldn’t do a show like this for a network that didn’t respect her and it sounds like they are great about working with her.

Kim is fine with that most of the time. Viewers have seen her fight with the kids and more on their show.  So what does Kim Zolciak-Biermann think is a downside to having the cameras around all the time? She said, “That’s the only real down side is where there is something like super major going on that’s kind of difficult.” Kim was talking about the time when her son Kash was attacked by a dog. The cameramen were there and filming. Kash was hurt pretty bad and had to have surgery.  It does look like Kim Zolciak-Biermann is going to let the fans see some of what went down with Kash when he was attacked. So far, Kim hasn’t revealed a lot like who the dog belonged to or how it went down.

1e1918b4-ca05-4b47-9318-81db6c6ae612,"EXCLUSIVE: Johnny Depp and his former business managers will not be kicking off a potential messy and revealing trial over the Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald star’s long-held fraud claims of $25 million next month after all.  After a long weekend in which attorneys for both Depp and the Management Group went hard, the parries reached a confidential settlement, I hear. While no one is talking, both sides in what has been a sometimes bitter and revelatory legal knife fight are happy with the deal, Deadline has learned.  Prodded by a Los Angeles judge and overseen by a retired one, the managed mediation between Depp’s lawyer and TMG’s reps from Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP comes after the actor’s primary attorney Ben Chew of Washington D.C.’s Brown Rudick failed late last month to get the August 15 starting trial pushed back. It’s rare for a plaintiff to seek a delay in a trial that they requested, and the unusual hearing came on the heels of a long Rolling Stone profile of the Depp that pretty much everyone agrees was not a winner for the actor. Another factor in the agreement hammered out over talks on Saturday and Sunday was Depp finally sitting down for a frequently postponed deposition in the matter back in May in L.A.  Now, with the deal sealed, all that’s old news and all that is left is the formalities.  Which means, if things go as they usually do in these things, that in the next couple of weeks, dismissal filings are likely to pop up in L.A. Superior Court dropping Depp’s initial action of January 2017 and the commission-seeking cross-complaint that soon followed. The November 2017 action for judicial foreclosure against several of the actor’s City of Angels properties by TMG over a $5 million loan that they said that made to him will also be closed.  Following the submission of that paperwork, the settlement agreement is expected to be approved before the August 15 trial start date, which is basically a moot note on the calendar at this point. A fact that will make Warner Bros very happy as sources say that the studio was not looking forward to a public hearing of The Crimes of Grindelwald’s marketing campaign and opening this fall of the latest installment in this J.K. Rowling’s franchise being flooded by headlines of Depp’s allegedly excessive spending habits and dwindling financial resources.  While the bloodletting between the actor and TMG is over now, the settlement in that matter does not, however, end the other litigation tidal waves that the Pirates of the Caribbean star is wading through. Depp still has to contend with a lawsuit from his ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorneyJacob Bloom and his. Claiming cahoots with TMG, the actor went after Bloom Hergott Diemer Rosenthal LaViolette Feldman Schenkman & Goodman LLP for $30 million last fall. They went right back after him a couple of months later as the actor seemed for a while to be shedding lawyers at an alarming rate  In addition, Depp’s legal dance card was hit last week with an assault and battery lawsuit from the location manager of the upcoming City of Lies.  So, let’s call it one down, a lot more to go when it comes to Johnny Depp and the courts right now.  In terms of the now-dimmed fraud lawsuit that started all this back in early 2017, representatives for TMG contacted by Deadline had no comment on the outcome of the Saturday and Sunday sit-down. Representatives for Depp did not respond to request for comment on the matter.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,684
86fef29c-3268-456d-b28f-9cd4b0d4a3b9,"While the love story of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux had its fans, sources close to the couple questioned whether it would last, E! News is reporting.  Sure, Aniston and Theroux are both beautiful and talented. One appeal of this love story is that Theroux was well-cast as the hero to rescue Aniston, America’s TV sweetheart, from her supposed heartbreak after Brad Pitt divorced her in 2005 to marry Angelina Jolie.  Theroux is dark, handsome and chiseled (his form is well on display in HBO’s “The Leftovers.”). He also brought to their Hollywood power coupling hipster/artist cred as both an accomplished screenwriter and as a director and actor for Broadway, film and TV.  E! News pointed out that the couple had genuine chemistry and love for each other. On the other hand, “they were never really suited to one another,” people close to the couple told the outlet.  For these people, it’s not surprising that Aniston and Theroux announced Thursday that they were separating.  “They have always just been two very different people with very different characters who just happened to fall in love,” a source told E! “He’s more nomadic, more of a free spirit, he’s rugged and urban and Jennifer just isn’t that kind of person.”  Their romance became public in 2011, a year after they filmed “Wanderlust,” a comedy in which Aniston plays a married urban filmmaker who has an affair with the leader of a hippie commune, played by Theroux.  Theroux may have fallen hard for Aniston but he reportedly was bothered by the intense media scrutiny that came with dating the actress, who became adored for her comedic talent and her signature hair styles while starring on the hit sitcom “Friends.” Because of the regular paparazzi presence, especially in Los Angeles, the more social Theroux had to adapt to the reclusive lifestyle that Aniston had come to accept as Brad Pitt’s wife of five years.  Because of these and other differences, few of Theroux’s friends were “fully on board” with the relationship, E! News said.  The couple married in 2015 in what sounded like an intimate but star-studded ceremony in the garden of their $21-million Bel-Air estate.  Actress, comedian and writer Amy Sedaris, a friend of Theroux’s, told Aniston in a Harper’s Bazaar interview that “everything about that wedding was perfect.”  “Everyone was dressed like a bunch of woodland creatures, and your dress looked so beautiful and breezy,” Sedaris said.  But the bliss didn’t last, according to reports coming since Thursday. The reports include the possibility that the couple began living apart this past summer. Sources near Theroux’s New York apartment told TMZ that Aniston had been absent from his West Village residence since August.  Sources said they saw Theroux in the West Village “all the time,” but that Aniston stopped coming. The last known photo of them together at the apartment was from Oct. 1, TMZ said.  Over the fall, Aniston and Theroux also were fending off a tabloid report in Life & Style that they were fighting over whether to live in New York City or Los Angeles, according to Gossip Cop. Life & Style reported that Aniston had recently come to the realization that “she’s just not cut out for city life” after spending a few weeks with her husband in their New York apartment.  Meanwhile Theroux wasn’t crazy about making Los Angeles their home base, Life & Style said. But in an interview with Gossip Cop, a representative for Aniston shot down the story that they were fighting over which coast to live on.  People magazine said Thursday that it was “telling” that Theroux didn’t pose with Aniston for an extensive photo shoot at their Bel-Air mansion for a recent cover story for Architectural Digest. The only photo of Theroux shows him outside with his motorcycles.  Aniston purchased the home for $21 million in 2011, and the couple spent two years carrying out extensive renovations on the modern, minimalist property that was billed as “their love nest,” according to various reports.  But Aniston admitted to Architectural Digest that the collaboration was initially a struggle for her. When she was single, she carried out home renovation projects on her own.  “Justin definitely wanted to be involved, so there was a bit of a learning curve for me on how to include another voice in the design process,” she admitted in the feature. “For instance, I figured out that immediately saying ‘No!’ to any suggestion is not the most collaborative move.”  People also noted that a feature in Architectural Digest is also looked at by many as a precursor to putting a home on the market.  Meanwhile, in their joint statement Thursday, Aniston and Theroux said they made their decision to separate at the end of the year. They were last photographed together on vacation in Cabo San Lucas over New Year’s, according to E! News.  It now appears that the couple, who have vowed to stay good friends, took the trip to Mexico to either make one last attempt to save their marriage or as a way to say good-bye.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,999

d07dccef-92a5-4ee0-8d67-9e0675f184fd,"[Warning: This story contains major spoilers from episode 808, ""How It's Gotta Be,"" of AMC's The Walking Dead, as well as the comic book series on which the show is based.]  Given the magnitude of the twist, it's no surprise that many Walking Dead fans are upset about the looming departure of Carl Grimes, the young survivor played since season one by Chandler Riggs — and that list includes Riggs' own father, who took to social media to express his disappointment in Walking Dead showrunner Scott M. Gimple over how his son's exit was handled.  ""Watching Gimple fire my son 2 weeks before his 18th birthday after telling him they wanted him for the next 3 years was disappointing,"" Riggs' father wrote on Facebook following the AMC zombie drama's midseason finale, in which Carl was revealed to be suffering from a fatal zombie bite. ""I never trusted Gimple or AMC, but Chandler did. I know how much it hurt him. But we do absolutely know how lucky we have been to be a part of it all and appreciate all the love from fans all these years!""  Speaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Riggs stated the decision to leave The Walking Dead was not his own, despite speculation that he was eyeing an exit in order to focus on college.  ""I'm taking a gap year right now to focus on acting for a while. Leaving Walking Dead wasn't my decision,"" Riggs told THR. ""I was planning on going to college until I found out. I found out when I was doing rehearsals for episode six back in June. It was quite the shocker for me, Andy and everyone because I don't think anyone saw it coming. It's definitely not a bad thing because it has been awesome being on the show but now I get to go and do a lot of other stuff that I haven't gotten to do before. Scott wanted to meet in person because it was such a big deal. We had just finished rehearsing for a scene in episode six and he wanted to meet with me and my mom and dad and talk about what's going to happen.""  ""That is a bite on his side. … It will play out as bites play out on the show,"" Gimple said Sunday on AMC's post-show Talking Dead, speaking about the character's exit. ""It's very important to Carl's story and the entire story, what happens in the next episode. I'm just focused on the fact that Carl right now is alive and he has some business to attend to. That is a one-way ticket. But I'd like to think that the things we see in the next episode are so important to his life and the other characters' lives.""  Riggs' impending exit from The Walking Dead is a shock for a number of reasons, including the fact that he is one of only five castmembers from the original season who still appear on the show. One of the others, Lennie James (Morgan), will depart The Walking Dead this season as well, joining the cast of Fear the Walking Dead for its fourth season.  What's more, Carl remains an active presence in the Walking Dead comic books from Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlard, on which the show is based. Many fans believed Carl would one day assume the lead role in the series, including Andrew Lincoln, who plays Rick Grimes, and has subsequently described Carl's demise as ""the biggest death"" of the entire series.  ""My first reaction was silence,"" Lincoln told THR about his first reaction to learning of Carl's death. ""Scott Gimple called me up and said, 'You're going to hate this one.' He's very good about alerting the cast when there's going to be a [character] death. I tried guessing four times and was nowhere near Chandler Riggs' name. Scott had to say that it was Carl. I just didn't speak for a minute. I always thought Carl was going to be the one who led the show forward; that Rick would hand over his boots and revolver when he walked off into the sunset in season 28.""  In the comics, Carl plays a central role in one of the story's most recent arcs, ""The Whisperer War,"" as his relationship with an outsider named Lydia causes a conflict between the Alexandrians and a group of survivors called the Whisperers, who walk among the walkers using flesh suits as camouflage.  ""I was excited to do a lot of those storylines in the comics because there's a lot of really cool stuff,"" Riggs told THR. ""I'm more excited to do other things than The Walking Dead than I was excited about doing those things on Walking Dead.""  AMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.

Splash News  Earlier this week, Bella Thorne took to Snapchat to show off a large bouquet of flowers that she received. A few hours later, Kourtney Kardashian took to Snapchat to show off a huge bouquet of flowers that she received.  Both sets of flowers looking quite similar in size, type and color.  According to multiple reports, the flowers were sent to both women by Scott -- perhaps as a bit of mea culpa for his recent behavior.  TMZ (who has images of the flowers) reported on June 15 that Bella's flowers were indeed sent from Scott. Bella shared the image in which her hair matched the color of the roses. ""Now I match z flowers,"" she said.  Scott, if you'll recall, took Bella to the Cannes Film Festival and proceeded to flirt with a parade of women.

Buzz60  After Bachelor Nation witnessed her emotional departure, Bekah Martinez (aka Bekah M.) appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Monday night. And while she did talk about her disappearance from Arie Luyendyk Jr.'s season of ABC's dating show, it was her appearance on a Humboldt County, Calif. missing persons list that was largely on Kimmel's mind.  Humboldt County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Samantha Karges told The North Coast Journal Martinez was reported missing on Nov. 18 by her mother who had not heard from her since Nov. 12. Karges said, ""Martinez had reportedly come to Humboldt County to work on a marijuana farm.""  Offering an explanation as to why she made the missing person's list, Martinez said, ""A lot of people thought I lied to my mother saying that I was on a farm when I was actually on The Bachelor, but no. I had already been eliminated from the show, and I just decided to go up to the mountains with some friends for a couple of weeks.""  ""I was there for six or seven days without phone service, which I thought I was going to have phone service and I told my mother that I would,"" she continued.  Martinez told the late night host that after about a week she felt a strong inclination to return home.  ""I just had this weird feeling on like the sixth or seventh day, I was like, 'I need to go home now,'"" she said. ""So, I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents and then come to find out only 12 hours before my mother had called the Humboldt (County) Sheriff’s (Office) saying that I was missing.""  So what was Martinez doing on a marijuana farm exactly? Trying to spice up her Bachelor lower third in case she appears on the franchise again? Not quite, she explained.  ""To set the record straight, I’m not a weed farmer,"" she said. ""I am still a nanny in L.A., but, yes, my friends have a weed farm up in Humboldt County.""  As for how she's doing after getting eliminated, Martinez said, ""I'm hanging in there. It was shocking for me as well, but I'm picking up the pieces as I go along.""

Khloe Kardashian, 34, has been continuing to try and make her relationship with baby daddy Tristan Thompson, 27, work after his shocking cheating scandal went public back in Apr. but some of her close family and friends believe it may not be a good thing. “Plenty of people in Khloe‘s life are questioning her decision to keep trying so much and giving so much to Tristan but it’s not their choice to make,” a Kardashian insider EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Khloe is following her heart and doing what she feels is best for her and her daughter. She doesn’t want to give up and Tristan has made it clear he wants a future with her and six-month-old True. People have accused her of being in denial about their future but Khloe insists she’s not in denial, she’s just choosing to move past the negativity and find happiness.”  Khloe’s ability to forgive and try to make things better between her and her basketball player beau is impressive considering how difficult things were for her in the days right before giving birth. The cheating scandal and Khloe’s labor were spotlighted in the latest episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and the new mom took to her social media account before it aired to reveal that it was tough for her to watch the intense scenes.  “Tonight’s episode is an uncomfortable and super emotional one for me, but when we signed up for this show over a decade ago, we signed up for a reality show, which meant showing you guys inside our lives, the good, the bad and the ugly,” Khloe wrote in a caption on Instagram. “To relive these moments all over again is incredibly difficult emotionally but I also hope that with every trail [SIC], tribulation and curve ball life throws at us, that we ALL get to learn from our journeys.”  Although Khloe has been working hard on the relationship, she admitted that her initial reaction to Tristan’s alleged cheating was a lot more intense than was seen on camera. She was in Cleveland, OH at the time, where Tristan’s basketball team, the Cleveland Cavaliers are based, and there were no cameras there to witness her response but she did give a hint as to how it was to her followers on Twitter. “Oh well thank God a camera was NOT with me in Cleveland!!!

After two seasons and 20 episodes, the E! network on Tuesday announced they will not renew The Arrangement, one of its two scripted series, for a third season.  The fictional celebrity drama, which certainly never mined the Church of Scientology and the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes for source material, aired what turned out to be its series finale on May 13. That episode, titled ""Suite Revenge,"" was--at least for a short time--regarded as the Season 2 finale. It was seen by 432,000 viewers and drew a 1.8 rating in the 18-49 demo.  ""Over two seasons, E!'s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,"" wrote an E! spokesperson in a statement to Deadline on Tuesday. ""While we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.""  The Arrangement was produced by Universal Cable Productions and starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan.  The series stylized itself as a high-stakes Hollywood love story exploring the bizarre and sinister underbelly of incredible fame. Ratings for its first season in the spring of 2017 were fruitful by cable standards, having drawn an average of 1.3 million viewers overall and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo. Most commendably, the show became the year's second-most watched new scripted cable drama with women ages 18-34.  Despite its strong start, ratings for Season 2 declined by double digits and the show reached its low point in the middle of this year's 10-episode spring run with a stretch of episodes viewed by 400,000 people or less.  ""Sad to say I got the call that #TheArrangement won't be coming back for a 3rd season,"" tweeted creator, executive producer and writer Jonathan Abrahams early Tuesday night. ""There's grieving to be sure but also gratitude for the opportunity and the experience of working with so many wonderful and talented people. Thanks for all your support, twitter peeps.

As of now, The Royals stands alone as E!'s only remaining scripted series; sticking out like a bearskin hat in a mob of reality programming (Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Total Bellas, Botched) and celebrity docuseries like Citizen Rose, Very Cavallari and Model Squad.  For its part, The Royals also suffered a marked downturn in ratings this year. Its fate is additionally in limbo following the December 2017 ouster of creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn over sexual harassment allegations.  While a twin-killing of scripted fare could be in the offing at the network, E! is reportedly in the early stages of developing a scripted pilot from writer Michael Patrick King called Juicy Stories.  On Tuesday night, Arrangement creator Jonathan Abrahams fielded tweets from disappointed fans of the show.

Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are taking aim at the constant tabloid rumors claiming that they’re having children. The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple’s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend – who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale – while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet “Go Ahead And Break My Heart” as they both stopped by Shelton’s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting “Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!” as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That’s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all “lucky” to have her perform because she’d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  “You guys are very lucky that [she’s here],” Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  “She actually gave birth to twins yesterday,” the country star then joked of how they’re hounded by pregnancy rumors, “and she’s here tonight to sing with me.”  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC’s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  #summer2017 ❤️love u guys gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jul 7, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Charley Gallay / Getty Images  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine’s Day – likely due to Shelton’s busy touring schedule – Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen – who’s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo – shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.

The “Law & Order: SVU” beauty, who finalized her contentious divorce from chef Flay last year, and Benton — the mogul behind high-flying tech fund Andor Capital Management — were spotted “looking very close” at a black-tie Whitney Museum gala on Tuesday where Leonard Lauder was honored.  A source further said that March and Benton have been together since October — “very quietly dating for six months,” said the source, adding the two are “crazy about each other.”  March was beaming in a pink gown with Benton by her side at the Whitney gala that was a sea of black frocks and tuxes. Among guests were artists Chuck Close, Ed Ruscha, Brice Marden and Frank Stella, gallerists Barbara Gladstone and Arne Glimcher, arts patrons Brooke Garber Neidich, Beth Rudin DeWoody and Anne Bass, museum director Adam Weinberg, and Ronald and Jo Carole Lauder.  Benton, who’s divorced from Axel Capital Management founder Anna Nikolayevsky, bought a 730 Park Ave. duplex in 2012 with his then-wife for $39 million. Harvard MBA whiz Benton launched Andor in 2001 after he was Wall Street’s fourth-highest earner in 2000 — making $100 million, behind Steve Cohen, who was No. 2 with $137 million, according to Forbes. Andor holds stakes in Tesla, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon.  In comparison, Flay’s reported net worth is a meager $20 million.

March said in an interview last October, around the time she began dating Benton, “It’s been quite a year,” and she wanted to “[hug] everyone I love 1,000 times over . . .

0f00a80f-1418-4a12-a6d2-a6b7fd45690c,"When I first walked into the Astros’ offices, which are located in the shell of Houston’s old Union Station abutting Minute Maid Park, on the morning of June 4, 2014, the club was still the laughingstock of baseball. Since the start of the 2011 season, the Astros had lost nearly twice as many games, 358, as they had won, 187. Worse, they were run by executives who were still viewed as know-it-all baseball outsiders—like the G.M., former management consultant Jeff Luhnow, and the so-called Director of Decision Sciences, the former NASA engineer Sig Mejdal—even though the men had at that point worked within the game for a decade. Worst of all, Luhnow and his execs were openly violating the baseball compact by which rebuilding teams were supposed to obscure their long-term plan by maintaining the illusion that they were genuinely trying to win each and every year, even if it meant losing just a little less.  “When you’re in 2017, you don’t really care that much about whether you lost 98 or 107 in 2012,” Luhnow said back then. “You care about how close we are to winning a championship in 2017.” In other words, they were entirely focused on several years down the line, which meant shedding every one of their expensive assets and starting from scratch. People hated it.  Still, a few days later I flew back to New York with the makings of a 5,000-word story that would appear in the June 24 issue Sports Illustrated, with a bold cover line: YOUR 2017 WORLD SERIES CHAMPS featuring the sorry Astros. SI’s editor Chris Stone and I, along with baseball editor Emma Span, had consulted on the proper year to choose. We settled on 2017 because the Astros’ young nucleus would by then be reaching its prime, because it seemed to more or less hew to the front office’s own timeline—which, they promised, would eventually include a payroll hike—and because three years, in baseball, is actually not the blink of an eye.  But many people, including some within our own office, hated the cover, too. Even the club’s own hometown paper, the Houston Chronicle, called it “more of an attention-grabbing, perhaps even tongue-in-cheek projection than a prediction.”  It was certainly a long shot, but so is everything in baseball. Vegas usually assigns a given season’s spring favorite less than a 20% chance of winning that fall’s World Series. What it wasn’t was empty clickbait, or a hot take. While we’re never above generating interesting conversations, my editors and I genuinely believed that what I saw down in Houston could result in a ring in three seasons. Now, the Astros are four games away from coming through on that prediction.  Of course, immediately after the issue reached mailboxes and newsstands, the Astros seemed to draw further away from the meeting the deadline we’d publicly set for them, in ways I described last month in an SI feature which focused on their recent last second trade for Justin Verlander. The 2015 Rookie of the Year, shortstop Carlos Correa, spent the second half of the season on the bench with a broken leg. George Springer, who had appeared on the cover, hit the DL. Their proprietary database, Ground Control, was revealed to have been hacked—by, it turned out, the former Cardinals scouting director Chris Correa, a former coworker of Luhnow’s and of several other Houston executives when they were all with St. Louis. (Correa—who, court documents suggested, was driven to increase his hacking efforts out of jealousy spurred by the SI cover, is now serving a 46-month prison sentence for unauthorized access of a protected computer.) Luhnow failed to sign the No. 1 pick in the 2014 draft, high school lefthander Brady Aiken, after the club detected an issue with Aiken’s elbow and decreased its offer to him. One of the Astros’ minor league stadiums flooded, and another caught on fire.  There were other mishaps and missteps along the way. “If we ever catch ourselves feeling smart, all we have to do is turn on SportsCenter,” Mejdal told me. There, as often as not, they could catch J.D. Martinez hitting another home run—the same J.D. Martinez whom Houston cut outright in March 2014, and who since then has an OPS (.936) higher than all but six other hitters in the majors. If Martinez wasn’t homering that night, then Kris Bryant probably was, the same Kris Bryant on whom the Astros passed with the top overall pick in 2013, in favor of the polished college pitcher Mark Appel. Appel had a 5.60 ERA in Triple-A this season—in the Phillies organization, where he was traded in December of 2015. Bryant, whom the Cubs picked No. 2 in `13, is the reigning NL MVP.  The Astros, though, never claimed to own a crystal ball, or that they would never make a mistake. They always expected to make many of them. Their goal was to make marginally more correct decisions than their competitors, in the long haul, and to do so they implemented an analytically rigorous system that not only processed all of the bleeding edge metrics they could find or create, but also heavily incorporated data from old fashioned sources: scouts, who could see things about a player’s potential and character that numbers couldn’t.  Many of those decisions have now paid off. Such as surprising baseball by drafting Correa—Carlos, not Chris—with the top pick in 2012, a move heavily endorsed by current assistant G.M. Mike Elias and one which not only gave them a star shortstop but also the financial room to choose starter Lance McCullers 41st overall. In McCullers’ most recent appearance, he shut out the Yankees over the final four innings of Game 7 of the ALCS. And declining to sign Aiken—who would indeed blow out his elbow nine months after the draft—and thus receiving a compensatory pick that they would use the next year on third baseman Alex Bregman, who has emerged as the star of the 2015 draft and was last seen making the pivotal and most risky defensive play of Game 7, nailing Greg Bird at home to keep the Yankees scoreless.  How about trading for Verlander, even though their metrics didn’t at all favor sacrificing three promising prospects for a 34-year-old with a contract guaranteeing him $28 million a year? It’s virtually impossible to imagine them making the World Series without the ALCS MVP. Or signing expensive free agents this past winter, like Carlos Beltran (one year, $16 million), Charlie Morton (two years, $14 million) and Josh Reddick (four years, $52 million)? Or hanging on to selected young players they’d inherited from the previous front office, particularly Springer, Jose Altuve and Dallas Keuchel?  Luck played its role, too—but the Astros’ plan, and the extended timeframe for their rebuilding effort permitted by owner Jim Crane, allowed room for good fortune. In the first season after Luhnow and his crew took over, 2012, Keuchel was a clean-shaven 24-year-old rookie who walked more batters (39) than he struck out (38), and Altuve was an undersized slap-hitter with nine career home runs. The front office had no idea that Keuchel would develop a devastating breaking ball and a more athletic delivery, as well as extraordinary facial hair, to become a Cy Young winner, or that Altuve, though still undersized, would develop into a power hitting, probable MVP. What they had was time to allow unexpected things like that to happen, as well as the analytical horsepower to expose players to every conceivable pathway by which they might improve.  Now they’re on the cusp of doing a few of the most unexpected thing of all: no, not making it seem as if we at Sports Illustrated know what we’re talking about—though, thanks for that—but winning the World Series just three years after completing their sixth straight losing season.  They’re still the underdog. Of eight SI baseball staffers who on Monday predicted the World Series’ outcome, just one picked the Astros to beat the Dodgers, and you can probably guess who that was without clicking that link. But even if they don’t do it this year, they are a team built to win in the long haul, as was always the plan. Just four members of the World Series roster—DH Carlos Beltran, outfielder Cameron Maybin and relievers Luke Gregerson and Francisco Liriano—will be free agents after the season, and none of them is nearly as vital as, say, Altuve, Correa, Keuchel, Springer or Verlander. And, with a payroll that still ranks around the league average of $150 million—an increase from a last-place $36 million just four years ago—they will have the wherewithal to spend more, too.  The most remarkable thing of all about the Astros is this: they told everyone exactly what they were going to do—and then they did it. That sort of confidence might not make them beloved within certain baseball circles. But whether they win or lose in the next nine days, it’s now impossible to doubt that they’ve been on to something all along.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1767
b9a654ec-31ba-4104-b2cd-6657b5ec5444,"It's Robert Pattinson like you’ve never seen him before!  The 32-year-old actor has made a name for himself by playing sullen and dark characters, but in his new Western film (with a twist), Damsel, he’s taking on comedy.  “It was really fun. I really wanted to do one for ages,” Pattinson told ET’s Katie Krause at the Hollywood premiere of the film on Wednesday. “I mean, I've played a lot of serious psychopaths so I thought I'd play a funny psychopath.”  The film turns the Western archetype on its head thanks to Pattinson’s co-star Mia Wasikowska’s character, Penelope.  “It seemed kind of subversive. Most Westerns, the archetype lead cowboy is someone who's sort of, they can handle anything and it’s them against the world and they come to save the damsel but pretty much every single male character in this movie is completely inept,” Pattinson explained. “They think they’re trying to save the damsel but actually they’re incapable of anything at all. They’re incapable of saving themselves.”  Getty Images  Pattinson himself has worked with many strong boss ladies in his lengthy career, and named a few for ET. “Oh tons! I mean, I've worked with some real power houses. Definitely Mia is one of them, obviously. Kristin Scott Thomas, Uma Thurman,” he said.  But what about his Twilight co-star and ex-girlfriend, Kristin Stewart?  “Kristen Stewart, Kristen too! Kristen Stewart as well, yeah, yeah, yeah,” he insisted. “Catherine Hardwicke, too. She's great.”  Earlier this month, Pattinson and Stewart reunited at Lily-Rose Depp’s 19th birthday party at the Chateau Marmont. This inevitably excited fans as it’s been almost 10 years since the film version of Twilight was released.  So, what would Pattinson say to his younger self when looking back at his first day on set?  “I don't know, just have fun!” he said. “The whole ride's been really great. I've just been incredibly lucky in my career and my life. I'm really appreciative of everything.”  Magnolia Pictures will release Damsel in theaters on June 22.
