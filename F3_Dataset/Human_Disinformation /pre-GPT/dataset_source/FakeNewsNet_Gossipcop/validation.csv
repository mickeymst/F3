17574a3f-90cd-469f-bfab-5d966920bd2b,"Embed from Getty Images  One of my most shameful celebrity ‚Äúcrushes‚Äù is Diplo. Go ahead and yell at me, I deserve it. You can tell me anything about Diplo too, I know he‚Äôs a total douchebag. I can‚Äôt help it though ‚Äì there‚Äôs something about his smug doucheface that I find appealing or hot or something. Sometimes we can‚Äôt always explain why we‚Äôre attracted to someone. But I would hit it and then I would never tell a soul about it, because banging Diplo is and always should be a shameful secret. Since he‚Äôs my shame-crush, I know that he likes women who are pretty young too, which is also gross. Apparently, he was possibly spending time with none other than Kendall Jenner at Coachella. Ugh.  Kendall Jenner is no stranger to getting up close and personal with music‚Äôs biggest names. The model has dated the likes of Harry Styles and A$AP Rocky ‚Äî and now I hear she may have Diplo set in her sights. My spies caught Kendall looking extremely close with the US producer‚Äî who counts Katy Perry as an ex ‚Äî at a Coachella bash on Friday. They set tongues wagging after spending lots of time with each other at the party which was thrown to celebrate the launch of a cosmetics brand headed by ¬≠Kendall‚Äôs sisters Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner. My source at the Palm Springs bash told me: ‚ÄúKendall and Diplo were super-flirty at the party. There was lots of touching and some extended hugging. They both appeared to be comfortable and familiar in each other‚Äôs company and hanging off everything the other ¬≠person said. Diplo was ¬≠stroking her arm. They were in great spirits. Kendall was toasting the launch of her show on Apple Music radio station Beats 1 while Diplo did a DJ set. It was the talk of the bash. Everyone ¬≠wondered whether there could be something more going on between them.‚Äù The pair‚Äôs flirting comes amid an ongoing saga in Kendall‚Äôs love life. Last weekend, it was reported she ignored rumoured love interest Blake Griffin when they both attended a different bash at the musical festival in California. At the party ‚Äî thrown by Hollywood night spot Bootsy Bellows and McDonald‚Äôs ‚Äî basketball star Blake walked straight past ¬≠Kendall and the two did not speak the whole night. But, on Thursday, they both had dinner at Delilah restaurant in West Hollywood ‚Äî although they made sure they were not snapped arriving together. A source added: ‚ÄúKendall has a lot of male interest and isn‚Äôt keen to be tied down in a serious relationship. Diplo is an extremely eligible catch and she seemed very ¬≠flattered at the attention he was showing her.‚Äù I also hear Kendall is being paid around ¬£450,000 per ¬≠episode to co-host her new monthly radio show Pizza Boys. Should Diplo decide to pop round for a takeaway, they can afford to splash out on a few side dishes.  [From The Sun]  I‚Äôm sure some of you will be like ‚ÄúKendall wasn‚Äôt flirting with Diplo because she‚Äôs gay.‚Äù First of all, lesbians flirt with men all the time. Secondly, Kendall recently spoke about the lesbian rumors which have surrounded her for years, and I tend to believe her on this one thing: if she was gay or bisexual, she would just BE gay or bisexual. It‚Äôs not like her family is super-conservative or anti-LGBTQ. She would talk about it and date women openly and it would not be a big deal at all. I think it‚Äôs more than likely she‚Äôs a straight woman with a masculine energy. I also think it‚Äôs likely that she‚Äôs the most ‚Äúquiet‚Äù about her love life among the sisters. So‚Ä¶ basically, I sort of believe this. I think Diplo and Kendall Jenner hooked up at Coachella. I doubt it‚Äôs true love. And she‚Äôs probably ashamed of herself and she‚Äôll never tell a soul about the hookup because, again, Diplo is gross (and so f‚Äìking hot).  Also: Emily Ratajkowski and Kendall look like twins to me.  Embed from Getty Images  Embed from Getty Images",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,804

5f5abe95-4b8b-4261-802b-633d7544489a,"Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter  / Source: TODAY By Donna Freydkin  Since actress Christina Applegate was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and had a double mastectomy thereafter, she‚Äôs taken steps to change her entire lifestyle, from the food she eats to the rest she gets. She also founded the Right Action for Women, which helps at-risk women pay for MRI screenings and testing.  But the actress revealed in a TODAY.com exclusive that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis: She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. Read on for our conversation with the actress, who‚Äôs busy raising her daughter Sadie, 6, with musician hubby Martyn LeNoble.  First off, let‚Äôs catch up on your health. How are you doing?  You're the first person I'm telling this. Two weeks ago, I had my ovaries and [fallopian] tubes removed. My cousin passed away from ovarian cancer in 2008. I could prevent that. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve taken control of everything. It‚Äôs a relief. That‚Äôs one other thing off the table. Now, let‚Äôs hope I don‚Äôt get hit by a bus.  What message do you want to send to women?  If you‚Äôre BRCA positive, it‚Äôs highly possible you‚Äôll develop cancer in your lifetime. The first thing is to be really diligent about what you‚Äôre putting into your body, as far as what kind of food you‚Äôre eating. Organic is expensive. I get that. I don‚Äôt want to alienate anyone who can‚Äôt pay for that. But maybe skip your morning latte and get organic vegetables for the week. Try to stay away from the foods that are filled with chemicals. Be a little more diligent and carve out as much of the bad stuff that you can. The other big killer is stress. That‚Äôs a hard thing to say to people especially right now. We‚Äôre living in a bizarre time. We‚Äôre bombarded by what‚Äôs going on in our world. Breathe deeper. That‚Äôs a big one for me. I used to be a stressed out person. I‚Äôm not anymore. I try to find the lining in everything in life.  Christina Applegate Stacie McChesney / Getty Images  I know you eat super clean.  We grow our own vegetables. That‚Äôs not an option for everyone. But just get a tomato plant! We‚Äôre a 100 percent organic house. My daughter is a vegetarian and practically vegan. That‚Äôs her choice. That‚Äôs how she eats. We‚Äôre really conscious about what we buy. Get some kale! Plant some green kale in your backyard and throw it into everything.  It‚Äôs pretty impressive that you founded Right Action for Women, because these tests cost a fortune and most women can‚Äôt afford them.  We‚Äôre at this place where we need to sit down and figure out the future of what it is that we‚Äôre doing and get into more of the BRCA tests for women. That‚Äôs a huge cost for a lot of people who don‚Äôt have perfect insurance. If you do know you have the gene, it gives you an empowerment about your lifestyle. I‚Äôve been a stay-at-home mom and focusing on my daughter the last two years. We‚Äôre moving forward now.  It must weigh on you that you have a daughter, and it must make breast cancer that much more of a personal issue  Of course. The chances that my daughter is BRCA positive are very high. I look at her and feed her the cleanest foods. I try to keep her stress levels down. I‚Äôm doing everything I can on my end knowing that in 20 years, she‚Äôll have to start getting tested. Hopefully by then there will be advancements. It breaks my heart to think that‚Äôs a possibility.  Do you get checked out regularly?  I don‚Äôt need mammograms anymore. I don‚Äôt have breasts. I go every six months to my oncologist. It used to be every three months. They still check me out as if I had all my parts. That‚Äôs never going to go away. If you know you‚Äôre high risk, you need to go start as soon as possible.  Otherwise, what‚Äôs your life like these days?  I feel good. I keep my life really simple. I‚Äôm very fortunate right now to have that freedom to not work. I love being my daughter‚Äôs mother and being 24/7 here with her, doing what I need to do, making her meals, taking her to soccer. I work at her school six or seven hours a week. I‚Äôm all in. That is my job. I love my life right now. I‚Äôve been very fortunate to be able to take a minute and it‚Äôs been wonderful.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,968

739a5bc7-c3fb-456d-8629-709629425018,"Mr. Weinstein, who is now a Hollywood pariah, has an array of legal problems that are separate from the bankruptcy case. Prosecutors in New York, Los Angeles and London are pursuing possible criminal cases against him. A lawsuit filed last month by Mr. Schneiderman will continue. Mr. Weinstein also faces additional civil suits, including one filed by the British actress Kadian Noble, who is suing him for sex trafficking.  But the bankruptcy filing does halt an array of lawsuits against the company, including those filed by women who contend that the studio facilitated misconduct by Mr. Weinstein. Those women will now have to line up behind the studio‚Äôs secured creditors ‚Äî who themselves are likely to be paid pennies on the dollar, according to bankruptcy lawyers.  The upshot is that women alleging abuse may now have a harder time recovering damages.  The filing, which was expected, ended a chaotic five-month effort to keep the Weinstein Company afloat.  In the fall, after The New York Times and The New Yorker revealed allegations of sexual harassment and rape, Mr. Weinstein‚Äôs younger brother and partner in the studio, Bob Weinstein, unsuccessfully scrambled to line up bridge loans to keep the company operating. He then sold ‚ÄúPaddington 2‚Äù rights to Warner Bros., which bought time but resulted in a lawsuit.  By early February, to the disbelief of many in the film industry, it seemed as if the Weinstein Company had found a way forward. A group of investors, including the billionaire Ron Burkle and Lantern Capital, had made an offer to buy most of the studio‚Äôs assets, which include the TV series ‚ÄúProject Runway‚Äù and the rights to ‚ÄúLion,‚Äù ‚ÄúDjango Unchained‚Äù and about 275 other films.  The investor group, managed by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, had offered to pay off what it believed was the Weinstein Company‚Äôs debt ‚Äî about $225 million. In return, it would receive most of the studio‚Äôs assets, which Ms. Contreras-Sweet planned to use to start a new, female-led film company.  But then Mr. Schneiderman threw the brakes on a sale, filing a lawsuit alleging that the studio and the Weinstein brothers had violated various state and city laws. He also said the proposed sale to Ms. Contreras-Sweet‚Äôs group was unacceptable because it did not adequately compensate victims, protect employees and ensure that those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein‚Äôs conduct would not be rewarded.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,470
40e060a3-d5fe-47cd-811a-0e5bbec225a1,"In case you wanted proof of your waning youth, Thursday marks the 10th anniversary of Britney Spears and Kevin Federline‚Äôs wedding ‚Äî a day when a promising young pop star and a dude nicknamed ‚ÄúMeat Pole‚Äù decided to throw caution to the wind and say ‚ÄúI do.‚Äù  ‚ÄúTen years ‚Äî it totally freaks me out,‚Äù says wedding planner Alyson Fox, reflecting on the September 18, 2004, nuptials. The day marked Fox‚Äôs first (and only) celebrity wedding. While it was originally planned as a big October wedding at the Bacara in Santa Barbara, things rapidly changed after the paparazzi figured out the date and location. Fox was left with about 10 days to organize a completely new, surprise wedding ‚Äî and, not trusting any other venue to keep the secret, she held it at her own house.  Most Britney fans probably don‚Äôt celebrate her short-lived marriage‚Äôs anniversary; some even see it as a key moment in a downward spiral from which she has only recently recovered. Still, though Britney filed for divorce in 2006, Fox holds that marriage dear.  TIME spoke to Fox about the whirlwind wedding, young love and the groomsmens‚Äô infamous white Juicy velour ‚Äúpimp‚Äù tracksuits.  TIME: Britney and Kevin Federline‚Äôs engagement was huge. Did you think that this would be one of the biggest weddings-  Alyson Fox: ‚Äîof my career? Yes, I mean, she is Britney Spears. I first interviewed with Felicia, her assistant for years, and I didn‚Äôt know who I was meeting with, just that it was a VIP‚Ä¶ I met Britney and her mom the next day and they all couldn‚Äôt be nicer. The sweetest. I mean they‚Äôre from the South. Britney‚Äôs so polite, she kept calling me Miss Alyson, and I was like, ‚ÄòOh my God don‚Äôt do that; that makes me feel old.‚Äô  And then you met Kevin.  They were like any young couple. Very much in love, very touchy feely.  What was the original wedding going to be like?  They came up with a list of 200 to 250 people, and we thought the Bacara would be great. We were designing the most beautiful but not over the top, elegant but shabby chic, gorgeous but fun event‚Ä¶ It was a really fun experience. I have not one negative thing to say until we had to move the whole wedding.  So what happened?  A publication printed the location and date of the wedding. I got a call from a very unhappy Kevin. [Unhappy at the situation not her.] Even though I told them that we had the best security team and it could still go on without a hitch, they didn‚Äôt want 100 million people standing outside trying to take pictures, ruining the intimacy and privacy of that event. So we had to go to Plan B, and we had to do it fast.  You had a ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù?  Well, we planned it in 10 days or less‚Ä¶ Everything was already in the works, Monique Lhuillier was making all the gowns that were basically ready, all the vendors were in place for the big wedding ‚Äî we just didn‚Äôt have a location. In that week we decided we can‚Äôt do it at a hotel, we can‚Äôt do a venue because people were going to know. We limited the guest list to the two families and the wedding party, and then we talked to Britney and Kevin about doing a surprise wedding. Nobody would know.  Not even Britney‚Äôs mom?  No. Nobody knew‚Ä¶ We told everyone and our vendors we were having an engagement party. We tried to use every vendor we could who was going to help at the wedding.  And you would throw it at your house in Studio City?  Well, their place wasn‚Äôt ready yet‚Ä¶ The vendors made the house look stunning. It was so beautiful. I only wish they could have had more people‚Ä¶ Every person who walked in that night, we handed then an invitation, they opened it up and it said ‚Äúsurprise!‚Äù you are here for the wedding and not the engagement party. And we would direct them to the room where they would change into their gowns and tuxedos‚Ä¶  Tuxedos? I thought the men were wearing those white Juicy velour jumpsuits‚Ä¶  No! That‚Äôs what they left the house in. They were in tuxedos and gowns. Everybody made such a big deal about that, but that‚Äôs what Juicy did for every celebrity who got married. They‚Äôd send them the cute little tracksuits. I asked Britney and Kevin what they wanted printed on the back, and Britney said, ‚ÄúMaids! Maids will be cute!‚Äù And it was. It was cute! And he said ‚ÄúPimps‚Äù which was adorable‚Ä¶ People are closed-minded. It was a joke, it was for fun. It was Juicy tracksuits! 10 years ago people would have given anything for a Juicy tracksuit.  You must not have gotten a lot of sleep that week.  Oh I didn‚Äôt sleep that week. And I didn‚Äôt sleep the week after, because there were all these stories going on [at the time] that they weren‚Äôt really married, and all this B.S. People are going to think what they‚Äôre going to think, but I know the truth. They were wonderful people and I‚Äôll say that until the day I die. To this day I don‚Äôt talk to a lot of people about it because I still feel protective over them. Unfortunately it didn‚Äôt work out ‚Äî but what is it, 60% of marriages that don‚Äôt?

The New York Police Department tells 60 Minutes that it has an ongoing investigation into the celebrity chef for potentially criminal behavior.  NYPD tells Eater that it‚Äôs looking at the assault allegations raised in the 60 Minutes report. Update: The Daily News reports that police are also looking into another, similar incident.  The 60 Minutes segment on Sunday took a look at several allegations against Batali, which first became public in a December Eater investigation. Anderson Cooper speaks with women who worked at the Spotted Pig, where Batali was an investor and allegedly groped staffers as a diner there.  The CBS newsmagazine show also spoke with an anonymous former Babbo employee who alleges Batali assaulted her in 2005 ‚Äî claiming that she woke up after a party at the Spotted Pig with a ‚Äúvery deeply wounded‚Äù leg and something that looked like semen on her skirt. She later called a crisis hotline and went to a hospital to be examined, but ultimately, she chose not to file a police report. Batali denied the incident.  Police are also investigating another case after the victim reported the crime in March, according to the Daily News. She told NYPD that she had been drinking at Babbo in January 2004 and then blacked out; when she awakened, Batali was having sex with her, the complain said. She believes she was drugged. That investigation is also ongoing.  Batali stepped away from his Italian restaurant empire in late 2017 after allegations that he inappropriately touched women over the course of his decades-long career. At the time, he admitted that ‚Äúmuch of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted.‚Äù  Batali and Bastianich Hospitality Group issued a statement saying that the other partners did not know about the allegations made public on Sunday night, calling them ‚Äúchilling and deeply disturbing.‚Äù The company also noted that the terms of Batali‚Äôs divestment from two dozen restaurants across the country will finalize on July 1.  This post has been updated to include a statement from B&B, new information from NYPD, and a newly reported incident.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,405

According to People, Meghan has a foolproof way for living a low-key life when she isn't working. As a source tells the publication, Meghan apparently ""spends most of her weekends in the Cotswolds with Harry. When she does venture out to Pilates or to get her hair done, she normally goes incognito under a baseball cap."" Just like in the movies, by wearing a cap and sunglasses, Meghan seems to manage going undetected in ordinary life.  Of course, Prince Harry and Meghan signed a two-year lease on a home in the Cotswolds following their May 2018 wedding, per Country Living. Based on the Great Tew Estate, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are able to escape London at the weekend. Notably, as Country Living reports, Soho Farmhouse, where Meghan had her spa-themed bachelorette party, is based nearby, making the Cotswolds a real home away from home for the former actress.  According to the Soho House website, the members' only club attracts mainly those working in ""film, fashion, advertising, music, art and media sectors,"" with Meghan's close friend, Markus Anderson, being a consultant for the brand.  Meghan and Harry are adjusting to their new life as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and it sounds as though they've found the perfect country hideaway to escape the limelight.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,297

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said‚Ä¶ ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father‚Äôs name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low‚Ä¶ YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father‚Äôs Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.

'Most of my following is usually my father's following and they're a lot older, they watched me grow up,' she reasoned. 'They saw him when he was in his very, very younger [days].  'So understand that the older people that are watching me and seeing what I'm doing don't necessarily agree with all of this because they have very conservative views.'

Katy Perry, who will be joined by Luke Bryant and Lionel Richie in hosting the revamped competition series, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday to promote the show. During the appearance she told host Jimmy Kimmel she and Luke are thick as thieves, but it seems there's a rift between them and their 68-year-old co-judge.  'We respect him just about as much as his kids respect him. Which is not a lot,' the Roar singer said while appearing on the late night show.  Katy Perry fired shots at American Idol co-host Lionel Richie during Jimmy Kimmel Live!  The comment appears to refer to something the musician previously made about his youngest daughter, Sofia Richie, dating Scott Disick. It's been widely reported that Lionel doesn't approve of his 19-year-old daughter's relationship with the troubled 34-year-old.  Katy's jabs didn't stop there, however. Speaking with the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host she nitpicked the way Lionel critiques American Idol contestants. The award-winning musician said Lionel often recalls working with music legends in long-winded stories comparable to 'Ted Talks'.  Katy doesn't just make snide remarks behind Lionel's back, though. She and her country musician co-judge, Luke, have been known to play a prank or two on the legendary musician, according to her Jimmy Kimmel appearance. She revealed on the show that they put whoopee cushions on his seat when he stands up to provide feedback to competitors.  'We're ruining his legacy,' she said.  Before American Idol fans get too bummed about this on-set beef, it's worth noting that Katy also said during her appearance that Lionel is actually like 'an uncle' to her and her fellow judge.  'He's an uncle you want in your house telling you all these wonderful historical stories and he does have some tea but we can't put that on TV,' she said.  Although there may be no actual feud on the set of American Idol, there's plenty of other drama rumored to be going down behind the judging table.  According to TMZ, Katy's left American Idol executives 'frustrated' with her repeated late arrivals on the set during auditions. Per the publication's report, she's 'almost always late' by about 10 or 15 minutes.  Producers are also said to be worried about a lack of 'comedic tension' on the show. The outlet reported that the panel are 'not at each other's throats, either in a serious or runny way', which has created worries about ratings.

280fb668-3127-4a00-b72b-7c7f2caa8474,"President Obama commuted the 35-year prison sentence of Chelsea Manning, an Army private convicted of taking troves of secret diplomatic and military documents and disclosing them to WikiLeaks, after deciding that Manning had served enough time.  Obama also granted a full and complete pardon to retired ¬≠Marine Gen. James E. Cartwright, a former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in an investigation of a leak of classified information about a covert U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran‚Äôs nuclear program.  The president‚Äôs dramatic, last-minute clemency actions for Cartwright and Manning were surprising for an administration that has brought more leak prosecutions than all previous ones combined. Obama took office pledging to bring a new era of transparency to government, but during his eight years, his administration has presided over at least nine leak cases.  But officials said the president thought that in Manning‚Äôs case, seven years behind bars was enough punishment and that she had been given an excessive sentence ‚Äî the longest ever imposed in the United States for a leak conviction. The administration has contrasted her case with that of Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency contractor who leaked classified documents in 2013 and then fled the country, pointing out that Manning did not try to avoid facing the U.S. justice system for her crimes.  ‚ÄúChelsea Manning is somebody who accepted responsibility for the crimes she committed,‚Äù a senior White House official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. ‚ÄúShe expressed remorse for committing those crimes. She began serving the sentence that was handed down. The president‚Äôs concern was rooted in the fact that the sentence handed down is longer than sentences given to other individuals who committed comparable crimes.‚Äù  [How do presidential pardons and commutations work?]  Republicans immediately blasted the White House‚Äôs decision, saying the commutation would encourage others to leak sensitive documents.  ‚ÄúThis is just outrageous,‚Äù House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said. ‚ÄúChelsea Manning‚Äôs treachery put American lives at risk and exposed some of our nation‚Äôs most sensitive secrets. President Obama now leaves in place a dangerous precedent that those who compromise our national security won‚Äôt be held accountable for their crimes.‚Äù  President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs team did not respond to requests for comment on the case.  Also on Tuesday, Obama granted clemency to more than 200 low-level drug offenders who were sentenced under harsh laws and would have received lighter sentences if convicted today. In all, the president commuted the sentences of 209 individuals and pardoned an additional 64. He is expected to grant more commutations before he leaves office.  Since 2014, Obama has commuted 1,385 sentences, more than the previous 12 presidents combined. Of those, 540 low-level drug offenders had been serving life sentences.  This ‚Äúfinal set of actions‚Äù as Obama leaves office ‚Äúis a signal to the system that prosecutors have gone too far,‚Äù said Steven Aftergood, a national security and transparency expert at the Federation of American Scientists.  Manning, 29, will be set free in four months, on May 17, instead of in 2045, under the terms of Obama‚Äôs commutation.  The Pentagon did not make the recommendation to the White House to commute Manning‚Äôs sentence, and senior Defense Department leaders opposed the move, said defense officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.  White House officials said the president‚Äôs decision had nothing to do with a recent pledge by WikiLeaks founder ¬≠Julian ¬≠Assange that he would agree to be extradited to the United States if Manning‚Äôs sentence was commuted.  ‚ÄúThank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning‚Äôs clemency,‚Äù read a statement attributed to Assange on the WikiLeaks Twitter feed. ‚ÄúYour courage & determination made the impossible possible.‚Äù  Trump invoked the death penalty in 2010 after WikiLeaks‚Äô disclosures, in stark contrast to his refusal to criticize Assange and WikiLeaks for the dissemination of hacked Democratic Party emails last year.  Members of Assange‚Äôs legal team did not immediately respond to requests for comment on whether Assange would now agree to be extradited.  ‚ÄúPresident Obama‚Äôs decision was both compassionate and amply justified,‚Äù said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice. ‚ÄúManning‚Äôs sentence was orders of magnitude greater than any sentence previously imposed for leaking classified information to the media.‚Äù  Manning was arrested in Iraq in May 2010 after she transmitted documents to WikiLeaks that came to be known as the Iraq and Afghanistan ‚ÄúWar Logs.‚Äù She also shared a video that showed a U.S. Apache helicopter in Baghdad opening fire on a group of people that the crew believed to be insurgents. Among the dead were two journalists who worked for Reuters. She also leaked documents pertaining to Guantanamo Bay prisoners, as well as 250,000 State Department cables.  In an impassioned statement last year accompanying her petition for clemency, she accepted ‚Äúfull and complete responsibility‚Äù for disclosing the material. She said she pleaded guilty without the benefit of a plea agreement because she believed that the military justice system would understand her motivation for the leak and sentence her fairly. ‚ÄúI was wrong,‚Äù wrote Manning, who is incarcerated at the all-male Fort Leavenworth prison in Kansas.  She said the 35-year penalty was ‚Äúfar more‚Äù than she imagined possible ‚Äî ‚Äúunreasonable, outrageous and out of line with what I had done.‚Äù  [Bradley Manning comes out as transgender: ‚ÄòI am a female‚Äô ]  Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning, came out as transgender after her conviction. She said in her statement last fall that the three years since she had been sentenced had enabled her to reflect on her actions and her struggle to adjust to the military.  ‚ÄúI am not Bradley Manning,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI really never was. I am Chelsea Manning, a proud woman who is transgender and who, through this application, is respectfully requesting a first chance at life.‚Äù  Her reason for passing the documents to WikiLeaks was to raise public awareness about issues she found troubling, including the effect of war on innocent civilians, her attorney, Vincent J. Ward, said in a letter accompanying Manning‚Äôs petition. Ward said Manning‚Äôs sentence exceeds even international legal norms.  Manning was kept in solitary confinement for almost a year before formal charges were brought, an experience she has called ‚Äúhumiliating and degrading.‚Äù The United Nations special rapporteur on torture called her treatment ‚Äúcruel, inhuman and degrading.‚Äù  She has tried to kill herself twice while at Fort Leavenworth ‚Äî the first time in July 2016 and again in November. After the July attempt, she was placed in solitary confinement as punishment.  ‚ÄúThe family is delighted to hear the news, and we are looking forward to seeing Chelsea in May, and we want to thank President Obama for granting her request. We‚Äôre all very, very happy about it,‚Äù said Debbie, an aunt of Manning‚Äôs in Maryland, who asked that her last name not be used to protect her privacy.  Cartwright, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, served as the nation‚Äôs second-ranking military officer and was facing his sentencing in two weeks after pleading guilty in October to a felony count of lying to the FBI in a classified leak investigation. He admitted to falsely telling investigators that he did not confirm classified information to reporters writing about a covert U.S.-Israeli cyberattack on Iran‚Äôs nuclear program.  The senior White House official said Cartwright‚Äôs long history of distinguished service to the nation factored into Obama‚Äôs decision. The official said a journalist involved in the case testified that Cartwright did not tell the journalist anything that the reporter did not already know. The conversation was ‚Äúfocused on preventing the publication of information that could be damaging to our national security,‚Äù the official said.  When the president is making clemency decisions, ‚Äúmotive matters,‚Äù the official said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear in this case that based on what the journalist has said . . . that General Cartwright‚Äôs motive was different than most of the people who are accused of leaking classified information to a journalist.‚Äù  In a statement Tuesday, Cartwright thanked Obama.  ‚ÄúWith the greatest pride, I have served my country as a member of the military for more than forty years. This action allows me to continue that work as a private citizen,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI love this country and believe it to be the greatest nation on earth.

462c3efc-9b29-4935-9d61-a64c5e247999,"As the couple deny fresh cheating and divorce rumours we take a look back at David's alleged affair with Rebecca Loos.  The world's most famous soccer player marries a superstar pop singer, what could possibly go wrong? Almost ever since David and Victoria Beckham's 1999 nuptials, their relationship has been plagued by tales of alleged affairs, most famously the purported affair between David and his former-assistant, Rebecca Loos. And it seems a new-wave of cheating accusations could hit the Beckhams, as Twitter this weekend was set alight with rumours of infidelity and an impending Beckham divorce. Victoria, 44, and David, 43, have since released a statement denying the new rumours, and branding them ""fake news"". If you're experiencing d√©j√† vu, it's because David and Victoria have penned similar statements defending their relationship in 2003, when Rebecca Loos famously claimed she had an affair with the soccer champion.  David and Victoria show a united front in the face of fresh cheating rumours.  David's alleged affair with assistant Rebecca Loos  In 2003, David was in the prime of his football career. The England Captain had been sold by his home club Manchester United to Spain's Real Madrid, for a whopping price. And while his star had never been brighter, a shock was soon to hit the Beckham family. In September of that year, David was spotted with a woman at a nightclub in Madrid. The woman was later identified as his assistant Rebecca Loos. Subsequently, the rumour mill kick-started into overdrive, churning out tales that the Beckham marriage was in trouble, which David denied. The now-defunct News Of The World, published a story from ""a source"" outlining several sexual encounters David and Loos allegedly had after that night at the club. They also reported the two exchanged racy texts. The story claimed Victoria contacted the assistant, warning her to stay away.  Rebecca Loos reportedly had an affair with David Beckham while the pair were working together in Spain.  Rebecca Loos' brother's statement  Loos brother then surprised British tabloids by claiming his sister had confirmed to him that she'd had an affair with David in Spain. ""Rebecca phoned home early this morning. I am overwhelmed with shock,"" Loos' brother John Charles told the Daily Mail in April 2004. ""Rebecca was upset when she parted company with David and Victoria last year. She became very down and cried a lot. At times she looked heartbroken. I thought it was because of professional reasons. But now I am beginning to understand there must have been more to it.""  Rebecca Loos, Victoria Beckham and her son Romeo watch David play for Real Madrid back in 2003.  While explosive allegations of David's infidelity flew, Victoria reportedly packed up their two children and flew to Switzerland, where David was to meet them from Madrid. Spokespeople for the family said the trip was a long-planned getaway and not a plan to escape media attention.  David's statement on alleged affair  In response to Loos' brother's comments, David released a statement. ""During the past few months I have become accustomed to reading more and more ludicrous stories about my private life,"" it read. ""What appeared this morning is just one further example. The simple truth is that I am very happily married. I have a wonderful wife and two very special kids. There is nothing any third party can do to change these facts.""  Rebecca Loos' tell-all  Rebecca gave an explosive tell-all interview with SKY TV alleging her professional relationship turned romantic with David as he grew lonely in Madrid. ""I think the chemistry between David and I was so strong and people were not happy because I was being very unprofessional and he's a married man,"" she said at the time. ""He is very generous lover. He gives a lot. He pleases. He knows what you want. It's all about you and not so much about him. It's nice."" When asked about the Beckham's intention to involved layers, Loos replied, ""What are they consulting their lawyers for? What can they do? I think they have worked very hard at getting the image they have and I think they will do everything they can to maintain it."" ""So whether that involves having happy shots taken or calling their lawyers it's up to them. I am 100 percent sure of what I am talking about, there no doubt in my mind I have no reason to lie -- why should I? I am just here to tell you my experience. He knows the truth and I know the truth."" Again, Victoria and David vehemently denied Loos' story calling it ""absurd and unsubstantiated"". Victoria and her two sons, Brooklyn and Romeo relocated to Spain so the family could be together with David.  The couple have weathered allegations of affairs time and time again.  The Beckham's sue  Following the months and months of stories of alleged infidelities, the soccer player and his wife turned to their lawyers, seeking justice. In 2004, they filed a lawsuit against News of the World, after a story was published claiming David also had an affair with a beautician named Danielle Heath. The couple then amended the complaint in 2005 to include another story by the publisher which detailed quotes from the couple's former-nanny Abbie Gibson, that the Beckham marriage was a lie. They also sued the nanny for breach of confidence. ""We are sick and tired of people trying to make money at the expense of our family,"" the Beckhams said in a statement.  The ultimate power-couple.  Where is Rebecca Loos now?  Fourteen years after her alleged affair with David Beckham, Rebecca Loos has completely turned her life around. After being dismissed from her position at Real Madrid, Loos went on to star on a range of reality TV shows. The Spanish-born beauty eventually fell in love with medical adviser Sven Christjar Skaiaa, who worked on one of the shows she appeared on.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1137

dcc937b3-88f0-4f07-976c-c2d65db2495c,"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel this spring, and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.  BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  Fans have eagerly been waiting to hear which celebrities scored an invite to what's sure to be the biggest event of the year, and this week, we learned that one of Meghan's closest pals, Priyanka Chopra, will for sure be in attendance. ""Yes I'm going,"" the Quantico star confirmed during her guest appearance on Live With Kelly and Ryan on Thursday. ""But that's all.""  Chopra told People, however, that she is ""not a bridesmaid,"" despite all the speculation in recent months that she would be in the bridal party.  As for the groom, Prince Harry has finally picked his Best Man, and, unsurprisingly, it's Prince William! The Duke of Cambridge joked earlier this year that he was expecting to fulfill the role, but his brother had yet to ask him. We're happy to report that Harry made it official on Thursday.  ""The Duke of Cambridge is honored to have been asked, and is very much looking forward to supporting his brother at St. George‚Äôs Chapel,"" Kensington Palace shared in a statement.  Meanwhile, Meghan has been busy wrapping up all the last minute details ahead of her and Harry's nuptials. A source told ET on Tuesday that Amal Clooney's go-to hairdresser in London, Miguel Perez, is expected to style Meghan's tresses on her big day. He's currently a stylist at Salon Sloane, whose world-leading hairstylists have worked on everyone from Lindsay Lohan to the Victoria's Secret Angels.  ""Yes, I do Meghan's hair,"" Miguel reportedly told The Mail this week. ""I do Amal's, and Meghan is friends with her. I also do George [Clooney]'s, I do the whole family. Amal put Meghan and me together when she moved here [to London]. I do her color, her cut and her styling.""  ""We have talked about it [the wedding] and we have a plan,"" he continued. ""I can't say any more, but we know what we're doing.""  Meghan and Harry also chose the music for their wedding service this week, and it will include a full orchestra. St. George's Chapel's Director of Music, James Vivian, will direct the music, which features a selection of choral groups, soloists and musicians, Kensington Palace revealed on Tuesday.  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be saying ""I do"" in:  Getty Images  OUT AND ABOUT  The lovebirds took a brief break from wedding planning early Wednesday morning to represent the royal family at the Anzac Day Service in London, England.  Anzac Day is a day of remembrance for soldiers from Australia and New Zealand who've served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. Both countries are a part of the Commonwealth, of which Queen Elizabeth II serves as leader.  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  As we anxiously wait to see what Meghan's wedding dresses will look like, there's also talks about what tiara she will be gifted with. There's a good chance that the bride-to-be will debut a brand-new tiara as she walks down the aisle, royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of the blog The Court Jeweler told Good Housekeeping earlier this week.  ""The younger son's wife getting a new tiara would be the precedent,"" she explained. ""Prince Charles might buy her a tiara.""  Previous royal brides like Sarah, Duchess of York, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, received major bling on their wedding day. But, the circumstances are different for Kate Middleton, who wore the Cartier Halo tiara for her wedding, since she will eventually become queen, and will ""borrow"" tiaras in the meantime.  ""Usually what happens is you get allotted your tiaras,"" Kay explained. ""Like Camilla [Duchess of Cornwall] has three, but they're all technically loaners that not anyone else wears.""  RATHER REGAL LOOKS  Getty Images  Meghan outdid herself with not one, but two regal looks in one day.  While stepping out to the Anzac Day service, the 36-year-old brunette beauty donned an elegant gray Smythe coat with a black dress underneath, Sarah Flint Jay heels, a Gucci Dionysus bag, a red poppy pin and a statement wide-brimmed, floppy hat. This type of hat is much simpler than the fancy fascinators and pillbox hats we typically see on royals like Queen Elizabeth II and the Duchess of Cambridge, but we love that Meghan put her own unique spin on the trend.  For her second look of the day, Meghan opted for a more formal ensemble. The bride-to-be arrived to Westminster Abbey in a black beret embellished with a dragonfly from milliner Philip Treacy, which she pulled off perfectly by pairing it with a midi-length Emilia Wickstead dress suit and a Jimmy Choo box clutch.  SERVIN' UP SUITS  USA Network  Sadly, this section of our weekly royals countdown ends this week, as Meghan appeared in her very last episode of Suits on Wednesday.  In case you missed it, we recapped the full finale (HERE).  You had a good run, Rachel Zane.  SPARKLE LIKE MARKLE  Earlier this week, ET caught up with one of Meghan's former makeup artists, Spencer Barnes, who opened up about her evolving beauty looks and how when he was still doing her makeup, Meghan always requested a natural look.  ""She loves beautiful skin, to start with, and she has the most gorgeous complexion,"" Barnes mused. ""It's that soft, caramel. Her mixed heritage makes her an exotic beauty of beauties. Her chocolate eyes, the way her eyes light up when she smiles, I love her smile, her teeth and her lips. And then her perfect brows.""  ""Whenever I'd work with her, she'd like to highlight her fresh, radiant skin,"" he continued. ""We'd do a very glowing, fresh-faced skin. We'd use earthy tones, colors that enhanced her natural beauty, rather than a lot of obvious color choices, like purple, green or blue. We'd stick with earthy tones -- peaches, golds, browns -- a lot of rich, warm tones and that really flattered her. It helped her just look radiant and fresh.""

LOL OF THE WEEK  Prince George and Princess Charlotte arrive at St Mary‚Äôs to meet their little brother. pic.twitter.com/rfX9rsdJhU ‚Äî Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 23, 2018  Spectators couldn't get enough of Princess Charlotte this week. While on her way to meet her new baby brother, the adorable 2-year-old stole the show when she smiled and waved to photographers on her way into the hospital, proving she's already an expert at royalty.  NEXT IN LINE  Jack Taylor/Getty Images  Welcome to the royal family, Prince Louis of Cambridge!  Kate Middleton and Prince William welcomed their third child, Louis Arthur Charles, on Monday, and just hours after giving birth, the Duchess of Cambridge and her husband stepped out to pose for pictures outside St. Mary's Hospital before making their way back to Kensington Palace. Kate channeled Princess Diana in a stunning red Jenny Packham dress, cradling her precious baby boy with William by her side.  Toby Melville - WPA Pool/Getty Images  But there was no down time for the new dad. William joined Harry and Meghan at the Anzac Day Service on Wednesday, and also attended the opening of the Greenhouse Sports Centre in London one day later with his brother. Hopefully William can catch up on some rest and family time this weekend!  For now, that's a wrap on this week's royals update. Let us know on Twitter (@desireemurphy_ and @lizcalvario) what other regal news you'd like us to cover in the future, and be sure to join us next week for another roundup!

b1099d48-cbf9-4dcd-aefd-3084db9297f7,"Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single ‚ÄúUnforgettable,‚Äù and now Life & Style is claiming the two were all over each other during the process. A so-called ‚Äúsource‚Äù tells the magazine, ‚ÄúMariah was hanging all over French. She sat on his lap, and at one point they even kissed! They weren‚Äôt trying to hide their PDA.‚Äù  A new tabloid report says there was heavy flirting going on between Mariah Carey and French Montana when the two recently collaborated in the recording studio. Gossip Cop looked into this claim about a possible hookup between the music artists, and we‚Äôve exclusively learned the truth.  {""position1"": {""artist"": {""bio"": """", ""id"": 31885, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey""}, ""catalog_type"": ""artist"", ""description"": """", ""id"": 31885, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey"", ""related"": [{""bio"": """", ""id"": 966208, ""name"": ""Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 89006, ""name"": ""TLC""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 120430, ""name"": ""Aaliyah""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 40100, ""name"": ""Boyz II Men""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 56563, ""name"": ""Alicia Keys""}, {""bio"": """", ""id"": 39258, ""name"": ""Mary J.

6525929a-72fa-4b71-b76c-83e85ef99565,"Re-castings of iconic beloved roles made famous by other actors are normally met with some degree of fandom skepticism. Yet when Warner Bros. announced Jude Law was stepping into the role of ‚Äúyoung‚Äù Albus Dumbledore for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, it felt like a perfectly shaped puzzle piece that clicked into place. Subsequent photos of Law as Dumbledore and a trailer showing the Sherlock Holmes and The Young Pope star giving some warm-yet-snappy line delivery as the charismatic future Hogwarts headmaster have subsequently reinforced the feeling that the 45-year-old actor was an unexpected yet ideal choice.  Below, Law takes our questions about how his Dumbledore differs from the Harry Potter-era character, details some of what author J.K. Rowling told him during their meeting, reveals (somewhat inadvertently) a couple intriguing plot details, and weighs in on the debate about how his character‚Äôs sexuality should be depicted.  ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So before you took on this role, what research did you do, if any?  JUDE LAW: I knew the books and the Harry Potter films pretty well, my children grew up with them so I grew up as an accompanying adult. And I‚Äôd seen and enjoyed the first [Fantastic Beasts] film. Then I had the good fortune and opportunity to sit with [author and screenwriter] J.K. Rowling shortly after we started work on it. She gave me a very good sense of Albus‚Äô life journey and who he was and what was happening in his head and his heart and his world for this particular story.  Did you look at the performances of previous Dumbledore actors Richard Harris and Michael Gambon?  I‚Äôm sure they were in the back of my mind, because I‚Äôd seen their work and admired both of them as actors, greatly. I talked with [director] David Yates about that and we both decided that it wasn‚Äôt necessary to do an impersonation of one of them as a younger man. This is a man with almost 100 years ahead of him before he became that character so we wanted to look at who he was in this moment and construct our own version. It makes me laugh when he‚Äôs called ‚ÄúYoung Albus‚Äù because I‚Äôm 45, so I‚Äôm more in the middle of a midlife crisis, but I‚Äôm happy to hold onto that as long as I can!  I found it funny you went from playing the Young Pope to Young Albus in pop culture.  The word ‚ÄúYoung‚Äù has to be in every part I play, it‚Äôs contractual.  What did Rowling say in terms of the performance or interior life of the character that you found helpful?  Well gosh, there was so much reference to interior life. The one thing that came out was the sense of play. He has a youthful mercurial approach to life, but that there‚Äôs something that hangs heavy in his heart, in his past, that underlies all of that. There‚Äôs a root of good humor and good heart and sense of self and a sense of past.  How much say, if any, did you have on how he looks in the film?  When you hire [famed costume designer] Colleen Atwood, you know you‚Äôre in the hands of someone rather great. There‚Äôs no one quite like her in the world of film. She has a very clear vision. It was open and collaborative, there were tweaks here and there, but I was happily corralled into the overall look which was clear from the get-go.  So what‚Äôs Dumbledore like at this age and how different is he than how we know him?  As I mentioned before, there‚Äôs a sense of humor and mischief, a dash of anarchy, a sense of what‚Äôs right and what he believes in, and a sense of mystery. There‚Äôs also how he comes around to get people onto his way of thinking ‚Äî which is rather indirectly. He also has a certain heaviness about him that I don‚Äôt want to reveal too much about ‚Äî and that‚Äôs something he has to overcome, or hopes to overcome. He‚Äôs also got a great passion for sharing his knowledge, he‚Äôs a powerful and inclusive teacher.  So he teaches Transfiguration, right?  He doesn‚Äôt teach Transfiguration, actually, not at this stage.  Oh! Because in Potter lore, it was said he used to be a Transfiguration teacher before becoming headmaster‚Ä¶  At this stage in his career, he‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm allowed to say what he teaches‚Ä¶[Editor‚Äôs note: We think we may have figured it out]  Ah, okay. Well, what was your favorite spell to cast?  Well ‚Ä¶ I ah ‚Ä¶ I only get to cast one. There‚Äôs a lot you don‚Äôt know about Albus in this film. And there are certain restrictions in storytelling ‚Äî you‚Äôll see, it all makes sense. You don‚Äôt see him in full flow yet.  Interesting! And if I remember right, Dumbledore doesn‚Äôt yet have the infamous Elder Wand, right? So what‚Äôs his current wand like?  Albus doesn‚Äôt have the Elder Wand yet, no. I have a wand. It‚Äôs very reflective of him, beautiful dark wood root with a stone on one end.  He calls on Newt to go after Grindelwald. What‚Äôs his relationship with his former student?  I think he admires in Newt this sense of moral code that he will always do the right thing because he can‚Äôt do anything but the right thing. I think he likes that Newt finds beauty in beasts because I think occasionally Dumbledore feels like a beast. And there‚Äôs a master and mentee kind of relationship. And Newt isn‚Äôt afraid to say when he thinks Dumbledore is wrong, it‚Äôs not servitude.  There was some uproar earlier this year when director David Yates told EW the character not ‚Äúexplicitly gay‚Äù in this film. What‚Äôs your take on how apparent Dumbledore‚Äôs sexuality should be?  Jo Rowling revealed some years back that Dumbledore was gay. That was a question I actually asked Jo and she said, yes, he‚Äôs gay. But as with humans, your sexuality doesn‚Äôt necessarily define you; he‚Äôs multifaceted. I suppose the question is: How is Dumbledore‚Äôs sexuality depicted in this film? What you got to remember this is only the second Fantastic Beasts film in a series and what‚Äôs brilliant about Jo‚Äôs writing is how she reveals her characters, peels them to the heart over time. You‚Äôre just getting to know Albus in this film, and there‚Äôs obviously a lot more to come. We learn a little about his past in the beginning of this film, and characters and their relationships will unfold naturally which I‚Äôm excited to reveal. But we‚Äôre not going to reveal everything all at once.  Obviously, Dumbledore had a relationship with Grindelwald. What‚Äôs that relationship like at this point in time? And what was it like working with Johnny Depp?  I don‚Äôt actually have any scenes with Johnny. As I said before, this is only Part 2 of a longer story. I‚Äôve always admired him from afar, but we don‚Äôt know each other, and I‚Äôve not yet met him on this. In many ways that suits the relationship as it‚Äôs been many years since they‚Äôve seen each other. So there‚Äôs complexity in that that‚Äôs fun to mine. Again, the past will reveal itself.

Instead, it was the symbol of the Video Music Awards: the Moon Person.  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Moon Person might be a new term to people who have watched the VMAs for years, and that's because for many years it used to be the Moonman. The trophy got a gender-neutral makeover before last year's awards ceremony.  ‚ÄúWhy should it be a man?‚Äù Chris McCarthy, president of MTV, told the New York Times in 2017. ‚ÄúIt could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist.‚Äù The decision also came around the same time the MTV Movie and TV awards stopped separating their acting categories by gender.  The Moonman trophy has been around since the start of the VMAs. When the network started in 1981, it launched with footage of Apollo 11 blasting off into space, and an astronaut planting a flag with the MTV logo on the moon's surface. ‚ÄúLadies and gentlemen, rock and roll,"" a voiceover noted, and the rest was history. That footage played every hour on MTV for the first five years of the network's history.  MTV's new gender neutrality reflects the music industry's push for LGBTQ representation and gender equality.

4afa0153-b565-478a-815a-fe4e5da7db6f,"Taylor Swift, photographed Nov. 2017. Billy & Hells for TIME  Before the Harvey Weinstein allegations broke, and before #MeToo swept the Internet, Taylor Swift testified in court on Aug. 10 about being assaulted in a room full of people. Swift, who TIME recognized as one of the Silence Breakers who inspired women to speak out about harassment in this year‚Äôs Person of the Year issue, granted TIME her first interview since the trial.  In 2013, the singer-songwriter took a photo with a Colorado radio DJ after an interview. During that photo, Swift says, DJ David Mueller reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end. Swift privately reported the incident to the station at which Mueller worked, and he was fired. Mueller then sued Swift for defamation; she countersued for a symbolic $1‚Äîand won.  Swift refused to be bullied on the stand. Her straightforward testimony was lauded by many for its fierceness. When asked why the pictures taken during the assault didn‚Äôt show the front of her skirt wrinkled as evidence of any wrongdoing, she said simply, ‚ÄúBecause my ass is located at the back of my body.‚Äù When asked if she felt guilty about Mueller losing his job, she said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I‚Äôm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions‚Äînot mine.‚Äù  Like many of the women interviewed for the 2017 Person of the Year issue, Swift would not accept blame for the abuse she experienced. Her clear-eyed testimony marked one of several major milestones in the conversation around sexual harassment this year. Swift responded to questions about her experience from TIME in writing.  Why was it important for you to come forward about what happened to you?  In 2013, I met a DJ from a prominent country radio station in one of my pre-show meet and greets. When we were posing for the photo, he stuck his hand up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek. I squirmed and lurched sideways to get away from him, but he wouldn‚Äôt let go. At the time, I was headlining a major arena tour and there were a number of people in the room that saw this plus a photo of it happening. I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance. It was important to report the incident to his radio station because I felt like they needed to know. The radio station conducted its own investigation and fired him. Two years later, he sued me.  How did you feel when you testified?  When I testified, I had already been in court all week and had to watch this man‚Äôs attorney bully, badger and harass my team including my mother over inane details and ridiculous minutiae, accusing them, and me, of lying. My mom was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn‚Äôt considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn‚Äôt hold back on my mom‚Äîwhy should I be polite? I‚Äôm told it was the most amount of times the word ‚Äúass‚Äù has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.  Watch: Why the Silence Breakers Are the 2017 Person of the Year  How have people responded to your story?  People have been largely very supportive of my story since the trial began in August, but before that, I spent two years reading headlines referring to it as ‚ÄúThe Taylor Swift Butt Grab Case‚Äù with internet trolls making a joke about what happened to me. The details were all skewed, as they often are. Most people thought I was suing him. There was an audible gasp in the courtroom when I was named as the defendant. Once it hit the news that I was in Denver dealing with this, there was an outpouring of support on social media and I have never appreciated it more. I spoke to Kesha on the phone and it really helped to talk to someone who had been through the demoralizing court process.  After this experience, what advice would you give to your fans?  I would tell people who find themselves in this situation that there is a great deal of blame placed on the victims in cases of sexual harassment and assault. You could be blamed for the fact that it happened, for reporting it and blamed for how you reacted. You might be made to feel like you‚Äôre overreacting, because society has made this stuff seem so casual. My advice is that you not blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you. You should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.  Is this a watershed moment for the way we think about sexual assault and harassment in culture?  I think that this moment is important for awareness, for how parents are talking to their children, and how victims are processing their trauma, whether it be new or old. The brave women and men who have come forward this year have all moved the needle in terms of letting people know that this abuse of power shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated. Going to court to confront this type of behavior is a lonely and draining experience, even when you win, even when you have the financial ability to defend yourself. Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances. When the jury found in my favor, the man who sexually assaulted me was court-ordered to give me a symbolic $1. To this day he has not paid me that dollar, and I think that act of defiance is symbolic in itself.

And don‚Äôt get us started on what we look like when we attempt to wriggle into a wetsuit (the image of Free Willy comes to mind...).

Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Last night, the newly single dancer/actress posted a video of herself dancing with her World Of Dance judges and let‚Äôs just say, she‚Äôs looking h-o-t.  In the clip, the mother-of-one - who recently announced her split from husband of eight years Channing Tatum - can be seen spinning, throwing her leg up in the air, and slapping her derri√®re.

According to a new report, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star is planning to cash in on her husband Joe Giudice‚Äôs deportation proceedings.

Well now, sources are telling Radar Online that Bravo has offered Teresa $500,000 to film a special about his deportation.  ‚ÄúTeresa was offered big bucks to film a special about Joe‚Äôs deportation and she agreed to do it,‚Äù an insider revealed. ‚ÄúHalf a million dollars to share the story on camera.‚Äù  And this story is believable because this isn‚Äôt Teresa‚Äôs first rodeo when it comes to cashing in on her crimes legal drama!  ‚ÄúIt is going to be like the other specials when she was in prison and will show how she and Joe and the girls are handling the scary prospect of Joe getting deported,‚Äù added the source.

And now Sarah Jessica Parker has also confirmed the third movie is not in the works when she spoke to Variety on Thursday in New York City.  The 53-year-old was attending the Women In Film & Television's Muse Awards gala luncheon when she revealed it wouldn't be happening at this time.  Sorry fans! Sarah Jessica Parker confirmed on Thursday that a third Sex In The Movie was not in the works, when she attended the Women in Film & Television's Muse Awards gala luncheon in NYC  'It's not something we are talking about right now,' she said.  'I just done have a clue.'  In September last year DailyMailTV exclusively revealed that just days before filming of the third Sex And The City movie was set to start, Cattrall pulled out.  She was said to have demanded Warner Bros produce other movies she had in development or she wouldn't sign up for the project - something she has denied.  No take three: Sarah Jessica's statement comes after co-star Kim Cattral (who played Samantha Jones) has openly refused to have any part in the project (L-R: Cynthia Nixon [Charlotte York], Sarah Jessica Parker [Carrie Bradshaw], Kim Cattral [Samantha Jones], Kristin Davis [Charlotte York])  An E! source explained. 'It was a combination of not great money and a bad storyline for Samantha. It was a bad script.'  The publication also revealed that the script had called for Samantha to be on the receiving end of sexting and 'd**k pics' from Miranda's (played by Cynthia Nixon) 14-year-old son Brady - and that was the final straw.  It's been previously reported that the main focus of a third SATC film was going to be the sudden death from a heart attack of Chris Noth's character Mr. Big and how Parker's character Carrie Bradshaw dealt with the loss of her one true love.  Two was enough: 'Kim never wanted to really do the movie to begin with,' E!'s source explained. 'It was a combination of not great money and a bad storyline for Samantha. It was a bad script.  Kim, it was claimed, felt that the movie relegated the relationship between Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) to a secondary level of importance while Parker as Carrie would get the primary attention.  Sarah Jessica, 53, confirmed last year that there was a 'beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable' script but that the third movie was not happening.  It's also been claimed that Cattrall has long been upset that she was paid less than Parker.  Not getting the girls back together: 'It‚Äôs not something we are talking about right now. I just don‚Äôt have a clue,' the actress told Variety on Thursday at the New York Women in Film & Television‚Äôs Muse Awards gala luncheon  Storyline: It's been previously reported that the main focus of a third SATC film was going to be the sudden death from a heart attack of Chris Noth's character Mr. Big and how Parker's character Carrie Bradshaw dealt with the loss of her one true love  Speaking on the Origins podcast, Sex And The City executive producer Michael Patrick King confirmed she was paid more than her co-stars because she was the lead.  'The show doesn't exist if Sarah Jessica wasn't the blonde star of the show, that's number one,' King explained.

USA TODAY Sports  Former Olympian Tonya Harding  Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.  Harding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about ""taking somebody out"" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.

2bbc6f9e-319a-4b4c-b8c1-b1028ff967fc,"(CNN) George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.  The couple, through the The Clooney Foundation for Justice, have made a $1 million donation to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) that will fund a joint initiative to combat hate groups.  The move comes more than a week after an August 12 ""Unite the Right"" rally sparked violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left one woman dead and 19 injured. Two Virginia state troopers who were monitoring the protests were also killed in a helicopter crash.  ""What happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate,"" they said.  In the aftermath of the event, President Donald Trump was criticized for his unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in a press conference given days after the unrest.  ""I think there is blame on both sides,"" Trump said during a news conference August 15.  George Clooney appeared to reference the President's comment in an additional statement, provided to CNN by a representative.  ""Amal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality. There are no two sides to bigotry and hate,"" he said.

c86ec894-1a64-4af0-978d-eef09cbf2d6e,"‚ÄúI love romantic comedies. I feel almost sheepish writing that, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years or so that admitting that you like these movies is a form of mild stupidity‚Ä¶ I enjoy watching people fall in love on-screen so much that I can suspend my disbelief for the contrived situations that only happen in the heightened world of romantic comedies.‚Äù ‚ÄîMindy Kaling, Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?  At the end of its second season, The Mindy Project has become one of those shows that inspires strong reactions on either side, and very few in the middle. If you scout out Mindy Project reviews (wait, I‚Äôve done it for you!), you‚Äôll find both total pans (‚ÄúThe Mindy Project fails at everything it attempts‚Äù) and complete raves (‚ÄúWhy only an idiot would miss out on TV‚Äôs funniest comedy‚Äù). I fall closer to the latter on the scale, but I understand the former. I don‚Äôt really care if Mindy‚Äôs likable or not, as long as she‚Äôs entertaining, but some of her actions are insane (tracing her one-night stand to his workplace, a first-grade classroom) or ignorant (a medical doctor who doesn‚Äôt know what ‚Äúcondo‚Äù stands for?) enough to take the viewer out of the actual show to ponder, ‚ÄúWhy am I watching this person?‚Äù When the show does stumble (‚ÄúL.A.,‚Äù or the recent ill-scheduling of ‚ÄúGirl Crush‚Äù), it takes at least a week or so to right itself.  Advertisement  But when it realigns, The Mindy Project becomes one of the most enjoyable comedies on TV. Todd VanDerWerff points out that although the show seems to be in a constant state of transition, at least its trajectory is skewing upward, with a big leap forward between this season and last. I would probably watch it for the one-liners and absurdist asides (like the stalker raccoon) alone, but I also appreciate Mindy Kaling‚Äôs overall mission: To draft her own brand of romantic comedy. From the show‚Äôs first episodes, it established that Dr. Mindy Lahiri only wants to be Meg Ryan in a movie with Tom Hanks, as idealistic and unrealistic as that sounds. Her real-life counterpart has studied these rom-com tropes as well, so nods to the Nora Ephron canon (like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve Got Sext‚Äù) abound in her scripts. She‚Äôs writing within the mold while redefining it: The saga of Mindy and Danny has contained some of the show‚Äôs finest work, as a hot in-air kiss led to a short yet delightful relationship, a too-quick and devastating breakup, and a hesitant walk toward each other again.  Heading into the finale, I fully expected Mindy and Danny to end up together (the episode title is a dead giveaway), but wondered how Kaling would make it memorable, meaningful, and most of all, funny. Fortunately, she pulled off this particular hat-trick. The episode features an absolute treasure trove of hilarious lines (I could list them all in stray observations, but that would be this entire review) strewn throughout the plot that finally brings Mindy and Danny together. This storyline not only utilizes the entire supporting cast for once (Zoe Jarman, we hardly knew ye), but it also uses Kaling‚Äôs rom-com curation as an actual plotting device. Pile on devastating performances by Kaling and Chris Messina, especially, and you have one of my favorite episodes of the year.  Danny pretending to be Mindy‚Äôs mysterious train admirer honors You‚Äôve Got Mail, but also The Shop Around The Corner, the movie on which it was based. He knows her well enough to know that the promise of perfect romance will be enough to make her dump her real relationship with Detective Charlie. Danny suggests they meet on the top of the Empire State Building‚Äîadd An Affair To Remember by way of Sleepless In Seattle‚Äîwhere he will reveal that he has loved her all along. After a slight derail, he visits her when she‚Äôs sick (You‚Äôve Got Mail again), while offering to watch the ultimate film study in friendship-leading-to-romance: When Harry Met Sally (He: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll order whatever gave her an orgasm!‚Äù She: ‚ÄúYou paraphrased one of the most famous lines pretty well!‚Äù). Then, in a Danny voiceover, he takes her all over New York, ‚Äúvisiting any place that Meg Ryan ever laugh-cried.‚Äù  Advertisement  I cite Messina‚Äôs performance because although he tells Morgan and Tamra and Mindy his true feelings this episode, he has not voiced them since the breakup. But for the last four or five episodes, we still have known‚Äîby his frequent smoldering looks, attempts to work his way back into Mindy‚Äôs life, and just his ready acceptance to go get breakfast with her and be late for work.  When the entire office staff gets pulled in to lead Mindy and Danny back to each other, it works so well I wish they‚Äôd been used more throughout the entire season. Morgan has always been the office‚Äôs unsung MVP, as he figures out Danny‚Äôs secret plan (Danny asks, ‚ÄúHow did you figure it out?‚Äù, then realizes he‚Äôs talking to Morgan: ‚ÄúHow did you figure it out?‚Äù). Jeremy was awesome with his waivers, as was Peter with his final pep talk this season as he proves to Mindy that Danny still loves her.  So Mindy and Danny both race to the Empire State, and in one of my favorite bits of the episode, Danny gets hit by a car, yet still hobbles off. This is a hilarious nod to An Affair To Remember (which I will not spoil in case you haven‚Äôt seen it, but really, you should see it). Danny and Mindy reunite, and all is right with the sitcom world.  Advertisement  It‚Äôs such a perfect finale, I almost wish the show hadn‚Äôt been renewed. But then there would be no more Mindy Project, which would be a real disappointment. That‚Äôs the thing about rom-coms: The ending is always the same. But Mindy and Danny‚Äôs journey to get there was such an enjoyable trip. The challenge for season three will be to keep the momentum going into Danny and Mindy‚Äôs actual relationship, without contrived breakups or third-party romantic obstacles. This finale points to the possibility that The Mindy Project could pull it off.  Finale grade: A  Season grade: B  Stray observations:  On the train, Mindy‚Äôs coworkers are having a boring conversation about street mimes: ‚ÄúMimes don‚Äôt even talk!‚Äù  For the record, Katie Holmes is six months older than Mindy Kaling.  I fervently hope Tim Daly is on the list for Emmy-nominated guest stars this year. Even his final scene is killer: He chastises Mindy for describing herself as a prostitute again (she shakes her head and agrees, ‚ÄúI know, I know‚Äù), then walks out of their breakup like a boss without ever acknowledging that he may have any flaws. I miss him already.  Loved Morgan‚Äôs dawning look of realization about Mindy‚Äôs ‚ÄúMindy2ndaccount@hotmail‚Äù email address. And his sarcastic nods to Danny about honesty.  Also, Beverly covering her ears so she won‚Äôt have to hear Jeremy‚Äôs catfish story about the man with no torso again.  The title of Danny‚Äôs fake emails to Mindy: ‚Äúwhat if‚Ä¶ ,‚Äù ‚Äúhello,‚Äù ‚Äútoday,‚Äù ‚Äúcoffee,‚Äù ‚Äúgood times.‚Äù  Morgan explains why Mindy should know Danny loves her: ‚ÄúHe laughs at all of your jokes, and let‚Äôs face it, comedy is not your strong suit.‚Äù  The elevator guy sends Mindy up 104 floors seconds before the elevators start working again.  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre killing me, Bradley Cooper!

27c6251c-c7ea-4c2e-bd2a-7cd3554dab69,"Image copyright EPA Image caption Rebel Wilson won a defamation lawsuit against Bauer Media last year  An Australian court has ordered actress Rebel Wilson to repay the majority of her record defamation payout from a magazine publisher.  Wilson had received A$4.7m (¬£2.6m; $3.5m) in damages and interest from Bauer Media over articles that she said portrayed her as a serial liar.  But a court reduced the sum to A$600,000 earlier this month following an appeal by the publisher.  On Wednesday, Wilson was ordered to pay back A$4.1m and A$60,000 in interest.  She will also have to cover 80% of what Bauer spent on its appeal.  Wilson, an Australian star of Hollywood films including Pitch Perfect and Bridesmaids, has vowed to give all of her compensation to charity.  In its original finding, the Supreme Court of Victoria awarded her A$650,000 in general damages and $A3.9m for film roles she had lost out on. She was later paid A$180,000 in interest.  However the size of the payout, Australia's largest for a defamation case, was reduced significantly on appeal.  Ahead of the appeal case - which Wilson did not attend in person - the actress was keen to point out that the court was not reconsidering whether she had won her case, but merely the amount paid out.  The Victorian Court of Appeal ruled that Wilson had failed to prove that Bauer was responsible for her missing out on film roles.  The actress wrote on Twitter at the time: ""That's now $4 million less going to less fortunate Australians and leaves a billionaire corporation, proven guilty of malicious defamation, being able to get away with their seriously harmful acts for a very low pay day.""  The size of the original payout also generated discussion in Australia over whether it could stifle future journalism in the public interest.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,350
5e8e783c-c7fc-40a1-a2db-1be63fbf9cac,"Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately ‚Äî not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the ‚Äúcrazy and manipulative‚Äù estranged wife who has become increasingly ‚Äúunpopular in Hollywood.‚Äù She‚Äôs ‚Äúout for blood‚Äù in the divorce fight, or she ‚Äúwants to embarrass and punish‚Äù the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed ‚Äúan insane jealousy‚Äù jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes ‚ÄúAmal has stolen her identity‚Äù as the world‚Äôs most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency‚Äôs efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children ‚Äî girls especially ‚Äî whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can‚Äôt read or write and has been ‚Äúrobbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.‚Äù  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university ‚Äî while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  ‚ÄúThere are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,‚Äù Jolie wrote. ‚ÄúThere are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.‚Äù  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: ‚ÄúNot with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.‚Äù  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  ‚ÄúHardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,‚Äù Jolie wrote. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.‚Äù  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a ‚Äúpatient, long-term manner, guided by our values.‚Äù She concluded her piece by writing: ‚ÄúIf we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.‚Äù",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,769

a7b629e2-1d5e-4067-94ec-e8cca3b4bbad,"Ronald Lyle Goldman (July 2, 1968 ‚Äì June 12, 1994) was an American restaurant waiter and a friend of Nicole Brown Simpson; they were killed in 1994 at her Brentwood, Los Angeles home. Nicole's ex-husband, O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of their murders in 1995, but found liable for both deaths in a 1997 civil suit.  Early life [ edit ]  Goldman was born on July 2, 1968. He grew up in the community of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, near Chicago. His parents divorced in 1974 when he was six and, after spending a brief time in the custody of his mother, Sharon (Fohrman) Rufo, he was raised by his father, Fred Goldman, and lived with him and his younger sister, Kim Goldman.[2][3]  Goldman grew up Jewish.[4][5] He attended high school at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. He was a student at Illinois State University for one semester (where he planned to major in psychology) and a pledge to Sigma Nu fraternity before he followed his family to southern California at age 18.[6]  When younger, Goldman had worked as a camp counselor and had volunteered to help disabled children.[7][8]  In California [ edit ]  While living in Los Angeles, Goldman took some classes at Pierce College.[7] He learned to surf and enjoyed playing beach volleyball, rollerblading, nightclubbing,[9] and working out.  Upon arriving in California, he lived independently from his family and supported himself by working as an employment headhunter and tennis instructor. He then worked a string of waiter jobs.[7] He also occasionally did work as a model for Barry Zeldes, owner of Z90049 (the store next to the California Pizza Kitchen in Brentwood Gardens, where he had worked before Mezzaluna).[6] Not long before his death, he had earned an Emergency Medical Technician's license but decided not to pursue that career.[7]  Instead, Goldman told friends that he wanted to open a bar or restaurant in the Brentwood area.[7] He had shared with friends his vision of opening a future restaurant or bar characterized not by a name, but by the ankh, an Egyptian religious symbol of life that matched the tattoo on his shoulder.[6] According to his friend, Jeff Keller, he wanted to learn all facets of the restaurant-bar business, and occasionally worked as a promoter[6] at a Century City dance club called Tripps.[7] For Memorial Day, he participated with a group of event promoters in organizing a party at Renaissance, a club and restaurant on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.[6]  Goldman had also expressed aspirations to act and to be on a show, and he appeared as a contestant on the short-lived game show Studs in 1992.[10]  Friendship with Nicole Brown [ edit ]  According to a June 15, 1994 Los Angeles Times article published three days after his death, Goldman probably met Brown six weeks before they were killed, when he borrowed her Ferrari. They grew increasingly close, accompanying each other to dance clubs, and meeting for coffee and dinner during the month-and-a-half before they died. According to police and friends, their relationship was platonic. According to the article, he had borrowed her car when he met his friend, Craig Clark, for lunch. According to Clark, he told him it was her car, but that he did not say she was his girlfriend. ""He said they were friends.""[11]  Death [ edit ]  On the evening of Sunday, June 12, 1994, Goldman was a waiter at Mezzaluna Trattoria, a restaurant located at 11750 San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood. Brown had called there to report that her mother, Juditha Brown, had accidentally left her sunglasses on the table.[11] After a quick search, they were discovered in the gutter outside the restaurant. Although he had not served her table, he agreed to take them to her home after work.  Before returning the sun glasses, Goldman stopped at his apartment, located at 11663 Gorham Avenue in Brentwood. He had after-work plans with his friend, Stewart Tanner, Mezzaluna's bartender, who said: ""He was going to go home and change and then we were going to go out."" The Los Angeles Times reports, ""Goldman punched out at 9:33 pm and stayed another 15 minutes to have a bottled water at the bar. Then he left, still in his uniform, black pants and white shirt, his tie shed. He carried the glasses that Brown wanted to be returned to her. 'I'll see you later,' he called to Tanner as he walked out.""[6]  When Goldman arrived at Brown's residence, at 875 South Bundy Drive, he was stabbed to death along with her, on the walkway leading to the condominium. He was just a few weeks shy of his 26th birthday.[6] During a reconstruction of the events, the police came to believe he had arrived during or shortly after Nicole's death.[citation needed]  His body, along with Brown's, was found shortly after midnight, when police arrived at the crime scene.  Goldman is buried at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.[12]  Trials and aftermath [ edit ]  Simpson was tried for the murders of both Brown and Goldman. In October 1995, after a public trial that lasted nearly nine months, he was acquitted. In a 1997 civil trial, a jury found him liable for the wrongful death of Goldman and awarded $19.5 million in damages to his family. Simpson was subsequently jailed for an unrelated armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2008.[13][14]  The rights to Simpson's book, If I Did It, a first-person account of how he would have committed the murders had he committed them, were awarded to the Goldman family in August 2007. They were granted the proceeds from the book in 2007 as part of the $33.5 million civil jury award against him they had been trying to collect for over a decade. They own the copyright, media rights, and movie rights.[15]  They also acquired Simpson's name, likeness, life story, and right of publicity in connection with the book, according to court documents, ensuring he would not be able to profit from the book. After renaming the book If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer, the Goldman family published it in September 2007 through Beaufort Books.[16]  Foundation [ edit ]  The Goldman family contributed a portion of proceeds from the If I Did It book sales to the newly founded Ron Goldman Foundation for Justice.[17] It provides grants for multiple organizations and programs that provide resources to victims and survivors of violent crimes.[18] One of the largest donors to the foundation is Las Vegas executive Mark Goldman, Fred's first cousin.  Portrayals [ edit ]  Goldman was portrayed by Paul Witten in the TV movie The O. J. Simpson Story. He was portrayed by Russ Russo in Reenactment of the Century. He will be portrayed by Oliver Walker in Joshua Newton‚Äôs upcoming 2019 film Nicole & O.J..  See also [ edit ]",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1411

According to the latest speculation into Katie and Jamie‚Äôs personal lives, the alleged couple is spending way too much money during this courtship.  After Katie Holmes decided to end her troubled marriage with the Top Gun star, rumors started to surface that she is having an on-and-off relationship with former Dawson‚Äôs Creek‚Äôs co-star Joshua Jackson. After that, her name was linked with How I Met Your Mother star Jason Segel. If that was not it, there were several rumors that indicated her inclination toward her The Kennedys: After Camelot co-star Matthew Perry. From the past three years, there are rumors that the 38-year-old Katie is having a secret and serious relationship with 49-year-old Jamie Foxx.  According to an insider who spoke to Life & Style, the alleged couple has put a lot of work into keeping their romance out of the media. Their secret romance is all about secret trips, sworn secrecy, and disguises. Not only this, they have even asked their close friends not to reveal their relationship among the paparazzi.  ‚ÄúTheir relationship is warm and passionate and very, very private. Only their closest friends are privy to their love affair,‚Äù the source told the outlet.  As previously reported by different media outlets, the real reason behind all the secrecy is Tom Cruise. According to them, Tom will feel betrayed that his old friend and Collateral co-star got involved with his ex-wife.  ‚ÄúKatie would go to Jamie‚Äôs house and lie down in the back of a car so she wouldn‚Äôt be seen on the way in. Jamie and Katie also felt safe on yachts because no one would see them out on the water.

In the leaked pictures, they both tried to go incognito by sporting sunglasses and hats.  The insider went on to suggest that after having a tough time dealing with the Church of Scientology and her troubled marriage to Tom Cruise, the Batman Begins actress wanted her personal life to go as smoothly as possible. The recent attempts by Jamie are making her extremely anxious, but given the fact that she is deeply in love with him, she is willing to spend $100,000 per year just to have a background check on everyone they hang out with.  ‚ÄúThis is not at all how Katie saw her life going. But she will take this over nothing. Katie‚Äôs friends are telling her that if he isn‚Äôt willing to step up and be there for her as a true partner, it‚Äôs time for her to move on,‚Äù the insider said. ‚ÄúBut she really loves him and can‚Äôt seem to let go.‚Äù  A lot has been said and published about the personal lives of Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx. There were once rumors that Katie was pregnant, then there were rumors indicating that due to her contractual marriage with Tom Cruise, she is not allowed to publicly date until 2017. Now there are these rumors suggesting that the alleged couple is spending millions just to maintain privacy from the media and Tom Cruise.  Fans of both Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx should remember that neither the stars nor their representatives have confirmed the news about their relationship.

Taking it to that level and unveiling her [new body] with a fully naked photo spread is going way too far.'  Kardashian momager Kris, who is said to have known about Jenner‚Äôs surgery in advance, has vowed to stop the shoot from going ahead, according to the insider.  ‚ÄòShe knew the surgery was inevitable and it was bound to happen,‚Äô said the source. ‚ÄòBut she says she will do everything in her power to stop the shoot if she can.'  DailyMail.com has approached representatives for Jenner and the Kardashians for comment. Jenner's rep knew nothing about it.  Jenner first announced her transition in an interview with Sawyer in April 2015 and revealed her new look in a Vanity Fair spread the following July.  The headline-making ‚ÄòI am Cait‚Äô shoot was said to have taken the Kardashian clan by surprise at the time and led to tension between Jenner and Kim, 36, as a result.  Nevertheless, the family have been publicly supportive of her decision to transition, which was completed in January according leaked extracts from her memoir.  Jenner wrote of the $20,000 operation: 'The surgery was a success, and I feel not only wonderful but liberated [‚Ä¶] I am going to live authentically for the first time in my life.  ‚ÄòI am going to have an enthusiasm for life that I have not had in 39 years since the Olympics, almost two thirds of my life.'  But the book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife and step-children.  Sources close to the family told DailyMail.com that Jenner‚Äôs ‚Äòunpredictable‚Äô behavior has also played a part in their current estrangement.  The insider said: ‚Äò[The book] is definitely something that she‚Äôs wanted to do for a while and it was just a matter of time before she got it done.  ‚ÄòBut the family were like, it‚Äôs probably going to reopen the drama of everything [that has happened].  ‚ÄòThey were worried because she‚Äôs been so unpredictable lately and just trying to get out into the limelight.‚Äô  Jenner's book, which was written with the help of Vanity Fair reporter Buzz Bissinger, has soured relations between Jenner and her former wife  A second leaked extract from the memoir has already proven embarrassing, after Jenner claimed the late Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty of the murder of his wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.  Kardashian, the father of Kourtney, Khloe, Kim and their brother Rob, was part of Simpson‚Äôs defense team during his 1995 trial.  The disgraced football star was acquitted of the charges but, in 1998, was found ‚Äòresponsible‚Äô for the deaths in a subsequent civil trial.  Writing in her memoir, Jenner says she was in a car with Kardashian a few years after the murders when he said: 'I would‚Äôve been okay with it if they had gotten him [Simpson] in the first trial.'  An insider tells DailyMail.com that the Kardashians learned of the 67-year-old‚Äôs plan from her model son Brody  She added: 'The implication was obvious that he believed O.J. was guilty.‚Äô  According to a family insider, Kris and the four Kardashians now rarely speak to Jenner.  The insider said: ‚ÄòKylie and do [talk to Jenner]. They do keep in communication and they‚Äôre fully supportive [of her transition].  ‚ÄòBut when Kylie and Kendall do speak with her, it‚Äôs always secret ‚Äì they don‚Äôt want to bring it up to their mom or sisters because it causes a lot of drama, so they keep it secret and between them.‚Äô  The source added: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just the Kardashian part of the family that hasn‚Äôt been talking to her. They feel like she had been riding on their coattails long enough for the fame and that she is really milking it for all its worth.  ‚ÄòThey feel if she wants to do things her way, she should be on her own - a lot of these things that she‚Äôs doing are trying to one-up them and trying to gain the spotlight back.  ‚ÄòWhile [the operation] was inevitable, they think her plan to do the nude spread is over the top.

a81cf2ec-4afb-4ecc-b7a1-51b1d25c961c,"Learning how to apply makeup isn't as simple as it seems‚Äîand watching complicated YouTube tutorials can only make you more confused. Does foundation go before or after concealer? Should you put your eyeshadow on first or last? The truth: It‚Äôs pretty much all up to personal preference. But after years of being a beauty editor and talking to makeup pros, I‚Äôve found a layering technique that works perfectly for me. For example, I fill in my brows before putting on foundation, since it‚Äôs one of the most important steps in my full routine. (So if I‚Äôm rushing at the end of my makeup routine, at least my brows will be done.) I also put on setting spray before mascara because I‚Äôve ruined one too many makeup looks with runny black streaks doing it the other way around.  I recommend this same application sequence to my girlfriends when I‚Äôm giving impromptu lessons in the bathroom before we go out, but don't worry‚Äîyou can remove and add steps as you see fit. For instance, I spend more time in areas like brows and highlighter, but you might want to focus your efforts on your eye makeup. I also edit based on how much time I have. I only have five minutes? Then I‚Äôm priming, concealing, adding some blush and highlighter, and putting on a quick brow. If I‚Äôve got an entire hour to prep, then I‚Äôm going all out. Really, you can customize this guide to fit your needs. Consider this a makeup beginner‚Äôs outline to layering your makeup, step by step.  Step 1: Moisturize or apply a primer.  Kardashian favorite Mario Dedivanovic says using a hydrating cream before makeup helps all the powders and products you apply on top sink into the skin, making your makeup look less cakey. Since I prefer a dewy makeup look, I spray my face with a mist like MAC Prep + Prime Fix+ ($26). Then I massage in an illuminating primer or oil like Farsali Unicorn Essence ($54). You don‚Äôt have to use a product that is marketed as a primer; any moisturizer will do.  Step 2: Fill in brows.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I always start my makeup look with the most time-consuming element. For me, that‚Äôs my brows (others like to do eyeshadow first, but I‚Äôm pretty clueless when it comes to eye makeup). First, I use a pencil to fill in sparse areas with hairlike strokes. Currently I‚Äôm liking the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz pencil ($21). I‚Äôll stop here if I‚Äôm in a hurry. When I‚Äôm being extra, I add a powder or pomade to really define the ends of my brows, where there is basically no hair. For this, I use Kat Von D 24-Hour Super Brow Long-Wear Pomade ($19). Finally, I lock it all in with a gel, like It Cosmetics Brow Power Pomade ($24).  Step 3: Apply foundation.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I don‚Äôt like to use a lot of foundation, which is why I follow makeup artist Faye Lauren‚Äôs rule of thumb: Focus on the areas you want to even out and leave the rest of the face foundation-free. So, I apply my foundation starting at the center of my face: Around my nose, the eyes, and on my forehead, but I leave the area around my jawline only lightly covered. This prevents me from getting brown makeup stains everywhere when I put my hands on my chin throughout the day (that‚Äôs my thinking pose). I like to use a sponge or brush to apply my foundation, because I hate having my fingers dirty with product.  Step 4: Cover dark spots with concealer.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Carmen Williamson, a makeup artist at Joanna Czech Dallas, previously told SELF that the best way to layer on concealer is after foundation in order to make sure your makeup blends together and that you don‚Äôt overdo it. This method works best for me because I get the kind of brightening I need for my purplish-black dark circles. I use a shade that is a bit lighter than my foundation under my eyes. I also apply a little concealer to my lids to act as a primer for when I wear eyeshadow.  Step 5: Add eyeshadow.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  You know those YouTube tutorials with eyeshadow primer and four shadow colors? I can‚Äôt do all that. I just pick one shade that reflects my outfit or my mood and put it all over my lids. Sometimes I try to get fancy and do a darker color in the crease of my eye, but that‚Äôs only if I‚Äôm planning to be in a dark place (like a club or ballroom) where no one will notice my eyeshadow ineptitude .  Step 6: Finish off the eye look with liner.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I‚Äôm not a huge fan of complicated eyeliner looks (are you sensing an eye theme here?). I use a very fine pencil like the Marc Jacobs Fineliner Ultra Skinny Gel Eye Crayon ($24) to outline my waterline (that‚Äôs the area underneath the lashes). When I do eyeliner on top of my lid, I am bound to mess it up. So, I keep a stiff, angled eyeliner brush like the Trish McEvoy #50 Angled Eyeliner Brush ($29) to blend it out into a more natural-looking‚Äîand mistake free‚Äîline.  Step 7: Add blush to the apples of cheeks.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Blush is one of my favorite parts of applying makeup because a few swipes and I automatically look more put together. It probably has something to do with the fact that blush is usually the first colorful thing I add, whereas everything else is pretty neutral. I always use a powder blush in a bright vibrant color like orange or bright fuchsia. But first, I swipe a little setting powder under my eyes to set my concealer and down on my cheeks. This was a tip I learned from makeup artist Fiona Stiles.‚ÄúIf you try to apply a powder blush over liquid foundation, the pigment will streak and be impossible to blend,‚Äù she says. I apply the blush on the apples of my cheeks (that‚Äôs the best placement for my square face shape). I like to apply blush before highlighter because, as Stiles also told me, sometimes the shimmer in your blush is enough.  Step 8: Apply highlighter.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Highlighter is one of my go-to makeup items. When I only have five minutes to do makeup, I do brow, concealer, blush, highlight, and a lip. I start with a cream or liquid-based highlighter like Glossier Haloscope ($22) on my cheekbones and browbones as well as down my nose. I‚Äôll stop here if I‚Äôm just doing my makeup for a day at the office. If it‚Äôs a night out, I add a powder like Nars Highlighting Powder ($38) on top to elevate my shine at least two levels.  Step 9: Apply contour.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  There‚Äôs much debate about what if contour should be first or last in the cheek trifecta (blush/highlighter/contour), but I like to do it last. That‚Äôs mostly because it‚Äôs got to be a very special occasion for me to contour . I use a stick like the Fenty Beauty Matte Skinstick ($25) to get the defined lines on my cheeks, forehead, and nose (the right tool is the key to getting a contour that isn‚Äôt too muddy). Then, I use an angled brush to blend it all in.  Step 10: Swipe on a statement lip.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  On lazy days, I skip straight to this step. Sometimes a lip has got to be enough. I cover my entire lip with liner to help my lipstick last a lot longer‚Äîa pro-approved tip I learned from my mother. Over that, I add a layer of matte liquid lipstick in a color that matches the liner pretty closely. Then apply a lipstick color that works well with the lip liner shade.  Step 11: Set your entire face with setting powder or spray‚Äîor both.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Makeup artist Hector Simancas likes to use both setting powder and spray to keep makeup in place, and I take a similar strategy. I use powder, like Maybelline Facestudio Master Fix Setting + Perfecting Loose Powder ($7), in the T-zone and underneath the eyes. Then, I spritz with my favorite setting spray, Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray ($32), to make sure I maintain the dewy look I like.  Step 12: Finally, put on mascara.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Mascara is my very last step because I've found that if I put it on before my setting spray it usually ends up streaking down my face. I also make sure to keep Q-tips handy to easily clean up inevitable stray smudges without ruining all my work.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1789

643f6eef-0f2a-4b18-8012-b1f27f733411,"Meghan Markle is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19, 2018. Life as she knows it will forever change from that day forward. Although, since announcing their engagement, life has already changed plenty for the humanitarian and (former) actress. Between her first royal engagement with Harry and spending Christmas with the royal family,Meghan has had to make some significant adjustments to her life and the way she interacts with the public.  Below, in no particular order, a list of things Meghan probably won‚Äôt be doing once she officially becomes a Duchess.  1. Take selfies.  Meghan has already mastered this rule.During her first official event with Prince Harry in early December, Meghan reportedly told a couple who asked for a selfie, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not allowed to do selfies.‚Äù  Meghan is learning the royal ropes already, telling one couple who asked for a selfie in Nottingham today: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not allowed to do selfies.‚Äù ‚Äî Victoria Murphy (@QueenVicMirror) December 1, 2017  Meghan also probably won‚Äôt be allowed to use any social media filters (like the puppy one from Snapchat, above) in public, and she can also say goodbye to posing with pretty drinks, unless it‚Äôs for an official royal appearance.  On top of all this, Queen Elizabeth allegedly isn‚Äôt a fan of the selfie. In 2014, U.S. ambassador Matthew Barzun told Tatler magazine that The Queen confided in him and revealed that selfies were ‚Äúdisconcerting‚Äù and ‚Äústrange‚Äù to her. To put it another way, ‚ÄúShe was essentially saying: ‚ÄòI miss eye contact,‚Äô‚Äù Barzun said. (via Hello!)  Related article: The Greatest Royal Family Moments To Relive From 2017  2. Go out in public totally alone.  Summer-summer-summertiiiiiime‚Ä¶ ‚òÄÔ∏è A post shared by Meghan Markle (@meghanmarkle) on May 28, 2016 at 11:11am PDT  Have you ever seen the Duchess of Cambridge all by herself? Like every member of the royal family, Meghan will likely have security with her everywhere she goes.  3. Give autographs.  Save for official signings at royal engagements, members of the royal family are not allowed to sign autographs for the public.The fear is that someone could forge the signature and use it against the family. In 2010, Prince Charles broke this protocol when he granted an autograph to one of the victims of the Cornwall floods. According to The Telegraph, he wrote, ‚ÄúCharles 2010‚Äù and apologized for his ‚Äúshaky writing.‚Äù  4. Use social media.  Meghan will likely join Harry, Kate, and Will under @KensingtonRoyal on social media. The trio have been providing updates about the charities they support on the account, which has provided an intimate but controlled line of communication between the young royals and the public. @KensingtonRoyal is where Meghan and Harry released their official engagement photos in December and also where they announced their wedding date.  5. Show PDA.  There‚Äôs a reason photos of Kate and Will kissing are limited to their wedding day smooch on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. Does this mean that Meghan and Harry‚Äôs engagement photos will be the last time we see them get up close and personal? According to royal etiquette expert Myka Meier (via People), there is no official protocol against PDA, despite Meghan and Harry‚Äôs predecessors keeping things to a minimum. (Recall Kate and Will‚Äôs hug fest during the 2010 Olympics in London.) Says Meier, ‚ÄúMeghan and Prince Harry holding hands at a royal engagement is a refreshingly modern approach to their new role both as a couple and as representative of the royal family.‚Äù FYI, Kate and Will held hands during their Christmas morning walk to church in December 2017, while Meghan held onto Harry‚Äôs arm. But that‚Äôs probably all we‚Äôll get moving forward.  Related article: How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Will Make A Living After The Wedding  6. Vote.  Meghan, who will seek British citizenship after her marriage to Harry, will likely not participate in future UK elections. As the official parliament website states: ‚ÄúAlthough not prohibited by law, it is considered unconstitutional for the Monarch to vote in an election,‚Äù referring to Queen Elizabeth II. Beyond The Queen, the law is blurry, but a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace told Newsweek in June 2017 that members of the royal family do not exercise their voting rights ‚Äúby convention.‚Äù  7. Wear see-through outfits like the $75,000 Ralph & Russo mesh dress in Meghan‚Äôs engagement photos.  While there was no obvious cleavage or slip-up, the sheer look of the dress raised some eyebrows and will likely be the last see-through dress Meghan wears in public or in official photos. She also drew (unnecessary) attention when she stepped out without stockings the day she and Harry announced their engagement.  ‚ÄúYou never see a royal without their nude stockings,‚Äù royal expert Victoria Arbiter tells Business Insider. ‚ÄúMeghan, from what I can see from the engagement photographs, it doesn‚Äôt look like she was wearing tights or stockings. I would say that‚Äôs really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires.‚Äù  8. Wear colorful or dark nail polish.  As per royal protocol, only nails bearing natural colors are allowed at official events.According to nail polish giant Essie, Queen Elizabeth has been a customer of ‚ÄúBallet Slippers,‚Äù a very subtle light shade of pink, since 1989.  Related article: 6 Major Ways Meghan Markle Has Already Broken Royal Convention  9. Wear wedges.  This rule reportedly only applies when Queen Elizabeth is present. In 2015, a source told Vanity Fair, ‚ÄúThe Queen isn‚Äôt a fan of wedged shoes. She really doesn‚Äôt like them and it‚Äôs well known among the women in the family.‚Äù Wedge away, Meghan, just as Kate has when the Queen‚Äôs not around.  10. Stick her tongue out.  There‚Äôs a reason tongue wagging has only been displayed by the youngest members of the family, and even those instances are rare. Though, to go with her recent string of breaking royal tradition, Meghan stuck her tongue out while walking to church on Christmas with the royal family.  11. Carry giant purses.  Yes, it‚Äôs very convenient when your giant bag can fit everything from a laptop to three days‚Äô worth of snacks. But when you‚Äôre a royal, other people carry things for you, right?  While it‚Äôs unclear whether or not carrying clutches (instead of big purses) is an official royal rule, there‚Äôs a really good reason why Duchess Kate and The Queen are almost always seen with clutches or bags with small handles. As one royal expert explained to The Daily Mail, ‚ÄúThe Duchess of Cambridge may well prefer not to shake hands with certain people ‚Äì but there are other ways to achieve this, as used by The Queen and other members of the royal family, than opting for a clutch over a bag with a strap.‚Äù What‚Äôs more: ‚ÄúIt is protocol that you do not extend your hand to any member of the royal family‚Ä¶ unless their hand extends first.‚Äù  Princess Diana was also a fan of clutches in the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s, but it had less to do with etiquette or protocol and more to do with practicality. She called them ‚Äúcleavage bags,‚Äù according to designer Anya Hindmarch, whose bags were a favorite of Diana‚Äôs. In 2009, Hindmarch told The Telegraph: ‚ÄúWe used to laugh when we designed what she called her ‚Äòcleavage bags,‚Äô little satin clutches which she would cover her cleavage with when she stepped out of cars.‚Äù",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1477

Baby Fiona, Bibi's firstborn, was supposed to arrive in March but instead was six weeks premature and about 25 pounds lighter than the lowest recorded birth weight for her species. Fiona, born Jan. 24 at 29 pounds, now tips the scales at 550.  ‚ñ∫ Oct. 10: Fiona the baby hippo featured in new children's book  ‚ñ∫ June 1: Fiona the hippo dazzles in front of the cameras  ‚ñ∫ April 29: Baby hippo's keepers learn to live with bruises  Henry, who had sired other hippos in Springfield, wasn't there for Fiona's birth but was introduced to her in July. He, Fiona and Bibi would spend most of their days napping on top of one another like a normal hippo herd.  Then Henry stopped eating and got diarrhea. Henry's caretakers began feeding him antibiotics and pain medication with applesauce and beet pulp. But ""nothing ‚Äî antibiotics, favorite foods, extra TLC ‚Äî seemed to turn his condition around,‚Äù said Christina Gorsuch, the zoo's curator of mammals.

""Vets and his care team worked tirelessly to keep him comfortable and help him fight this illness.""  In the intervening months he had lost hundreds of pounds from his 3,650-pound frame and could not overcome his infection. Despite having some good days, the bad ones outnumbered them, so caretakers decided to euthanize him Tuesday, according to a zoo statement.  ‚ñ∫ March 14: The science behind milking a hippo, saving baby Fiona  ‚ñ∫ Feb. 5: Cincinnati Zoo's premature hippo Fiona takes first steps  ""He became pickier and pickier until he was barely eating anything and he began losing weight,"" Henry's caretaker, Wendy Rice, wrote on her blog Monday. ""Additionally, he became more lethargic and less interactive with keeper staff and even his interactions with Bibi and Fiona diminished.""  When caretakers first noticed his illness, they isolated him from Fiona and Bibi because they were worried that he might be contagious. When tests came back negative for bad bacteria and viruses, zoo staff brought the trio back together.  ‚ÄúFrom meeting, bonding and breeding with his mate Bibi, to becoming a father to charismatic and spirited Fiona, Henry‚Äôs days in Cincinnati were filled with sunshine, watermelons (and) waterfalls.‚Äù Wendy Rice, Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden  Henry started to get better, but at the end of September began going downhill again, Rice wrote. In mid-October, zoo doctors anesthetized Henry for a full checkup and a transfer of some of Bibi's healthy digestive system bacteria into Henry's stomach.  But Henry's white blood cell count soon after showed he was fighting a serious infection and his kidneys appeared to be shutting down.  ""While our time with him has been short in quantity, no one can deny that his quality of life before becoming ill was exceptional,"" Rice said. The median life expectancy for a male Nile hippopotamus is 35, so Henry was a year older.  ""From meeting, bonding and breeding with his mate Bibi, to becoming a father to charismatic and spirited Fiona, Henry‚Äôs days in Cincinnati were filled with sunshine, watermelons, waterfalls and the highest quality of care that can be provided to any animal,"" she said.

But humour notwithstanding, there are several issues with our response to Aniston's breakup.  First of all, it's a break up. Need I remind any of you what it feels like to end ties with someone who was your partner for over five years (married for 2, together for 7)? It feels like the pits. The last thing you want to do is scroll through twitter and find your face attached to way too many memes about getting back together with a man that left you for another woman. Pretty sure Jennifer, right now, is thinking ""thanks but no thanks"".  We are so obssessed with happy-endings and romance that practicality, self-happiness seem to matter very little.  Has it occurred to noone that maybe, just maybe, Jennifer Aniston wants to be alone? That after a whirlwind of two marriages and much heartbreak, maybe it would better for her to be by herself? Would that be too bad? Why is it so hard for us to imagine Jennifer Aniston being alone? Or single? Does being single automatically mean someone is not happy?  Remember, the statement that those two gave out with the news of their divorce was this: ""This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.""  Doesn't sound any bit the heartbreak to me. If anything, Jennifer Aniston is probably happier being by herself and away from the world's baggage involving her love life. Besides, I'd like to see people trying so hard to couple up the single male actors in Hollywood.  Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she's with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.  Besides, in my humble opinion, Aniston is way beyond Brad Pitt's league. If she *had* to get together with someone in the near future, I sincerely hope it is with someone new.

60accd96-9b89-49e3-b897-a666c279b6b5,"0  The Epix drama series Berlin Station is back for Season 2, as the Far Right tide is sweeping across Europe while Germany is in the midst of a pivotal election. And with Alt-Right party leader Katerina Gerhardt captivating disillusioned voters fed up with the status quo, the team at Berlin Station must determine the nature and level of the threat that she poses and what they should do about it.  During this 1-on-1 interview with Collider, actress Ashley Judd (who plays the new Chief of Station, BB Yates) talked about what drew her to Berlin Station and this character, how her TED Talk led them to want to cast her, crashing the boy‚Äôs club, finding a balance between acting and her humanitarian work, and loving action. She also talked about what a pleasure it was to be a part of Twin Peaks: The Return, and to work with David Lynch and Richard Beymer.  Collider: How did you come to Season 2 of Berlin Station? What was it that drew you to the show?  ASHLEY JUDD: My manager reached out to me and said that the good folks at Epix had a very special show with an incredibly strong ensemble cast, and that the show was very smart. She said that they had watched my TED Talk and they wanted me to play BB Yates, who would be the boss of the CIA in Germany. I loved the idea, instantly, particularly when I watched Season 1 and saw what a strong actor and character Valerie Edwards is and the fact that, in the second season, Esther Krug would be the head of German intelligence. I think that the show looks like what the 21st century should be, in terms of gender parity in the workplace. So, when you have all of us together, augmented with Keke [Palmer], it‚Äôs phenomenal. I‚Äôm 49 and Michelle [Forbes] is 52, and that‚Äôs fantastic. I think that audiences are going to love it.  How is BB Yates received by the boy‚Äôs club of being in a profession like this?  JUDD: Another thing that appealed to me was learning that, as the season evolved, I would continue to be crashing the boy‚Äôs club. My nemesis is the U.S. Ambassador, who‚Äôs a political appointee. He‚Äôs not someone with a background in diplomacy from the state department. He‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs violating the traditional boundary between the White House and the CIA. With BB leaving, the CIA becomes a place of resistance, so it adds to the intrigue.  Have you ever had someone want to cast you because of your TED Talk before this?  JUDD: It affirmed to me that they want me for exactly who and what I am. I‚Äôve been acting now for a little over 20 years and I have a body of work that accurately expresses what I‚Äôm capable of doing, Paramount has been a studio home for me since Kiss the Girls, so there are many reasons why I could be an obvious choice, but I have all of my international travel with my humanitarian work and I‚Äôm a PhD student at University of California Berkeley. For them to say, ‚ÄúOh, we love Ashley! Let‚Äôs look at her TED Talk and see how that energy fits with BB,‚Äù was just absolutely delightful. It‚Äôs an example of, how I do something is how I do everything. There doesn‚Äôt have to be a false separation between my advocacy voice and how I show up in my acting.  Because you do so much outside of acting, is it hard to find acting roles that get you excited enough to want to take time away from the other work that you do, or do you like to have a balance?  JUDD: I like the balance. I loved working on Twin Peaks. Mr. Lynch called and said that he‚Äôd written something for me, which was a wonderful compliment and seemed like it would be really fun. And then, I did a movie about human trafficking (called Trafficked), that came out in October. I was in India for the month of March. I was in Jordan, working with Syrian refugees, before India. I‚Äôve also been to the war zone in eastern Ukraine. So, I have a very balanced and full life, and acting will always, God willing, be a part of that life ‚Äòcause I love it.  Do the worlds that you work in ‚Äì acting and humanitarian ‚Äì feel very different?  JUDD: Berlin Station has wet my appetite for acting again. I‚Äôm more open-minded now about scripts than I was, over the past couple of years, when I was really hunkered down pretty exclusively in the humanitarian work. Acting is very joyful for me. The process is draining and time consuming, but the acting itself is really joyful.  Have you had fun doing some of the more physical roles that you‚Äôve done?  JUDD: I love that! I made sure that I told them right away, on Berlin Station as I did on Missing, that I would love to be able to fight. I love to fight.  Are you able to get out in the field and do that, this season?  JUDD: There‚Äôs a little bit, but I‚Äôm running the station, making it all happen. So far, I haven‚Äôt had a chance to do a big fight scene.  As the person who has to come in to run things, how does everybody else react to her?  JUDD: Well, there‚Äôs always workplace relationships, and some are more straightforward than others. Part of what‚Äôs so nice about the work with Keke is that I mentor her and it‚Äôs a strong female-to-female alliance.  How was it to work on Twin Peaks with Richard Beymer, who was there from the beginning?  JUDD: It was super cool. He‚Äôs such a lovely man. Of course, I asked Mr. Lynch what the humming sound was, and he said, ‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt tell you that!‚Äù  Berlin Station airs on Sunday nights on Epix.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1191

Cattrall‚Äôs brother Chris, 55, was found dead last week after going missing from his home in Alberta, Canada.  After announcing his death, Cattrall thanked both her fans and her Sex and the City colleagues for support.  #SexandtheCity A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Feb 6, 2018 at 12:39pm PST  But four days after posting that message, the actor, who played Samantha on the hit HBO show, followed it up with a post directed at Parker, criticising her for ‚Äúreaching out‚Äù, and saying she had been cruel.  In the caption, Cattrall said Parker‚Äôs ‚Äúcontinual reaching out‚Äù was ‚Äúa painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now‚Äù.  She went on: ‚ÄúYou are not my family. You are not my friend‚Äù and urged Parker to ‚Äústop exploiting our tragedy.‚Äù  Cattrall‚Äôs post linked to an article in the New York Post from October 2017. It described an ongoing feud between the stars which culminated with a dispute over whether to produce a third Sex and the City movie, which Cattrall said she did not want to do.  Parker has not publicly responded to the statement.

The sexy superstar just wrapped up Mariah: #1 to Infinity, her first-ever Vegas residency, where she performed all 18 of her #1 hits at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Fans who didn't catch Mimi's Vegas show will get another chance in December when she returns to the Colosseum for All I Want for Christmas Is You, a holiday concert series that, yes, will be sure to feature that iconic, titular hit. (For those unable to head out West for the holidays, you can also catch Mariah's Christmas shows at New York's Beacon Theatre.) On top of these performances, the pop star has her hands in two film projects: the first, All I Want For Christmas Is You, is an animated movie based on her holiday hit and out this November and the second, The Star, is another animated feature out the same month in which she wrote the film's titular song.  At our cover shoot, Carey's outfits channel the glittery, over-the-top extravagance of her new city. ""I think this is kind of a fairy princess moment,"" she says of one sparkly gold tulle gown. ""And I took off my shoes to be very Cinderella,"" she adds. ""Although I don't know that Cinderella went as plunging in the neckline."" So, an adult, glamorous Cinderella? ""Adult, glamorous...yeah, I guess so,"" she says. ""If I have to be an adult, sure.""  Click through for more Mariah photos from our 'Las Vegas' cover story!  What made you decide to do a show in Las Vegas?  Well, I just thought it would be something in between albums, because now I'm working on a new album and new singles, and I just thought it was a great place to be able to be. Because I have twins [Moroccan and Monroe], who just turned six...to have them be in one place for a period of time rather than, like, touring for all that time [is great]. They go with me.  And they say 'What happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas.' Do you have any of those kinds of moments that you really cut loose?  Well, it's hard because sometimes it's like two nights on back to back so I don't really [go out] -- it's not like, 'WOO HOO,' let's, like, go wild on the Las Vegas strip, but occasionally some of my friends and I will drive around, have fun, go to different places, do whatever.  If your friend was going to Las Vegas for the first time, besides seeing your wonderful show, are there other things you would suggest they do?  Well, if they have kids they should take them to the dentist that [my kids] go to, because it's a kids' dentist and they have all these games there...I'm sitting here waiting to go to the dentist, like, 'Let me get to Vegas so I can get to the dentist!'  I can't imagine many people would recommend going to Las Vegas for a dentist.  Darling, you've got to take care of your teeth.  Your fans love your many 'Mariah moments.' You know, like your 'butterfly moment' or an 'off-the-shoulder moment' is something you're always loving. Are there any moments you're particularly feeling these days?  I like good moments. There's often moments that I'm like, 'This is not a good moment.' But usually when I'm like, 'It's a moment,' I really mean it in a good way.  What about a diva moment?  I've never had a diva moment.  No?  No...Actually, I have had diva moments, and then people can't handle it. I guess it's a little intense, because I come from a true diva: My mother is an opera singer. And that's a real diva, you know -- Juilliard diva. And so other people that are like, 'I'm a diva,' it's like, 'Honey, you don't know what a diva is, you didn't grow up with my mom.' [Laughs] And I mean it as a compliment, or I wouldn't be the person I am without experiencing that. And so when people hear me say, like, 'Dahling da da da da' and talk that way, it's kinda like I'm channeling my mother. Not that she says 'dahling' all the time, but like that voice is... it's like I inadvertently do it, and I don't do it to be disrespectful, I just do it and it just happens and it's like, [in diva voice] 'I don't even know why.'  So you can't fight it; it's in your blood.  I can't fight it, no.  If you could start a rumor about yourself, what would it be?  Start a rumor about myself? Oh, do we have to do that? Can't we just leave it to all the other people who love to start rumors? I don't know. I've already said that I insist on having puppies everywhere I go, which would be great! Like, that would be great, no?  You're such a huge star, but can you remember the last time you were starstruck?  There's always people who I admire and when I see them [I get starstruck]. The last time I saw Prince, he came to my dressing room. I had said I wanted to go visit him to say hello because we've met before.When he was living we had had lots of conversations, and he helped me through certain moments that were not easy. I don't want to get too depressing, but I was having a conversation with Prince and then I looked around the room and I noticed that everyone in the room was looking up and staring like they couldn't believe he was standing there. But I would always be a little bit starstruck [when] I [saw] Michael Jackson as well.  Finally, in three words, tell me what it's like to be Mariah Carey.  Pshh, three words!?  You can do more, but that's the challenge.  [Laughs] So many things...Sooo. Many. Things. Those are my three words.

Grissom starred with Feldman and the late Corey Haim in two films: ‚ÄúLicense to Drive‚Äù and ‚ÄúDream a Little Dream.‚Äù  Feldman launched a campaign last month to finance a documentary that would expose the alleged pedophiles in Hollywood. He‚Äôs seeking $10 million to fund the film, and pay for attorneys and security for his own protection.  ‚ÄúThat is him,‚Äù Feldman said Thursday on ‚ÄúThe Dr. Oz Show‚Äù as the host held up a photo of Grissom on his phone. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the guy.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis guy, on his Myspace page and his Facebook page has pictures of me and Corey Haim,‚Äù Feldman said. ‚ÄúHe still taunts it and flaunts it.‚Äù  The actor had mentioned the alleged assaulter in his 2013 memoir, ‚ÄúCoreyography,‚Äù but changed his name to ‚ÄúRon Crimson‚Äù for legal purposes.  ‚ÄúThe lawyers made me change the names,‚Äù Feldman added. ‚ÄúThey gave me a list of three or four names.

Before and after his landmark show last week at the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Most Famous Arena,‚Äù the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible ‚Äî and likely all-time record-breaking ‚Äî MSG run.  After mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.  ‚ÄúThis past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,‚Äù he said.

""Dancing with the Stars"" host Tom Bergeron addressed the interruption after the commercial break.  ""We had to go to break because we had a little incident,"" he said, although he didn't clarify any further. Bergeron thanked the security team on the show.  He also asked Lochte how he was doing after the interruption.  ""I'm a little hurt""  ""So many feelings are going through my head right now,"" said the Olympic swimmer. ""I'm a little hurt.""  After the show, Lochte told CNN that he was saddened by what happened.  ""You know, at that moment, I was really heartbroken,"" he said. ""My heart just sunk. It felt like somebody just ripped it apart.""  But Lochte added he ""had to brush it off.""  ""Completely shocked"" but ""beyond"" proud of him  ""I had to realize that I came out here in front of millions. I did something that I did not know how to do -- I don't know how to dance,"" he said. ""And I gave it my all and I'm glad I did it and I'm glad I'm here.""  His dancing partner, Burke, said she was ""completely shocked"" but ""beyond"" proud of him.  CNN crews captured two suspected protesters outside of the event being led away in handcuffs. They both wore T-shirts that contained a red circle with a slash going through the word Lochte. One man called Lochte ""a liar.""

Professional dancer Witney Carson, who this year is paired with Robert Van Winkle, known best as Vanilla Ice, said she'd never seen anything like the incident during her time on the show.  ""I think it was just saddening and disheartening more than anything because this is such a positive show and we're all about putting people in a positive light,"" she said. ""For somebody to want to ruin that for Ryan is just really, really hard.""  ""He's a hero and a great guy on top of that""  Van Winkle also offered Lochte his support.  ""He won the gold medal for this country, folks. Get over the bull story, whatever. It doesn't matter,"" he said. ""He's a hero and he's a great guy on top of that.""  Former NFL wide receiver Calvin Johnson, Jr. told CNN the ""unfortunate"" event no doubt put ""a damper"" on Lochte's debut, but said he gave his fellow dancer a pep talk backstage.  ""You know, you have to keep pushing, have another great week next week,"" he said. ""It sucks to have somebody like that in the crowd do those kinds of things. Nobody's perfect.

The actor, 54, was spotted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology back in November where he seemingly dropped by one of Oxman‚Äôs classes the week after Thanksgiving. Several students posted pictures of the actor posing with the class, including one where he is standing next to Oxman.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs genius and gorgeous,‚Äù an architect, who has seen Oxman lecture and knows her work, tells PEOPLE.  The actor kept it casual in an all-black outfit as he happily smiled along with the students for several pictures. He also stood next to Oxman in another picture with his hands behind his back as the larger group beamed at the camera. That photo has since been taken down.  Page Six first reported last week that the two had struck up a friendship based on their shared love of architecture. Pitt reportedly met Oxman, 42, through an architecture project at MIT, where she works as a professor of media arts and sciences at the school‚Äôs Media Lab.  The duo connected over their shared love of design and architecture, a source told Page Six TV, adding that their relationship ‚Äúis best described as a professional friendship.‚Äù While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is ‚Äúinterested in spending more time‚Äù with Oxman.  RELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is ‚Äòin a Better Place‚Äô Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source  In a 2017 interview with W Magazine, Oxman used Pitt and George Clooney as examples of the human tendency to idolize male icons.

But it‚Äôs not only true for architecture; it‚Äôs true in musical composition, for females working in theater, for film directors.

aca59ce7-a20d-48ef-95a9-62cd8af2abc7,"The actor is confident that he could beat Trump if he were to place a 2020 bid for the real Oval Office.  Alec Baldwin talked politics during a Monday interview on Howard Stern's SiriusXM radio show. Naturally, the conversation turned to President Trump ‚Äî whom Baldwin hopes doesn't get to serve a second term.  Baldwin ‚Äî whose portrayal of Trump on Saturday Night Live has drawn Twitter criticism from the president himself but has earned the actor an Emmy ‚Äî told Stern, ""I can only think of a couple people who I think could beat Trump."" When Stern suggested that Baldwin should run for the Oval Office in 2020, the actor confidently replied, ""If I ran, I would win. I would absolutely win. I 1,000 percent would win.""  However, Baldwin said an official bid is highly unlikely because of his hosting duties on ABC's Match Game revival. Plus, his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, ""would kill"" him. ""I've got to do Match Game! The presidency of the United States or Match Game?"" he jokingly asked Stern. ""You tell me.""  Baldwin then slipped into his caricature of Trump and revealed his plans to take the summer off should he ever be elected. ""I'm gonna take the summer off and be like, 'Listen everybody, I'm going to East Hampton to relax. Howard and I have to go to Nick & Toni's,'"" he said, garnering laughter from Stern.  When Stern brought up the idea of Baldwin running for president as Trump, the 30 Rock alum doubled down on his prior statement: ""If I ran for president, I would win! Hands down, I would win. It would be the funniest, most exciting, most crazy campaign.""  ""You're the hope of the Democratic Party,"" Stern said, to which Baldwin quickly replied, ""I'm not.""  He elaborated: ""The only reason I say that is because I'd love to run for that position to just have things be very common sense. There's so many things that this country needs to do that are so obvious.""  During his chat with Stern, Baldwin emphasized that he'd like to ""see a healthy"" Republican Party. ""I don‚Äôt want [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi to run everything either,"" Baldwin said of the California Democrat. ""I want the Democrats to have a smart opposition to keep them on their toes.""  ""I‚Äôd like to see the Republican Party get back to [John McCain or Mitt Romney],"" he explained to Stern. ""I‚Äôd like to think that this thing with Trump is a one-off.""  Still, Baldwin believes Trump's election has had a negative impact on the way Americans view potential candidates. ""We buy the presidency now ‚Äî we vote for the president ‚Äî like we buy gum or laundry soap,"" he said. ""It‚Äôs all jingoism and all this marketing.""  Baldwin also offered a ""theory"" about Trump's history-making summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. ""You can almost see Trump's people saying to Kim Jong Un‚Äôs people, ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt really care if you get rid of the nukes. Let‚Äôs just say you are,'"" Baldwin said, slipping into his impression of Trump again. ""'It‚Äôs politics. Let me go home and say what I need to say to get reelected.'""  Baldwin has hinted that he might be done playing Trump on SNL. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said of the gig, ""Every time I do it now, it's like agony. Agony.""

Not only do the residents of Brookfield Heights, Michigan have to contend with a gang of killer clowns and a power-hungry angry young man in Kai Anderson, but now their streets are also being sprayed with a mysterious chemical by people in black haz mat suits, riding around in a truck that glows a very eerie green.  Of course, the first of all the residents to notice the peculiar vehicle is Ally Mayfair-Richards. She‚Äôs so perturbed by its sudden appearance on her street that, the second time it appears, she races outside and stands in its path, only to have to jump out of its way at the last second when it becomes clear she‚Äôll be mown down if she doesn‚Äôt.  Fans on Reddit are suggesting the gas being sprayed in her neighbourhood could be symbolic. So far, her wife Ivy has tried to convince her that every sighting of clowns she‚Äôs reported is in her head. Are these newcomers mocking the fact that she‚Äôs effectively being gaslighted by her partner?  The green glow of the truck is also notable. In a happier scene in this week‚Äôs episode, Ally, Ivy and son Oz are eating ice cream in the couple‚Äôs restaurant. Ivy comments that nobody‚Äôs tried the mint green tea flavour before feeding some to her wife. Is it coincidence that the ice cream is the exact same shade of bright green as the lights on the truck? Or is this yet another subtle signifier that Ivy has already been initiated into the cult and is now part of a plot against Ally?  Maybe whatever is being sprayed from the truck has already got to Ally‚Äôs head because, as frustrated fans have pointed out on Twitter, she doesn‚Äôt even think to use any of the modern technology at her disposal to try and help her figure out who the truck belongs to or where it‚Äôs come from. Instead of using the phone in her hand to film the vehicle as it drives past, she opts for the obviously much brighter idea of walking right up to one of the suited-up sprayers, screaming at them and pulling at their outfits until they remove their mask to reveal another mask with a smiley face just like the one the clowns have painted on their victims‚Äô homes.

Nothing happened, she said, and the abuse carried on for another five years.  Maroney, who won gold and silver at the 2012 Olympic Games in London as part of the ‚ÄúFierce Five,‚Äù said in an interview with NBC‚Äôs Dateline that she was in a car with coach John Geddert and other gymnasts when she told them, ‚ÄúLast night, it was like Larry was fingering me.‚Äù  Maroney, now 22, said Geddert did not react, while the other gymnasts appeared surprised. One of the gymnasts criticized Maroney for making the statement at the time and later told NBC that the incident did not happen. Dateline reported that three other witnesses corroborated Maroney‚Äôs story.  Geddert was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January after numerous gymnasts accused him of verbal and physical abuse. Geddert has not commented on the allegations.  The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

She said the abuse happened every time she saw him after that ‚Äî ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù of times. At the world championships in Tokyo in 2011, she said Nassar ‚Äúwent overboard.‚Äù She told NBC that she was naked with Nassar on top of her, and ‚ÄúI thought I was going to die.‚Äù  Four of Maroney‚Äôs ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù teammates have reported that they were abused by Nassar. Maroney was the first to publicly reveal the abuse, in a tweet in October 2017. She said Nassar started to abuse her when she was 13 and continued, even during the 2012 Olympic Games until she left gymnastics in 2016.  Her teammates Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas, and Jordyn Wieber have also accused Nassar of sexual abuse. Raisman and Wieber are suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Michigan State University, where Nassar was on the faculty, for failing to protect them from Nassar‚Äôs behavior.  Nassar abused the gymnasts under the pretext of medical care. An osteopath, he told the girls that the procedures would ease whatever pain they were sent to him to relieve, and would help them to continue training.  ‚ÄúHe told me he was going to do a checkup on me and that was the first day I was abused,‚Äù Maroney said during the interview. ‚ÄúHe said that nobody would understand this and the sacrifice that it takes to get to the Olympics, so you can‚Äôt tell people this.‚Äù  Maroney said that Nassar won the favor of the gymnasts by being friendly, bringing them food when they were afraid to eat while under the watchful eye of coaches and national team coordinator Martha Karolyi. ‚ÄúYour coaches are just always watching you. And wanting to keep you skinny,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI would‚Äôve starved at the Olympics if I didn‚Äôt have him bring me food.‚Äù  Martha and Bela Karolyi respond to allegations  Martha and Bela Karolyi, the famed Romanian coaches credited with bringing U.S. women‚Äôs gymnastics to world championship and Olympic glory, spoke publicly for the first time since the accusations against Nassar were revealed last fall. They said they were not aware of Nassar‚Äôs abuse, and were saddened to learn of his behavior.  Several gymnasts have said the abuse occurred on the Karolyi ranch, which doubled as the national training center, where elite gymnasts came once a month to live and train. USA Gymnastics cut ties with the Karolyi ranch in January amid the Nassar scandal.  ‚ÄúAny child who is violated by Nassar, it‚Äôs a crime and it‚Äôs so sad,‚Äù Martha said. ‚ÄúIt is very much hurtful,‚Äù Martha said of the abuse allegations. But she said she was not aware of Nassar‚Äôs sexual abuse of the gymnasts. ‚ÄúI heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this,‚Äù said Martha. ‚ÄúAnd the parent couldn‚Äôt see.

Bush, and everything else we loved about the year 2007.  Today, it's easy to forget how much America detested Spencer and Heidi, a.k.a. Speidi. Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad.  Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! ‚Ä¶ But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship‚Ä¶you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me ‚Ä¶ when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person‚Ä¶she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports. ""Actually, [Lauren] told MTV if they didn't stop filming with me she would quit and they told her then quit,"" he tells Broadly in a direct message. (Lauren's representative did not immediately respond to Broadly's request for comment.)  In the third season premiere, fans watched a similar party scene. At a club called Les Deux, Heidi hands Lauren a letter lamenting their dilapidated friendship. It does not mention the rumors. ""She won't fucking admit it,"" Lauren complains. She refuses to see her.  ""It's her problem,"" Heidi tells herself. But when Lauren flees the club, Heidi follows her.  ""You're not my friend anymore,"" Lauren tells her. ""I always feel bad for you,"" Heidi cries. She wants to know why Lauren hates her. ""You know what you did!"" Lauren cries in a scene that has become as memorable as the ""Nancy Jo, this is Alexis Neiers calling"" video.  It was one of the few moments of real drama on a show that mostly consisted of plotless scenes and beautiful shots of Sunset Boulevard. Speidi come across as manipulative villains, while Lauren seems genuine. But during her promotional tour, Lauren went on Regis and Kelly to discuss the ""big split."" The feud was the best thing to happen to The Hills: The episode premiered to a record-setting 3.6 million viewers. Speidi later admitted to ""producing"" drama behind the scenes to boost ratings. There's a reason Spencer and Heidi have become the media's go-to experts on reality TV.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,963

BIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK  The excitement is in the air, as Meghan's family and friends are starting to make their way to London. Just in time for Mother's Day, Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, arrived in England earlier this week.  A source told ET on Thursday that Meghan has ""normal last-minute nerves"" ahead of her nuptials, but is happy to have her mother by her side in the days before she says ""I do."" According to our source, this is the first time Doria will see Meghan's dress, as Meghan just had her final fittings a week and a half ago. The Los Angeles native's father, Thomas Markle, is also expected to arrive by the weekend.  ""Doria will be here to help Meghan relax in the last days before she becomes a [royal],"" the source said, adding that one of Meghan's closest pals, Jessica Mulroney, will arrive next week to ""help Meghan out with last-minute touches ahead of her big day.""  WEDDING COUNTDOWN  So, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be tying the knot in:  Getty Images  ROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP  The rumor mill this week has Queen Elizabeth sneaking a peek at Meghan's wedding dress. The bride's gown is said to be hidden away in Windsor and will show it to the queen this week or possibly the next, according to US Weekly.  Another story circulating the web is that Meghan's gown -- rumored to be a custom Ralph & Russo Couture creation -- will cost approximately $135,600.  ""Meghan‚Äôs dress is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,"" royal expert Melanie Bromley told Harper's Bazaar. ""It's going to be featured in the history books, so needs to stand the test of time.‚Äù  The price may seem quite high, though that doesn't compare to Kate Middleton's custom Alexander McQueen design that cost around $400,000. ""But that eye-watering price was befitting for a future queen, so it‚Äôs unlikely Meghan‚Äôs will be as expensive because it could be seen by some as being disrespectful,‚Äù Bromley added.  ET‚Äôs royal expert Katie Nicholl had echoed those sentiments back in March, saying, ""I think it's very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that and in doing so try and upstage a future queen.""  OUT AND ABOUT  Although we didn't get a real sighting from Meghan and Prince Harry this week (they're kinda busy, ya know, preparing for a royal wedding!), fans freaked out via social media when Madame Tussauds unveiled two wax figures of the bride-to-be on Wednesday.

A source tells ET that Kim and Kanye were in the delivery room when their surrogate gave birth to their baby girl at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The couple was joined by Kris Jenner and Kim's sisters at the hospital, however, the family was not in the delivery room.  ""We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.

Baby No. 3 joins older siblings, 4-year-old North and 2-year-old Saint. Kim and Kanye opted for a surrogate to have their third child, after Kim's first two notoriously difficult pregnancies.  ""They are fully prepared and can't wait to bring their baby home,"" a source told ET earlier this week. The name of their baby has not yet been revealed.

Though both the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and the 40-year-old rapper were in the delivery room, the birth of the baby was not filmed for their E! reality show. In fact, the surrogate's privacy has been extremely important to the husband-and-wife duo, a source told ET back in September.  ""This was always the plan. After the complications with the other pregnancies, they knew they wanted to go the surrogacy route for the next baby,"" the source added.  Last fall, Kim admitted to ET that the surrogate experience has been ""really different.""  ""Anyone that says or thinks it is just the easy way out is just completely wrong,"" the KUWTK star said. ""I think it is so much harder to go through it this way, because you are not really in control. And, you know, obviously you pick someone that you completely trust and that you have a good bond and relationship with, but... knowing that I was able to carry my first two babies and not my baby now, it's hard for me.

Dubbed ‚Äúthrone idle‚Äù in the British press after skipping a Commonwealth Day service earlier this week in order to go skiing with friends, the 34-year-old royal is also understood to be in the dog house with his wife.  Kate is said by Royal Watch sources to be understandably ‚Äúless than pleased‚Äù that her husband has been filmed partying with his friends and an unidentified woman. The new footage, which emerged Wednesday in several tabloids, shows Prince William singing and dancing with friends during a boys-only skiing trip. Shot at the popular Farinet nightclub in Verbier, the video also shows the prince putting his hand on the waist of a mystery woman  William was also filmed ‚Äúdad dancing‚Äù at the club and enjoying himself on the slopes just hours before senior royals including the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince Harry attended Westminster Abbey for a Commonwealth Day service. The Queen considers the date one of the most important in the royal calendar and William‚Äôs decision not to attend was seen as significant and controversial. While the Duchess of Cambridge stayed at home with Prince George and Princess Charlotte, William, who is now back in the U.K, chose to have fun on the slopes instead of attending the service.  VIDEO: 12 Facts About Kate Middleton  ‚ÄúIt was William‚Äôs choice to go away, but make no mistake Kate wears the trousers in their marriage, and she won‚Äôt be happy with William‚Äôs antics. She thought his partying days and larking around with the boys was a thing of the past. I imagine she‚Äôll find this humiliating and William will have come in for a pasting,‚Äù says a source.  The couple will put on a united front when they travel to Paris for a state visit on Friday, but the ski trip has once again put the spotlight on William who has so far carried out just 13 days of royal engagements this year. The Queen, who has been in poor health, has clocked up 24 days of official duties.  Last February, the Cambridges posed on the slopes of Courchevel where they enjoyed their first family ski holiday with George and Charlotte. This year, in contrast, William opted to hit the slopes solo with a group of male friends who included Guy Pelly, James Meade, and Tom Van Straubenzee.  According to The Sun newspaper, Wills and his pals spent Sunday night dancing to the band Hussy and looked ‚Äúvery worse for wear‚Äù after downing ‚Äúseveral drinks.‚Äù William, who is stepping down from his job as an air-ambulance pilot later this year, does have a history for having fun when he‚Äôs out with the boys. At Tom van Straubenzee‚Äôs wedding four years ago‚Äîwhich Kate had to miss because she was pregnant with Prince George‚ÄîWilliam reportedly ended up losing part of his front tooth after he was knocked in the face accidentally by his friend Tom Inskip during a marathon drinking session.  According to sources on the slopes, the champagne‚Äîand spirits‚Äîwere flowing in Verbier last weekend. Wills and his friends were photographed enjoying a liquid lunch with 24-year-old Australian model Sophie Taylor who works at the Farinet nightclub and a 30-year-old British former beautician from Blackpool named Rosie Peate who they met during the vacation. The group drank British beer, wine, and Jagerbombs and seemed to be in high spirits, with the prince high-fiving Sophie Taylor at one point during the lunch. Later William and his friends met up with the girls at another posh bar where the drinking continued.  Kate, who‚Äôs not a big drinker, is apparently not the only wife said to be annoyed.

The Zero Dark Thirty actress is in talks to join the sequel to Stephen King‚Äôs It, playing the adult version of the flame-haired character who inspired that secret admirer‚Äôs poem, EW has confirmed.  Ever since New Line announced that King‚Äôs epic 1986 novel would be split into two parts, it has been obvious to most people, including director Andy Muschietti, that Chastain would be perfect to play the grown-up Bev, who returns to the town of Derry with her fellow Losers nearly 27 years later to face the evil, shapeless presence they defeated as children.  Chastain previously worked with Muschietti on the 2013 horror film Mama, and during post-production on It, the filmmaker told EW he hoped to recruit her to the Losers‚Äô Club if the sequel became a reality. Now that It stands as the highest grossing horror film of all time, with $700 million in earnings worldwide, things are pretty real.  Variety first reported that Chastain is in talks for the film, which is scheduled for release in September 2019. Bill Skarsg√•rd is also set to return as the malevolent clown ‚Äî one of It‚Äôs favorite forms.  Sophia Lillis played the young Bev Marsh in the original, and she would also return for the sequel, performing new scenes as the character in flashback.  Those who know King‚Äôs book are aware that although Beverly survived her first encounter with Pennywise, and her abusive father, she carries with her deep, invisible wounds that have led her to another toxic relationship.  All of the Losers will have traumas that linger from their youth in Derry, and the resurrection of Pennywise serves as the catalyst for dealing with the more mundane monsters who plague them in adulthood.

However, a new report from OK Magazine claimed that the diva no longer feels connected to her spouse and is ready to move on with her life.  A so-called pal said for many years the legendary singer and songwriter stayed with McGraw because she did not want to break her family.  The publication went on to reveal that Hill has grown tired of McGraw‚Äôs love for the ladies.  Speculations on Hill and McGraw‚Äôs marriage have been going around for years, and they rarely dispel them.  Instead, during interviews to promote their albums and tours they talk about how strong their love is.  Last year, they sat down with ET‚Äòs Keltie Knight and talked anniversary gifts.

FXX announced that Stephen Falk's relationship comedy, You're the Worst, will be granted a fifth and final season to air in 2018. The announcement came November 15 - the same day as You're the Worst season 4's finale  FX co-President of Original programming Nick Grad said in a statement:  ‚ÄúStephen Falk has been an extraordinary creative partner to work with over the past four years, and it is in that spirit that we came to the mutual decision to end You‚Äôre the Worst with its fifth season. Stephen‚Äôs singular vision for the series has been its guiding force from the start and our decision, while difficult, will allow the series to end on its own terms and in a way most satisfying to its devoted fans. We want to thank Stephen, the cast and the crew for everything they‚Äôve done to make You‚Äôre the Worst one of the best comedies on TV.‚Äù  It may be a bit early to eulogoize You're the Worst (seasons tend to run in the Fall so we're about a year away from the series finale in all likelihood) but while we have the time, Gad is right: this was one of the better comedies on TV. What initially seemed to be a comedy about shitty people falling into something approximating love, You're the Worst evolved into a sophisticated exploration of mental illness, self-destruction, and general human imperfection.  Chris Geere and Aya Cash excelled as star-crossed lovers Jimmy and Gretchen and Desmin Borges, Kether Donohue, and Janet Varney round out the cast as Angelenos all damaged in their own way.  ‚ÄúMaking You‚Äôre The Worst has been an incredible experience and FX Networks have been dream partners,‚Äù creator Stephen Falk said. ‚ÄúI am thankful to have the opportunity to be thoroughly judged whether or not we ‚Äòstick the landing‚Äô -- which is a thing people say now that stupid Breaking Bad had to end so damn perfectly.‚Äù  You know what that means.

The 20-year-old has confirmed a romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin, taking to Instagram on Monday to post a sweet tribute to her new boyfriend.  Alongside an image of the couple sharing a tender embrace, Simone, who trains at the same gym as Stacey in Texas, posted the caption: 'Always smiling with you.'  Head over heels! Simon Biles has confirmed her romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin  Awwww! 'Always smiling with you,' the 20-year-old Olympian captioned a photo of the cute couple staring at each other on a balcony  And it seems Simone is not the only one ready to shout about the romance from the rooftops.  Ervin let slip the secret about their relationship a day before on his own account, after accompanying Simone to her induction into the Gymnastics Hall Of Fame.  'Words cannot express how incredibly proud I am of you, all you've accomplished and how well you carry yourself,' he wrote alongside a picture of the couple at the ceremony, smiling with their arms around each other.  'You make me feel like I am the luckiest man alive. Congratulations on your induction to the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame!'  He added: 'I can't wait to see what the future has in store.'  It is not the first time that Simone has featured on her boyfriend's account, however, and vice versa.  Earlier this month, Simone and Ervin posted pictures of themselves posing with a group of friends at a Bryson Tiller concert in Houston, Texas, with neither choosing to tag their significant other in the post, no doubt keen to keep their relationship under wraps for a little longer.  Young love: Earlier this month, both Simone and her Stacey (center) posted images of themselves at a Bryson Tiller concert with a group of friends  Secret: Neither Simone or Stacey chose to tag their significant other in the image, which were taken in Houston, Texas, no doubt keen to maintain some privacy around their relationship  Five-time Olympic medalist Simone opened up about her love life in an interview with ET earlier this year, admitting she had 'never had a boyfriend in [her] life'.  'At 20 years old I feel like you should have gone through those things and gone on dates,' she said. 'I have been on like, maybe one proper date.'  Simone, who earned four gold medals and one bronze at the Rio Olympics last summer, previously did not have much time to devote to dating due to her rigorous training schedule, which keeps her busy six days a week.  But her budding romance wasn't the only exciting element of the weekend for Simone, who was reunited with her fellow Final Five members of the 2016 Olympics team, both at the Hall of Fame ceremony and the P&G Championships in Anaheim, California.  Simone shared some pics with her former team members at the induction, posing alongside Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez and Aly Raisman.  Olympians: Simone also shared some pics with her fellow Final Five members at the induction, Aly Raisman (left), Laurie Hernandez (center left), and Madison Kocian (center right)  Flying high: Simone let slip over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, suggesting that she may have her sights set on a spot in the 2020 Olympic team  Winner: Stacey attended the University of Michigan, where he competed as a member of the men's artistic gymnastics team  The fifth member of the team, Gabby Douglas, did not attend the ceremony, having already been inducted into the Hall of Fame after competing in the 2012 Olympics, where she won the all-around gold medal which Simone clinched four years later.  However Gabby and the rest of the Final Five were reunited at the national gymnastics championships over the weekend, where they supported and cheered on the next generation of gymnasts.  Having taken a break from gymnastics for the past year - during which time she competed on Dancing With the Stars - Simone revealed over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, sparking speculation that she is training for a spot on the 2020 Olympic team.  Competition will be even fiercer for the next wave of Olympic hopefuls however; it was revealed during the 2016 Games that the team numbers would be reduced from five to four, meaning there is one less spot available on the squad.  Simone, who is arguably the most successful individual US female gymnast in the program's history, will no doubt be hoping to repeat the success of her teammates Gabby and Aly, who successful returned to their second Olympics in 2016, having already won gold in London in 2012.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,910

Cheek stain doubles as lip pigment, and brown eyeshadow helps fill in our brows. But, there's one tube in our makeup bags that could do so much more: concealer.  What we normally slather onto zits and undereye circles has many other applications. We tapped makeup artist Tina Turnbow to show us five techniques that turn our old cover-up into a highlighter, brow accent, lip definer, and more.  Ahead, find her step-by-step instructions for using concealer to get a gorgeous face. Don't you just love a good multitasker?  Hello, Highlighter  If you haven't plunked down the cash for a contour kit with a shadow powder and highlighter, your concealer could sub in a pinch. ""Make sure you're using one that's about two shades lighter than your skin tone,"" Turnbow says.    Start with your contour powder. Find your cheekbones, and slide the pigment just below them in a downward motion. ""It should end a couple of inches away from the corner of your mouth,"" Turnbow says.  Product used: Kevyn Aucoin The Sculpting Powder ($44; sephora.com)    Next, apply your concealer. ""It should create a halo effect around your eyes,"" Turnbow says. Use your fingers to pat it on along the tops of your cheekbones. Then, bring it up until it reaches just above the tip of your eyebrows. ""Look for a concealer with a radiant aspect to it,"" she says. ""This will help attract the light.""  Product used: NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, ($29; nars.com)    For your nose contour, use the same shadow you swept under your cheekbones. Focus it along the two edges of the bone. ""Start right under the ends of your brows, and bring it down to the tips,"" Turnbow says.    Your concealer should sit in the center of your nose. Swipe it in a downward motion, to the tip. Then, blend your three lines together. ""When you blend, make sure you're still able to see the product,"" Turnbow says. ""People tend to over-blend and erase the work they just did. Instead, just blur the edges so that they're less noticeable, but still there.""    The result is bright, beautiful, and so easy to do. It's contouring that works in real life‚Äînot the crazy sculpting you see on the red carpet all the time.

The music artist and designer has been quietly looking to expand his portfolio into food service, according to a new report that says West has been eying storefronts for a restaurant in his wife Kim Kardashian's native neighborhood, Calabasas.  ‚ÄúKanye‚Äôs shopping for the ideal premises to create a flagship restaurant in Calabasas,‚Äù a source told Radar . While the menu seemingly will not offer patrons the chance to demand their own croissants, it will be more ""comfort food-oriented."" ‚ÄúHe has this vision of creating high-end comfort food just like his mom used to make,"" the source added, ""but with a price tag that‚Äôs as eye-watering as it is mouth-watering, of course.‚Äù Of course.  West could always pad the menu with recipes from his wife, as she's shared her love of cooking on social media, showing off her own fried chicken, cornbread, mac and cheese, sweet potatoes, and collard greens as part of her #SoulFoodSundays. While Kardashian received some backlash after first sharing photos from her meal back in July of 2016, she later posted testimonials from people she's cooked for like Kevin Hart, who told her ""You did that!,"" and actor and TV host Terrence J, who said, ""You made me a believer."" ‚ÄúYou guys don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôve been making this food since high school, so when I started this post all of my high school friends were DM‚Äôing me saying, ‚ÄòBlast from the past!,'‚Äù Kardashian explained earlier this year.  Whatever does end up on the menu, it would be shocking if it didn't include ice cream , which is one of the few things guaranteed to make West smile. Another thing that would likely delight West is being able to design custom uniforms for his restaurant staff.  While the idea of a Kardashian-approved restaurant in Calabasas seems too impossible to fail, West would be taking a risk in venturing into the food and service industry. Few celebrities have actually thrived in that space, as just today brought the closure of Jessica Biel's West Hollywood restaurant Au Fudge. Then again, he's managed to crossover into fashion on his own terms and breaking into the food industry may be no different ‚Äî so long as he can sell comfort food like Yeezys.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,481

2873665a-225d-4013-9029-ca3047b69580,"Christmas is a time for goodwill, seasonal cheer, and forgiveness, so it seems fitting that the royal family is set to move past some recent rumors to once again celebrate Christmas en masse at the royal estate of Sandringham.  Despite talk of sibling rivalry, tearful duchesses, and diva-like behavior in the court of Kensington Palace, William and Kate Middleton and Harry and Meghan Markle will be together on Christmas Day, the Palace has confirmed. The news comes just after Kensington Palace attempted to snuff out reports of difficulty between the duchesses with a terse comment to The Sun over the weekend.  Although it is William and Kate‚Äôs turn to visit the Middletons this year (they usually alternate Christmas between their two families and spent Christmas with the Queen last year), royal sources say that they have decided to join the royal family for Christmas Day.  It is believed they will then head to Bucklebury, Kate‚Äôs parents‚Äô hometown, to enjoy a second Christmas with her family.  Kate‚Äôs mother, Carole Middleton, revealed in her first-ever interview, published in The Daily Telegraph over the weekend, that she has prepared an extra-special Christmas this year to welcome the two newest family members, her grandsons Prince Louis and Arthur, son of Pippa Middleton.  There will be no fewer than 12 Christmas trees at Bucklebury Manor, the Middleton family‚Äôs home, with one just for Prince George to decorate, but the Cambridges will have to skip the Middletons‚Äô traditional smoked salmon and Champagne brunch on Christmas morning because they will be with the Queen and the rest of the royal family at church in Norfolk. It will be the first time the Cambridges and the Sussexes, a.k.a the ‚ÄúFab Four,‚Äù will have been pictured together since reports of a simmering feud rocked the Palace.  It was reported this weekend that courtiers have launched a ‚Äúmole hunt‚Äù to try to uncover who has been leaking stories of tensions between Harry and William and Kate and Meghan. Reports of discord between the couples emerged after Kensington Palace announced last weekend that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would be moving out of Kensington Palace in the new year and into Frogmore House in Windsor.  Since then it has been claimed that Kate and Meghan don‚Äôt get along and that the brothers have fallen out because William voiced concerns about how quickly Harry‚Äôs relationship with Meghan was moving.  The Queen, who dislikes any rumors of discord regarding her family, will no doubt be relieved that the family will be coming together on Christmas Day. After the family celebrates with a turkey dinner on Christmas Eve, the sight of the foursome at church on Christmas morning will, courtiers hope, put an end to the unhappy narrative that the couples have fallen out.

efd6a1ec-6006-45e7-924e-1aaadf9dd37a,"Have you been hearing a lot about facial mists, setting sprays, and primer sprays lately and wondering what all the hype is about? Many women swear by spritzing their face with these types of products for a variety of reasons. Depending on which one you use, a facial mist, setting spray, or primer spray can help to perk up tired-looking skin, set your makeup, prep your skin for face makeup, or provide an additional boost of hydration‚Äîwhich can be particularly helpful if you have dry skin. But generally, all skin types can reap the benefits of a facial mist or setting spray. Ready to add one to your beauty routine? Keep reading to find out more about what they can do!  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACE SPRAYS AND MISTS?  Wondering what exactly the difference is between all of the types of face sprays we‚Äôve mentioned already? Facial mists are generally designed to help provide skin with a little boost of hydration, giving you an instantly refreshed feeling. Toss one in your purse or leave one at your desk‚Äîrefreshing facial mists are about to become your skin‚Äôs new BFF! Setting sprays are typically used to help makeup last longer and pull your look together. Sick of your makeup always sliding off halfway through the day? It‚Äôs time to invest in a setting spray! Primer sprays are similar in that they can extend the life of your makeup, but they‚Äôre meant to be used in place of a regular old makeup primer. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to speed up your routine, a primer spray could be the way to go!  Now you have an idea of what each type of spray does, but if you aren‚Äôt sure which deserves a spot in your routine, keep reading! We‚Äôre breaking down when to reach for each one, plus, how to use them.  ADD A FACIAL MIST TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF‚Ä¶  A facial mist is the perfect addition to your daily routine when you need a midday pick-me-up! In movies, you often see people splashing water on their faces to help jolt them awake. But that doesn‚Äôt sound too enjoyable, now does it? Instead, reach for a mist with a refreshing formula and spritz it on anytime you need a wakeup call throughout the day.  Even if you‚Äôre feeling totally fresh-faced and well-rested, a facial mist can also come in handy when your skin is feeling a little dry. A quick misting can give dry skin the extra boost it needs. This is particularly helpful during those cold, winter months when skin tends to get dull.  HOW TO USE A FACIAL MIST  We promise: It‚Äôs so easy! Just spray your facial mist onto clean skin morning and night before applying moisturizer and as needed during the day (typically, facial mists shouldn‚Äôt interfere with your makeup). That‚Äôs it!  ADD A SETTING SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF‚Ä¶  When you want to rock a ‚Äújust applied‚Äù makeup look all day and night, a setting spray is the way to go! When your contour and your smoky eye are on point, we understand that you‚Äôll try just about anything to maintain your look from desk to drinks. Instead of constantly reapplying or worrying about any makeup faux pas, make locking in your look with a setting spray as the last step in your makeup routine. A setting spray will increase your makeup‚Äôs lifespan‚Äîwhich means you can dance the night away without the fear of sweating your foundation off.  A setting spray can also come through in the clutch if you have oily skin. If you do have oily skin, chances are you‚Äôre layering on powder makeup to help your makeup stay put throughout the day. A setting spray can help soften the look of all the products you‚Äôve previously applied‚Äîgiving you the seamless look you‚Äôre after! Trust us, if you love powder makeup and layering your look, be sure to complete your beauty routine with a spritz of setting spray.  HOW TO USE A SETTING SPRAY  Once you‚Äôre done applying all of your makeup‚Äîfoundation, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, you name it‚Äîlightly mist your face with a setting spray to help lock everything in place. You can also use one midday to help refresh your makeup and keep your look lasting even longer.  ADD A PRIMER SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF‚Ä¶  Primer sprays are another type of facial spray worthy of adding to your beauty regimen‚Äîand they‚Äôve been getting more attention as of late. A primer spray is ideal for those with oily skin. It preps your skin for your makeup application, allowing it to last longer and go on smoother! It‚Äôs also a must if you have a big occasion coming up (cough, cough‚Äîthe holidays) where your makeup fading throughout the night is simply not an option.  HOW TO USE A PRIMER SPRAY  Using a primer spray is as easy as saying your ABC‚Äôs and counting to 1, 2, 3! Simply spritz it onto bare skin before applying your makeup‚Äîafter going through your full skin care routine‚Äîand you‚Äôre good to go!

The show, which currently has no title, is being written by Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage.  The Michael Jackson Estate and Columbia Live Stage company announced the news on Tuesday, but didn't say which theatre the show will play in.  The musical will encompass many of Jackson's greatest hits, including Thriller, Beat It and Smooth Criminal.  Christopher Wheeldon will direct and choreograph the show, which is likely to contain some of the recognisable dances moves from Jackson's music videos and tours.  Wheeldon won a Tony Award for best choreography in 2015 for his work on An American in Paris.  It is not known what role the Michael Jackson estate has in creating the show and whether the more controversial talking points from the star's life, such as his 2005 trial and acquittal over claims of sexual abuse, will be featured in the dramatisation.  This won't be the first time that Jackson's music has been featured in a stage production - Thriller Live opened in London's West End in January 2009.

eb528336-0acf-406b-bc0d-5305318faf78,"When you get the chance to make a Star Wars film and have been a fan of the saga your whole life, it's hard to pass up an opportunity to appear on screen . The Last Jedi writer/director Rian Johnson might not have appeared in his film in an immediately recognizable capacity, but confirmed on the film's commentary track that he grasps Han Solo's golden dice from the cockpit of the Millennium Falcon in a close-up shot.  After clashing with Rey on Ahch-To, Luke Skywalker boards the Falcon in an emotional scene, reflecting on his former ally Han Solo having been killed by Kylo Ren. Upon discovering the dice, Luke takes them from where they hung on the ship and pockets them, ultimately handing them over to his sister Leia in the film's final act.  Actor Mark Hamill filmed a majority of this scene, yet Johnson couldn't help but take advantage of the opportunity to lend his own talents to the film by sporting a glove to clutch the dice in the quick shot.  This is Johnson's second appearance in the Star Wars saga, as he was also a Death Star gunner in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The filmmaker returned the favor to Rogue One director Gareth Edwards, who made an appearance as a Resistance trooper during the battle of Crait .  Johnson managed to sneak in quite a few cameos in The Last Jedi, with some being more obvious than others. Actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Noah Segan, who have appeared in all of Johnson's films, both made brief appearances, with Gordon-Levitt lending just his voice to an alien character while Segan played a Resistance pilot.  Tom Hardy, Take That singer Gary Barlow, and Princes Harry and William all shared a scene together where they played Stormtroopers, yet the scene was reportedly absent from the final cut.  Star Wars fans may have recognized saga staple Warwick Davis' voice during the Canto Bight scene, as the actor voiced one of the aliens in the casino. Even Mark Hamill earned an additional role, providing the vocalizations for the alien who attempts to put coins in BB-8.  You can get The Last Jedi on Digital HD now and on Blu-ray March 27th.

5ec603da-ec01-43e8-b6c0-766dc3cbce8f,"Shakira Kicks Off Momentous U.S. Tour in Chicago After 7-Year Wait: 'I've Been Dreaming About This Moment'  Shakira kicks off the North American leg of Her El Dorado World Tour at United Center on Aug. 3, 2018 in Chicago.  Shakira fans waited long enough to see the Colombian superstar touring and back onstage in the United States -- seven years to be exact. And for some fans, like Joel and Karen, it was the first time they got to see Shakira live.  ‚ÄúWe drove eight hours from Minnesota just to see her,‚Äù said the couple. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been waiting since the '90s to see Shakira. I want to sing the oldies with her."" ""I‚Äôve been practicing in my shower for the last 20 years,‚Äù added Karen.  After a successful run in Europe earlier this summer, Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado Tour at the United Center in Chicago on Friday (Aug. 3). The tour was rescheduled from January after the singer/songwriter had to postpone her international trek due to strained vocal chords.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so good to see you,‚Äù Shakira said after singing her first couple of songs, including ‚ÄúEstoy Aqu√≠,‚Äù ‚ÄúShe Wolf‚Äù and ‚ÄúSi Te Vas.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been way too long,"" she continued. ""I‚Äôve been dreaming about this moment. There were times when all of this seemed impossible, but miracles do exist. You made this happen! Thank you for all your support, especially in these last few months.""  Not only did Shakira sing her heart out -- in English and Spanish -- for nearly two hours and delivered classics like ‚ÄúInevitable,‚Äù ‚ÄúT√∫‚Äù and ‚ÄúAntolog√≠a‚Äù and her most recent hits such as ‚ÄúMe Enamor√©‚Äù and ‚ÄúChantaje,‚Äù she also danced all night long. Even as mother of two, those hips still don‚Äôt lie.  Working the stage from left to right and walking along a runway that stretched to the center of the venue, the hypnotizing and infectious hip moves came when the chart-topping artist sang tracks like ‚ÄúPerro Fiel,‚Äù ‚ÄúDare (La La La),‚Äù ‚ÄúWaka Waka‚Äù and ‚ÄúLoca.‚Äù  Of course, the sexy, upbeat tracks called for a change in wardrobe and for those, Shakira appeared onstage with her staple belly dancing wraps covered with beads and coins that really accentuated her hip-swiveling moves.  Two special guests spotted in the crowd were Shakira‚Äôs sons: Milan and Sasha. The two almost stole the show when they were ushered to their front row seats where they would see their mam√° in all her glory. From the stage and throughout the show, she blew kisses their way.  Another fan favorite moment was when Shakira appeared on the other side of the venue wearing a long, gold dress to sing ‚ÄúToneladas‚Äù and right after, made her way back to the main stage walking in the middle of the crowd and stopping to snap a few selfies and greet fans who threw themselves at her as she passed by.  The grand finale was a succession of hits, including ‚ÄúRabiosa,‚Äù ‚ÄúHips Don‚Äôt Lie,‚Äù ‚ÄúLa Tortura‚Äù and ‚ÄúLa Bicicleta.‚Äù It reminded us of how vast Shakira's catalog is, and how enduring the hits are, even after a seven-year wait.  ‚ÄúFirst night in the U.S., incredible,‚Äù she wrote on social media immediately after the concert. ‚ÄúThank you, Chicago.‚Äù",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,671
05a1d070-fb8a-42f4-81a0-5e20f77c5942,"Despite the whoring and arguably gratuitous nudity in ‚ÄòBook of the Stranger‚Äô, this week‚Äôs episode was refreshingly positive for female characters, and ranks alongside ‚ÄòHome‚Äô in quality and story progression.  It makes sense to begin at the beginning: specifically the long awaited Sansa-John reunion. A sensible decision by the writers to forego yet another ‚Äòmissed them by that much‚Äô moment helped spark life into the plot of the North, and saved this particular sub-plot from becoming any more farcical. It was a warm moment ‚Äì it felt almost inevitable that somebody‚Äôs head or genitalia would roll across the screen at some point. Thankfully not.  Apparently Jon‚Äôs been listening to Elliott Smith songs on repeat since his resurrection and thinking about the human condition, as the hurting hero seemed averse to any further violence, even to save his own family. Enter Sansa. Who knows what should be credited for the maturation of the Stark girl ‚Äì there are plenty of qualifying tragedies in her arc ‚Äì but she was on impressive form. Her stern persuasiveness ensured that viewers will eventually get to see ‚ÄòBastardbowl‚Äô ‚Äì the internet‚Äôs preferred nomenclature for any battle between Snow and Bolton. Unfortunately, given her new found confidence, it would be unsurprising to see Sansa finally meet her maker(s) this season. For now, though, her transformation is welcome.  Not to be overshadowed, Brienne shone at Castle Black, too. Melisandre and Ser Davos played no real part in the episode, besides being in receipt of Brienne‚Äôs barbs regarding her execution of Stannis. There was overt sexual tension between herself and Tormund, too, in a quasi-fetish dinner scene.  The next stop for ‚ÄòBook of the Stranger‚Äô was somewhere in the proximity of the Vale. Little Finger‚Äôs falcon will hopefully peck out the eyes of the endlessly irritating young lord, Robin. Flippancy aside, the decision to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô Sansa and Jon in their battle versus Ramsay revealed little in terms of motive, other than that Baelish must see success in the future of House Stark.  On to Meereen, where Tyrion appeared to badly misrepresent his new queen. Making peace with the masters of Slaver‚Äôs Bay may have been diplomatic, but is unlikely to endear himself to Danaerys, and received dreadful feedback from Grey Worm and Missandei.  Jorah was frankly pathetic in this episode as his greyscale caught up with him, and the unbearably smug Daario played bodyguard for his love rival as a result. Having traveled so far, it nicely summarised the episode that, rather than being slung over their shoulders, Danaerys chose self-determination and relegated the two noble soldiers to doormen.  In much the same way as Sansa, Margaery was the stronger sibling in King‚Äôs Landing. Not to fall prey to the silver tongue of the High Sparrow, she instead attempts to manipulate him, reciting verses from The Seven-Pointed Star. Sent, she believes, to break her brother, she instead encourages him to stay strong. Sadly, these attempts may have been in vain; indeed, it looks to have been the High Sparrow‚Äôs intention for her instead to be broken by her brother, sucked in by his weakness.  With Tommen being manipulated every which way by everybody and their dog in King‚Äôs Landing, Lady Tyrell‚Äôs decision to introduce her army to the fray was encouraging. With her actions and Cersei‚Äôs we saw yet more decisiveness on the part of the show‚Äôs female characters.  A short visit to the Iron Islands saw Theon returning to his sister (who he previously unceremoniously pleasured, much to her amusement). After a frosty introduction, where Yara told her brother stop being such a wimp, Theon lent his support to her claim to the throne.  Back across the sea, Ramsay sat in Winterfell, badly peeling an apple. Enter Osha, who tried to seduce and assassinate him, only to find her own neck irrigating the cobbled ground. This was an anti-climax in her arc, as her lengthy disappearance quickly became non-existence. Nevertheless, it was a typically belligerent death for the Wildling, as she displayed her loyalty for one last time. In other news, Ramsay sent a threatening letter to Jon Snow which read like an homage to a cyber bully.  The resurgence of the Khaleesi which brought about the end of the episode was a relief, in as much as it injected life into her story line (ironically through a lot of death). It has been described as cathartic and climactic, but it did not really deserve such high praise. While the scene itself played well, there had been so little substance in the build-up that it felt sudden, as opposed to a culmination. A few unseemly rape jokes were not enough to develop this story of vengeance. Nonetheless, the event will serve as a catalyst, as Danaerys may well command the biggest army in the Seven Kingdoms. It can only be a matter of time until she travels to Westeros.  4.5/5  Dir: Jeremy Bodeswa  Scr: David Benioff, George R.R. Martin, D.B.

928a666e-eea8-41e5-ba11-2bfaa03253f6,"The eight-hour diet is the latest health craze to hit Hollywood and fitness gurus are raving about its benefits.  The programme is based on only eating within a window of eight hours per day, and fasting for the other 16 to kick the body into fat burning mode.  Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of the diet, eating breakfast at 10am and having their last meal of the day before 6pm.  Australian nutritionist, Lee Holmes, spoke to FEMAIL about the benefits of the eight-hour diet and discusses whether or not it really works.  Advertisement  ""The idea of intermittent fasting may seem foreign, impossible and even scary to some but, I've got a secret for you! It's something you do every. Single. Day,"" Lee said.  Over the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet. Photo / Getty Images  ""As soon as you drift off to sleep at night until the moment you open your eyes in the morning, you've been doing intermittent fasting. They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.""  Lee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.  ""By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,"" Lee said.  ""New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.""  Fasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.  ""But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,"" Lee said.  Acknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,463

2bc46675-ab93-46e5-a5ea-1535f671758c,"‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt change the circumstances, change your perspective.‚Äù ~Unknown  Sometimes it feels as if you are completely in control of your life, but when it comes to relationships there's always the other person.  In a relationship, you can't be the puppeteer. People have their own emotions, behaviors, actions, beliefs, scars, wounds, fears, dreams, and perspectives. They are their own person.  How often have you wanted a relationship to be something that it was not?  How many times have you said a certain word or phrase in order to spark a specific reaction?  How much do you expect from this person? Do they fail you each and every time?  In healthy relationships there are certain expectations, like being treated well or being respected. Yet sometimes we find ourselves in relationships that don‚Äôt mirror what we anticipate to happen. We may feel hurt or used.  We cannot expect other people to treat us as we would treat them. We cannot assume anything or force change upon someone who clearly demonstrates he or she is stuck in his or her own way.  With eyes full of clarity, I am capable of changing the relationships in my life by adjusting my point of view.  I call my father a sperm donor. He gave me life but never showed up in my life.  My friends at school never knew I had a father because they never saw him. He missed all of the concerts and sports games. For the majority of my life, we didn‚Äôt talk. He didn‚Äôt acknowledge me‚Äîno birthday calls. I had no idea where my dad lived. Some days I was not sure he was still alive.  In high school, my dad limped back into my life. I could stop by his apartment and visit him when I wanted to. If I called him, he would pick up the phone. Things were changing between us.  Blindingly bright, his true colors revealed themselves the night before my high school graduation when I called to make sure he was coming. He said he couldn‚Äôt attend because he had to drive a friend to the airport. Cabs exist. His friend could have used one. I was angry, sad, and most of all, hurt.  Rejection from my father has been the hardest thing for me to accept. It is not easy to grasp the idea that someone who once loved me, adored me, gave life to me could turn his back and walk away so easily.  I could no longer take the feelings of disappointment.  These feelings were a direct result of what I was expecting from him:  Assuming he would respond to things as I would.  Assuming he would care like I do.  Assuming he thinks in a similar way as I do.  I was living in a fantasyland of my hopes, dreams, ideas, beliefs, expectations, and assumptions.  I was hurting myself most.  For the protection of my emotional body, I changed my perception from what I hoped would happen to being open to experience whatever actually happens.  This shift didn‚Äôt occur immediately, but by following the five steps listed below I was able to come to peace with the type of relationship I have with my father.  1. Be aware of reality.  Acknowledge the other person‚Äôs behaviors. Look at patterns and how they regularly treat you. Remember the feelings you had in the past. Don‚Äôt be fooled into believing things are different from how they are.  2. Stop manipulating situations.  Many times we yearn for specific responses, like validation and approval. When we do not receive what we want, we may speak or behave in certain ways to try to elicit the desired reaction.  This type of behavior leaves us feeling empty when the other person does not react the way we hope they would. Remember, you cannot change anyone; it is up to them to change.  3. Let go.  Throw expectations and assumptions out the door. Release the hopes, wishes, and dreams that things will change by detaching from the ideas.  Get out of the fantasy world by not hooking into the thoughts of what could be. Keep your mind from running into the future. Remain open to all possibilities by staying in the present moment.  4. Focus on those who love you.  It will be easier to follow the third step if you remind yourself of those who are there for you. They continue to be there because they care about you. Focus on people who make you feel loved, connected, cared for, and worthy. Reach out to them and reconnect.  5. Learn to love yourself.  Provide yourself with what you are yearning for (compliments, compassion, or encouragement). Only you know what you truly need.  Realize each moment you are being the best you at that time. Build self-confidence and strive to eliminate any doubts you have about yourself. When you feel shaky or alone, look in your eyes in the mirror and say, ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù Nurture yourself. Feel the love you have inside of yourself.  Let go of your expectations of people and see how your relationships change. And if you don‚Äôt feel differently about it or if it‚Äôs not benefiting you, you can always walk away. Your emotional state matters most. You cannot control other people, but you can make yourself happy.

(Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)  Barack and Michelle Obama are one step closer to becoming empty nesters.  Former President Obama described dropping off his oldest daughter Malia, 19, on Harvard University's campus last month for her freshman year at college, admitting he shed some tears in the process.  ""For those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast,"" Obama said during a reception for the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children Monday in Delaware.  ""I dropped off Malia at college, and I was saying to Joe and Jill (Biden) that it was a little bit like open-heart surgery, and I was proud that I did not cry in front of her,"" he continued. ""But on the way back, the Secret Service was off, looking straight ahead, pretending they weren't hearing me as I sniffled and blew my nose. It was rough.""  ""And it's a reminder that at the end of our lives, whatever else we've accomplished, the thing that we'll remember are the joys that our children, and hopefully way later, our grandchildren bring.""  Malia was spotted on the Cambridge, Mass., campus in August moving in for her first year at the Ivy League school after spending a gap year traveling and interning at the Weinstein film company.

4fe4d8b3-79b7-401c-b672-48ce40c6d025,"In the history of Hollywood, certain co-stars stand out as the most dynamic duos whose chemistry jumps out from the screen. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, and the more recent partnership of Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The last pair has starred together in three films, Crazy Stupid Love, Gangster Squad, and La La Land. Moviegoers can't get enough of the somewhat offbeat pair, and Emma Stone's recent comments on Ryan Gosling prove that the co-stars can't get enough of each other, either.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Stone spoke about Gosling at Colorado's Telluride Film Festival during a Q&A on Sept. 1. ""I can‚Äôt even imagine what my life would be without Ryan,"" Stone said. The Battle of the Sexes star went on, saying, ""He‚Äôs so special. It makes me emotional. He‚Äôs so talented but he‚Äôs such a great person to work with because he‚Äôs so collaborative and excited about the process. He‚Äôs taught me a lot about being really generous."" Stone continued to tell the audience about her ""dear, wonderful friend"" after an audience member asked about why the La La Land co-stars have so much chemistry. She said, ""The moment he walked into the audition of Crazy, Stupid, Love, we had an unspoken understanding of each other.""  It probably won't come as a surprise to hear that fans have long-been obsessing over the duo who first stole everyone's hearts in Crazy Stupid Love. That movie included the unforgettable scene where Emma Stone's character freaked out over Ryan Gosling's glistening six-pack, and the iconic Dirty Dancing lift. With Stone's lovable awkwardness and Gosling's humble charm, it's no wonder that everyone wants to see the duo star in a fourth ‚Äî and fifth, and sixth ‚Äî movie together ASAP.  Some fans even feel that the couple's lack of co-starring role from the year might ruin awards season. Twitter user @dailyemmastone wrote, ""Yeah heartbreak is horrible, but have you ever imagine an award season with emma stone and ryan gosling doing it separately... well it's about to happen."" At least you can take heart in the fact that Stone and Gosling likely will at least see each other on some red carpets, since Gosling's starring role in the upcoming movie First Man is already drumming up Oscar buzz as is Stone's role in the upcoming release, The Favourite.  Even though Stone and Gosling didn't star together in a new movie in time for the 2018 awards season, the duo very well could end up teaming up together in the future. After all, Gosling's admiration for Stone has long inspired fans to ship the onscreen pair. In 2011, Gosling told MTV, that Stone is ""everything, all the time,"" and then he revealed that Stone's casting in Crazy Stupid Love got him excited for his role. ""There's no one like her. As soon as she signed on for this movie, I knew it was going to be good,"" he added.  Not only did Stone and Gosling make an impression on viewers in their first movie together, but they also left their co-star Steve Carell wanting more. According to E! News, Carrell spoke about Stone and Gosling at the 2017 at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Office star said, ""I hope the three of us get to work again together. They are, incidentally, two of the nicest people ever."" At least Carrell got to reunite with Stone in 2017 with Battle of the Sexes, but fans still want to see Gosling reunite with Stone on the big screen at least one more time.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,725

And then for a brief window on Thursday evening, 330 million Twitter users slid into a world without @realDonaldTrump.  President Donald Trump‚Äôs Twitter account ‚Äî from which he aggressively confronts those who displease him, suggests North Korea ‚Äúmay not be around much longer!‚Äù and promotes Trump Tower taco bowls ‚Äî disappeared.  Twitter initially posted a statement Thursday night saying Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúaccount was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee.‚Äù  Earlier today @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee.

The company‚Äôs tweet: Earlier today @realdonaldtrump‚Äôs account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee. The account was down for 11 minutes, and has since been restored. We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again.  Trump has used the account since March 2009. He has tweeted more than 36,000 times and has 41.7 million followers.  Trump has spoken publicly about his reliance on Twitter before. In an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network last month, Trump credited his use of social media as among the reasons he was elected.  ‚ÄúYou have to keep people interested also,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou know, you have to keep people interested.‚Äù  Twitter also serves as among Trump‚Äôs main tools for deflecting criticisms and attacks. In the same interview, Trump said that ‚ÄúWhen somebody says something about me, I am able to go bing, bing, bing and I take care of it.‚Äù  Trump conceded that those close to him try to steer him away from social media. But he insists on tweeting ‚Äî spelling errors included ‚Äî as a weapon against ‚Äúfake news.‚Äù  Trump‚Äôs account may have been ‚Äúinadvertently‚Äù deactivated Thursday, but Twitter has also had to defend its decision not to take down particular presidential tweets.  In a six-tweet thread in September, Trump issues what some took as a threat directed at North Korea.  ‚ÄúJust heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won‚Äôt be around much longer!‚Äù Trump wrote.  As The Post has reported, Twitter prohibits tweets that include violent threats, which some argued was Trump‚Äôs intention.  Twitter responded saying a number of factors go into account when evaluating controversial content, including its ‚Äúnewsworthiness‚Äù and whether it has ‚Äúpublic interest.‚Äù  Those tweets confronting North Korea followed other instances where critics called for Trump‚Äôs account to be more closely controlled, such as when he tweeted an edited video of himself beating somebody up, the victim‚Äôs face replaced by a CNN logo.  And then there are the accounts that Twitter has chosen to suspend. Last month, the actress Rose McGowan took to Twitter to challenge Ben Affleck on his claim that he knew nothing of Harvey Weinstein‚Äôs decades-long history of sexual assault and violence towards women.  ‚ÄúYou lie,‚Äù McGowan wrote in one tweet.  But another tweet led to the temporarily suspension of her account. Despite initially declining to comment on the content of that specific tweet, Twitter later explained that McGowan‚Äôs ‚Äúaccount was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates our Terms of Service.‚Äù  On Thursday alone, Trump used his account to congratulate the Houston Astros for winning the World Series, call on Congress to ‚ÄúTERMINATE‚Äù the diversity visa lottery and announce the nomination of Jerome Powell as the next chair of the Federal Reserve.  Trump was back tweeting at 8:05 p.m., praising the day‚Äôs ‚ÄúGreat Tax Cut rollout.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!‚Äù  It was as if he never left.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,927

cf21cb40-3ce2-4e40-b2c0-0575062bd877,"Tonight Ashley Graham will be making her 2017 Met Gala debut. It's a big moment for the model‚Äîabout time, we say!‚Äîbut it's not exactly shocking if you have been at all in tune with her meteoric rise to fashion fame . What is surprising? Graham was actually supposed to attend last year's gala. According to her, she was put on hold for the Manus x Machina‚Äìthemed party , but after no designer stepped up to dress her, the invite fell through. The tea: At the time she thought she had been uninvited because her husband had hugged Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour , who oversees the event, upon meeting her. (You can read the whole story in her upcoming memoir, A New Model . )  This time around Graham's friends at H&M ‚Äîwho have previously dressed stars like Sarah Jessica Parker and Ciara for the evening‚Äîraised their hands and made her a stunning red number (see our exclusive look at her fitting below). It was inspired by Comme des Gar√ßons designer Rei Kawakubo ‚Äî the subject of the exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, which the gala opens ‚Äîwho's known for her bold use of color and imaginative silhouettes.  ‚ÄúWe wanted to create a gown for Ashley that reflected Kawakubo‚Äôs love of a garment‚Äôs construction,"" says H&M head of design Pernilla Wohlfahrt. ""The off-white corset is subtly deconstructed, the long red skirt is held by hook-and-eye fastenings, and it is boned to echo the construction of the corset‚Äîwith ruffles of red organza that fall down the whole dress."" So as Graham hits the Met's steps in her one-of-a-kind look, we bring you the scoop on how it came to be, her secrets to red-carpet posing, and the recent wardrobe malfunction she hopes not to repeat.  Pinterest PHOTO: Courtesy of H&M  Glamour: You‚Äôre a face of H&M Studio, and you‚Äôve walked the brand's show in Paris ; so how does it feel to be wearing H&M to your first Met Gala?  Ashley Graham: It feels amazing! H&M has been such a big supporter of me from day one‚Äîand this further proves that they believe beauty comes in different aspects. And the fact that Anna [Wintour] was like, ""Hey, you can be on the cover [of Vogue ],"" and then was like, ""Hey, you can come to the Met,"" makes me [scream]. I'm Anna Wintour‚Äìapproved!  Glamour: How has this experience been different from your past red-carpet events?  AG: It‚Äôs really a team effort. I've never had so many people involved in what my hair and makeup and nails are going to look like. And I had to be careful [with the dress], because it‚Äôs a costume [event] and I want to stay within the theme, but I don‚Äôt want to look gimmicky.  Glamour: Right‚Äîas a viewer, it's disappointing when people ignore the theme. How did you and the H&M design team pay homage to Comme des Gar√ßons?  AG: Everybody has a take on what that brand feels and looks like to them‚Äî[for me], Rei Kawakubo and Comme des Gar√ßons is red, red, red. H&M took that inspiration‚Äîand all the great big shapes that you see in Kawakubo's designs‚Äîand made this dress. We needed to show shape, because I have a body type that, when covered by a bunch of [volume], looks like a big [blob] walking down the red carpet. So the exposed bustier is a good detail.  Glamour: How much of the design process were you involved in?  AG: The great thing about custom is that you can get involved in the design. I‚Äôve been a part of it from the beginning, but H&M started the process by drawing. They sent over a couple of sketches of different dresses, and I picked my favorite. We edited that a little bit from there.  Pinterest PHOTO: Courtesy of H&M  Glamour: Are there any tailoring secrets you worked into the dress? One-shoulder pieces can be really hard to wear without a bra.  AG: Well, I‚Äôm going to wear Spanx‚Äî the ones that go past the knee and onto the shin. I‚Äôm tucking it them under my [strapless] bra.  Glamour: This all sounds like a dream. But have you had any unglamorous red-carpet experiences lately?  AG: Yes. At the Time 100 Gala, actually. My stylist custom made a silk black dress for me, but I didn‚Äôt have a second fitting for it, so it didn‚Äôt fit my butt very well. We pinned it and sewed it up, so that it ruched down [the back]‚Äîbut as I got out of the car, my publicist went, 'Oh my God, Ashley, your butt!' and I looked back and all the seams had busted. So I walked into Lincoln Center with my hands over my butt. Thank God my stylist had thrown a long, black, silky jacket into the car‚Äîjust to cover my hair in the rain‚Äîand that‚Äôs why I had a jacket on the red carpet.  Glamour: Speaking of not-so-great moments, have you had any designers say no to making you custom looks?  AG: Well, I‚Äôve been dressed off the rack. It's hard [for designers to make custom at times] because some of the events I go to are last-minute. Custom takes time‚Äîno matter what size you are. But being dressed off the rack means, first of all, that someone at the event could be in the exact same outfit as you. It could also mean that it's not a garment that was tailored to your body.  Pinterest PHOTO: Courtesy of H&M  Glamour: Do you think you're different from the guests that H&M has dressed in the past? And if so, how?  AG: I know who else is at the [H&M] table [tonight], and there's another very, very curvalicious woman there. I don‚Äôt see how [we] are any different‚Äîbecause if it‚Äôs custom, size doesn't matter.  Glamour: True. So what are you most looking forward to tonight?  AG: I‚Äôm really excited to geek out on all the celebrities! I‚Äôve been texting Lena Dunham , and she‚Äôs like, ""Girl, just stick with me."" I hope Rihanna ‚Äôs there. I know Beyonc√© won't be there because she‚Äôs literally about to pop, but I would love to just be like, ""Hi."" [ Laughs. ] And I hope Andre Leon Talley interviews me when I get to the top [of the stairs]. If he doesn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm just going to look him in the eye and be like, ""Interview me!""  Glamour: And when you finally take the red carpet, what will you be channeling?  AG: Jenna Lyons gave me really good advice. She said, ""Don‚Äôt think 'sexy.' Just think about being your best you. If you‚Äôre thinking 'sexy,' you might come off too smoldering‚Äîyou‚Äôre already smoldering.""

Rumour has it that Brad Pitt, following his separation from Angelina Jolie, has his attention diverted to Jennifer Lawrence. According to gossip mongers, the Allied actor has shown interest in dating the Hunger Games star and this will definitely get Jolie worked up.  Sources told Australian tabloid Woman's Day that the actor feels Lawrence fits his criteria of a perfect girlfriend.  ""Jennifer 'ticks' all of Brad's boxes in all the right ways. She's gorgeous, the hottest name in Hollywood and seems to like older guys,"" the insider told the magazine, referring to her recent boyfriend and Mother! director Darren Aronofsky. It was recently confirmed that the director-actress couple are no longer dating each other.  Coming back to JLaw and Pitt, the grapevine claims that Pitt had reached out to director Quentin Tarantino to help him get Lawrence's phone number.

""Brad hasn't dated much since the breakdown of his marriage, so Jen is a very lucky girl to have his undivided attention.

8ea824c4-1aa4-4aa2-8170-9648a3fd028e,"Taylor Lautner and Billie Lourd have broken up. The ridiculously good-looking couple met on set of Scream Queens and yes, their characters played love interests ‚Äî who met an untimely end when Dr. Cassidy sacrificed himself to save Chanel #3 ‚Äî but still, it was all cute af.  It was only a matter of time before they look this fictional love and well, made it a real thing. Now, here we are eight months later and they're dunzo.  ""They aren't together anymore but they are still friendly. She‚Äôs really focused on her work right now,"" a source said to People.  If they're still friendly that leaves hope for a possible reconciliation, right? While we want to get our hopes up, that seems super unlikely since Billie has gone ahead and deleted every trace of her time with Tay from her Instagram. Her feed was once was flooded with adorable selfies from their many adventures but now, every trace of #couplegoals is gone. Remember that trip to the poppy fields?  Besides the fact that we all went ahead (and by we, I mean myself) and got emotionally attached to this celeb couple, this breakup goes deeper. Billie went through the worst thing anyone could ever endure: losing her mom Carrie Fisher and her grandmother Debbie Reynolds one day apart. The two women who mean the most to her both passed away, and Taylor was by her side through it all. He really stepped up to be there for her, so much so that Billie's uncle Todd Fisher recently spoke so highly of the Twilight cutie and confirmed every thought we ever had about the kind of guy Taylor actually is.  ""The truth of the matter is the guy is ‚Äì he‚Äôs pretty spectacular. He's a really deep person and he has supported her amazing,"" Todd said in an interview. ""He's stepped up and acted like a husband would act. I mean, not that that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on, but it‚Äôs just an amazing support system for her and I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs in her life.""  Taylor was legit pulling husband duty over here. Need a minute to just let that sink in.  Now, Taylor does have a habit of dating his co-stars after they play his on-screen GFs. There was Taylor Swift from Valentine's Day, then Lily Collins from Abduction, followed by Marie Avgeropoulos from Tracers before he met Billie. So it's kind of this thing to fall in love with these girls in real life and eventually these relationships fizzle out.  But it felt different for his romance with Billie. I was rooting for them. We were all rooting for them. It seemed like this was the real deal. Perhaps, just maybe, Taylor had finally found the perfect co-star to stay with him for the long haul. Whenever co-stars date IRL, there is always that sense of ""is this legit or are they just trying to get some promo?"" Sure, this has definitely happened in the past since Hollywood is a strange place filled with smoke and mirrors when you think about it, but you could literally feel the love between Taylor and Billie. Frankly, it's all rather disappointing to see this relationship has gone down in flames now too. If us mere fans are distraught over Mom and Dad going their separate ways, we can only imagine how the actual people involved are feeling.  Scream Queens has since been cancelled, so they won't even be any sort of TV reunion to possibly reignite the spark. Let's hope the next time Taylor decides to date another one of his co-stars, that relationship with a happier ending. Or better yet, maybe he should learn to just not fall in love with his co-workers and instead find a leading lady any other way.  Tbh, this is all just too much emotional investment and I don't need this second-hand heartbreak anymore. I've had a soft spot for Taylor ever since the Adventures Sharkboy and Lavagirl days, but homeboy needs to get it together when it comes to his love life, and I mean that in the best way possible. It all comes from a place of fan appreciation, so feel like I can say this and hopefully put it out there as a lesson because us fans get too attached and now here we are: wrecked and wondering if true love is even real anymore. Until he makes his debut with another stunning beauty and then I'll be shipping them too, that is.  Related:",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,864

a2734381-e1a5-432a-8287-e21e719f53dc,"Either You're the Fastest or Not: Michael Fassbender on His Car-Racing Obsession  The two-time Academy Award nominee is part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers and is fresh off a first-place finish in the first of six series at the Daytona Ferrari Challenge, with another race on June 9.  ""What have I learned?"" With the din of race cars screaming around the Laguna Seca racetrack outside Monterey, California, Michael Fassbender ‚Äî wearing a racing suit, hair mussed from the Nomex balaclava and helmet he's had on his head all morning ‚Äî leans in as a big grin spreads over his face. ""I've learned that I'm always two seconds off where I need to be.""  Two seconds in a line reading might not mean much, but on this 2.2-mile track with 11 turns (on the corkscrew, ""head for the tree,"" he advises), it's an awful lot of time. Part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers, from Paul Newman and Steve McQueen to Patrick Dempsey, Fassbender ‚Äî who spent his childhood in Ireland glued to the TV watching Michael Schumacher win one F1 title after another ‚Äî is the real deal.  The 41-year-old star, who picked up the sport in 2016, possesses an encyclopedic, arcane knowledge of 1980s Group B rally racing and has logged more than 120 hours behind the wheel of his 488 Ferrari Challenge car ‚Äî valued at $330,000, featuring a 670-horsepower, 3.9-liter turbocharged V-8 engine. It's numbered 133, because, as he says, ""three is my lucky number.""  Luck, though, had little to do with Fassbender winning the first of six series (his next race is in Montreal on June 9) in the Ferrari Challenge 2018 season, which opened at Florida's Daytona Speedway in January, where speeds exceed 190 miles per hour. Says Ferrari Challenge head instructor Didier Theys: ""From the start, Michael has shown a great deal of dedication and talent as a competitor.""  Racing is the reward that rounds out a career marked (so far) by two Oscar nominations, for his work in 2013's 12 Years a Slave and 2015's Steve Jobs.  ""It's one of the things about the job that I do that's a huge perk, just an absolute dream come true,"" says Fassbender, who lives in Lisbon, Portugal, with Alicia Vikander, whom he married in October. ""It was always a goal to do some sort of racing at 40, but I didn't imagine that I'd be in a series like this with very powerful, very fast 660-odd horsepower machines."" Fassbender adds with a laugh, ""It's a lot more fun prepping for this than learning lines at home,"" the downside being, ""if you miss an apex or mess up a corner, you don't get a 'take two.'""  He points out the other contrast between his two chosen vocations ‚Äî the type of risk involved: ""It's a different kind of butterflies. For a film, I've usually been putting together this character, but haven't really shown it to anybody. That first day of shooting, it's like, 'God, I hope this works.' But racing, once you start doing it, focusing on what you have to do, you can't think of anything else. When you're driving, literally, if your mind wanders, you're going to go off the track.""  There's a process to maintaining composure while white-knuckling it for four 30-minute races over weekends that begin with Thursday practice laps and end Sunday. Says Fassbender, ""When it comes to the first practice day, your brain and body have to assimilate to these high speeds. You get into the car and think, 'Oh, God, I can't do this,' but it's incredible how the body and mind adapt ‚Äî it's just about focusing and trying to get in a rhythm. Racing is something that really does bring that level of forced meditation ‚Äî it's very rare in life.""  Over time, the actor, who plays Magneto in February's X-Men: Dark Phoenix, has reached an understanding about anxiety: ""Before my first race here last year, I literally thought I was going to vomit. I was in the toilet beforehand, breathing. I was nervous, but that feeling is pretty special, that first race feeling.""  With Fassbender, winning really does seem to matter. ""Like many of his fellow drivers, he's something of a perfectionist and determined to win,"" says Theys.  Notes the star, making a nod to a perspective that many a fellow Oscar nominee might share: ""You race to win, for sure, that's the goal. Either you're fastest or you're not ‚Äî that's the allure for me. It's always great to be on the podium.""  This story first appeared in the June 6 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

The singer has previously spoken about her battle with the disorder on social media.  Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain and is not curable.  In 2016, Lady Gaga revealed an Instagram post is 2016 that she suffers from ""chronic pain"" but never gave more details. But in her upcoming documentary, ""Gaga: Five Foot Two,"" the singer and actress dives a little deeper into the disease she's been battling for some time.  The singer recently tweeted that the chronic pain she deals with is fibromyalgia, a disorder that is more common than people may think. In the tweet, she wrote that she wants to, "" help raise awareness and connect people who have it,"" CNN reports.  Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder that causes tenderness to touch or pain over the body.  According to the National Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Association, the disease can vary in intensity and affects people ""physically, mentally, and socially."" People suffering from this disorder, which often manifests itself in adolescence or young adulthood, feel more pain than would be typically expected. Because of this pain, a few common symptoms include fatigue, tenderness, sleep disorders, memory problems, depression, and stiffness.  The foundation also reports that 10 million Americans suffer from fibromyalgia with a ratio of eight to two ratio, women over men.  There is no cure for this pain, and it is a lifelong condition.  The disease can occur on its own but has also been linked to stress, repetitive injuries, and other diseases like Lupus, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Researchers are working to determine definitively what causes people to develop this pain in the hopes of finding a cure or better treatment options.  Healthline reports that treatment typically goes beyond medication and focuses on improving quality of life through self-care and lifestyle changes. Medication options vary from antidepressants and sleep aids to pain relievers and narcolepsy drugs.  Other celebs have opened up about their struggle with chronic pain or fibromyalgia.  George Clooney Getty Images/Chip Somodevilla  In addition to Gaga, Morgan Freeman has specifically spoken about dealing with fibromyalgia. In an interview with Esquire, the actor described the pain. ""Up and down the arm,"" he said. ""That's where it gets so bad. Excruciating."" The actor doesn't let this pain stop him from doing some of the things he enjoys like golfing or walking, but he can't fly pilot jets or drive.  According to ABC, other stars that have suffered from chronic pain include Paula Abdul, George Clooney, and Tobey Maguire.  In a press conference, Gaga said that the ""pain is a microphone"" and it ""does me no good unless I transform it into something that is,"" Variety reports.

Chris Jackson / Getty  The average cost of a wedding for couples in the US and the UK is around $34,000 (¬£23,700).  Five figures is a huge expense for a one-day affair. That is, unless you're ultra-rich ‚Äî and especially if you're royalty rich.  Next month, the world will bear witness to the most anticipated royal wedding in years. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are set to be married on May 19 at St. George's Chapel, in Windsor, and will begin a carriage procession immediately after the ceremony. Their reception will take place later on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace will cover the cost of the wedding, an expense traditionally taken on by the bride's family.  The case was the same for Kate Middleton and Prince William's 2011 royal wedding‚Äî the only item Middleton paid for was her six-figure Alexander McQueen dress. Their total wedding celebration cost $34 million (¬£23.7 million).  Markle and Prince Harry's wedding will reportedly cost in excess of $45.8 million (¬£32 million), according to Bride Book's estimation. That's over 1,000 more than the average wedding.  The venue is the biggest part of a typical wedding budget for couples in the US and the UK, taking up nearly half of the entire wedding cost. Access to St. George's Chapel ‚Äî and St. George's Great Hall, where the wedding reception will take place ‚Äî is free of charge for Markle and Prince Harry. Transportation is also free, thanks to the Queen's fleet of Rolls-Royces, Daimlers, and Bentleys.  The greatest cost for the royal couple? Security. Protecting Markle and Prince Harry, plus thousands of guests and onlookers, will run Kensington Palace a whopping $43 million (¬£30 million), estimates Bride Book. That includes the cost of snipers, undercover police, military technology, and security drones. The bulk of Kate Middleton and Prince William's wedding budget similarly went to security costs.  Otherwise, Markle and Prince Harry's total wedding spend, including food, cakes, entertainment, wardrobe, and the honeymoon, amounts to about $2.8 million.

431bae09-0bb5-4349-9df3-a48e9d7430f6,"Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)  Rumors of a feud between Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey have existed in Internet lore for years. And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it‚Äôs the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.  So here‚Äôs how the whole thing went down.  The Beginnings  In the early ‚Äò00s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyonc√© ‚Äúnice‚Äù and ‚Äúa good writer‚Äù and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her,‚Äù Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.  If you‚Äôve not seen the GIF, you‚Äôve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.  The Aftermath  It is years later; ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her‚Äù has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey‚Äôs mouth since ‚Äúall I want for Christmas is you.‚Äù It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.    ‚ÄúI know from back in the day, I‚Äôve read things that she‚Äôs said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,‚Äù Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. ‚ÄúLike, we don‚Äôt know each other. I think it‚Äôs kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I‚Äôm not really aware of.‚Äù    Then, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the ‚ÄúLambs.‚Äù  Recently? I don‚Äôt know. [yawns] I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm having a ‚Äúsleep‚Äù moment‚Ä¶    Well, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn‚Äôt trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody‚Äôs kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it ‚Äî and I‚Äôm going to leave you hanging as to what it was.  To recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was ‚Äújust being honest.‚Äù The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn‚Äôt really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.  Round Two  Talk of the feud picked up after last year‚Äôs Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey‚Äôs performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez‚Äôs visual response to Carey‚Äôs ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know her‚Äù GIF.  Which Brings Us to This Week‚Ä¶  Jennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects ‚Äî Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. ‚Äî she‚Äôs currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.  ‚ÄúFirst of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it ‚Äî it was a long performance,‚Äú Lopez said, in what is not not shade. ‚ÄúI watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, ‚ÄòLook at her! Look at her!‚Äô‚Äù  Lopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey‚Äôs show didn‚Äôt start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.  ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù the talk show host joked of Carey. ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm playing because that‚Äôs what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.‚Äù    ‚ÄúShe does say that,‚Äù Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs forgetful I guess.‚Äù",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,867

23326226-3316-4585-a141-ba48ec08a38c,"Hands shaking and heart pumping, athletes from all over the world take to the podium with tear-stained faces, radiant smiles and unbridled euphoria. They watch in genuine wonderment as their nation‚Äôs flag rises and the stadium resounds with the thunderous tones of their national anthem. These awe-inspiring moments draw the eyes of half the world to the Olympic Games, where spectators marvel at the unfathomable tenacity and strength of the world‚Äôs best athletes.  Yet those triumphant moments provide only superficial insight into an athlete‚Äôs tumultuous trek to victory. Their journeys took stamina and determination, but for too many athletes, it also took much more: their innocence, pride, self-worth and well-being, a merciless charge in exchange for success.  In too many cases, the winner is expected to take it all ‚Äì the psychological and physical pain, the sexual abuse and the animosity of teammates in silence and with unfaltering national pride. Nowhere is this more evident or troubling than in USA Gymnastics.  Clad in sparkly, red-white-and-blue spandex, the female USA gymnasts are images of strength, grace and patriotism. Winning consecutive Olympic golds in 2012 and 2016, in addition to world championships in 2011, 2014 and 2015, the USA Women‚Äôs Gymnastics program has distinguished itself as a force to be reckoned with. The women have not only racked up quite the collection of gold medals, but they have also accrued millions of views and brought abundant media attention to the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.  During the 2012 London Summer Olympics, 38.7 million viewers tuned into NBC‚Äôs broadcast of the Women‚Äôs Gymnastics final, where the U.S. women dominated. In fact, in 2012, four of the five members of the ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù ranked in the ‚ÄúTop 10 Most Clicked Athletes‚Äù on NBC‚Äôs Olympics.com, with Gabby Douglas leading with over 23 million clicks to her page. These women are the pride and joy of the U.S. Olympic Committee, not to mention national and international sensations.  You might also like: Michigan State Freshman Claims She Was Gang Raped by Basketball Players  However, recent history has given a glimpse behind the curtain, revealing a revolting and disturbing truth: USA Gymnastics has created a deplorable culture that values its precious reputation more than the health and safety of its athletes. But the thinly veiled facade is beginning to fade, most notably with the well-founded sexual abuse allegations against USA Gymnastics doctor, Larry Nassar, by over 150 women and girls, according to CNN.  Among those victims were gymnasts Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber. They each had a story to tell, rife with gruesome details of long-term abuse.  It is the dismaying story of McKayla Maroney, a ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù member and silver medalist at the 2012 London Olympics, that perhaps most aptly encapsulates both Nassar‚Äôs menace and USA Gymnastics‚Äô negligence. In the fall of 2017, Maroney made a startling announcement via Twitter that Nassar had abused her from the time she was thirteen years old until she left gymnastics in 2016, according to Time Magazine.  ‚ÄúI had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting,‚Äù Maroney said. The gymnast recounted a particularly traumatic event on a flight to Tokyo when Nassar gave her a sleeping pill. The next thing Maroney remembered was waking up alone with Nassar in his hotel room enduring one of his ‚Äútreatments.‚Äù She was 15 years old.  While it is shocking that a predator like Nassar was able to worm his way into this esteemed organization and continue his abuse for years without notice, the organization‚Äôs handling of the travesty was unprofessional, unpardonable and downright unethical.  While USA Gymnastics commended Maroney‚Äôs courage when she publicly announced the horrors she endured, it soon came to light that a year earlier, the organization made her ‚Äúsign a non-disclosure agreement as part of a financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment,‚Äù according to NBC.  On Dec. 20, 2017, Maroney filed a lawsuit on the grounds that the agreement she signed was ‚Äúhypocritical, immoral and in this case illegal,‚Äù said Maroney‚Äôs attorney. In response, on Jan. 16, 2018, USA Gymnastics ensured that it would not hound Maroney for any money should she choose to speak out. But even with this turnaround, the sheer reality that this rectification was even necessary is utterly unspeakable.  A symphony of voices rose in corroboration of Maroney‚Äôs claims, and 156 women delivered grievous and powerful statements in front of Nassar‚Äôs very eyes during a seven-day-long trial. Aly Raisman, team captain of both the ‚ÄúFierce Five‚Äù and the ‚ÄúFinal Five,‚Äù has become a vocal advocate for her fellow victims and delivered a harrowing testimony at Nassar‚Äôs trial.  ‚ÄúI have represented the United States of America in two Olympics and have done so successfully. And both USA Gymnastics and the United States Olympic Committee have been very quick to capitalize and celebrate my success,‚Äù Raisman said. ‚ÄúBut did they reach out when I came forward? No.‚Äù  You might also like: Love or a Gold Medal? Two Olympic Ice Skaters Break Up to Win  But the sins of the organization did not develop overnight. In fact, this sickening culture laid down its roots many years ago. The Washington Post reported that since 1982, ‚Äúmore than 290 coaches and officials associated with the United States‚Äô Olympic sports organizations have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct,‚Äù spanning 15 Olympic sports. Yet even aside from all the sexual abuse, the organizations‚Äô transgressions still run deep, and if you pay close enough attention to history, the signs are evident.  One of the Olympics most spectacular and inspirational moments for the U.S. occurred during the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, when U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug was exhorted by coach Bela Karolyi to perform the last vault on a critically sprained ankle. Despite her injury, she completed the vault, and led the U.S. women to victory over the Russians for the first time ever. However, malevolence lurks even in the Games‚Äô most glorified moments.  The first feeling the video elicits from viewers is almost always one of admiration for the 18-year-old Strug, who somehow miraculously landed on one foot. But when you witness the agonizing pain on this young girl‚Äôs face, and Karolyi‚Äôs seemingly heartless coercion, the picture slowly turns from heartening to unsettling. To make matters worse, one of the doctors helping Strug off the stage is none other than Larry Nassar himself.  From being forced to practice on broken limbs, doping at the urging of coaches and acquiescing to irrational diets, Olympic athletes withstand unthinkable afflictions and tribulations en route to domination at the Games.  The 2017 feature film ‚ÄúI, Tonya,‚Äù provided yet another startling reminder of the cutthroat nature of the Games; it resurrected the 1994 attack on U.S. Olympic ice skater Nancy Kerrigan, which soon implicated Tonya Harding, her own teammate and possible conspirator in the attack.  You might also like: Randolph College‚Äôs Meredith Alwine Is Lifting Herself to the 2020 Olympics  Without the most fundamental trust and security shared between teammates, coaches and doctors, the Olympics will cease to be a place where athletes can flourish. It will become their personal hell. Olympic gold medal winner Shawn Johnson even went so far as to say in a YouTube video on her channel, ‚ÄúI think gymnastics is the best sport in the entire world, but if I had a daughter right now, I wouldn‚Äôt put her in it.‚Äù  With news stories, personal testimonies and unearthed history inundating almost every media platform, it has become increasingly difficult to look past the Games‚Äô faults and focus on their worth. In order to preserve an honorable tradition and progress in a positive way, major reform is necessary.  The U.S. Olympic Committee needs to genuinely recommit itself to cultivating an organization characterized for its emphasis on unity, not duplicity. In addition, the U.S. Olympic teams must forge environments that do not alienate future generations of athletes, but instead encourage and ignite the most inspired work and dedication they can give.  There is a black, rotting hole corroding the Games from the inside, and now is the time to wipe it out. Let the upcoming PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Winter Games be the birthplace of a new era, so when these world-class athletes take the stage, country flags ascending and anthems blaring, they can be filled with authentic, unadulterated ardor for the organization and country whose names they proudly bear.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1631

6f006501-8daf-49ce-8901-6555a64da77c,"There have been plenty of celebrity breakups recently, but none have been so carefully analyzed as the Pitt-Jolie separation. Each bit of information that reaches the media is being treated like a chess move in a big game of Who Gets to Keep Their Reputation.  Angelina Jolie filed for divorce after an alleged altercation between Brad Pitt and their son Maddox on a private plane. The only info that we, the reading public had at first was that she cited irreconcilable differences, and was trying to get sole custody of their children. Wanting sole custody seemed significant, even before reports of Pitt‚Äôs drinking began to surface.  Now that Marion Cotillard has denied any involvement in the separation, the media focus is more and more on how Pitt interacts with his children. Is he a man who drinks and emotionally or physically abuses his family when intoxicated? Or is Angelina Jolie exaggerating one family argument so she can get custody, then jet off to the U.N., as the Pitt camp alleges? It all kind of hinges on some recorded evidence of the inciting incident that supposedly led to Jolie‚Äôs filing.  Lainey Gossip devoted a long blog Friday to the way in which Brad Pitt has been trying to set up the video of his argument with Jolie and Maddox, a video that has not yet been released, but likely will judging from the way Pitt‚Äôs PR is trying to lay the groundwork. She points out that Pitt‚Äôs team has clearly chosen People as their tabloid of choice, and in a post literally titled ‚ÄúBrad‚Äôs Side of the Story‚Äù they have carefully crafted how we should read the abuse allegations. As Lainey writes:  You know what‚Äôs interesting though? PEOPLE‚Äôs version of ‚ÄúBrad‚Äôs side of the story‚Äù has been amended. The one that‚Äôs up on the site right now has been edited. Originally when they posted the article last night, this is how it read: The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. ‚ÄúHe is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed.

(Picture: Black Label Media/REX)  Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling used body doubles for La La Land‚Äôs most complex dance scene, a shocking new report has claimed.  Chadwick Boseman fought with Marvel to use African accent in Black Panther  The sensational report throws the film‚Äôs integrity into question, given that it was widely reported how the two stars of the film underwent intense dance training for their roles, of which Emma won an Oscar for.  But according to a film insider, the iconic Griffith Observatory scene, which is thought of as the film‚Äôs most intricate dance sequence in which Emma and Ryan fly through the observatory, apparently looked so good because it was crafted by professional dancers and not Emma and Ryan.  Is that Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling dancing‚Ä¶ or body doubles? (Picture: Lionsgate)  A stunt double allegedly used in the film has told The Sun how Ryan had two doubles for his dance scenes, whilst Emma‚Äôs moves were performed for her by pro-dancer Emilie Livingston, who is the dancer wife of Jeff Goldblum.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ‚ÄòRyan had three stunt doubles ‚Äî two were dancers ‚Äî and Emma‚Äôs dancing was done by Emilie Livingston,‚Äô the inside tole The Sun On Sunday.  ‚ÄòThe sequence where they danced in the clouds was filmed on a platform and was not Ryan and Emma.‚Äô  Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling filmed a magical scene in the Griffith Observatory for La La Land (Picture: Lionsgate)  Claiming film makers had tried silencing the dancers on the use of doubles, the source added: ‚ÄòLots of people have been asking what really went on and we have been contacted by the studio, told off for talking and sworn to silence.  ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not fair but they were insistent we shouldn‚Äôt tell anyone there were doubles for the dancing.‚Äô  Lionsgate were apparently quizzed on the use of dancing doubles in February but denied the claims, staying that, ‚Äòboth Ryan and Emma trained for three months intensively and everything you see is their work‚Äô, according to the newspaper.  However, the film production company has now released a contradictory statement which confirms the use of doubles, specifically in that iconic Griffith Observatory scene.  ‚ÄòDoubles were used for some silhouette turns in the latter half of the observatory scene,‚Äô the statement reads.  Livingston is credited on La La Land‚Äôs IMDB page, described as a ‚Äòstunt double‚Äô for Mia, the role Emma played.  Advertisement  Advertisement  If Lionsgate did indeed originally deny stunt doubles were used, it‚Äôs no surprise, given that February would have been in the middle of awards season.  An industry source further explained to The Sun: ‚ÄòThe film‚Äôs campaign was quite heavily built around how amazing it was that Emma and Ryan had learned to sing, dance and play piano for the movie.  ‚ÄòBut in the observatory scene it‚Äôs obvious, if you pay attention, that the silhouettes are not them.

The scholarship‚Äôs recipient, Hayley Williams, is the daughter of a man who was injured during a training exercise before Operation Desert Storm. Her father has inspired her to become a nurse, and so she applied to the Folds of Honor Foundation for one of the scholarships they provide for children and spouses of veterans (with funding help from Budweiser). In a new video from Budweiser, Driver drives out to Brodheadsville, Pennsylvania, to personally deliver the good news to the Williams family that Hayley had won one of the grants.  ‚ÄúI found the Williams to be an incredibly close-knit and loving family,‚Äù Driver told the Huffington Post. ‚ÄúI understood where Hayley‚Äôs father, John, was coming from right away.

274e3b41-e153-43de-820a-c709e36a57db,"Jim Carrey says the Illuminati is pushing Satanism through the entertainment industry  The Trueman Show star claims that a push is being made by ""dark forces that control the world"" to promote Satanism in the mainstream and turn people away from traditional values.  During an aftershow event at the Chinese Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, where his new documentary, ""Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond"" was being screened at the AFI Fest, Carrey was answering questions from a group of fans on his preparation for his acting roles.  Jim & Andy chronicles the time when Jim Carrey was filming his 1999 movie biography Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon, for which he won multiple awards, including the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.  Carrey is known for his method acting, in which he lives his life on and off the set as his character.  Jim & Andy explores his methods and details how he ""nearly lost it"" after becoming so deeply involved in his character.  Carrey joked with fans about how he drove his friends and family ""crazy"" whilst he was filming The Grinch, with one of them asking if that meant he ""wasn't looking forward to Christmas,"" to which he replied:  ""No, I love Christmas. ""I fully embrace the festivities as I know that we, as a civilization, don't have many of them left.""  Following a smattering of nervous laughter from the group, Carrey was prompted to elaborate:  ""Those dark forces who control everything - the Illuminati - the Illumi-nutty - they are working hard to eradicate tradition values. ""Satanism is being pushed through movies, TV, and pop music to brainwash young minds into following Satan. ""You must of all seen that, right? ""It's everywhere and has been for years. ""They are not trying to manifest themselves into the zeitgeist: Satan is already fully embedded in the public psyche. ""It's only now that the trigger is being engaged and the final stages of the agenda are being fulfilled. ""You keep seeing these celebrities opening up about their devotion to Lucifer, and that's not a slip of the tongue: They are preparing for the final push. ""Once Satan is the dominant force on Earth, there will be no more Christmas. ""I don't know what they will replace it with. ""Probably one of their rituals where they sacrifice children and drink their blood. ""Trust me, once you see what these guys in Hollywood really get up to, you'll think Weinstein was a boy scout.""  At this point, the atmosphere changes as the group seem confused as they nervously smile at each other, to which Carrey steers the conversation back.  ""Anyway, at least we still have this Christmas to look forward to,"" he said before raising a glass of soda water to toast saying:  ""To Satan... I mean Santa!""  Jim Carrey's concerns about a push towards a Devil-worshipping future may not actually be so far-fetched.  For generations, Illuminati symbolism has been subliminally pushed though pop culture, but more recently there has been a dramatic rise of Satanic symbols in music.  Celebrities, from Nicki Minaj to Lil Wayne to Rihanna, are accused of filling the airwaves with Illuminati imagery.  In music videos, promotional materials, video games, and paparazzi photos, the most famous guys and girls in pop culture are caught repping the All-Seeing Eye.  This eye, a singular eyeball in a pyramid-esque shape, is associated with this occult group of Satanists who have sold their souls for success.  Turn on the MTV VMAs for Illuminati symbolism, courtesy of Lady Gaga and Miley Cyrus.  Scroll through old album covers and find one-eyed Jordin Sparks and Celine Dion confirming their membership in the occult organization.  Turn the pages of Parlour magazine and Esquire to see Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj use triangular mannerisms to cover one eye.  The Eye of Horus isn't even disguised as the CBS logo, nor is it disguised in scenes from the hit video game ""Grand Theft Auto V.""  Look close enough, and Illuminati Eyes sightings are all over pop culture.  Illuminati symbols in pop culture aren't uncommon, but now they are becoming more frequent and less subtle.  Jay-Z wears a Satanic slogan across his sweatshirt: 'Do What Thou Wilt'  ¬© press  Recently music stars have become far more open about their devotion to the occult and their love for their ""Lord Satan.""  Just last month, Hip Hop star Jay-Z has blasted traditional Christian values in an epic rant where he claims to be part of an exclusive club of ""smart people"" who worships ""our true lord; Satan.""  The billionaire rapper has also claimed that ""God created Lucifer to be the bearer of truth and light,"" and that ""Jesus never existed"" but was merely a ""tool created by smart people to control dumb people.""  More recently, pop star Miley Cyrus left her followers shocked and confused after advising her young fans to ""worship Satan"" if they want to become ""rich & famous"" like their heroes.  If what Carrey is saying is correct, then maybe these revelations aren't accidental slip-ups at all but are meant to be an intentional push at taking their Satanic teachings into the mainstream.  Fox has invested millions into pro-Satanic programming like TV show 'Lucifer'  ¬© press  TV network Fox has also being accused of trying to ""take the Devil mainstream"" after investing millions into pro-Satanic programming.  One of Fox's most popular shows, Lucifer, depicts a cool, good-looking incarnation of the devil who drives a Corvette and owns a nightclub.  The series makes the idea of Satan seem exciting, and clearly being aimed at teenagers and young adults, it certainly fits in with Carrey's brainwashing comments.  Fox has also heavily promoted a show that's a modern reinvention of William Peter Blatty‚Äôs bestselling 1971 book, The Exorcist.  The project is described as ""a propulsive, serialized psychological thriller following two very different men tackling one family‚Äôs case of horrifying demonic possession, and confronting the face of true evil.""  Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs media conglomerate News Corp., that owns Fox, also owns a company called Avon that publishes and promotes Anton Lavey‚Äôs book The Satanic Bible.  If the Illuminati is trying to push Satanism onto the public, then the signs are all there.  And, if there are trying to influence the beliefs of future generations, then pushing Satanic values through popular culture would certainly be the most effective way to brainwash young minds.  People often assume that Jim Carrey is either joking or crazy when he makes statements that most people are unable to decipher, yet in this case, and many others, it seems as though he's making more sense than ever.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1285

980fd6b7-d235-44fb-86ec-e7fbaa44ffcd,"CLOSE Emma Stone stars as Billie Jean King and Steve Carell is Bobby Riggs in the 1970s-set sports film 'Battle of the Sexes.' Fox Searchlight  It took more than Hollywood magic to turn Emma Stone, the svelte actress from La La Land, into Billie Jean King in her new movie Battle of the Sexes.  For starters, the physical transformation required three months, 15 pounds and a meal and fitness plan.  Trainer Jason Walsh, founder of climbing gym Rise Nation, who got Stone in shape for La La Land, knew the actress would need to up her calorie intake and strength training regimen to embody the powerful tennis legend.  Here's what Stone went through to reshape her body.  For her role in 'Battle of the Sexes,' Emma Stone gained 15 pounds. (Photo: Melinda Sue Gordon, 20th Century Fox Film)  She wasn‚Äôt afraid of packing on pounds.  Stone is ‚Äúvery petite and has a dancer's body,‚Äù but she was willing to bulk up to look more like King. ‚ÄúShe took it seriously,"" Walsh says. ""She wanted to do the story justice.‚Äù  Gaining a dozen-plus pounds of muscle made Stone look more like a tennis pro, and also feel more like her character. ‚ÄúWe wanted to give Emma the psychological backing‚Äù to be able to compete in professional tennis matches, Walsh says. ‚ÄúShe needed to be resilient and to have the psyche of being really strong.‚Äù  Emma Stone, here with co-star Ryan Gosling, had a lithe look for 'La La Land.' (Photo: Dale Robinette)  She drank two high-cal protein shakes a day.  ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt like we were taking someone off the Taco Bell diet,‚Äù Walsh says of his clean-eating client, ‚Äúbut we added shakes into her diet."" The shakes had ‚Äúhundreds of calories‚Äù each, he says, and usually contained a handful of spinach, a supplement known as ashwagandha and a ‚Äúgood tasting"" protein powder. Fortunately, since Stone was working out so much (twice a day), she was hungry enough to down the filling beverages.  Emma Stone getting her deadlift on. Ladies, DEADLIFT!!!! This lift will change your life. #Strongisthenewsexy #strong #motivated A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 21, 2015 at 7:54am PDT  She lifted an impressive amount of weight.  Some of Walsh‚Äôs daily go-to strength training exercises for Stone? Pushing and pulling sleds twice her size, heavy farmer‚Äôs walks (aka walking while holding dumbbells) and up to 300-pound hip thrusts. At one point, Stone was deadlifting 185 pounds and doing push-ups with 50 pounds of chains on her back.  ‚ÄúI was pretty proud,‚Äù Walsh says.  The ""Battle of the Sexes"" Working with Emma is pure hell...we loathe each other #battleofthesexes #emmastone A post shared by JASON WALSH (@risemovement) on Sep 22, 2017 at 6:34pm PDT  Then she backed off.  While Stone was gaining weight, she stayed away from fat-burning cardio. But once she achieved the right look for the film, ‚Äúwe started adding conditioning aspects,‚Äù Walsh says. That meant Stone was lifting fewer weights and doing cardio at Rise Nation once or twice a week.  She's two years beyond her most intensive Battle of the Sexes training, but Walsh encourages the actress, and anyone else trying to stay in shape, to mix activities like yoga and hiking with strength training.  Yes, for women. And, yes, that means lifting weights.  ‚ÄúI train (GLOW star) Alison Brie and (future Captain Marvel) Brie Larson, and all of these girls are strong as hell and not big,‚Äù he says. In fact, after incorporating weight-lifting into their workout routine, ‚ÄúThey fit into their clothes better (and) are three, four, five times stronger than before.‚Äù  Want to see the results of Stone's hard work?

470ba3fb-9327-4292-bf46-ebb08eb88208,"Ivanka Trump, President Donald Trump‚Äôs daughter, is closing her namesake fashion brand and planning a longer-term focus on policy in Washington.  Ms. Trump, who formally separated herself from the business more than a year ago, holds an undefined policy portfolio as a senior adviser in the White House, most recently centered on workforce development. Her decision to concentrate on the White House comes after months of speculation about whether she and her husband, fellow White House adviser Jared Kushner, would remain in the administration for the rest of Mr. Trump‚Äôs term.  Apparel sales at the brand, which Ms. Trump launched in its current form in 2014, soared in the year of the 2016 presidential election. But the company also became a lightning rod for critics of her father‚Äôs policies, with one anti-Trump group last year urging shoppers to boycott stores selling Trump-branded goods. Retailers including Nordstrom Inc. and Hudson‚Äôs Bay have stopped selling Ivanka Trump products in the past 18 months, citing poor sales.  Abigail Klem, who took over as president of the New York-based brand in the spring of 2017, told its 18 employees Tuesday the company would be shutting down. Ms. Trump addressed the staff in person later in the day.  Ms. Trump said she had contemplated the move in recent months as she grew frustrated by the restrictions she placed on the company, IT Collection LLC, to avoid possible conflicts of interest while serving in the White House.  Visitors at the Ivanka Trump Collection store at Trump Tower in New York in 2017. Photo: Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News  Ms. Trump said Tuesday she was uncertain whether she would return to the retail industry once she leaves Washington.  ‚ÄúAfter 17 months in Washington, I do not know when or if I will ever return to the business, but I do know that my focus for the foreseeable future will be the work I am doing here in Washington,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo making this decision now is the only fair outcome for my team and partners.‚Äù  When Ms. Trump and Mr. Kushner moved to Washington from New York in late 2016 to join the administration, it was unclear how long they would stay. Mr. Kushner initially took on an expansive portfolio that included China relations, Middle East peace and improving the federal government‚Äôs efficiency. Ms. Trump made an early focus pushing to include a child-care tax credit in a federal tax overhaul.  Since then, the couple has faced questions about their roles at the White House and their companies‚Äô financial dealings. Mr. Kushner was drawn into the special-counsel investigation into whether Trump associates colluded with Russia‚Äôs efforts to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Kushner and the president have denied collusion, and Moscow has denied election meddling.  Ms. Trump also drew rebukes for at times appearing to hawk her brand in her official capacity, including by wearing the merchandise in Instagram posts about official appearances.  Mr. Trump has often privately expressed concern about the couple and has suggested they would be happier in New York, according to people familiar with the discussions.  Ms. Trump has focused in recent months on promoting the White House‚Äôs infrastructure plan, which the administration has since declared dead, and workforce development, holding an event last week with lawmakers and corporate executives at the White House and making a presentation at a cabinet meeting.  There are signs the couple are easing into their lives in Washington. They have routinely hosted members of Congress and reporters at their home in the city‚Äôs upscale Kalorama neighborhood for dinner parties and off-the-record conversations. In recent months, they have been house-hunting for a permanent home in the city, according to people familiar with the matter.  Ms. Trump separated herself from the management and operations of the company but retained her ownership interest through a trust. The ethics restrictions she implemented included ordering the company not to expand internationally and to seek her approval before striking agreements with new domestic partners.  The Ivanka Trump brand sells moderately priced apparel, shoes, handbags and jewelry, such as a $200 pink handbag and $100 black pumps.  In January 2017, the company said it wouldn‚Äôt proceed with a distribution deal with Sanei International that would bring the brand to Japan after learning that Sanei had ties to the Japanese government, according to a letter from Ms. Klem to the House Judiciary Committee.  Ms. Trump has frequently worn her brand in public and at White House events. Photo: Evan Vucci/Associated Press  The Ivanka Trump brand will allow its licensing agreements with companies including G-III Apparel Group Ltd. , its apparel distribution partner, to expire in the coming months, according to a person close to the company, but will continue to file trademark applications in certain instances. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a responsibility to Ivanka to ensure that others are not exploiting her name,‚Äù the person said.  Despite Ms. Trump‚Äôs efforts to separate herself from the company, it has proved difficult to fully extricate the brand from her father‚Äôs administration.  After Nordstrom dropped Ms. Trump‚Äôs line last year, the president in a tweet chastised the company for treating his daughter ‚Äúso unfairly.‚Äù Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway was later rebuked for urging the public to ‚Äúgo buy Ivanka‚Äôs stuff‚Äù in a televised interview from the White House briefing room.  At the time, a Nordstrom spokeswoman said sales had deteriorated to the point where ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt make good business sense for us to continue with the line.‚Äù  Neiman Marcus Group and T.J. Maxx in the last 18 months have scaled back or changed the way they display Ivanka Trump products.  Hudson‚Äôs Bay, a Canadian company, notified the Ivanka Trump brand in the fall of 2017 that it would phase out its merchandise, based on its performance, according to a person familiar with the situation.  Lord & Taylor and Saks Off 5th, also owned by Hudson‚Äôs Bay Co. , continue to carry the line, according to a Hudson‚Äôs Bay spokeswoman. Other retailers selling the line included Dillard‚Äôs Inc., Bloomingdale‚Äôs Inc., Zappos.com, Amazon.com Inc. and Von Maur Inc.  An Ivanka Trump spokeswoman said the brand launched its e-commerce operation earlier this year in light of shifts in retail patterns across the industry.  Newsletter Sign-up  The business is privately held and doesn‚Äôt disclose sales or other financial information. Online sales of the Ivanka Trump brand sold at Amazon.com, Macy‚Äôs Inc., Bloomingdale‚Äôs and Zappos.com fell nearly 55% in the 12 months to June, compared with the year-earlier period, according to Rakuten Intelligence, which gathers email receipts from 5.5 million U.S. consumers.  An Ivanka Trump spokesman attributed the decline to particularly high online sales in early 2017 because of ‚Äúnewfound awareness‚Äù of the brand after Mr. Trump took office.  During the 2016 election, the brand saw its apparel sales boom. In the year ended Jan. 31, 2017, net sales of Ivanka Trump-licensed apparel rose 61% to $47.3 million from the prior year, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing from G-III. Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of G-III, said Tuesday the company was ‚Äúappreciative‚Äù of its partnership with Ivanka Trump.  In the White House, Ms. Trump continued to receive certain financial information and a share of the company‚Äôs profits. The financial disclosure form she filed in June showed the trust was valued at over $50 million and brought in more than $5 million in income in 2017.  Ms. Klem said in an interview that she was ‚Äúincredibly proud‚Äù of the brand. ‚ÄúI know that this was a very difficult decision for Ivanka and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have led such a talented and committed team,‚Äù she said.  Ms. Trump said in a CBS interview shortly after joining the administration that she hadn‚Äôt sold the company because of its name. A sale would have allowed whoever bought the brand to go around the globe, she said, ‚Äúlicensing and leveraging the name of the 45th president of the United States of America‚Äîcompletely unfettered.‚Äù  Corrections & Amplifications  Online sales of the Ivanka Trump brand sold at Amazon.com, Macy‚Äôs Inc., Bloomingdale‚Äôs and Zappos.com fell nearly 55% in the 12 months to June, compared with the year-earlier period, according to Rakuten Intelligence, which gathers email receipts from 5.5 million U.S. consumers.

After scheduling issues made the actress turn down a role in the DC Extended Universe film, it appears that she's very open to appearing in Wonder Woman 2. During a panel at last month's San Diego Comic-Con, Theron addressed the possibility of reuniting with Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins - who previously teamed up with the actress in Monster.  ""Look I would love to work with her again."" Theron revealed. ""I had such an incredible time. I trusted her from the first time I met her. That‚Äôs a big thing for an actor, to be able to trust your director that way and she just never disappointed. She‚Äôs incredible so to see her have this moment, I just feel incredibly happy for her."" Considering the success of 2003's Monster - which earned Theron a Best Actress Oscar - a reunion between the two in Wonder Woman 2 feels like a no-brainer. While nothing is currently confirmed, Jenkins appears to agree, judging by a letter Theron was given at the SDCC panel.  ""Getting to work with Charlize and what we did together will always be remembered as a great high point of my life."" Jenkins explained. ""She‚Äôs a tremendous person, talent, artist, and actor, but also a wonderful and incredibly unique spirit who brings that dynamism to every part she plays. She‚Äôs hard, yet soft, tough, yet yielding. It was a wonderful and rare gift and I can‚Äôt wait to work with my friend again one day.""

e1c8baf6-d1eb-47ac-94fc-c52c531f6dad,"No doubt, you are still distraught after learning nearly a week ago that Selena Gomez broke up with Justin Bieber.  Nothing make sense anymore: Black is white, up is down and you are questioning if love even exists. Well, hold on tight, because things are about to get even crazier when it comes to ""Jelena"" breakup rumors.  The pop-star power couple are splitsville now, but rumors that Bieber, 18, proposed to his 20-year-old girlfriend, not once but twice, in the months before the breakup are gaining traction. Proposal rumors developed out of a blind item from earlier this month, and there is talk that their relationship began as a PR arrangement -- which was fine for Gomez, who saw it as a job from the get go -- but Bieber actually fell for her and wanted to make things official.  This isn't the first time we've heard that their relationship was a publicity stunt and it's not the first time we've heard engagement rumors. There were multiple reports the couple was engaged or that Bieber had proposed throughout their nearly two year relationship, and more recently it was reported that Gomez's team had encouraged her to stay with Bieber because it was good for her brand.  While the proposals are likely a bit of a stretch, it definitely sounds like Gomez wasn't as into the relationship as the teen pop star and she also wasn't about to be made a fool of, because of his tendency to flirt with other women.  According to Gossip Cop, Gomez had ""trust issues"" with Bieber, but she also wasn't able to spend as much time with him as he wanted. Sources told the website that the teen heartthrob was ""very needy,"" and ""constantly complaining‚Äù for her to ‚Äúmake time for him.""  Multiple sources told E! news that the breakup was ""a long time coming"" and jealousy had been building up for some time between the pair.  Though it was a photo of Biebs with model Barbara Palvin that sparked rumors he'd already moved on, sources say it was a photo of Gomez kissing her ""Parental Guidance"" co-star Nat Wolff that set the couple on rocky ground. The kiss happened while the actors were filming a scene, but it sounds like Bieber and Gomez have been playing a game of emotional chicken -- trying to see who can make the other jealous.  ""They're young. Of course they have their jealous streaks. Justin has gotten jealous, and so has Selena,"" a source told E! News.  Their relationship sounds less than ideal, so it's not shocking that Gomez would want out. RadarOnline is also reporting that jealousy contributed to the downfall of ""Jelena,"" and sources say that Bieber has promised he'll stop texting other girls if Gomez takes him back.  ""He is texting her like crazy trying to stay in her good graces,"" the source told the website. ""If either one of them slows down and they actually have the chance to spend time together again, they will end up back together.""  Bieber is reportedly desperate to get back with Gomez, but it doesn't look like the breakup has slowed him down -- at all. The pop star has kept himself busy by posting shirtless photos to Twitter, riding around on his $20,000 Ducati, and hanging out with Ashley Olsen at a Textile Elizabeth & James event -- that's just weird.  UPDATE: Selena must be tired of the constant texts she's reportedly getting from the Biebs, as sources tell TMZ she's spent the last day blocking her phone number and other communication devices so he can't contact her. Though she's still following him on Twitter, the source says she wants no contact with the pop star. It's not surprising, since sources also say the breakup ""absolutely, positively involved another woman.""",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,738

077c145d-e8cb-4422-9420-73dbaa088420,"Most of us assume that cleansing is a task so basic it can be accomplished even when you're completely exhausted or slightly tipsy‚Äîwhich, of course, it can. But it turns out that there's a lot more to it than soap and water, says Dr. Doris Day, NYC dermatologist and author of Forget the Facelift. ""With so many sophisticated, gentle cleansers that won't strip the skin, using the right one allows moisturizing and antiaging products to absorb more effectively."" Clearly, an old-school splash and scrub won't do. Here, the new rules for getting your freshest face.  Myth 1: Wash and Go  It's more of a two-step process. ""Remove your makeup before you wash your face,"" says Montclair, New Jersey, derm Dr. Jeanine Downie. ""Many cleansers can't take off concealer or foundation completely, especially around the eyes and nose."" Use an oil-based cream, an emollient wipe, or a cleansing oil to dissolve stubborn sunscreen and makeup. Follow with lukewarm water and a dime-size amount of cleanser (look for the ingredients cocamidopropyl betaine or caprylic triglyceride, which are sulfate-free surfactants) on your fingers or a clean, damp washcloth.  Myth 2: Wash Twice a Day  While the jury is still out on how often to cleanse (every a.m. and p.m. or just once at night), all derms agree that over-washing can lead to irritation and a lack of moisture. The rule is to use common sense: Always wash your face after a workout to prevent breakouts, and wash excessively oily skin morning and night. For very dry or sensitive skin, stick to cleansing once daily in the evening.  Myth 3: Close Your Pores  Sorry, folks, but you can skip rituals like massaging your face to increase circulation or splashing with cold water to ""close"" your pores. ""Pores don't open and close,"" says Downie. In fact, extreme hot or cold can exacerbate problems like rosacea and redness. That said, mild steam can help soften hardened oil in pores, so it's never a bad idea to cleanse in the shower. And ""while it feels nice, massage doesn't do much,"" adds Downie. ""Exercise is what boosts your circulation.""  Myth 4: Buy Cleanser According to Skin Type  No matter what kind of skin you have, make sure the ingredients list doesn't contain fragrance, which can be irritating; parabens (potentially toxic preservatives); or harsh soap (it's drying). ""If a cleanser fits that bill, the formula itself [cream, lotion, foaming, etc.] is more a matter of personal preference,"" says NYC dermatologist Dr. Brad Katchen. Of course, people with dry skin may prefer formulas with added moisturizers, like glycerin or shea butter. And ""if you have oily skin, you might want a foaming wash that leaves skin feeling super clean,"" says Day. The American Academy of Dermatology also recommends avoiding alcohol in cleansers that can be abrasive to skn.  Myth 5: Scrub to Exfoliate and Smooth  A salicylic- or glycolic-acid cleanser is gentler and more effective than grainy scrubs, and both offer anti-aging benefits and help prevent breakouts. Alternate with your regular wash (start with three times a week), and adjust depending on how your skin is looking and feeling.  Myth 6: Use Toner  ""An alcohol-based toner strips off natural oils,"" explains Day. Not good. ""Gentle toners calm the skin and balance pH levels, but with the right cleanser, you don't really need this step."" Love the feeling anyway? Choose gentle, alcohol-free versions.  Myth 7: Brush Your Skin to a Healthy Glow  ""A brush removes oil, dirt, and dead skin better than your hands can, and it's less aggressive than most exfoliating cleansers or scrubs,"" says Day. ""But it's not something you have to use every night, especially if you're also applying ingredients like retinoids or acids. Too much exfoliation can cause inflammation."" Basically: Use, but use sparingly. (Right now we're obsessed with Clarisonic's new acne-cleansing brush head, below.) To keep your brush bacteria-free, rinse and air-dry after use. Oh, and hey, clean freak, like you do with your Brita, replace the brush head every three months.  Myth 8: Spend a Fortune  Save your pricier ingredients, like retinol or antioxidants, for leave-on products instead of washing them down the drain. ""They're most effective when they stay concentrated on the skin,"" says Katchen.

27b4de3d-72bd-4f1f-9955-5eb1dc0c0912,"(CNN) A grand jury indicted actress and activist Rose McGowan Monday on one felony count of cocaine possession, according to Loudoun County, Virginia court documents.  McGowan voluntarily surrendered to authorities in Virginia in November in response to an arrest warrant. She later pleaded not guilty to the charge.  The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority obtained the warrant in February last year after authorities allegedly found traces of narcotics in her personal belongings that were left behind on a United flight in January to Washington, D.C.  McGowan tweeted about incident, asking, ""Are they trying to silence me?""  ""There is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia,"" she wrote. ""What a load of HORSES**T.""  McGowan is one of the more than 80 women who have accused former producer Harvey Weinstein of acts of sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape.  Through a spokesperson, Weinstein has consistently denied any allegations of ""non-consensual sex.""  McGowan told Farrow that she was afraid when an airport police detective called her to retrieve her wallet, as she was unsure whether he was actually a detective.  McGowan's spokesperson confirmed to CNN the accuracy of her published quotes at the time.  McGowan, who was traveling to Washington for the Women's March when the incident occurred, said the next day she received an Instagram message from a user she did not know that read, ""You left your wallet on your Saturday flight with your 2 bags of coke.""  The ""Charmed"" star and her attorney assert that she left her bag containing her wallet on the plane unattended. McGowan said she filed a lost luggage claim and tweeted United Airlines for help when she realized her wallet was missing, according to The New Yorker's report.  On October 30, McGowan first publicly responded to the existence of the warrant on Twitter.  McGowan told Farrow she has used drugs in the past, but said marijuana was her ""jam.""  ""Imagining I'm going into sisterly solidarity, I can think of nothing more opposed to that, energetically, that I would want in my body at that moment,"" she said referring to the cocaine.  A May cover story with The Hollywood Reporter included comment from McGowan about the fact she faced a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted, while Weinstein remained free.  ""I'm the only one who's had handcuffs on me so far in this situation,"" she told the publication. ""That's not right.""  Weinstein has since been arrested on charges of rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct in New York for which has pled not guilty. The charges are unrelated to McGowan's allegations against him.  CNN has reached out to McGowan's representatives for comment.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,521

""I really didn't have a choice,"" she said. ""I, at this point, couldn't get pregnant and we wanted to expand our family. So the fact that that is something that you can do, and it's really taboo to talk about and people don't really understand it, I mean, even throwing my baby shower, do I a baby shower? What do I do?

""And all of a sudden, like five days before the baby shower, I was like, 'I have to do it.' Cherry blossoms, it's what I wanted. We had to rent off these cherry blossoms. They pulled it off in four or five days...and it was so beautiful and it was just a tea for my friends and it was beautiful. I'm so glad that I did it.""  The baby shower featured pink cherry blossom trees, which fueled speculation Kim and Kanye are expecting a girl. Kim then confirmed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show this week that they will be welcoming their second daughter.  Kim and Kanye's new baby will join big sister North West, 4, and big brother Saint West, who will turn 2 in December.  ""It is an interesting transition.

27bf1fa3-7be6-40d2-9f28-522098703754,"Lamar Odom cheated death 17 months ago. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a walking miracle,‚Äù says the former NBA star and ex-husband of Khlo√© Kardashian, admitting he suffered 12 strokes and two heart attacks after being found comatose October 13, 2015, at a Las Vegas‚Äìarea brothel. Cocaine use and reckless behavior had already ended his four-year marriage. Yet Kardashian delayed a divorce to support his recovery, ultimately refiling in May 2016 after the Queens native was photographed drinking at L.A.‚Äôs Beverly Center.  Today, the 37-year-old ‚Äî who completed a stay at San Diego‚Äôs Casa Palmera rehab center in January ‚Äî is working on a docuseries and an autobiography due this year. ‚ÄúI had no choice but to become stronger,‚Äù the dad of Destiny, 18, and Lamar Jr., 14 (with Liza Morales, 37), told Us‚Äô entertainment director, Ian Drew, March 24 in the Hollywood Hills while cracking jokes, singing along to Hall & Oates‚Äô ‚ÄúSara Smile‚Äù and, yes, dribbling a ball. ‚ÄúS‚Äìt, I‚Äôm here talking to you. So I guess I‚Äôm winning.‚Äù Watch him tell his emotional story in the video above, and read on for our full interview.  Take Us back to the start of your marriage. Was Khlo√© aware of your drug use?  I was hiding it for a while, but then I got frustrated and was like, f‚Äìk it. Around two years before we split up [in 2011], I was in the man cave she had made for me and she caught me. She was disappointed. So was I. The sad thing about it is, I don‚Äôt know if I was disappointed because I was actually doing the drug or because she caught me. She knew I was doing cocaine the whole time after that. It was my drug of choice. I‚Äôm not going to say she accepted it because that would be the wrong word. Tolerated would be a better word.  Do you regret sharing your ¬≠marriage on TV?  Businesswise, it opened up opportunities, like the fragrance Khlo√© and I created. We probably cursed it by calling it Unbreakable, but that was my baby. It also opened this gate up with other women who probably wouldn‚Äôt have been interested in me. When I became Khlo√© Kardash¬≠ian‚Äôs man and on TV, it made me look more enticing. People who didn‚Äôt even know basketball would approach me because they knew Lammy.  You mean other women?  Yes. Bitches and THOTs came out of the woodwork. If there is one thing I regret when I was married, it was having multiple affairs with different women. That wasn‚Äôt the stand-up thing to do. I wish I could have kept my d‚Äìk in my pants.  After Khlo√© filed for divorce in December 2013, you moved into an apartment in L.A.  That‚Äôs where me and my friend Jamie [Sangouthai], God bless the dead, turned the drug use up to another level. The ‚Äúdon‚Äôt give a f‚Äìk‚Äù place. I was in a very dark place and very confrontational. I wasn‚Äôt trying to repair my marriage; I was just trying to get high. My life was all about drugs at that point. It probably helped the end of my career come along a little faster because drugs killed my drive to want to train and be in shape. It killed that and my sex drive. The only time you can f‚Äìk is when you take coke.  Tell Us about the night you ended up at the brothel.  I was home by myself. Bored. I wanted to get out and have a good time. Looking back, I might have had a drink to get the mood started, but was I drunk or on drugs? Not at all. I remember lying in bed. Two women were in bed and then I fell asleep. That‚Äôs all. When I woke up four days later, I was trying to pull the tubes out of my mouth.  Surprised Khlo√© was at your side?  Hell, yeah. It was definitely a moment of relief. I didn‚Äôt even know what had just happened. I mean, I‚Äôm a big strong dude who has made it to the highest level of doing what he loves. And now I can‚Äôt walk or talk. She was the first thing I saw. She said, ‚ÄúHi, Mookah.‚Äù ‚ÄúMookah‚Äù is a name my mother used to call me. She said it to let me know I wasn‚Äôt dead. She played a major role in me getting my memory back. She would bring pictures of my mother and my grandmother. I kept thinking, Am I paralyzed forever? Am I mute forever? It was scary shit. Faith got me through.  Did you reconnect romantically?  Honestly, at that time I was just blessed to be around her. I wasn‚Äôt making any more out of it than that. We haven‚Äôt been intimate in years.  When did you realize you needed to enter rehab again?  My daughter gave me the ultimatum to go. She said, ‚ÄúPops, you get help or I won‚Äôt talk to you.‚Äù I think she saw it in my behavior. Coke is a real psychological drug. You can be getting high and feeling great and then on the way down cursing yourself out. So I think it was one of those moments on the way down. This last time I checked into rehab, I was able to stay the whole 30 days and get the most out of it. I learned about addiction and that it‚Äôs a brain disease. The choices we make when our brain is diseased are involuntary. So it was important and life-changing. My kids were really scared that their dad wasn‚Äôt going to be here. It was good bonding time with them when they came to see me. They said, ‚ÄúDad, we want you to be here.‚Äù I was honest with them. There is no reason to lie now. But it was good for them to know it is a disease and one I may pass back to them.  Are you clean now?  Of course. Living sober, meaning no drugs, is a great feeling. Being in the moment is important ‚Äî how you react, respond, create. If I would have done coke last night, you would have gotten some d‚Äìkhead here trying to get out of here fast.

1208d159-e31a-48f9-8f61-6efaccff341a,"Tracee Ellis Ross was one of the brave few to show up on the Met Gala red carpet actually wearing one of Rei Kawakubo's Commes Des Gar√ßons designs , becoming part of an exclusive group that included Rihanna and Caroline Kennedy . The Black-ish actress chose a sculptural blue outfit from CDG's Spring 2016 ""Blue Witch"" collection. While it may not have been as constricting as Helen Lasichanh's arm-encumbering red CDG outfit, the runway piece wasn't exactly designed with practicality in mind, as is the case with much Commes Des Gar√ßons.  Still, as Ross explained last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , she felt it was an honor to wear it. Should it be such a surprise that the daughter of one of pop's greatest fashion risk takers, Diana Ross , would be completely fine with exchanging her full range of arm movement for a once-in-a-lifetime red carpet moment?  Kimmel, of course, is not exactly enamored by the world of fashion and is often bemused at its excesses (see his feud with Kanye West over the idea of leather jogging pants, in particularly). So naturally he had to have Ross walk him through why she chose to wear the look.  Ross explained she was attending as a guest of online retailer Farfetched, which just happens to carry Comme Des Gar√ßons, so she actually got to wear a piece from the label (many other celebs attended as the guests of other fashion labels, and as per tradition and common courtesy, wore their host's creations, and thus explaining why so few celebs seemed to go full-out with the theme).  ""The designer who was the cochair was Comme Des Gar√ßons, Rei Kawakubo. So she's a very avant-garde designer. Very arts meet fashion,"" explained an excited Ross. ""So I got to wear a Commes Des Gar√ßons dress""  ""It was such a big deal in fashion, and it was a huge deal for me,"" continued Ross. ""I feel like my mom taught me about glamour, and growing up I was a big fashion girl. I had magazines and loved that world, and so it was a big deal. It was a very big deal to wear that designer.""  After a picture of Ross in the outfit popped up behind the host, Ross had to convince him for a second that it was actually a big fashion moment, but did admit its particularly drawbacks.  ""As you can tell, there's not a lot of movement I could do in the dress,"" she explained. ""So it was a little bit like...couldn't lift me arms up, couldn't hug people because if I lift my arms up too high the dress would come up.""  Kimmel's take away: he thought about the idea of teaming up with Kawakubo to get celebrities to wear the most ridiculous things possible in the name of fashion.  ""I'm going to contact Rei, and Rei and I are going to work out a scheme where we come up with the most ridiculous things and try to get famous people to wear them.  ""I'm going to put somebody in a big Sprite bottle.""  Actually, dressing someone in a Sprite bottle sounds more like Jeremy Scott for Moschino than Rei Kawakubo to us, but point taken.

9680bd64-c5ab-4ddb-b1b8-2ed2d48d0a84,"(CNN) Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.  The reality star appeared in court Monday morning with her attorneys as she sought to stop what she alleges is cyber-bullying by Kardashian.  Kardashian posted personal information last week about his relationship with Chyna on his Instagram account, including sexually explicit images of his former fianc√©e whom he accused of cheating on him and using him for his fortune.  Outside of court, Chyna's attorney Lisa Bloom said they were granted everything they sought in their petition.  ""As we have said all along, revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,"" Bloom said. ""It is also a crime in California and 38 other states.""  Attorney Robert Shapiro represented Kardashian, who did not appear in court.  Shapiro said his client stipulated to the restraining order and agreed to follow all the conditions.  The attorney said Kardashian's concern now ""is the health and welfare of the baby and both parents are going to work toward that goal.""  ""I, personally, on Mr. Kardahsian's behalf apologized and offered our regrets as to what happened in the past couple of days,"" Shapiro said. ""Now we move forward to do one thing and one thing only, what ever is in the best interest of the child.""  Chyna echoed that sentiment in a brief statement she made after the hearing.  ""I'm just going to get back to co-parenting Dream,"" she said.  In the petition, Chyna, whose legal name is Angela White, alleged that Kardashian swore at her in front of her 4-year-old son, King, and got angered when she attempted to call King's father during an argument back in April.  ""Rob immediately grabbed my phone and pushed me to the ground by aggressively shoving me by the side of my arm and hitting me on the side,"" the declaration read. ""I fell down from the blow to my side. I was sore and it hurt to walk.""  The next hearing in the case has been set for August 8.  Earlier the model and entrepreneur appeared on ""Good Morning America"" with Bloom in an interview which aired Monday morning before the hearing.  Chyna told ""GMA"" she was ""devastated"" by Kardashian's actions.  ""Like, this is a person I trusted,"" she said. ""I just felt...betrayed.""  She denied claims she engaged with the photos by liking some of the images her ex posted, saying she has Kardashian blocked on Instagram.  She said she decided to pursue legal action after speaking with her former love with whom she shares an eight-month-old daughter, Dream.  ""The moral of the story is he doesn't respect me,"" said Chyna, whose real name is Angela White. ""If you can't respect me, you have to respect the law.""  Bloom said on Friday she had filed for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian on behalf of her client.  California has laws regarding ""revenge porn"" in which a person can be charged for publicly releasing unauthorized nude images of another person to cause them emotional distress.  The former couple has had a tumultuous relationship that's been documented on both social media and their E! reality series ""Rob & Chyna.""  Things were also complicated by the fact Chyna shares a son with rapper Tyga, who left her to begin dating Kardashian's younger sister, Kylie Jenner.  On Monday's ""GMA"" appearance, Bloom defended Chyna against those who say the reality star already exposes a great deal of herself in her own social media postings.  ""Any explicit photos that she may have chosen to post in the past that's her choice,"" Bloom said. ""This is like saying that a woman can't be raped if she previously chose to have sex with someone. It's her body, it's her choice,each and every time.""  Chyna said she and Kardashian split in December and there is absolutely no hope of a reconciliation. She said she has not heard from any of his family members since Kardashian's social media postings last Wednesday.  Chyna addressed speculation that she got pregnant as a revenge ploy against the Kardashians or to get money out of the reality mogul family, Chyna denied it.  ""I was already Blac Chyna before the Kardsahians,"" she said.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,833

There's one thing Hollywood couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt liked to collect during their now-defunct decade long relationship. And no, it wasn't children.  It was houses. They currently own one for each child (six), with a spare for guests or their shoes or whatever you need a seventh home for.  The couple brought significant assets to the union and have only added more, including a charity which was responsible for helping rebuild in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, giving them a combined net worth of about US$400 million (NZ$547m).  Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in happier times.  So now that their love is kaput, who gets which palatial abode? Who'll take over the foundation?

Brad lived there with Jennifer Aniston during their marriage - but will he give it up for Angelina Jolie and the kids?  The Jolie-Pitts have seven houses in various spots around the world, but the family home is a sprawling Craftsman style home in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, that Brad Pitt had previously lived in with jilted ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston.  While his prior ownership of the home might suggest Pitt will keep the home in this divorce too, it's been extensively remodelled for the kids and now includes a huge swimming pool, park land, and an area for dirtbike-riding ‚Äì something his son Maddox enjoys.  Maybe Angie will want to keep things as normal as possible for her brood in the Los Feliz house, or perhaps she'll want to ship them out to France ‚Äì her ancestral and spiritual home ‚Äì where the couple owns the frankly enormous Chateau Miraval.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval, the US$60m estate which is owned by actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Costing about US$60m and boasting a 30-acre vineyard (famous for a rose called ""Pink Floyd"") and 35 bedrooms (just how many kids did these guys want?), Pitt and Jolie were married in the chateau's chapel in August, 2014.  So, maybe it won't be high on Jolie's list of places to lie low until the news cycle has rolled over them. Perhaps the beach then if it's privacy the divorcees are after?  That's doable, since the pair have what passes for a bach in Hollywood up the coast in Santa Barbara. It comes with 11 acres of land around it and a private beach in front of it, for max seclusion.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval.  Pitt bought it in 2000 for US$4m, in recent years the family has used it mainly as a holiday home. But maybe he'll head up there to lick his wounds?  Pitt's also the reluctant owner of a villa in New Orleans that he's been trying to offload since 2015.  The pair bought the five-bed-five-bath home to live in while Pitt was in Nola filming The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It's on the market now for the bargain basement price of US$5.5m.  Ray Tamarra Brad Pitt greets a friend from his New Orleans balcony on May 17, 2014 in New Orleans.  Then there's also Jolie's Laurel Canyon home, and an apartment in New York's Waldorf Astoria building.    THE FOUNDATION  The pair started the Jolie-Pitt Foundation together in 2006. However it seems most likely to be Jolie who'll take over the running of the charity.  The Foundation has donated to various causes including the Hurricane Katrina and Joplin tornado rebuilds; children's health centres in Ethiopia and Cambodia; the Na'an ku se Foundation in Namibia; GlobaL Action for Children; the HALO Trust and Doctors Without Borders.  But it's Jolie who puts her money (and her time) where her mouth is most often as a UN Goodwill ambassador, Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award winner and vocal crusader for children and women.    THE FILM COMPANY  Plan B Entertainment was the brainchild of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, that Brad took custody of in the divorce.  To date, it's been responsible for a huge range of films, from gritty horror World War Z to Oscar-winning marvels Selma and 12 Years a Slave.  Pitt is the sole owner of the company, but could Jolie angle for a piece of that cinematic pie in the settlement?    THE DOG  Jacques must be getting on in years. While he was often papped out and about with the Jolie Pitt kids, he's not been spotted out a lot lately.  But if the baggy-faced mutt is still kicking round, this picture of Jacques with Brad from 2012 should clear up who the old growler belongs to.  - Stuff",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1028

He added: ‚ÄúJust out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.‚Äù  There was no additional information provided to substantiate the president‚Äôs claims that Obama had ‚Äúwire tapped‚Äù Trump Tower, and it was not clear on what information Trump was basing the allegations.  There has been no response to the tweets from Obama.  The Trump administration has been on the back foot over its contacts with Russian officials before the president took office in January.  Last month Michael Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser over conversations with the Russian ambassador to Washington and misleading statements about them to the press and the vice-president, Mike Pence.  This week it was revealed that Sessions had two meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, last year twhich he failed to disclose to senators during his confirmation hearing.  Sessions said on Friday that he would recuse himself from investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election despite backing from Trump, who described the controversy as ‚Äúa total witch hunt‚Äù.  Trump‚Äôs tweets follow claims made by the conservative radio host Mark Levin on his Thursday night show about the alleged steps taken by the Obama administration to undermine the Republican candidate‚Äôs campaign to win the White House.    Donald Trump accuses Obama of orchestrating protests against him Read more  The presenter called the effort a ‚Äúsilent coup‚Äù by the Obama administration and called for a congressional investigation into the issue. That contrasts with demands from across the US political spectrum to examine Russian interference in the presidential election.  Levin‚Äôs comments were followed up by Breitbart News, the ‚Äúalt-right‚Äù website formerly run by Steve Bannon, who ran the Trump campaign and is now the president‚Äôs chief strategist.    The article stated: ‚ÄúThe Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorisation to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the NSA [National Security Agency] rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media.‚Äù    The Breitbart story references recent claims that the FBI had asked the foreign intelligence surveillance court for a warrant last year to monitor members of the Trump team suspected of being in contact with Russian officials. The request for the warrant was initially rejected before being granted in October, the reports have said.  Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, said: ‚ÄúI am very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally. I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about the Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. It‚Äôs my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this ‚Äì I promise you I will.‚Äù  The Democratic congressman Seth Moulton, a member of the House armed services and budget committees, told the MSNBC channel: ‚ÄúThis is right out of Donald Trump‚Äôs reality TV playbook. He‚Äôs trying to distract attention from the real story here, which is his campaign, his administration‚Äôs contact with Russian officials ... There‚Äôs clearly a deeper story here and we the American people need to know how high this conspiracy goes.‚Äù  Moulton added: ‚ÄúObviously contacts with Russian intelligence officials are monitored ‚Äì that‚Äôs part of maintaining our national security. So if under the Obama administration they were simply monitoring contacts with Russian officials ‚Äì not trying to wiretap into the Trump campaign but simply looking at who Russian officials were talking with ‚Äì and then Trump campaign officials got ensnared in that net, then it‚Äôs a total mischaracterisation to say President Obama was wiretapping Trump.‚Äù  Rep Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who is a member of the House intelligence committee, told Fox News that Trump ‚Äúis not credible when it comes to talking about Russia‚Äù.  Swalwell downplayed Trump‚Äôs allegations. ‚ÄúI think this is just the president up early doing his routine tweeting, he said. ‚ÄúPresidents don‚Äôt wiretap anyone. These are pursued by the Department of Justice in accordance with the FBI and signed off by a judge.‚Äù",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1188

Now, Will and Kate Middleton have announced what the baby boy‚Äôs name is.  The royal baby name is Louis Arthur Charles, Kensington Palace announced on Twitter Friday. His royal title will be His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.  While the royal baby name odds on Louis were 33/1 could make it appear to be a surprising choice, the names Louis, Arthur and Charles have significance within the royal family. Louis was the name of Prince Phillip‚Äôs grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, as well as Prince Charles‚Äô great-uncle Earl Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. Louis is also a middle name for both Prince William and Prince George.  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son. Kirsty O'Connor - PA Images‚ÄîPA Images via Getty Images  As for Prince Louis‚Äô middle names, Arthur was a middle name of Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs late father King George VI and is a middle name to both William and Prince Charles. Arthur of course also brings to mind King Arthur (though experts say there‚Äôs no evidence of any actual historical king behind the famous Arthurian legends).  Prince Louis shares his third name, Charles, with his grandfather, Prince Charles.  Louis Arthur Charles is the third child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who welcomed a son, Prince George, in 2013 and a daughter, Princess Charlotte, in 2015.  Ahead of Louis Arthur Charles‚Äôs birth, the couple announced via the official Kensington Palace Twitter account that Middleton was expecting in September 2017, but opted not to reveal the baby‚Äôs gender (something they had done with their previous two children) ahead of the birth.

ebfc3e98-d05f-4b25-a2d8-ee04828153d1,"The Voice features a rotating group of celebrity coaches mentoring up-and-coming talent. Gwen Stefani has played a big part in the show, coaching three seasons: Season 7, Season 9, and most recently Season 12. Her presence on The Voice extends beyond just coaching though. She's performed solo, mentored, and even did a duet with her boyfriend and fellow coach Blake Shelton. So, suffice to say, fans were surprised to hear she wouldn't be returning for Season 13, despite her popularity on the program. So, why isn't Gwen Stefani coaching The Voice Season 13? (Bustle reached out to NBC and Stefani's rep for comment, but has not yet received a response.)  This isn't Stefani's first time stepping away from her red spinning chair; she took a hiatus after Season 9, only to return for Season 12. At the time she took the break, Stefani told Extra she wanted to focus on her career. The Season 9-12 timeout had a clear purpose to it, she wanted to focus on making music and performing. Stefani's reasons for leaving this time are a little less defined, although the multi-night live show is a big commitment for already busy stars.  Minus Stefani, the coaches for Season 13 are Shelton, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus, and Jennifer Hudson. And, for now, Stefani is keeping busy with music and performances. Stefani is releasing a Christmas duet with Shelton Oct. 6 and is promoting the jingle on her Instagram.  Stefani's love for Shelton is as strong as ever, even without The Voice, and she's been promoting his upcoming album on her social media. In February of 2017, Stefani went on Late Night With Seth Meyers and talked about their musical and romantic unity saying, ""It's so unbelievable ... I love Blake, he's just the most incredible guy. Like, everybody loves Blake ... he's just a sparkly, happy, amazing person.""  According to Stefani's social media, she's also continued to perform her music around the world. She posted the below Instagram on Sept. 15, preforming her classic hit ""Hollaback Girl"" in Korea. She's a seasoned performer and any time not spent coaching on The Voice will likely be spent doing concerts at home and abroad. While The Voice platform is large, the coaches are all successful outside the show as well.  And, maybe Stefani will return for a future season. It's not like she'll stop being involved with The Voice since Shelton remains a coach. Hopefully the opportunity to coach new talent, the fun she seems to have on the program, and the fans will draw her back in at a future time ‚Äî it's happened before when she left after Season 9 but came back for 12. And, ET reported in May of 2017 that Stefani would love to return to The Voice, but that her future on the show was uncertain. ""I don't have any plans to come back,"" she told the outlet. ""I love being here; I'd love to come back. We'll see what happens next.""  The new season of The Voice airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on NBC. New coaches Cyrus and Hudson should inject a new energy into the program, which will be anchored by longtime coaches Shelton and Levine.

The album title comes from the name of a city in Alabama about 25 minutes south of Birmingham. Sam played football at the University of Alabama at Birmingham before moving to Nashville. Once he got to Music City, Sam ended up dating a girl who lived down in Montevallo. Though that relationship is now over, that girl is the main inspiration for the songs Sam wrote and recorded for his debut project.  He tells ABC News Radio, ""I spent a lot of time talking to her about songs. I probably should have included her as a co-writer on a lot of these songs because I spent a lot of time chatting with her.""  Spending so much time with that girl made Sam tap into a vulnerable side of himself he hadn't been able to display on the football field.  ""I got a lot of insight into females in general from being in a close relationship with her,"" Sam says. ""I used a lot of that when writing on the songs, because a lot of the songs are relationship-based. I didn't want it to be just extra-macho.""  While Sam shows his sensitive side on songs like ""Break Up in a Small Town"" and ""Take Your Time,"" he also comes off as a very confident guy on other tracks such as ""House Party,"" ""Speakers"" and ""Leave the Night On.""  Sam explains, ""You know, I think there is a side of me personally that can be vulnerable, and there's also a side that can be the opposite of that.""  He adds, ""I think it takes a strength to be vulnerable, so it is a weird paradox there that I think sort of happens on the album.""  Look for Sam to perform a song from Montevallo on ABC's Good Morning America on Tuesday and Live with Kelly & Michael on Thursday.

4eee056d-a094-4235-85bb-4ca0421980c6,"Johnny Depp. Getty Many entertainment stars love the finer things in life, but it seems even the earnings of an A-lister like Johnny Depp couldn't sustain his wild indulgences.  The ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" star is currently in a public-relations tailspin after his messy divorce with actress Amber Heard, who alleged he had abused her, and his filing a $25 million lawsuit against his former business managers at The Management Group. (TMG has countersued.)  Things didn't get any better for Depp on Wednesday when The Hollywood Reporter published a feature that went deeper into Depp's financial woes.  TMG's Joel Mandel claims that even though Depp has earned more than $650 million in the more than 13 years the company represented the star, Depp didn't have enough cash to cover his $2 million in bills each month.  Depp's extravagant spending habits reportedly include $3.6 million annually for his 40-person staff, $350,000 monthly for maintaining his 156-foot yacht, $30,000 monthly for wine, and $5 million the star says he spent to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.  TMG says it met with Depp numerous times over the years to try to get Depp to sell some of his expensive items. On one occasion, he agreed to sell his $10 million yacht that he spent $8 million to renovate, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Another year, TMG almost got Depp to sell his French chateau ‚Äî on which he spent $10 million to renovate ‚Äî but he got cold feet after prospective buyers came calling, according to the former business managers, and it has since been relisted for $39 million.  Johnny Depp will be seen next in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,"" out May 26. Disney Depp has routinely earned $20 million up-front paychecks for the movies he's been in since the success of 2003's ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."" He also gets 20% of the backend per picture, according to The Hollywood Reporter ‚Äî a source said that was $40 million from the backend of each ""Pirates"" movie and $55 million from his profit on the 2010 hit ""Alice in Wonderland,"" which earned over $1 billion worldwide.  TMG attorney Michael Kump said in the lawsuit that TMG stepped in to help Depp avert a ""devastating financial collapse."" Depp has claimed he was kept in the dark about his finances.  It's unclear how cash-strapped Depp is. According to litigation, he has received $25.7 million over the past two years in profits from six movies, and he earned up-front money ‚Äî likely close to $20 million each ‚Äî from ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"" ""LAbyrinth,"" and ""Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes.""

32566f5a-876c-4f8e-8378-19774a0bef9b,"For the most part, we've heard a lot about how protective Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan was over his costar Dakota Johnson on set, how much BDSM research was done to get those scenes just right, and so on. But far more scandalous set secrets are coming to light about the film, and, frankly, we're a little worried.  According to reports from Star, which we admittedly take with a grain of salt, life wasn't so honky dory on the highly publicized Fifty Shades movie set.  More from The Stir: Quiz: What's Your '50 Shades of Grey' Movie-Viewing Style?  For starters, the tabloid alleges Jamie was perpetually ill-prepared for scenes, never having memorized his lines. This resulted in cast and crew working overtime into the wee hours of the morning.  Then there's the matter of Dakota, who reportedly acted very un-Anastasia-like by causing friction between crew members and throwing diva tantrums over wardrobe (in one instance going so far as to throw a pair of shoes at a stylist).  So was anyone professional on set? That award is said to go to Eloise Mumford, who plays Anastasia's roommate Kate. She was responsible for cracking jokes with crew members and keeping things light on set.  We were already privy to the fact that director Sam Taylor-Johnson and author EL James didn't get along on set, like at all, but at least their creative differences have the potential to make the Fifty Shades sex scenes smokin' hot.  More from The Stir: 50 Shades Extended Sneak Peek Will Send Shivers Down Your Spine  With what sounds like a lot of crankiness and drama on set, can this cast even be trusted with a sequel? A forgetful leading man and thankless leading lady are not exactly a recipe for success. And if this is the way they acted before the first film has even been released, how much worse can their antics be on the set of a second film when the franchise has been proven a big-screen success?  The right amount of money tends to solve problems in Hollywood, but it certainly can't help make parts two and three the happiest movie sets in the history of the business.

2b19e8ce-d8c3-4802-9bd9-ac10dcf7e449,"Donald Trump and Time magazine dispute Person of the Year plans  Updated  Donald Trump's long and complicated relationship with Time magazine has taken another twist.  The US President has tweeted that he was the frontrunner to be named its Person of the Year again this year after taking out the gong in 2016.  A short time later the magazine rejected Mr Trump's assertion, saying: ""The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. Time does not comment on our choice until publication.""  Securing the magazine's title ‚Äî which was launched in 1927 ‚Äî has long been a preoccupation of Mr Trump's.  In June the magazine asked Mr Trump to take down framed copies of a fake March 2009 Time cover featuring Mr Trump that had been prominently displayed in at least five of the President's golf clubs.  The photoshopped image featured Mr Trump alongside a headline claiming his Apprentice reality TV series was a ""television smash"".  The cover also said: ""Trump is hitting on all fronts ‚Ä¶ even TV.""  The counterfeit cover also had several other ""telling mistakes"", including a skinnier red border, no white border and an issue with the placement of the secondary headlines.  As his campaign for the presidency picked up steam in late 2015, the then New York businessman was hopeful of being featured on the cover as Person of the Year.  He even sat for a photo shoot with a bald eagle.  It wasn't to be, though, with the billionaire missing out to German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  Mr Trump was less than impressed.  In the following months the magazine was critical of his presidential campaign, featuring caricatures of him on the front describing his bid as being in ""meltdown"".  Despite their criticism, he was finally named Person of the Year in 2016, a month after securing the presidency.  He said it was a ""great honour"" which ""meant a lot"". But that didn't stop him again going on the attack a few days later.  ""I was lucky enough to receive the Time Person of the Year,"" Mr Trump told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, on his Thank You victory tour.  ""They used to call it 'Man of the Year,' but they can't do that anymore, so they call it 'person'. They want to be politically correct. That's OK.""  There were also suggestions on social media that the cover featuring Mr Trump was designed in a way that made it seem he had ""devil horns"" with the placement of the letter ""M"" in the magazine's name directly behind his head.  Time magazine denied this and posted a gallery on their website of past covers that also appeared to give their subjects horns.  After a year of headlines, the naming of Mr Trump as Person of the Year for a second time, as he has claimed, may not come as a surprise to many.  But former Time editor Richard Stengel was sceptical and tweeted that the photo and interview request does not mean Mr Trump was likely to take out the title for the second year in a row.  Either way, Mr Trump's claim that he was ""PROBABLY"" going to take out the title when it's announced on December 6 has predictably been a source of mirth on social media.

She has high anxiety wondering if this will go on forever.‚Äù  Despite her public woes, the 37-year-old has received support from her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II.  ‚ÄúWhat may surprise some is just how supportive Her Majesty has been during the problems Meghan has faced with her family,‚Äù claimed a Buckingham Palace insider. ‚ÄúMeghan is in a tough place, and the queen knows it‚Äôs completely out of Meghan‚Äôs hands.

He told the publication that he had a ‚Äúreal conversation‚Äù with his wife following the controversial appearance he gave on TMZ Live. ‚ÄúThere was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, ‚ÄòWas Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?‚Äô‚Äù he said.

46a764ca-2eff-48be-8256-32dd761520a7,"She was one of many stars who attended the super glitzy Versace pre-fall runway show in New York earlier this month.  And proving just how much fun she had Kim Kardashian shared a collection of behind the scenes photos from the evening on Monday.  The 38-year-old reality star, dressed in a sparkly pink mini dress appeared to get up to mischief with her husband Kanye West, 41.  Giddy: Kim Kardashian has shared a collection of photos from the behind the scenes at the Versace Pre Fall 19 Fashion Show on December 3  The duo looked like giggling teenagers as they ran down a hallway holding hands in one of the images.  In another the mother-of-three poked her tongue out as she flashed a cheeky look over her shoulder at the camera.  Kim dazzled in a sparkling pink mini dress which showed off her cleavage and some Yeezy PVC heels.  Kim and Kanye were also pictured with 2 Chainz and wife Kesha Ward as well as LaLa Anthony as they all hung out in a hotel room before the fashion show.  Cheeky: The 38-year-old reality star showed off her curves in a sparkling pink mini dress  Flawless: Kim's glam team worked hard to create her look for the star-studded show  Meanwhile Kim has revealed she thinks that husband Kanye can't be 'suppressed'.  The reality star - who has kids North, five, Saint, three, and ten-month-old Chicago with Kanye - opened up to the Keeping Up with the Kardashians cameras about Kanye's emotion-filled rants in light of his controversial remarks to TMZ earlier this year.  Speaking after Kanye's much-discussed interview, in which he described slavery as a 'choice', Kim explained: 'When he gets ramped up, he can't control what he says - he can't let it go.  Sitting pretty: Kim sat in-between 2 Chainz' wife Kesha Ward and pal Lala Anthony  'He loves being ramped up. He's like, ""I feel powerful when I'm ramped up. I don't want to be so suppressed. Yeah, I say crazy s**t, but I've always said crazy s**t. That's why I'm Kanye.""'  Kim also tried to, inaccurately, clarify Kanye's slavery remarks, insisting he'd been misunderstood.  She said: 'He didn't say slavery is a choice, he was saying, ""If you're going to still be enslaved for another 400 years, then that's some bulls**t.""'  The reality star showed off her long legs in some PVC $50 Yeezy heels  However, that is not correct, as in the interview with TMZ, Kanye said: 'When you hear about slavery for 400 years ... for 400 years? That sounds like a choice.'  However, the Famous hitmaker - whose remarks prompted widespread outrage within the hip-hop community - subsequently took to Twitter in an attempt to clarify what he'd meant.  He wrote on the micro-blogging platform: 'To make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will.  'My point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved. (sic)'  Just chilling: The duo hung out in their hotel room with pal 2 Chainz",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,617

041f4a95-273a-42c6-8678-b4b9719a0c99,"A rumor spread among Netflix bingers and royal watchers earlier this year that Queen Elizabeth was, herself, a fan of the award-winning series The Crown depicting her first years at the head of the monarchy. According to those reports, in fact, the Queen enjoyed the series though clucked her tongue, predictably at some of the ‚Äúheavily dramatized‚Äù historical liberties. The Crown star Claire Foy didn‚Äôt trust the rumors, telling Vanity Fair: ‚ÄúI will believe it when I see it is all I‚Äôll say.‚Äù Well perhaps after this year‚Äôs Christmas speech in which the Queen appears to have included a cute little nod to Season 2, Foy will believe she has a royal fan.  In the fifth episode of the most recent season of The Crown, Foy‚Äôs version of The Queen gives a disastrous and stiff speech to workers at a car factory. At the time and as depicted in the episode, royal critic Lord Altrincham suggested one solution to the Queen‚Äôs communication difficulties was to televise her annual Christmas message‚Äîwhich she has done ever since. In this year‚Äôs speech, many suspect, the Queen paid direct homage to that Season 2 plot.  The Queen opened by saying: ‚ÄúSixty years ago today, a young woman spoke about the speed of technological change as she presented the first television broadcast of its kind. She described the moment as a landmark. Six decades on, the presenter has ‚Äòevolved‚Äô somewhat, as has the technology she described.‚Äù Don‚Äôt let the third person fool you, the Queen is talking of herself here, and of a moment Foy embodied beautifully for Netflix.  Now it‚Äôs entirely possible that someone else‚Äîsavvy to the show‚Äîslipped that reference in on the Queen‚Äôs behalf. But whether authored by Elizabeth herself or someone close to her, the acknowledgment of The Crown was a hit with audiences.  Lord Altrincham himself couldn‚Äôt have come up with a better way to humanize the Queen than to out her as a fellow binge watcher. Before Season 1 aired, Claire Foy admitted she was in denial that the Queen might ever watch her performance. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got other things to do with her time,‚Äù Foy said and then, contemplating royal disapproval, added: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll get put in The Tower for treason.‚Äù  But Foy has since adopted a less fearful attitude, telling Vanity Fair: ‚ÄúI would be very interested to see what she thinks about historical elements of it. . .the personal level of it, and seeing someone else act out your life, and act out your most painful moments of grief, or happiness, or fear, or triumph, or whatever, I don‚Äôt think would be a very enjoyable thing, which is why I doubt very much that she‚Äôs watched it.‚Äù  But whether or not the Queen is a fan of Foy or her performance, Foy is an unabashed fan of the Queen. Thanking her directly during a SAG acceptance speech earlier this year, Foy said: ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been at the center of the world.

e69c85e3-db73-4f44-b7b2-eb1c8e9876e2,"Mother is the story of a couple's relationship that is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence. From filmmaker Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream), Mother! stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer in this riveting psychological thriller about love, devotion and sacrifice. (2017)  OSCAR-WINNING actress Jennifer Lawrence has suggested the devastating hurricanes in Texas and approaching Florida were signs of ‚ÄúMother Nature‚Äôs rage and wrath‚Äù at America for electing Donald Trump and not believing in man-made climate change.  Lawrence, who is promoting her new drama Mother!, appeared on British network Channel 4, where she discussed topics ranging from the movie to the gender pay gap and Mr Trump.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs scary,‚Äù the actress responded to the interviewer‚Äôs assertion that there was ‚Äúan end-of-days feeling‚Äù across the world and especially in the US.  ‚ÄúYou know, it‚Äôs this new language that‚Äôs forming. I don‚Äôt even recognise it. It‚Äôs also scary to know that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting.‚Äù  ‚ÄúAnd you have voted very recently, as a country‚Äù the reporter noted ‚Äì to which Lawrence replied that ‚Äúit was really startling‚Äù Mr Trump was elected.  She then suggested the recent hurricanes devastating Texas and nearing Florida may have been prompted by Mr Trump winning the presidency.  ‚ÄúYou know, you‚Äôre watching these hurricanes now, and it‚Äôs really hard, especially while promoting this movie, not to feel Mother Nature‚Äôs rage and wrath,‚Äù Lawrence said.  Lawrence later said the conversation topics of Mr Trump and US politics were ‚Äúreally polarising and upsetting.‚Äù  ‚ÄúYou know, I‚Äôve heard things and seen things on TV in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it‚Äôs just really confusing,‚Äù she said.  After being asked whether she finds Mr Trump confusing, the actress fired back, saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is.‚Äù  Lawrence has never been shy about sharing her opinions on the President.  In 2015, when Trump had just launched his presidential campaign, she said a victory by him would ‚Äúbe the end of the world,‚Äù during an Entertainment Weekly interview.

cc9a0213-dd80-4997-87a3-ea839fc5b43a,"Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied  Chuck stars Zachary Levi and Yvonne Strahovski are reuniting for an episode of the Disney Channel's Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. The series is a spinoff of the 2010 animated film, Tangled, starring Levi and Mandy Moore.  Action comedy series Chuck aired on NBC from 2007 to 2012. The series starred Levi as Chuck Bartowski, a nerd who has all of the government's secrets downloaded into his brain. Assigned to protect Chuck is the beautiful but deadly CIA agent Sarah Walker (Strahovksi). Chuck and Sarah have to work together to foil terrorist plots, defeat enemy spies, and diffuse bombs. Though the two adopt a fake relationship as part of their cover, the pair eventually become a couple in season 3 and marry in the season 4 finale. Due to low ratings, the show faced threats of cancellation with each season, but with the help of a devoted fan base, the series was able to last for five seasons.  As reported by E! Online, The two leads of Chuck will reunite on TV for the first time in six years for the season 2 premiere of Disney's animated series, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure. The series features Levi in the lead role of Eugene/Flynn Rider, the character he voiced in the Tangled movie. Strahovski will guest star in the season 2 premiere as Eugene's ex-fianc√©e, Stalyan. Like their Chuck characters, Eugene and Stalyan have a deep romantic history and were once a great team. In a clip for E! Online, Levi and Strahovksi discuss their characters and talk about working together again - see the clip on E! Online's site.  Disney's computer-animated musical adventure film, Tangled was a love story between Levi's character, Flynn Rider, and Moore's Rapunzel. Nominated for several awards, Tangled was considered a critical and commercial success. In 2017, the story was brought back in the form of a TV movie on the Disney Channel, Tangled Ever After, which evolved into Tangled: The Series, with the two lead roles reprised by Levi and Moore. After its first season, the show was retitled Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure.  Even though Chuck's series finale was able to wrap up loose ends and give the characters a proper send-off, Levi has been working on reviving the series as a film. Whether this happens or not, Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure will finally reunite Levi and Strahovksi, which could be fun for fans of Chuck.  Season 2 of Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure premieres Sunday at 7:45 PM ET on the Disney Channel.  Source: E!

Despite being romantically linked since last May, they've only been spotted out and about together a handful of times.  While the lovebirds enjoyed the quiet, romantic holiday in relative privacy, fans of the pop icon were left wondering if this marked the end of Swift's Fourth of July party tradition.  For years now, the singer and her squad of besties -- which included super models, singers, actress and social media stars -- all gathered at Swift's Rhode Island estate for FOMO-inducing festivities that included barbecues, fireworks, patriotic inflatable bouncy houses and more.  However, amid her prolonged break from the public eye in the months before Reputation's release in November -- as well as her highly publicized feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and taking heat for not being as vocal against President Donald Trump as some fans would have liked -- Swift also skipped last year's Fourth of July celebration.  As some fans have suggested, it's possible Swift -- like many celebrities -- simply hasn't felt like celebrating the patriotic holiday. Or maybe its because she has been gearing up for and then subsequently performing in her massive Reputation Stadium Tour, and simply hasn't had time or energy to throw together a massive party. Only Swift herself can answer those questions.  For more on Swift's epic Fourth of July celebrations of years' past, check out the video below.

4205a9c0-c3b0-4c64-b960-ed0de24d3535,"Postby Guest ¬ª Sat Jul 07, 2018 5:10 am  Brad Pitt is on the verge of relapsing because Neri Oxman dumped him, according to a completely wrong tabloid story. Gossip Cop can debunk this report. Pitt is committed to his sobriety, and was never dating Oxman in the first place.    But the Globe wants readers to believe Pitt has ‚Äúsuffered a painful blow to the heart‚Äù after Oxman ‚Äújilted him for a billionaire.‚Äù The magazine contends that ‚Äúfriends‚Äù now ‚Äúfear losing at love will send‚Äù the actor into a ‚Äúdestructive abuse binge.‚Äù The narrative was sparked by Oxman being seen with her boyfriend, Bill Ackman, in Paris last month.    ‚ÄúBrad still thought things would work out with Neri. So it was a shock when he saw she‚Äôs back with Bill,‚Äù a so-called ‚Äúsource‚Äù is quoted as saying. Maintains the outlet, ‚ÄúNow sources worry the Allied star could fall off the wagon‚Ä¶ Insiders worry the stress of romantic disappointment and his custody war [with Angelina Jolie] could trigger an issue.‚Äù Of course, none of these untraceable ‚Äúsources‚Äù or ‚Äúinsiders‚Äù are named.    Gossip Cop can‚Äôt help but wonder if they‚Äôre the same ones that led this publication to falsely allege last month that Pitt and Jolie were ‚Äúcalling off‚Äù their divorce. The tabloid even went as far as claiming they were ‚Äúhot again‚Äù after a ‚Äústeamy, clothes-ripping reconciliation,‚Äù and that they‚Äôd have a ‚Äúsecond commitment ceremony.‚Äù Notably, nothing is said about any of that in this new tale about Pitt‚Äôs supposed heartbreak from Oxman.    The stories aren‚Äôt just inconsistent; they‚Äôre also plain wrong. Just as Pitt was never getting back together with Jolie in June, he was never romantically involved with Oxman. As Page Six rightly reported back in April, Pitt and the MIT professor have shared a friendship and nothing more.    Confirms his spokesperson to Gossip Cop, ‚ÄúThey were only friends.‚Äù And Oxman was dating Ackman all along. So the premise that Pitt has been ‚Äújilted‚Äù is entirely untrue. As for his love life affecting his well-being, ‚ÄúEntertainment Tonight‚Äù reported just last week that Pitt has chosen to focus on fatherhood, not dating. It was specifically noted, ‚ÄúHe spent over a year learning to live a healthier lifestyle and he feels better than ever.‚Äù    Conclusion: After wrongly claiming Pitt reunited with Jolie in June, the tabloid is now contending in July that he‚Äôs been dumped by Oxman. But according to other outlets and Pitt‚Äôs own rep, he and the scholar were never dating. That means this article is based on a false premise. Additionally, while the magazine asserts there‚Äôs concerns Pitt is on the verge of a relapse, it was just reliably reported last week that he is feeling ‚Äúbetter than ever‚Äù and has embraced a ‚Äúhealthier lifestyle.‚Äù It‚Äôs apparent this story is entirely inaccurate.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,570

You won‚Äôt be wrong ‚Äî now. There are no poor answers within reason.  But we put forth our own 16-player bracket two weeks ago and asked fans to decide. The winner? Tennessee‚Äôs Grant Williams, who beat Indiana‚Äôs Juwan Morgan in the final vote.  In his sophomore campaign last season, Williams averaged 15.2 points, 6 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks, earning him SEC Player of the Year honors on a Tennessee team that went 26-9 overall and finished in first place in the conference with a 13-5 record.  Tennessee returns all five starters this season, and all six of its leading scorers, so Williams will have plenty of help as he tries to get Tennessee past the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014.  Sixteen student-athletes qualified for our tournament of preseason player of the year candidates, seeded No. 1 through No. 16, in a four-round, single-elimination format. Voting was conducted on the @MarchMadness Twitter account and Instagram account beginning Monday, Oct. 15. The student-athlete with more fan votes in each matchup advanced to the next round.

3a73494e-8a2b-4bb9-90c0-6b5a34809004,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva  NORRISTOWN, Pa. ‚Äî The fate of Bill Cosby was now once again in the hands of a jury after the dramatic retrial at which the comedian was accused of sexual assault by a half-dozen women.  The jury, which began deliberating Wednesday morning, will decide whether Cosby, 80, is guilty of three counts of aggravated assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, who claims the comedian drugged and sexually assaulted her in his home in January 2004.  Deliberations are to resume Thursday morning. Cosby made no comment as he and his lawyers left court about 9:45 p.m.  Andrew Wyatt, who has served as Cosby's spokesman throughout the trial, told reporters Wednesday night that the lack of a quick verdict led him to believe that jurors ""will find Mr. Cosby not guilty on all charges.""  ""What we are seeing and what we are appreciating is the fair impartiality that they are showing,"" Wyatt said.  Defense attorneys portrayed Constand as lying about the sexual encounter, which Cosby has claimed was consensual, and jurors returned to the courtroom early Wednesday afternoon to ask, ""What is the legal definition of consent?""  Montgomery County Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill said that he couldn't give them a legal definition and that they would have to answer that question on their own, using their ""common sense.""  In this trial, unlike in the first, prosecutors were allowed to call five more accusers in addition to Constand. Prosecutors said that Cosby preyed on Constand and that all the women who testified against him had ""strikingly similar stories.""  O'Neill issued specific instructions regarding the five additional accusers who testified. He told the jurors that they could only use the evidence for a limited purpose ‚Äî to show a common plan, scheme or design or to demonstrate that the defendant didn't make a mistake.  He said the jury couldn't conclude from the five additional accusers that Cosby has ""bad character or criminal tendencies.""  He also gave the jury specific instructions about the testimony of prosecution witness Chelan Lasha, one of the five additional accusers. Defense attorneys attacked her testimony by pointing out that she has a prior conviction for making false statements to police. O'Neill told jurors that they could consider her conviction in deciding whether to believe all or part of her testimony.  The judge also instructed the jury that Constand's testimony alone is enough to convict Cosby.  ""It does not need the support of other evidence,"" he said. He also told the jury that it could convict Cosby based on circumstantial evidence and that it didn't need to determine a specific motive to reach a guilty verdict.  Cosby, sitting next to his defense team, appeared solemn as the judge read the charges.  In two hours of closing arguments, Cosby's defense team painted Constand as a ""con artist"" and a ""pathological liar"" seeking fame and fortune and willing to blackmail Cosby in pursuit of those goals.  Defense attorney Kathleen Bliss suggested that Constand and the other women who testified ""were motivated by a common movement, many of them represented by the same attorney,"" she said, referring to Gloria Allred and her daughter, Lisa Bloom, who is also a lawyer. Bliss emphasized a proposal from Allred for a $100 million settlement fund in 2014.  Tom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, told the jury that the case was about a ""blind 80-year-old man with a successful career facing absolute ruin.""  Mesereau walked the jury through a PowerPoint presentation, pointing to what he characterized as 12 inconsistent statements about the nature of Constand's relationship with Cosby, including whether they had flirted before the alleged assault, whether they were ever alone together and whether she had been in bed with him. He said her statements were not simply ""inconsistencies ... they are lies.""  ""This woman will say anything. She will absolutely say anything. She's a pathological liar,"" he added.  Bliss also questioned the prosecution's decision to bring in witnesses to testify that Cosby assaulted them more than 30 years ago.  ""How unfair is that ‚Äî digging up stuff from three decades ago?"" she asked. She also told the jurors that they shouldn't allow the #MeToo movement, which has exposed scores of men in the media, entertainment and business worlds as sexual harassers, to sway their decision.  ""Don't get me wrong ‚Äî bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,"" Bliss said. ""We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality.  ""But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,"" she added.  But Assistant Montgomery County District Attorney Kristen Feden told jurors that it was Cosby, not Constand, who was the con artist and that the women who testified against him had ""all strikingly similar stories.""  ""He preyed on Andrea Constand the same way he preyed on all those five women,"" she said.  She prosecutor also lambasted Bliss for ""character assassination"" of the accusers.  ""That character assassination that Ms. Bliss put those women through was utterly shameful,"" she said. ""She's the exact reason why women, victims of sexual assault and men don't report these crimes.""  While there have been dozens of sexual misconduct allegations against Cosby, the Constand case is the only complaint that has resulted in criminal charges. Cosby has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, which have ranged from groping to sexual assault to rape, with many of the accusers claiming that he drugged them.  Cosby's first trial last year ended in a deadlocked jury, so his retrial has become the first big celebrity court case since the #MeToo movement emerged. In the first trial, the jury deliberated for 52 hours and failed to reach a verdict, resulting in a mistrial.  Cosby declined to testify at both trials. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count.  Meredith Mandell and Adam Reiss reported from Norristown.

1ae88da5-a88b-46fe-8860-2bd0b7e5c98e,"Wednesday afternoon, Olympic gold medalist and gymnastics phenom Simone Biles tweeted this:  there is a gavin meme for everything ‚Äî Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 10, 2016  Ah, yes, Gavin. The guy we all know and love. Gavin!  Still confused? Biles‚Äôs teammate Laurie Hernandez replied with a reaction meme featuring Gavin.  when you win a gold medal at the Olympics: pic.twitter.com/tyhs9gD0ya ‚Äî Laurie Hernandez (@LaurieHernandez) August 10, 2016  There he is! Gavin.  At a time when the eyes of the world are upon Biles and Hernandez performing miraculous athletic feats, the eyes of Biles and Hernandez are on some kid named Gavin.  Well, ‚Äúsome kid‚Äù is underselling it: Gavin is the 5-year-old nephew of Vine star Nick Mastodon, a 30-year-old from Minnesota who was one of Vine‚Äôs earliest stars thanks to his videos combining Disney movies with Top 40 hits. In November of 2013, he made the viral ‚ÄúSuck a Dick‚Äù vine (22 million loops and counting) with his friend Dustin Hatzenbuhler.  ‚ÄúNot the most family-friendly thing we‚Äôve ever made,‚Äù Mastodon admitted when I spoke to him on the phone, ‚Äúbut most people seem to enjoy it. And throughout that time in 2013, I started putting my nephew Gavin, who was 2 at the time ‚Äî he would appear in my videos. And people thought he was cute, but they didn‚Äôt really take notice of him a whole lot.‚Äù  In the spring of 2014, Mastodon posted an innocuous video of Gavin with a crested gecko on his forehead. He wasn‚Äôt expecting much of a response, but it blew up.  ‚ÄúPeople started to comment about his reaction and how great it was,‚Äù he recalls. ‚ÄúAnd I was like, Let‚Äôs find other ways to capture him in funny situations and see if he can make that face some more. He just made a whole lot of different faces; it‚Äôs just something he seems to be good at without even trying.‚Äù  Gavin kept appearing on Nick‚Äôs Vine account over the next two years, and then, all of a sudden, Gavin started blowing up. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt up until, like, this past June that he really blew up, and I think it was because more and more big meme accounts were posting pictures of him.‚Äù Meme accounts like @chanelpuke and @tinatbh and the like, which trade and copy memes from each other like playing cards. (Know Your Meme credits the account @wedecideit with blowing up Gavin‚Äôs spot.) Once they had drawn attention to Gavin, he was everywhere.  With dozens of Vines to choose from, it was easy to find a Gavin reaction face for any situation. I went from not knowing who Gavin was to seeing 20 different pictures of him in the span of a few days. On Instagram, his mom, Katie, has roughly ten times more followers than she did two months ago.  In addition to the Team USA shout-out, Gavin has drawn the attention of stars like Katy Perry and Skai Jackson. Shawn Mendes invited Gavin to his show when he was in town.  The attention of celebrities in tweets like Biles‚Äôs are a good indication of just how megaviral Gavin is. ‚ÄúThose types of things are just fun,‚Äù Mastodon says, ‚Äúbecause they were just talking about him and just addressing him, referring to him on a first-name basis. And I think that that‚Äôs really powerful, to show how popular he is or how recognizable his name is.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI think the word phenomenon is a good word for it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere was definitely a buildup to it, but the fact that all of a sudden so many people are using his pictures and his videos, and there‚Äôs Twitter feeds or streams of our old Vines and some of the newer stuff, and just the rate at which this stuff is getting shared is pretty incredible.‚Äù  When you send a risky text and 5 mins later you open up messages and see the three little dots pic.twitter.com/5tgXnVDlIu ‚Äî Gavin Reactions (@GavinReacts) August 1, 2016  Exactly how aware Gavin is of his internet fame is up for debate. Fans ask to take pictures with him, and he knows that they know him from Vine, but the sheer scale is lost on him. ‚ÄúThe only thing I worry about, really, is that he would ever resent any of us for making these videos and posting these pictures,‚Äù Mastodon admitted. Some of the money Mastodon makes from doing sponsored Vines goes toward Gavin‚Äôs college fund. ‚ÄúI think that it will definitely come down to how we explain what‚Äôs happening or how it happens. I‚Äôm hoping that he thinks it‚Äôs cool. I‚Äôm hoping that it‚Äôs not something that he gets teased about. I think his parents feel the same way.‚Äù  For the foreseeable future, though, Gavin will continue to grace our screens with his presence.

e7e1c95f-3a39-49e3-aedb-3f335dc85700,"There is growing speculation that Oprah Winfrey may challenge the president in 2020 after her rousing speech at Sunday's Golden Globes. Winfrey's best friend and ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King said on Tuesday ""I do think she's intrigued by the idea.""  Winfrey's partner, Stedman Graham, started much of the talk when he told the Los Anegels Times on Sunday that she would ""absolutely"" run, but ultimately it was ""up to the people.""  Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision for Lindt Chocolate/AP Images  King addressed Graham's comments and said that he had misinterpreted the reporter's question.  ""Stedman says that he thought the reporter said to him 'Would she make a good president?' And he said 'Absolutely she would.' That's how he interpreted the question, because this is the thing ‚Äì Stedman would never so cavalierly say absolutely she would do it. It's up to the people. He would never do that,"" King said.  While King insisted that Winfrey is not ""actively considering"" a run for president, she also said, ""She loves this country and would like to be of service in some way.""  According to King, Winfrey was originally asked by producers to keep her speech at Sunday's Golden Globes to three minutes long. She insisted on keeping it at six minutes and when it was all said and done, it lasted for about nine.  ""I think the producers thought that was worth going late for,"" King said. ""She wanted that moment to be more than women wearing black dresses of solidarity. She really did want to speak to young girls around the country. She really did want to say 'enough already' and I think she delivered on all that in a very eloquent way. Will she run for president? I think it's a very very intriguing idea myself.""  Read King's full comments below.  NORAH O'DONNELL: ""So what about what Stedman said?""  GAYLE KING: ""I do think that's interesting because Stedman says that he thought the reporter said to him would she make a good president and he said absolutely she would. That's how he interpreted the question, because this is the thing. Stedman would never so cavalierly say absolutely she would do it. It's up to the people. He would never do that.  KING: ""I got emails from people yesterday that said is Stedman being strategic or is he being supportive? He is nothing but supportive. He would never just throw it out there like that.""  O'DONNELL: ""I'm going to ask you the same tough question that I ask guests on this show. In fact, Stedman did say she would absolutely do it. It's up to the people.""  KING: ""He did say it is up to the people but I'm telling you his interpretation of the question was would she ‚Äì he thought the reporter was saying would she be a good president.""  O'DONNELL: ""Is she considering it?""  KING: ""No, I absolutely don't think that her position has changed. I don't. You know, I was up talking to her very late last night. I do think this though, guys. I do think she's intrigued by the idea. I do think that. I also know after years of watching the Oprah show, you always have a right to change your mind. I don't think at this point she is actually considering it. But listen, there are people who have said they want to be her campaign manager, who want to quit their jobs and campaign for her. She loves this country and would like to be of service in some way, but I don't think that she's actively considering it.""  JEFF GLOR: ""For the record that is a significant change ‚Äì that is a change from what we heard in October.""  KING: ""It's not a change from her, Jeff. That's a change from me. It's not a change from her.""  O'DONNELL: ""So let me ask you, who wrote the speech?""  KING: ""Listen, Oprah crafted that speech. She knew how she wanted to start. This was the thing for her: she knew exactly what she wanted to say and she knew how she wanted to say it. She crafted the speech, she talked to an editor at the magazine and the two of them came up with it, but Oprah put down exactly what she wanted to say. Those were all her words. You know, listen, she writes her 'What I Know For Sure' column every week ‚Äì every month in the magazine. She's a very good writer. We all know she's a very good talker and so I think that it was a home run on many levels. Being in that room I will say this: Being in that room was electrifying. It was the right person giving the right speech at the right time. She wanted that moment to be more than women wearing black dresses of solidarity. She really did want to speak to young girls around the country. She really did want to say enough already and I think she delivered on all that in a very eloquent way. Will she run for president? I think it's a very very intriguing idea myself.""  GLOR: ""If someone were to potentially run for president, what do you think their timeline might be?""  KING (looking at newspaper headline): ""I don't know, Jeff. I'm just looking at, this 'Yes She Can.' 'Noprah' if you took out the 'p' it would say Norah. I don't think there is such a thing as a timeline. I'm not trying to be cute here or be mysterious but I do think it's a very intriguing thing that she had never considered. People said 'oh yeah, she wrote that speech as a launching pad for what she wants to do.' That's absolutely not true. She worked on it, she rehearsed it, she practiced it. I was a practice audience member and I have to say I knew the speech was going to be powerful just when she was reading it to time. And you'll like this: before when she was at rehearsal they told her she had to cut three minutes out of it because it was six minutes long. They said you have to cut it to three minutes and Oprah said if it was any other night than this one I could do that but I don't plan on cutting it. As it turned out with all the applause it went nine minutes and I think they were very pleased ‚Äì I think the producers thought that was worth going late for.""

b08a70a9-311d-4253-9918-a3aa5f7f5861,"The 'Star Trek' icon denies a claim by Scott R. Brunton, who says he was groped at the actor's Los Angeles condo.  A former model and actor is accusing Star Trek icon George Takei of sexual assault in 1981. The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable.  ""This happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,"" Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. ""It is one of those stories you tell with a group of people when people are recounting bizarre instances in their lives, this always comes up. I have been telling it for years, but I am suddenly very nervous telling it.""  Brunton says he was living in Hollywood in 1981, working as a waiter and beginning a career as a commercial actor and model when he met a 43- or 44-year-old Takei one evening at Greg's Blue Dot bar. The men exchanged numbers and would call one another from time to time as well as run into each other at clubs, Brunton says. When Brunton broke up with his then-boyfriend, he spoke with Takei. ""He said, 'Let me know what your new number is' and I did. And not long after we broke up and I moved out, George called me,"" Brunton recalls.  Takei, as Brunton tells it, invited him to dinner and the theater. ""He was very good at consoling me and understanding that I was upset and still in love with my boyfriend,"" Brunton says. ""He was a great ear. He was very good about me spilling my heart on my sleeve.""  The two men went back to the actor's condo for a drink the same night. ""We have the drink and he asks if I would like another,"" Brunton recalls. ""And I said sure. So, I have the second one, and then all of a sudden, I begin feeling very disoriented and dizzy, and I thought I was going to pass out. I said I need to sit down and he said sit over here and he had the giant yellow beanbag chair. So I sat down in that and leaned my head back and I must have passed out.""  ""The next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,"" Brunton says. ""I came to and said, 'What are you doing?!' I said, 'I don't want to do this.' He goes, 'You need to relax. I am just trying to make you comfortable. Get comfortable.' And I said, 'No. I don't want to do this.' And I pushed him off and he said, 'OK, fine.' And I said I am going to go and he said, 'If you feel you must. You're in no condition to drive.' I said, 'I don't care I want to go.' So I managed to get my pants up and compose myself and I was just shocked. I walked out and went to my car until I felt well enough to drive home, and that was that.""  THR spoke to four longtime friends of Brunton ‚Äî Norah Roadman, Rob Donovan, Stephen Blackshear and Jan Steward ‚Äî who said that he had confided in them about the Takei encounter years ago.  Takei's rep, Julia Buchwald, told THR, ""George is traveling in Japan and Australia and not reachable for comment."" Takei, now 80, rose to fame playing Hikaru Sulu on the original Star Trek television series. He is also an author and activist and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights.  In a series of tweets and in a Facebook post Saturday morning, Takei denied the allegations.  ""The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now. I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do,"" he said. ""Right now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago. But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.""  Brunton claims that he met up with Takei years after the incident in Portland, Brunton's current home, while the actor was there on a book tour. ""I wanted to see him,"" Brunton says. ""I always wanted to ask him ‚Äî I just felt really betrayed. I thought I was a friend and here I am later, just another piece of meat. So I called him up at the hotel ‚Äî I figured out which hotel he was at ‚Äî and he said 'Hi, Scott. I remember you.' I wanted to ask him why. We met for coffee, and I just couldn't bring myself to do it. It was just too uncomfortable.""  Brunton says he considered going to the media with the story for years, but he assumed no one would take him seriously. ""Who's going to believe me? It's my word against his,"" he says.  Brunton's reasoning changed after the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and specifically when Takei spoke out regarding allegations leveled against Kevin Spacey.  On Oct. 29, Anthony Rapp, an actor starring in the latest Star Trek series, claimed to BuzzFeed News that Spacey sexually assaulted him while he was a minor in 1986. Spacey later apologized and came out as gay in response. ""When power is used in a non-consensual situation, it is a wrong,"" Takei said of the Spacey claim in a statement to THR on Oct. 30. ""For Anthony Rapp, he has had to live with the memory of this experience of decades ago. For Kevin Spacey, who claims not to remember the incident, he was the older, dominant one who had his way. Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight ‚Äî that is a deflection. They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.""  Brunton says he found Takei's response infuriating. ""I don't want anything from him but an apology,"" he says. ""I am sure he'll disown all this, I don't know, maybe not.""  Friends,    I'm writing to respond to the accusations made by Scott R. Bruton. I want to assure you all that I am as shocked and bewildered at these claims as you must feel reading them. /1 ‚Äî George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) November 11, 2017  The events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now.

524a1ca2-5780-41f8-bdbd-b528ebaa18ff,"Sing me a song of a lass that is gone  Say, could that lass be I?  The first time I saw the opening lyrics to Outlander‚Äôs theme song posted on a friend‚Äôs Facebook post, I thought it sounded ridiculous, way too on-the-nose to start every episode by acknowledging the series‚Äô premise. YES WE GET IT CLAIRE YOU DISAPPEARED.  That was before I actually listened to it, and watched the title sequence‚Äîand then, like Claire at Craigh na Dun, I fell hard. Now, I forbid my husband from fast-forwarding through the credits every time we watch‚Ä¶ and considering that we‚Äôve been bingeing a season at a time, that means I‚Äôve got it well memorized. But why do I find this particular TV opening so compelling?  The answer, I think, is that it presses all of my nerd buttons: it‚Äôs a remix of a mashup, with an excellent invocation of Rule 63. It is the platonic ideal of a TV theme song.  Spoilers for Outlander seasons 1 through 3.  I knew that Bear McCreary is behind so many excellent modern scores, from Battlestar Galactica and 10 Cloverfield Lane, but I did not truly appreciate his expertise until I traced the origins of the Outlander theme. Because first he started off with the tune of the 1884 folk song ‚ÄúThe Skye Boat Song,‚Äù which is not just any random Scottish ditty, but which chronicles the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie (!) during the Battle of Culloden (!!) at the heart of the Jacobite uprising. Already, amazing season 2 synergy before the damn pilot has even started:  Speed, bonnie boat, like a bird on the wing,  Onward! the sailors cry;  Carry the lad that‚Äôs born to be King  Over the sea to Skye. Loud the winds howl, loud the waves roar,  Thunderclouds rend the air;  Baffled, our foes stand by the shore,  Follow they will not dare.  And so forth. But, as Bear explained in his wonderfully detailed Behind the Music-esque blog posts, he wasn‚Äôt connecting with the original lyrics by Sir H. Boulton. It was Raya Yarbrough, the voice behind every iteration of the Outlander theme, who suggested swapping them out for Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs 1892 poem (same subject matter) ‚ÄúSing Me a Song of a Lad That Is Gone‚Äú:  Sing me a song of a lad that is gone,  Say, could that lad be I?  Merry of soul he sailed on a day  Over the sea to Skye. Mull was astern, Rum on the port,  Eigg on the starboard bow;  Glory of youth glowed in his soul;  Where is that glory now?  And on. Except that the tiresome fop Prince Charlie, the worst character from season 2 (I said it), doesn‚Äôt deserve to narrate the opening credits. And really, Outlander isn‚Äôt about any of the men‚Äînot him, not Frank, not Black Jack, not even dear Jamie. So then Bear conjured his inner fangirl and genderswapped RSL‚Äôs poem, so instead of Bonnie Prince Charlie talking, it‚Äôs Claire. And, let‚Äôs be honest, this stanza from the poem sounds more like her than any man anyway:  Billow and breeze, islands and seas,  Mountains of rain and sun,  All that was good, all that was fair,  All that was me is gone.  And it all comes together like a brilliantly remixed fanfic, or an unexpectedly inventive dish on Chopped:  UGH it‚Äôs SO GOOD. When the drums pick up after all that was me is gone and she takes off through the forest? /chefskiss  In the words of Eliza Schuyler Hamilton, this could be enough. BUT THEN. It‚Äôs not enough to have achieved this remix excellence and just float on your laurels for at least six seasons. Then the brilliant minds behind these credits tapped into my favorite part of golden age of TV-era openings and changed it up for every season. Just as I still have a soft spot for appointment television, I earnestly miss TV show openings that change up the footage every season. It was always a treat to start up the new season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and gawk at all of the moments to look forward to (two Xanders?? a roving monster hand? and of course, the inevitable badass Buffy pose) over the next 22 episodes. Just imagine if every season of Game of Thrones had fleeting shots of Rob Stark getting stabbed, Joffrey purple and spluttering, Cersei‚Äôs dragonfire lighting shit up‚Ä¶  To be fair, the Game of Thrones theme is its own work of art, and fits the show: Westeros is so massive, of course we need to see the entire world from the point of view of scholars and military strategists. Also, the twists in A Song of Ice and Fire are so big that to give even a hint of them would ruin many viewers‚Äô experiences. Outlander had to show not so much where physically Claire would wind up, but where in time‚Äîto contrast the magic of the Dance of the Druids at the standing stones with the equal magic of turning a radio dial.  That said, the series still very much leans in to its predilection for choosing a new country (sometimes a new continent) for each season. To wit, season 2 saw the Frasers going to France‚Äîso Bear and co. replaced the Scottish fiddle and drums with a baroque viola de gambe and even translated a verse into French:  But France was short-lived, with Jamie and Claire returning to Scotland and the fated Battle of Culloden in the latter half of the season. The folks behind the credits could have just washed their hands of it and kept to the Frenchified titles. But do you think they were content with that? OF COURSE NOT. This is war, and the military Scottish snare drums, bagpipes, and shots of shirtless Highlanders versus musket-wielding British soldiers needed to reflect that:  At this point, changing the main titles every season has become an Outlander tradition. At first, season 3‚Äôs changes appear a bit subtler, but there: the radio is replaced by a flickering television, broken chains carry incredible significance, and while many of the Scottish elements remain, they‚Äôre more somber, more retrospective. Then, instead of adding or replacing something, Bear strips out the bagpipes‚Äîsignifying the crushing defeat at Culloden. Seriously, every detail, every choice, is so delightfully deliberate:  Thankfully, we do not linger on sadness for long. While the first half of season 2 was very classy and baroque, the latter half of season 3 is shaped by McCreary‚Äôs most out-there choice yet: ‚ÄúI cannot imagine any project other than Outlander that would allow me to set a soaring bagpipe melody over blistering congas!‚Äù Not unlike Hamilton‚Äôs Act 1 ending number ‚ÄúNon-Stop‚Äù (one of my favorites in the show), the new Outlander titles utilize congas and other Afro-Cuban influences to impressive dramatic effect. Pack your bags, kiddos, we‚Äôre going to the Caribbean:  ‚ÄúAltering a series main title is a risky move,‚Äù McCreary wrote when it came to switching things up for season 2. ‚ÄúThe entire point of a main title is to be consistent from episode to episode, building a relationship with the audience.‚Äù And that could be the case, but when does familiarity begin to breed monotony? Do TV audiences really have a relationship with a static title card and one beat of music, or is it just an extra two seconds to fast-forward to get to the episode at hand?  Claire Beauchamp Randall Fraser‚Äôs relationships are as jagged as the lines on her palm: She‚Äôs with Frank, then Jamie, then returned to Frank, then reunited with Jamie. As she jumps through time and around the world, aging and changing and conceiving in one timeline but giving birth in another, meeting old friends for the first time and rediscovering new loves, viewers must follow along her dizzying route. She, and they, need a theme song that changes with the show, that always reflects its present moment before shedding that identity and taking on a new one.  Let‚Äôs bring back opening credits that match the tone of the show‚Äîthe headbanging fun of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the almost-too-cheesy folksiness of Firefly‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou Can‚Äôt Take the Sky From Me,‚Äù the quick trip through the universe afforded by Futurama. These should be the rule, not the exception‚Äîthe rule being that even if you have read the books or otherwise know what to expect from your show, it can still surprise you.

The general consensus though is that the Top Gun star is a just a normal guy, despite all the mystery that surrounds him. ‚ÄúHe allows himself to be surrounded by a lot of mystique and conjecture and gossip and he just sort of lets it fester and I think that makes people think he is some sort of inhuman kind of thing, but he is just a bloke,‚Äù Pegg explained. Fans of the 56-year-old are delighted https://www.instagram.com/p/BiC6IVODUeD/?taken-by=tomcruiseby his return to the public eye as he travels the world to promote the most recent installment of the franchise. More recently, he has joined Jimmy Fallon for a hilarious round of Mad Lib Theatre, before crossing the country to join James Corden as he skydived for the first time.  Even as he excels as Ethan Hunt, it‚Äôs been hard for the actor to duplicate that magic in other would-be franchises.The last couple of years have not been kind to Tom Cruise‚Äôs status as an action hero. In 2016, he played the taciturn Jack Reacher again in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, following that in 2017 as the lead of The Mummy and American Made. All three of those movies stumbled in one way or another ‚Äî American Made acquitted itself best of all and received strong reviews, but it was not exactly a runaway hit. Meanwhile, The Mummy doomed a shared universe before it began and Jack Reacher earned $56 million less globally than its predecessor.  That impact? No joke. #MissionImpossible A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Jun 18, 2018 at 12:09pm PDT  As Cruise is only four years away from 60 ‚Äî yes, really ‚Äî it‚Äôs not wrong to wonder if his action-star days are far behind him. But Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout suggests he‚Äôs got some life in him yet.Throughout the last two decades, Cruise has excelled when he plays IMF agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt was first introduced in the 1996 movie adaptation of the 1960s TV show, Mission: Impossible, pulling off a daring and breathtaking break-in of CIA headquarters, fending off an attack by a man in a helicopter while hanging for his life on the top of a fast-moving train and more. As Cruise has grown older, he‚Äôs worked more often in action films than dramas ‚Äî in between the first and second M:I films, Cruise co-starred in Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, a one-two punch he‚Äôs not replicated since ‚Äî but he‚Äôs never better than when playing the beleaguered IMF agent.  Fallout could easily have felt like more of the same, were it not for, among other things, Cruise‚Äôs fierce commitment to doing whatever he has to do to entertain people. Here, that means ‚Äúnearly killing himself.‚Äù Not every one of this film‚Äôs 147 minutes is dedicated to action sequences that seem to catalogue the ways in which Tom Cruise could have died on set ‚Äî the pre-title sequence is both ominous and deliciously twisty without featuring any severe action. But once Ethan and his not-entirely-willing new partner, CIA agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill), have to do a HALO jump from above 20,000 feet in the air into a Parisian nightclub, Fallout isn‚Äôt playing around. Yes, Cruise pulled off that jump, just like he climbed up a rope to take over a helicopter mid-flight and jumped from one London building to another. (Of course, as you may know, he broke his ankle in the process, in a shot that‚Äôs in the finished film.)  It‚Äôs difficult to know exactly what makes the Mission: Impossible franchise so special for Cruise, what makes it work so well for his intense persona. Movies like Jack Reacher: Never Go Back and The Mummy suggest that Cruise is looking for other franchises on which to work in between making M:I adventures. (Seeing that Cruise is co-starring in a Top Gun sequel next only furthers this notion.) But few of those capture the ineffable essence of Cruise the way that Ethan Hunt does. In Fallout, Hunt is at his most desperate. One of Ethan‚Äôs refrains in Fallout feels like a Cruise mission statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll figure it out!‚Äù The tension in that statement is always in wondering how. Ethan, of course, does figure things out at the last second, but how he does is always thrilling.  The same can‚Äôt be said for those other would-be franchises. (Hard to believe that we‚Äôre only a year removed from Universal announcing that so-called Dark Universe with The Mummy, which was a real don‚Äôt-count-your-chickens-until-they‚Äôve-hatched situation.) Part of it falls to something Cruise can‚Äôt control: his age. In Fallout, both Michelle Monaghan and Rebecca Ferguson return to play important women in Ethan‚Äôs life, even though both actresses are a great deal younger than him. It was laughable in last year‚Äôs The Mummy when Cruise‚Äôs hero had a love interest who was young enough to be his daughter, just as it was laughable when the main character was referred to as younger than Dr. Jekyll, played by Russell Crowe (who is younger than Cruise). In Fallout, at least, there is an unavoidable sense that Ethan is getting wearier, physically and mentally. He‚Äôs still able to save the world, but he‚Äôs not always as spry on his feet.  A post shared by Tom Cruise (@tomcruise) on Mar 15, 2018 at 8:05am PDT  Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout is a high point in Tom Cruise‚Äôs career. Frankly, in the last decade-plus, he‚Äôs only had a handful of standout films; four of them have been entries in this franchise. (Edge of Tomorrow was also a lot of fun, an exception in his recent filmography.) Though Tom Cruise may not be ageless, his intensity works in his favor when playing Ethan Hunt. A seventh Mission: Impossible has not yet officially been greenlit, but one is expected to be in the works. If Cruise can keep figuring out how to make Ethan‚Äôs exploits as brilliantly entertaining as they are in this new entry, then it‚Äôs almost worth the stumbles in between.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1488

387a0a7a-95a4-4854-9a84-555b4878432d,"Director‚Äôs departure over ‚Äòcreative differences‚Äô expected to delay production, and could even lead to loss of star Daniel Craig  The immediate future of the James Bond franchise is in chaos after the sudden departure of the director Danny Boyle.    Three months before shooting on the as-yet-untitled film was scheduled to start, the Oscar-winning film-maker behind Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting quit, leaving producers scrambling.  A delay to the scheduled release date of 25 October 2019 looks inevitable; there is also speculation the fallout could stretch further, claiming star Daniel Craig as another victim.  A tweet from the franchise‚Äôs official account announced on Monday evening: ‚ÄúMichael G Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25.‚Äù  Industry insiders suspect these differences revolve around the script, which Boyle wrote with his long-term collaborator John Hodge. The pair previously collaborated on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle‚Äôs debut, Shallow Grave.  The Bond script was reportedly a deal-breaker for Boyle, who took on the project after the departure of Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall in 2012 before returning (having previously quit) for 2015‚Äôs Spectre.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Craig in the most recent James Bond film, Spectre. Photograph: Allstar/United Artists  The producers were reportedly so keen to secure Boyle that they put an already completed screenplay, by the longtime 007 writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, on the back-burner. Purvis and Wade have previously written six Bond films, including all four Craig outings, as well as the final two starring his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan.  Hodge and Boyle‚Äôs script ‚Äì which is different in all respects ‚Äì was thought to have been a work-in-progress until recently, and it is understood its themes were more topical than is traditional for a Bond film.  A leaked casting-call sheet indicated that the key villain would be Russian, and Boyle has suggested the film would help the franchise evolve in the #MeToo and #TimesUp era.  ‚ÄúYou write in real time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou acknowledge the legacy of the world of Bond and you write in the world ‚Äì but you also write in the modern world as well.‚Äù  Boyle indicated that the script featured a considerable coup de cinema ‚Äì ‚Äúit‚Äôs a great idea so hopefully it will work‚Äù ‚Äì which some speculated could involve a high-concept plot in which Bond would be incarcerated for much of the running time ‚Äì or, potentially, die.  The high-stakes nature of such a twist, and the controversial real-life issues the film may have explored, may well have proved a sticking point with producers. Bond films have increasingly toyed with topicality, with Spectre hanging on an initiative to axe field agents in favour of virtual espionage. However, grappling with issues such as sexual assault and Russian influence in geopolitics might have been deemed too great a gamble.  Although Mendes and Craig‚Äôs tenure has put Bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters, Eon Productions, the production company behind the franchise, would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent. With budgets for Skyfall and Spectre exceeding $300m (¬£232m), little compromise for the film‚Äôs commercial prospects can be countenanced.  Boyle and Hodge‚Äôs script is unlikely to survive the director‚Äôs exit, meaning that Purvis and Wade‚Äôs draft will need to be polished up for production, and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story, characters and settings. This would add at least a year to the schedule, and the film may not be released until late-2020, at the earliest.  Producers would be reluctant to delay further, as a 2020 release date would already mean a five-year gap between the new film and Spectre. Although there were four years between Craig‚Äôs second outing, Quantum of Solace (2008) and his third, Skyfall (2012), the longest break between Bond films is only six years ‚Äì between Licence to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995) ‚Äì and that involved a change of actor in the leading role.  This makes it yet more likely that Craig, 50, will call it a day. Until there was confirmation he would return alongside Boyle, speculation had been rife that the actor, a famously reluctant tuxedo wearer, would move on, with Idris Elba and Tom Hardy among those named as possible candidates to replace him.  Promoting Spectre in 2015, Craig said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role; months later, his departure seemed all but certain following that of Mendes.  In 2016, Craig was reportedly offered $150m to star in another two Bond movies by Broccoli, and this year he was confirmed for at least one more.  Craig and Boyle have worked together once before: when the former appeared as Bond, alongside the Queen, in a brief film that featured in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, which Boyle directed.  Mark Tildesley, Boyle‚Äôs favoured production designer, was also recruited to the Bond film this year. His future on the project is now unknown.  Boyle‚Äôs latest film, a romcom scripted by Richard Curtis, is scheduled for release in September 2019 ‚Äì just a month before the Bond movie was due to come out. It is distributed by Universal Pictures, which recently took on UK distribution rights to the Bond films from Sony Pictures, which was responsible for getting Boyle‚Äôs most recent big screen release, T2: Trainspotting, into cinemas.  Possible replacements for Boyle include Christopher Nolan, Christopher McQuarrie and Susanne Bier. McQuarrie‚Äôs latest film, Mission: Impossible ‚Äì Fallout, was widely praised for its Bond-style plot and stunts. The film, which stars Tom Cruise, has so far made $500m at the box office.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1121

Daniel Craig is coming back as BOND!  Hurry the f*ck up!!! pic.twitter.com/tx8MqPhpnR  The film garnered rave reviews but Craig, clearly frustrated with the promotional commitments that accompanied playing Bond, said he would rather ‚Äúslit my wrists‚Äù than reprise the role.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm over it at the moment. We‚Äôre done. All I want to do is move on,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúIf I did another Bond movie, it would only be for the money.‚Äù  But explaining his heated comments, Craig told Colbert that they had been made in the moment, two days after Spectre had finished shooting when he was exhausted. ‚ÄúInstead of saying something with style and grace, I said something really stupid,‚Äù he said.  It is the source of much speculation of how much the film studios will have promised Craig to tempt him back. He was rumoured to have been paid $65m (¬£48.66m) for Spectre, and in 2016 it was reported he had been offered $150m to shoot two more Bond films, almost back to back.  Say never again: why Daniel Craig should quit while he's ahead as Bond Read more  Neither ‚Äì should they both happen ‚Äì will be directed by Sam Mendes, who, despite the critical and commercial success of Spectre and its predecessor, Skyfall, has ruled himself out of returning. Directors rumoured to be in the running include Christopher Nolan.  Thanks to Craig‚Äôs reticence to return to the franchise, speculation over who could replace him has raged for two years, with figures such as Idris Elba, Tom Hardy, Tom Hiddleston and Aidan Turner and even Gillian Anderson all put forward as suggestions. Elba said he was already weary of the attention that the speculation had attracted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I‚Äôve not even played the role,‚Äù he said in 2015. ‚ÄúEnough is enough. I can‚Äôt talk about it any more.‚Äù  Craig succeeded Pierce Brosnan as Bond and made his debut in Casino Royale in 2006. While initially seen as a divisive choice, he was soon praised for his darker, more brooding take on the martini-sipping spy, which proved a massive hit at the box office, with the Observer film critic Mark Kermode describing him as the ‚Äúbest screen Bond to date‚Äù.  Skyfall was one of the highest grossing films of all time when it was released in 2012, and was the first Bond film to gross over $1bn at the box office. 2015‚Äôs Spectre, which was described by the Guardian‚Äôs Peter Bradshaw as ‚Äúterrifically exciting, spectacular, almost operatically delirious 007 adventure‚Äù cost $245m to make ‚Äì the most expensive Bond film to date ‚Äì but was also box office gold, taking in $880m worldwide.

Numerous publications have been circulating details about how the pair will supposedly reunite on-screen with a romantic comedy project, for example. There have also been reports of the two getting married. As it turns out, neither of these is true.  Listing a variety of rumors and reports that it considers false, Gossip Cop has certainly gone out of its way to try and prove other publications wrong. The stated fictional declarations on that list include the supposed secret Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt marriage and that the pair is engaged once again.  Apparently, publications have been taking the smallest details to spin a narrative that was nowhere close to the truth. For example, a snapshot of the ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù actress wearing a ring for the movie she was shooting called ‚ÄúMurder Mystery‚Äù was mistaken for an engagement ring. This was quickly picked up and circulated all over the web, leading to a Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumor feeding frenzy.  There were also some reports about the former married couple tying the knot once more to celebrate what would have been their 18th wedding anniversary. As Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumors go, this one might just be one of the most misleading.  The part about the two actors being in a romantic-comedy has also been debunked recently by Gossip Cop, as well, which was reposted by MSN. Neither of the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt parties had shown any indication that such a rumor was even close to being true. In fact, past discussions alluding to the same topic have been denied by spokespersons of the actors before.  For Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt news that does come with evidence, it would seem that the ‚ÄúFight Club‚Äù actor likes to model his look after whoever he is currently dating. This tidbit was posted by Twitter user Sarah McGonagall after she spotted it on an old Daily Express article. At least this proposition actually has photographic proof.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,423

On the polished heels of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs wedding, another regal celebration is a welcomed jubilee.

Jack is a brand manager for Casamigos Tequila (co-founded by George Clooney who might be making his second royal wedding appearance of the year).  Royal watchers will recall that the couple officially announced their engagement via the Royal Family‚Äôs Twitter account this past January. As we previously reported , the couple met back in 2011 skiing in the Swiss Alps. From one epic location to meet (and fall in love) the location of their engagement was just as epic‚Äînear a lakeside Nicaraguan volcano ‚Äîah, young royal love.  After Jack bestowed Princess Eugenie with a stunning pink diamond sapphire engagement ring (so extra) it was announced that their marriage will take place at St. George‚Äôs Chapel in Windsor (the same place Harry and Meghan tied the knot).

The viewing starts early‚Äî4:25 a.m. EST Friday, October 12th. So have your teapot hot and your scones pre-jammed for another English wedding spectacle.  While the past regal weddings have been very pomp-and-circumstance, this one is expected to be the same with an environmental-friendly no-plastic stance.  This past August, British Vogue shared the news that both Princess Eugenie and Jack are planning to have an eco-conscious planned wedding as she and her sister, Beatrice grew up in an ‚Äúanti-plastic‚Äù home. She told British Vogue, ‚ÄúMy whole house is anti-plastic now ‚Äì and Jack and I want our wedding to be like that as well.‚Äù  Princess Eugenie, one of the few royals on Instagram, recently posted a regal black and white profile portrait captioning, ‚Äú#tbt to some serious wedding daydreaming going on here.

Fans saw LeeAnne Locken get engaged to her longtime love Rich Emberlin on Season 2 of The Real Housewives of Dallas and Season 3 began with the couple being toasted at D'Andra Simmons' anniversary party. D'Andra dared the two to get married right then and there, but the couple demurred. Previews for this season show the Dallas ladies discussing LeeAnne's relationship and wondering why she and Rich haven't set a date. Given that LeeAnne's engagement happened on cameras, fans have been wondering if their wedding will be a part of RHOD as well.  ""I have always said that I would share it with our audience because I feel like I've taken them down the journey of watching me get engaged on camera,"" LeeAnne told The Daily Dish podcast. ""A lot of people were like, 'You planned that!' I'm like, 'Sweetie, that was the one and only time he was ever asked me with a ring was then. I mean, what you saw was the first time that he's ever asked me. That was his real moment and my real moment. And that was our real joy. And I really wanted to share that with our audience. So, yeah, I'm going to share my wedding with our audience.""

""The wedding is a ceremony that I think people should get to enjoy. I mean, I want you to see if I get nervous or, God forbid, I trip in my wedding dress or my flowers die in my hands as I'm walking down the street or lightning strikes me and whole church burns up. I want to share all that,"" she laughed.  Given the special occasion, The Daily Dish podcast asked if Rich would be jazzing up his eye patch, which he has worn ever since sustaining damage to one eye.  ""No, I will not bling him a patch, people. Come on now,"" LeeAnne said. ""Every single one of my friends is like, 'I'll bling that for you. You want me to put some rhinestones on that patch?' I'm like, ""Y'all, it's not an accessory. Losing your vision is not an accessory; it's a tragedy.""  It sounds like Rich will be making his wedding day ensemble decisions all on his own: ""I don't have to drag him everywhere and tell him what to dress and how to dress and all that. I let him do him. And then every night, I let him do me,"" she joked.  LeeAnne and Rich's wedding is definitely a hot topic this season. Make sure to tune in to RHOD every Wednesday at 9/8c.

""Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement.

d64872a8-5c1e-4af0-a1f9-ea1c25dc7feb,"On Saturday, Prince Harry, 33, and Meghan Markle, 36, will wed at St. George‚Äôs Chapel at Windsor Castle in a ceremony officiated by . . . sorry, we almost fell asleep there. We know all those details. You know what‚Äôs much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.  And unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here‚Äôs all the gossip leading up to the year‚Äôs most anticipated nuptials:  What‚Äôs up with Meghan‚Äôs dad?  Thomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan‚Äôs relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they‚Äôve reportedly spoken by phone. An ‚Äúinsider‚Äù recently told People magazine, ‚ÄúLike any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.‚Äù  Then it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan‚Äôs half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it ‚Äúthe biggest mistake in wedding history.‚Äù The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan‚Äôs father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.  However, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were ‚Äústupid and hammy,‚Äù and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.  Early in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, ‚ÄúThis is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.‚Äù  On Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: ‚ÄúSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.‚Äù  And what‚Äôs up with her half-sister?  Samantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.‚Äôs daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry‚Äôs relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called ‚ÄúThe Diary of Princess Pushy‚Äôs Sister.‚Äù (The two reportedly haven‚Äôt spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a ‚Äúshallow social climber‚Äù only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was ‚Äúabsolutely lovely.‚Äù  So guess who wasn‚Äôt invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a ‚Äúlittle vulture.‚Äù  Why did Meghan‚Äôs half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?  It‚Äôs unclear ‚Äî maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.‚Äôs son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? ‚ÄúMeghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,‚Äù he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a ‚Äújaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.‚Äù Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, ‚ÄúWe are all still family.‚Äù We‚Äôre guessing that it did not work.  However, Thomas Jr.‚Äôs ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them ‚Äî they recently landed in London, where they‚Äôll be acting as wedding correspondents for ‚ÄúGood Morning Britain.‚Äù    Meghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)  What about her mom?    Doria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they‚Äôre extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her ‚Äúamazing.‚Äù Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.  Is her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?  Meghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: ‚ÄúDivorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London‚Äôs tabloid media, is next level.‚Äù Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.  However, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold ‚Äî for now.  Is there any drama on Harry‚Äôs side of the family?  Have you seen ‚ÄúThe Crown‚Äù? You have? Good. That‚Äôs probably all the intense Windsor drama you‚Äôre going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list ‚Äî it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill ‚Äî some distant relatives who were invited to William‚Äôs wedding were not invited to Harry‚Äôs. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don‚Äôt know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.  What‚Äôs up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?  Meghan‚Äôs eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry‚Äôs late mother, Princess Diana, often called the ‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Princess.‚Äù Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan‚Äôs overall popularity with the family and public.  But some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting ‚Äî in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.  William replied, ‚ÄúOhhh, yes,‚Äù according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].‚Äù He then noted that they are all ‚Äústuck together for the rest of our lives,‚Äù to which Meghan added, ‚ÄúTogetherness at its finest.‚Äù    Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)  What roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?  A few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man ‚Äî ‚ÄúIt could be a sensitive subject,‚Äù he joked on a radio show ‚Äî Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won‚Äôt have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry ‚Äújust want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.‚Äù William and Kate‚Äôs older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.  [Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry‚Äôs wedding]  Are Harry‚Äôs exes invited to the wedding?  Probably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There‚Äôs also precedent: Several of William‚Äôs exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles‚Äôs then-ex-girlfriend ‚Äî now his wife, Duchess Camilla ‚Äî attended his to Diana.  Which celebrities will be there?  Never forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from ‚ÄúSuits,‚Äù the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls ‚Äî British royalty in their own right ‚Äî likely will, too, along with Meghan‚Äôs pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams.

Going as far as to claim that Satan is a ‚Äúreally nice guy‚Äú, the singer described Satan‚Äôs relationship with her as ‚Äúfatherly and nurturing‚Äù before stopping abruptly and asking the radio hosts, ‚ÄúYou guys are liberal, right? Uber liberal, right?‚Äú  After the hosts laughed and one of them said ‚ÄúErr, yeah, I guess you can call us that,‚Äù Cyrus laughed too and then admitted that ‚Äúsometimes he [Satan] can be a bit naughty too. He can be pervy. But that is natural. It‚Äôs only religious maniacs who see a problem with natural things.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI have reached the point where my relationship with him is stronger than my relationship with my earthly father,‚Äù Cyrus said, making reference to her biological father, Billy Ray Cyrus.  Asked how Billy Ray feels about ‚Äútaking a back seat to the devil‚Äú, Miley Cyrus said, ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt feel anything, I don‚Äôt think so anyway. I haven‚Äôt asked. But it‚Äôs not like my relationship with anyone else takes away anything from my relationship with Dad. It‚Äôs just different.‚Äù  Cyrus also claimed that she receives guidance from Satan ‚Äúon a fairly regular basis.‚Äù Asked what kind of guidance, Cyrus said, ‚ÄúEveryday stuff. Normal stuff,‚Äù before explaining that Satan‚Äôs guidance is ‚Äúbetter than Jesus‚Äô guidance.‚Äú  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been there, done that. Jesus is ok. He‚Äôs boring, you know? He gave Satan a bad rap. Jesus is the goody two shoes with no life. I prayed to Satan last Friday. I was in a foreign city, I barely knew anyone. He spoke to me quietly, prompting me to dress like a boy.  ‚ÄúI went out into the street dressed like a boy and I just walked and walked, following his whispers. I found myself in a dark alley by some kind of industrial area. Two big guys, rough guys you know, they suddenly appeared and I don‚Äôt know, I guess you‚Äôd call it rape. They took me forcefully. Yeah, it was painful. But to be totally honest, the whole experience was transcendental.  ‚ÄúIt was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. When they were both finished, I started straight into their eyes and said ‚ÄúHail Satan‚Äù.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure they understood but they appeared calmed by my words.‚Äù  Miley Cyrus‚Äôs Satanic confession is merely the latest in a long line of public dalliances the singer has shared with the devil. After starting her career with Disney, the pop star reinvented her image as a raunchy pop star, flashing Satanic hand gestures and promoting Illuminati symbolism as she rode to the top of the charts.  Since establishing herself in the global consciousness as a Devil-worshipping entertainer, the singer has attempted to tame her dark image, however the disturbing conversation she held with the Swedish radio hosts suggests she is far from a reformed character, and she has openly sold her soul to Satan.  The incident has also sparked fears around the world that the Illuminati have moved onto the next phase of the masterplan, and have begun openly promoting Satanism as a viable religious choice for those seeking spiritual guidance.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,677

The report claims that Prince Harry and Markle's marriage has ""hit the rocks following a blistering fight."" A so-called insider claimed that ""Harry and Meghan hadn't even had time to unpack from their honeymoon when tempers flared.""

""I'm told Meghan turned to Harry and announced, 'Of course, if the threat of Zika is still there in October, we will cancel the trip',"" the insider added.

(Not to worry, control freaks: you can still see your shots on screen via a smartphone app as long as you‚Äôre connected to Wifi, and the actual guts of the camera are as cutting-edge as any of Leica‚Äôs latest products. You can also purchase an optional Visoflex electronic viewfinder.) The move is in keeping with a culture-wide trend towards reviving the rituals of a pre-digital world, on the principle that they can help you cut out the noise and reclaim a measure of serenity. The photographer is forced to rely on nothing but artistry, serendipity, and faith in the German brand‚Äôs legacy of technical excellence. The lack of a screen frees you up to fix your eye on the world around you as you keep searching for that moment.‚Äù  Julian Sancton, Senior Features Editor  To buy: $7,995; leica.com    Courtesy Mahabis    Mahabis Slippers  These modern, unisex slippers have a snap-in, Italian-made sneaker sole, making them the most comfortable non-shoe you‚Äôll ever wear, indoors or out.

CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photo gallery on your mobile device.  This is all according to the Daily Mail, which published grainy photos of Stewart and Pattinson, looking like they were having a chill time together, hanging out by a car outside a party at Chateau Marmont for Lily-Rose Depp.  Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ‚Äì OUTSIDE OF THE CHATEAU MARMONT, LA 06/02/2018 pic.twitter.com/yozZSAGSIw ‚Äî Elishia (@multifandomacc5) June 3, 2018  Stewart, 28, was wearing a black ensemble and appeared to be smoking, while Pattinson, 32, was wearing jeans, a graphic T-shrirt and black cap.  The idea of the ‚ÄúTwilight‚Äôs‚Äù Bella and Edward reconciling romantically in real life seems improbable because of the high-profile humiliation Pattinson likely suffered when Stewart was caught in a cheating scandal.  She was photographed in an intimate embrace with Sanders, her director for ‚ÄúSnow White and the Huntsman,‚Äù who was 19 years her senior. She and Sanders issued a very public apology to Pattinson.  When the Twilight series ended in 2012, Stewart and Pattinson seemed to go their separate ways both professionally and romantically.  Each has earned critical praise and International awards consideration for leaving blockbuster fare behind and starring in smaller, indie films. Meanwhile, Stewart came out as bisexual and began seriously dating model Stella Maxwell in late 2016, while Pattinson became engaged to U.K. singer FKA Twigs.  But Pattinson‚Äôs engagement to Twigs reportedly ended in October, while the Daily Mail, citing a report in OK! magazine, said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs trouble in paradise,‚Äù with regards to Stewart and Maxwell‚Äôs relationship.

What causes a subdural hematoma?  While this type of brain bleed is occasionally random, a subdural hematoma most often follows a traumatic head injury, such as a fall, collision or accident, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. Trebek told fans that his was the result of a fall that occurred a couple months ago.  What are the symptoms of a subdural hematoma?  Subdural hematoma symptoms typically include headache, vomiting, drowsiness and eventual loss of consciousness, dizziness, confusion, differing pupil size and slurred speech, according to the Mayo Clinic. Symptoms may appear immediately, but in some cases, they can take weeks or even months to manifest.  How serious is a subdural hematoma?  They can be fatal, but a person‚Äôs prognosis depends on multiple factors, from the size and severity of the bleed to how quickly treatment is sought, the U.S. National Library of Medicine says. Some subdural hematomas are reversed by drilling a hole in the skull to drain blood and relieve pressure on the brain, while others require more invasive brain surgery. Trebek did not comment on the severity of his case or his treatment plan.  Write to Jamie Ducharme at jamie.ducharme@time.com.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,440

RadarOnline.com has found footage of the troubled reality star with a short temper slapping his ex in the face!  As Radar has reported, Kardashian is currently at war with ex Blac Chyna, after his online hissy fit saw him slamming his baby mama for allegedly cheating on him.  Chyna snapped back with accusations of her own, claiming that she was abused by Rob, and that truth would soon come out.  PHOTOS: Rob Who? Meet Blac Chyna‚Äôs Hot Rebound Boyfriend!

03332d7d-898b-427a-83e8-5e23b3be0f65,"For eight seasons (the last one doesn't count), ""Roseanne"" was groundbreaking in its portrayal of working-class Americans, struggling to make ends meet from paycheck to paycheck, held together by an independent-thinking, liberal, feminist icon in Roseanne Barr. More than 20 years later, the Conner family is back, only this time Roseanne Conner voted Republican.  That single character decision has divided fans before the show even aired, but we're here to tell people on both sides of the political spectrum to put away their pitchforks and give it a chance. It's still the same ""Roseanne,"" and the same Roseanne, no matter how she voted.  Roseanne Barr never shied away from difficult social issues and political topics during the show's original run, so it makes sense she would continue that trend in the revival, and there are so many issues and topics to tackle from the Conner's still somewhat unique perspective on television as a middle class family (we see you ""The Middle"").  If you're a Trump supporter and you're looking for ""Roseanne"" to stand firmly in your corner, you might be disappointed. If you're a Trump hater, ""Roseanne"" doesn't have your back, either. Instead, it offers a place to have a meaningful discussion about those specific issues that are really dividing us surrounded by people we love. It's a show that wears its politics on its sleeve, and always has, but those politics don't define the show, nor are they the reason we tune in.  Below are the five main reasons you should give the new ""Roseanne"" a chance, no matter your political view:  Political Without Being Political  All those people wondering how a working-class mom in Middle America could ever vote for Trump are forgetting that people like the Conners are exactly who did vote for Trump. Most importantly, though, the show's writers realize that nothing is as simple as right and left, or even right and wrong, and Roseanne's vote is treated like everything else has been in the show's history: with sensitivity, understanding and laugh-out-loud sarcasm and humor.  ""Roseanne"" touched on hot-button issues like gay rights before it was acceptable to talk about that on television, so of course the show is going to embrace the topical issues of our time. And there are so very many of them to explore through the limited understanding of the Conners, and that's why the show still works. This family doesn't have all the answers, and they don't even always understand the issues fully, but that doesn't stop them from caring passionately about them and having strong opinions about them. Sound familiar?  The Conners Are All of Us  Unless you're a Kardashian, chances are the Conners speak to you on a visceral level. They've worked hard for what they have, and some of their biggest fears include suddenly losing their job and having to scramble to keep what little they've managed to accumulate, or getting sick and not having the insurance coverage necessary to be able to afford it. And yet, they live and love their lives fully, because what else is there? They have always been, and still are one of the most relatable families ever on television.  While it might have been nice to imagine that the kids all grew up to be multimillionaires, ""Roseanne"" has never traded in that kind of fantasy (we told you, Season 9 doesn't count!). Darlene (Sara Gilbert), Becky (Lecy Goranson) and DJ (Michael Fishman) did all grow up and have adult lives of their own, but they were all extraordinarily ordinary, and we wouldn't want it any other way. There is a surprising grace in the ordinary life, and it is within that world that ""Roseanne"" has always excelled at finding the funny, the heart and the beauty.  It's Still Funny  ""Roseanne"" was groundbreaking in its time (like ""Married...With Children"") because the family was sarcastic and insulted one another. In other words, they were more like real families and real people than we'd ever seen before. It might seem quaint in a television landscape where that kind of realism has become the norm, but this revival proves that the originals never go out of style. Darlene still gives the most scathing insults to Becky, and nobody can touch the love-filled hate -- or is that hate-filled love? -- that Roseanne and Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) sling at one another.  Roseanne is the queen of the put-down, and Dan (John Goodman) is the oft-overwhelmed emotional heart of the entire ensemble, and none of them have lost a beat of their comedic timing. Watching Roseanne and Dan together, it's easy to imagine them having been married for 45 years, the chemistry between them is palpable and the love and affection rings through all the insults and yelling.  All You Need Is Love  No matter how much they scream and fight, and they do it a lot, ""Roseanne"" succeeds because this is a family that loves one another and listens to one another. Even if they don't always understand why Jackie is so passionately smug about things she knows nothing about, they tolerate it and her because they love her. That's the message that ran through every episode of the original run, and it's what elevated ""Roseanne"" above so many other shows, even as it tackled serious topics and tough issues.  Dan and Roseanne could have a blowout fight over women's rights or how to raise their kids, but that wouldn't be the end of the conversation. In fact, it was usually just the beginning. It's when cooler heads prevailed that they could sit down and talk through the issue until either one of them backed down or they reached a mutual compromise. That love and respect -- liberally sprinkled with funny commentary -- allowed ""Roseanne"" to talk about serious issues without losing its viewers, and it's the same philosophy employed in these new episodes. It softens the blows of the insults and makes the tougher topics easier to explore.  The Next Generation  If the idea of hanging out with Jackie, Roseanne, Dan and the kids doesn't entice you to check out the new series, it's worth it to see how twenty years has changed the next generation of Conners. Season 10 not only introduces us to the adult versions of Becky, Darlene and DJ, but also to their children. The whole revival is like a fun family reunion where we can't believe how much older everybody looks and we can't stop squeezing the cheeks of all the new kiddos.  Mark is the clear breakout character so far, played with impressive depth and nuance by newcomer Ames McNamara. The son of Darlene and David (Johnny Galecki), Mark likes to dress in women's fashion, but like everything else on ""Roseanne,"" his reasons aren't as clear-cut as you might imagine. ""Shameless"" star Emma Kenney plays his sister Harris, and while she hasn't been given much material beyond sullen teen daughter in the episodes available to screen, we know the depth of Kenney's talent so we imagine there is more in store.  As for DJ's young daughter Mary (Jayden Rey), there is a lot of mystery surrounding her. She's adorable, and like Keshia Knight Pulliam on ""The Cosby Show"" or the Olsen Twins on ""Full House,"" that is her primary duty so far, but we are eager to find out more about DJ's life, his wife and how this family came to be.  It's a rarity on television to get the opportunity to revisit our favorite fictional families during the next chapter of their lives, and the Conners were always one of the most fully realized and believable clans on the airwaves. Their return is at equal times totally familiar and comfortable, while at the same time refreshed for the new millennium. Best of all, it's every bit as funny as we remember. Now, if someone could tell us were 20 years went?  ""Roseanne"" premieres Tuesday night at 8 p.m. ET on ABC with back-to-back episodes.

db3fc56c-6012-49a4-a281-d99c4ee6e66e,"Director J.J. Abrams has tapped the filmmaker and producer to serve as second unit director on his upcoming film, marking a major milestone for the series.  The ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù universe is making some changes.  While the ever-expanding movie franchise has been taken to task plenty of times for its repeated hiring of exactly one type of filmmaker ‚Äî white males, including recent turns from Ron Howard and Rian Johnson ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Force Awakens‚Äù director J.J. Abrams is bringing someone brand new into the fold: filmmaker Victoria Mahoney. The filmmaker and producer (and, fun fact, bit actor in ‚ÄúLegally Blonde‚Äù) will serve as the second unit director on Abrams‚Äô upcoming untitled ‚ÄúEpisode IX,‚Äù marking the first time an African-American woman has served in any directing capacity on a ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù film.  The news was first announced by fellow Disney filmmaker, Ava DuVernay, who shared a picture of Mahoney and Abrams hanging out at a recent open house at her own production and distribution company, ARRAY.  Happy to share this historic news. A black woman directing stories in a galaxy far, far away. First unit director #JJAbrams. Second unit director @VictoriaMahoney. #StarWarsE9 #StarWars pic.twitter.com/s689jv9I4u ‚Äî Ava DuVernay (@ava) April 17, 2018  Abrams is currently in pre-production on the film, and Mahoney will step into a role that requires a close attention to detail, mostly dedicated to shooting essential pieces like establishing shots, stunts, inserts, and cutaways. Mahoney is herself already an established filmmaker who has spent the past few years working inside the television space, including stints on DuVernay‚Äôs ‚ÄúQueen Sugar,‚Äù plus ‚ÄúGypsy,‚Äù ‚ÄúGrey‚Äôs Anatomy,‚Äù and more. She just completed directing a pilot for CBS entitled ‚ÄúRed Line,‚Äù which was executive produced by DuVernay and fellow heavy-hitter Greg Berlanti. Also on deck: Mahoney is penning a TV adaptation of the novel ‚ÄúDawn‚Äù for DuVernay and Charles King‚Äôs MACRO.  But she‚Äôs no stranger to filmmaking, and Mahoney‚Äôs debut feature ‚Äî ‚ÄúYelling at the Sky,‚Äù which was loosely based on her own life ‚Äî premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in 2011.  While Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kenned has repeatedly said that ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù is eager to tap more diverse talent, the hiring of Mahoney is the first major sign of progress in years. Last year, Kennedy drew ire after a Variety interview during which she told the trade that although finding a female director for one of their features was a priority, the studio ‚Äúwant[s] to make sure that when we bring a female director in to do ‚ÄòStar Wars,‚Äô they‚Äôre set up for success‚Ä¶They‚Äôre gigantic films, and you can‚Äôt come into them with essentially no experience.‚Äù  She also added that, because of the perceived lack of female filmmakers with blockbuster experience believed to be essential to making a ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù film, they were actively looking for appropriate talent. Kennedy said at the time, ‚ÄúWe want to really start to focus in on people we would love to work with and see what kinds of things they‚Äôre doing to progress up that ladder now, and then pull them in when the time is right.‚Äù  ‚ÄúStar Wars: Episode IX‚Äù is currently slated to open on December 20, 2019.

80a41e64-9a37-4d03-887a-a27802e9c844,"Naomie Olindo has a voice, and she's not afraid to use it this season of Southern Charm. Of course, the southern belle has never been afraid to share her true opinion, but this season, she's really not holding anything back, whether it's trying to get to the bottom of her issues with ex-boyfriend Craig Conover or calling out J.D. Madison.  But now as Naomie relives the months following her breakup with Craig as this season of Southern Charm airs, she recently told The Daily Dish that she now wishes she hadn't been ""so mean to Craig."" ""Oh my gosh, I think that's probably my biggest regret. It's funny because now I'm in such a different headspace than I was eight or nine months ago, and so watching back how angry I was all the time, and I'm like, 'Why did you let this drag out so long? Why didn't you just get over it and act like a nice human being?'"" Naomie said during an interview over the phone. ""It's very weird just to watch back, just the anger, really. I wish I had been nicer to him because Craig is such a nice person. He's like a puppy. I wish I hadn't been such a bitch, but oh well. It is what it is now.""  After working on their relationship last season of Southern Charm, including going to see a counselor, Naomie and Craig ultimately decided to end their relationship prior to the start of Season 5. Naomie attributed the breakup to ""a million little things that added up"" that eventually ""just kind of blew up."" ""I think it was just a culmination of things that at the end of it, we were just two very different people that couldn't get along,"" she explained. ""It was sad because we did care about each other. You saw, we just could not get along. I was 22 when we started dating [she's 25 now]. When I was younger, you just start dating someone because you have a couple things in common, and you're attracted to each other and you have fun together. You don't think about the attributes that would make you get along with someone, their work ethic, and all the different adult things that matter that don't matter when you're a 22-year-old kid.""  Those ""adult things,"" as Naomie put it, continued to be a topic of conversation between her and Craig, as we saw when she questioned his lifestyle choices at Cameran Eubanks' baby shower at Patricia Altschul's house earlier this season (clip above). ""People think, 'Oh, why can't you support his sewing?' It had nothing to do with me not wanting a boyfriend who sews. I don't care at all about that. Hobbies are important, and I thought it was great,"" Naomie said. ""The reason I had a problem with it was Craig is a procrastinator, and he was using sewing as a way to procrastinate doing things that he actually needed to do, you know, important things. ... Instead of doing something that he had a deadline on or whatever, he'd just sit and sew all night, not the actual fact that he sewed.""  Naomie clarified that she does see that Craig has made accomplishments during the time that she's known him, such as the two investment properties he owns mentioned during the episode, which she called ""an impressive feat."" ""But that's not what I cared about. What I cared about was the day-to-day,"" she explained. ""But if you sleep all day now to the point where I don't even want to see you anymore because you go to bed when I get up in the morning and then sleep until I go to bed at night, it doesn't work. So that was the issue. I'm very proud of everything he's accomplished, and I think it's amazing. My problem was with the daily stuff, the small things.""  How loved ones are going to take a breakup after getting to know a significant other is always a concern, but Naomie said that her parents, who have gotten to know Craig as we've seen on Southern Charm in the past, took the news of the split well. ""My family's very supportive, and they love Craig. They would never say anything bad about him,"" Naomie said. ""They want both of us to be happy, and I think they understood that we were unhappy together and that breaking up was probably the best option. So they were supportive.""  Naomie has also been able to lean on the so-called ""Breakup Bunch,"" including Kathryn C. Dennis, Chelsea Meissner, and Danni Baird, during her split, as well as all of the Charmers, really. ""Even the guys were incredibly supportive, like Shep [Rose] and Austen [Kroll] and Whitney [Sudler-Smith], they were lovely through the whole thing. No one chose sides, no one did anything like that. It was actually a very good reaction,"" Naomie shared. ""I'll go to lunch with Austen one day, then he'll go to lunch with Craig the next day, and it's not a thing. So that's been nice.""  We'll see more of Craig and Naomie's post-breakup life this season of Southern Charm.

One month after Hilton revealed that Lohan will not be invited to her upcoming wedding with Chris Zylka, explaining ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all,"" Hilton has become more specific about her issues with Lohan.  The heiress called the actress a ""pathological liar"" on Instagram after the fan account @paris2000s posted a few old videos of Lohan talking about their relationship. The videos, taken in 2006, show Lohan exhibiting conflicting feelings about Hilton. In one clip, Lohan says, ""This is a video that Paris Hilton... and I'm saying this on tape... she hit me last night, for no reason, apparently at my friend's house and I didn't know she'd be there. She hit me; she hit me with a drink and poured it all over me and it hurts and it's not okay.""  In another video, though, the pair are still together. As Hilton is getting into a car, she shouts at Lohan who is approaching the vehicle, ""Lindsay, tell them the truth,"" to which Lohan replies, ""Paris is my friend,"" Lohan says, ""She's a nice person. Please leave us alone...she never did that, she's a good girl.""  Then, in another clip, Lohan calls Paris a ""c-nt,"" before a friend of her whispers something to the actress and Lohan clarifies her stance, saying, ""I never said that. Paris is my friend. I love her. I‚Äôve known her since I was 15 years old.‚Äù  Loading View on Instagram  Hilton left her own opinion in the comments section of the video, which was posted with the caption, ""The chronicles of the '00s troubled star Lindsay Lohan and her chaotic backtracking situations,"" writing, simply, ""#pathologicalliar.""  It's worth noting that 2006 was the year Lohan and Hilton's rumored feud began, after a video of Hilton laughing at their mutual friend Brandon Davis calling the actress a ""fire crotch"" went viral. Last month, Hilton clarified their current relationship status, saying, ""I don't have any drama with anyone but I choose to not surround myself with certain people. Life is too short.""  Pinterest ¬© Instagram  Lohan is more or less attempting to do the same as she has stepped away from the spotlight to work on a film with an all-female team in Saudi Arabia.

Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP  Laura Dern won an Emmy Sunday night for her supporting role in HBO's ""Big Little Lies."" And while she thanked her co-stars (many of them nominees as well) in her speech, she may have snubbed one of them on her way to the stage.  In the CBS broadcast of her winning the award, it shows Dern hugging co-stars Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley (who she beat in the category of supporting actress in a limited TV series or movie), but skipping over Reese Witherspoon, who also starred in ""Big Little Lies.""  People are freaking out over the apparent snub.  A more likely solution is that the aired footage simply didn't show the hug between Witherspoon and Dern. At the beginning of the shot where Dern hugs her co-stars, it looks like she's pulling away from Witherspoon, as if they had just embraced.  Laura Dern getting up, probably from hugging Reese Witherspoon. CBS  It's also possible that Dern was just gripping the seat in front of her as she was getting up. It's not totally clear.  Dern also, after all, did give a shoutout to Witherspoon in her speech. ""I share this with my tribe of four ladies,"" she said, referring to her co-stars Witherspoon, Kidman, Woodley, and Zoe Kravitz. So there probably isn't any beef between them.  Also, it's just kind of awkward to hug someone in the seat in front of you. The chair is in the way. What's she supposed to do? Like, hug the back of her neck? Tap her on the shoulder?

The tabloid alleges that the ‚ÄúStarboy‚Äù singer may have slept with an Irish model while he was on tour in Dublin. But Gossip Cop is on the case and they claim that the story is nothing but the work of a ‚ÄúBad Liar.‚Äù  As Gossip Cop reports, Star Magazine says that it ‚Äúlearned that The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, invited Irish Instagram model Ava Van Rose back to his hotel the night before his performance at the Longitude Festival in Dublin on July 15.‚Äù They say that they got the information from a so-called insider who told them that the model spent some time with The Weeknd.  The article then speculates about how Selena will react to the ‚Äúnews‚Äù that Abel may have cheated on her, implying that Gomez would be emotionally gutted by the news.  ‚ÄúShe hoped Abel would prove her wrong. If Selena finds out about this [hookup with Van Rose], there‚Äôs no telling what she might do!‚Äù  But Gossip Cop insists that the story is based on what they call ‚Äúunsubstantiated rumors.‚Äù They say that the story was first published in The Irish Sun and was derived from an insider in the model‚Äôs circle. Even though these claims about the Weeknd are pretty explosive, the story hasn‚Äôt been picked up by any of the major celebrity news publications. This is a pretty good hint that the story isn‚Äôt credible. As Gossip Cop notes, the rumors about Abel and Ava were published by Radar Online, but that‚Äôs expected because it‚Äôs Star Magazine‚Äòs sister publication.

The hotel is located near the entrance of the park in the suburbs of Paris, France.  McLean-Glass, who is from Devon, England, wrote that she decided to book the experience for Noah as early Christmas gift.  ‚ÄúI knew that there would be NOTHING he'd love more than to get to wear a pretty dress, put make up on like Mummy does and have his photo taken being one of his beloved Disney Princesses,‚Äù she wrote.

Time to set your final away message  AOL cut off access to AIM from third-party chat clients back in March, hinting at this eventual shutdown. It‚Äôs hard to imagine that many people are still using AIM, so that change, nor this upcoming shutdown, are likely to make a huge difference.  AIM was one of the first and most successful instant messengers, widely used in the late ‚Äò90s and even throughout the 2000s. I was still using AIM to chat with my friends throughout college at the end of the decade, including to stay in touch with my (not-yet) significant other while she was studying abroad.  But with the proliferation of smartphones, everything has changed. Text messaging has taken over for desktop instant messaging apps, and increasingly, we‚Äôre seeing other social apps, like Snapchat and Instagram, take over for those in certain ways. For straight messaging, Facebook also makes things much easier, since you‚Äôre already connected to everyone you know and can just start up a chat without exchanging arcane things like screen names. In fact, Facebook has multiple billion-user messaging services at this point, Messenger and WhatsApp.  Other classic chat apps have shut down in recent years, too. MSN Messenger shut down in 2014, and Yahoo Messenger shut down last year (although Yahoo also launched a new messaging service under the same name).

Is Dwayne Johnson running for president in 2020?

His co-star in the upcoming film Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Kevin Hart, he says, would ""completely sabotage the campaign.""  ""Here's the problem. It's been very flattering that there's been this really interesting uptick in public opinion wanting that to happen, but the problem is this guy to my right would completely sabotage the campaign,"" Johnson said when asked about his political plans for 2020 during a group discussion with Hart, Jessica Chastain, Jack Black and Rebel Wilson.  Hart emphatically agreed: ""100 percent.""  ""I will take you down. I don't want it to happen because it would make you that much better than me, and I just don't want that to happen,"" he joked with his friend and co-star.  When Norton pressed Chastain on whether she would be a ""cheerleader"" for Johnson, she said she definitely would. ""Have you seen his Instagram?"" she asked.  Rebel Wilson also chimed in, telling Norton she would be ""prepared to donate"" to a potential Johnson campaign.  The rumors of a Johnson presidential run picked up steam after the actor told GQ that he thinks a campaign is ""a real possibility"" in June. In October Johnson continued to fan the flames of fan speculation when he commented, ""I think 'The People's President' has a really nice ring to that.

NBC‚Äôs last live musical, ‚ÄúHairspray Live,‚Äù drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 9 million viewers back in December 2016.

Elsewhere on broadcast, a new episode of ‚ÄúAmerican Idol‚Äù (1.6, 7.4 million) held steady with last week‚Äôs Sunday episode. ‚ÄúDeception‚Äù (0.8, 4.2 million) ticked up slightly in the demo.

Freshman drama ‚ÄúInstinct‚Äù (0.6, 6.7 million) slipped over 50% in the demo in its third week. ‚ÄúNCIS: New Orleans‚Äù (0.8, 7.1 million) and ‚ÄúMadam Secretary‚Äù (0.5, 5.7 million) were also down versus last week.

CBS was second in viewers with 6.9 million. Fox was fourth in viewers with 1.7 million.

The live musical, which starred John Legend in the title role, averaged a 6.0 rating in Nielsen‚Äôs metered market households. That is good enough to tie with ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù on CBS in households as well as top ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerican Idol,‚Äù which drew a 4.5. It is also on par with the 5.9 that NBC‚Äôs last live musical, ‚ÄúHairspray Live,‚Äù drew back in 2016. ‚ÄúHairspray Live‚Äù ultimately drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and just over 9 million viewers, making it one of the lower-rated live broadcast musicals to date.

During his recent appearance at the Graham Norton Show, the 35-year-old actor revealed that he went through great lengths to impress girls in order to ‚Äúget lucky‚Äù.

On one particular day, I was in an amateur drama play and was going to a party after.

I also decided to cut up the rest of wig and glue it to my private parts just in case I got lucky‚Äú.  That reckless move backfired on the young Brit when it came time to remove the improvised pubic hair. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get lucky and removing the bits of wig ripped out the very small amount of natural hair I had down there.

732e5679-07b7-4bf4-ae0b-9a84840639f4,"First it was Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Futurama and Bob‚Äôs Burgers. Now 30 Rock is the newest series to leave Netflix, the streaming service has confirmed.  There were early rumors that 30 Rock would be leaving earlier this month, but Netflix has just confirmed that the show will be removed due to a license expiration.  ‚Äú30 Rock will be rolling off the service in October,‚Äù a statement originally reported by Vulture reads, which Polygon has confirmed. ‚ÄúThe license for a TV series or movie is for a set period of time, which means every title eventually comes up for renewal. At that point we take a variety of factors into account to determine if we will renew the title. As we expand our content portfolio, our goal is to continue offering great movies and TV series for our members, while also providing content that is available exclusively on Netflix.‚Äù  It‚Äôs unclear where 30 Rock will go next. Unlike Fox, which signed a deal with Hulu two months ago and has started migrating its series over, NBCUniversal hasn‚Äôt announced a new major streaming partner. 30 Rock may live on in NBC‚Äôs own app, but the network hasn‚Äôt announced any plans at this time. Polygon has reached out to NBC for comment.  30 Rock may not be the only popular, non-original show to leave Netflix next month, ether. Netflix hasn‚Äôt confirmed if How I Met Your Mother will leave next month, but it seems very likely, albeit for much more apparent reasons. When Hulu and Fox announced their partnership in July, the streaming service company confirmed the new deal meant it could ‚Äúadd nearly 3,000 episodes of hit comedies, popular dramas and iconic series,‚Äù including How I Met Your Mother. If How I Met Your Mother doesn‚Äôt leave in October, it could still be removed from Netflix in November or December.  Although it‚Äôs not an exclusive deal by any means, Netflix isn‚Äôt a streaming service that wants to offer the same content that can be seen on a competitors network. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings and chief content officer Ted Sarandos have said multiple times that the goal was to make more of Netflix‚Äôs content 50 percent original. That‚Äôs why Netflix is spending north of $6 billion this year on original content.  If Hulu is going to become the go-to destination for Fox series ‚Äî including American Dad, How I Met Your Mother and House ‚Äî then Netflix will cut its losses and pick up the exclusive rights to other shows. One of Netflix‚Äôs biggest exclusive deals was Friends, which also belongs to NBCUniversal.  In light of the 30 Rock news, a petition has started up asking Netflix to renegotiate the licensing terms and keep it on the streaming service.  For now, both 30 Rock and How I Met Your Mother are still available to stream. Get your binging in now.  Update: Netflix confirmed on Oct. 23 that all nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother would be leaving the streaming service on Nov. 13. The show is already available to stream on Hulu.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,592

On Wednesday, July 4, 2018, The Crown star addressed reports romantically linking her with Mission: Impossible ‚Äî Fallout co-star Tom Cruise. Speculation surrounding their rumored romance began in May 2017 after the two were spotted kissing while filming a scene for the action movie.  ""Even though the crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, 'The next wife falls at his feet,'"" Kirby began during an interview with the August 2018 issue of Marie Claire UK. At the time, she had already been in her current relationship with actor Callum Turner for nearly two years.  The Netflix star added, ""The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn't think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, 'Are you OK?' I don't think they believe anything they read now because you just can't. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.""  While there are a number of real-life couples who did actually meet on set, Kirby, 30, and Cruise, 56, clearly are not one of them. However, the tabloid fodder gave the actress a crash course in how to balance her newfound fame with keeping her personal life private.  ""It's a weird feeling. I definitely don't feel it yet. I've been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,"" Kirby continued. ""[Turner's] just completely wonderful and he's my best friend, so that's ‚Ä¶ I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not. If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don't, then it's not.""  Kirby isn't the only celeb to recently dismiss relationship rumors.

With less than three weeks to go until the January 17 premiere, the show is digging a bit deeper into the mystery with a behind-the-scenes look explaining why this shocking murder is truly a perfect American crime to dissect 20 years later.  ‚ÄúThis particular manhunt is the largest failed FBI manhunt in history,‚Äù actor Darren Criss tells us in the video. The failed manhunt centers around Criss‚Äô character, Andrew Cunanan, a hustler and grifter who landed in Miami after a killing spree that saw at least four closeted gay men dead throughout the Midwest. Cunanan‚Äôs crimes were tangled with his fear of being outed and his use of his sexuality to control his victims by telling them he would out them to their families if they didn‚Äôt go along with him.  Before heading to Florida, Cunanan was put on the FBI‚Äôs most wanted list. When they didn‚Äôt track him to the coastal city in time, Cunanan managed to kill fashion designer Versace on the steps of his Miami home. The killer eventually took his own life without ever being arrested.  Executive producer Nina Jacobson says that in choosing the crimes they dramatize for ACS, they want to explore how these issues affect all Americans, and not just those at the center of the crimes. In The Assassination of Gianni Versace, the show looks at gay culture and how Americans treated gay men, the AIDS epidemic, and more in the ‚Äô90s, all culminating with Cunanan‚Äôs killing spree.  ‚ÄúPeople were scared at the fact that this man was killing gay men,‚Äù Ricky Martin, who plays Versace‚Äôs partner Antonio D‚ÄôAmico, says in the clip. ‚ÄúStill some people don‚Äôt understand why it happened.‚Äù Executive producer Brad Simpson agrees, saying, ‚ÄúAndrew‚Äôs journey is a journey through politics of homosexuality as they played across America in the 1990s.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe truth is,‚Äù Criss quips, ‚Äúfear and prejudice, unfortunately, is always in fashion.‚Äù  Will you watch this season of American Crime Story?

London-based baker Claire Ptak and her team created a lemon elderflower cake for Harry and Meghan's wedding's reception.  Kensington Palace first shared the wedding cake plans back in March, revealing that Ptak, who was raised in California and now owns Violet Cakes in London, was selected to bake it. Many were surprised that the couple chose a lemon elderflower cake for their Windsor Castle reception, since most royal wedding cakes are traditionally fruit cake. But Harry and Meghan broke from tradition to choose a spring-inspired cake covered in buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.

9987f585-50bb-46f3-a325-55f624550217,"It's a good time to be a '90s television fan, if only because the world has finally realized how much we miss our long-dead sitcoms. Full House is getting a spinoff series, Boy Meets World has a reincarnation in Disney Channel's Girl Meets World, and even the Magic School Bus is chugging back onto TV. So why not bring back Clarissa Explains It All? After all, the series launched Melissa Joan Hart's career AND provided us with endless hours of family-friendly entertainment, all told through the perspective of a savvy, colorfully dressed tween. We know where Hart is today ‚Äî she's back polishing off yet another sitcom with Melissa & Joey and will probably make a plethora of ABC Family TV movies in the near future ‚Äî but she's not the only person I want to keep track of post- Clarissa Explains It All . Whatever happened to Sam, aka actor Sean O'Neal?  I always wanted a BFF like Sam, if only because his mode of transportation (a ladder into Clarissa's bedroom window) always seemed pretty rad. The actor who played him, O'Neal, was in his early teens while on the show, and now is a full-fledged adult. So what has O'Neal been up to in his post-Clarissa years? There's not much out there about O'Neal's later years, but here's what I could find.  Noir  In 2001, O'Neal provided additional voices for an English dub of this anime series, as well as portraying the character Vint.  RahXephon  O'Neal also provided character voices for this anime series, which he worked on in 2002.  Development Hell  O'Neal appeared as a background actor on this 2013 web series about a production company.  Today  That's unfortunately all we know about O'Neal's post-Clarissa ventures in acting, but there are certain other things we do know about him. For example, we know that he is NOT the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club, though I'm sure it's been a struggle for the other Sean O'Neal to constantly explain to people that he was never on Clarissa Explains It All.  (You can see why we'd all believe it, though.)  Screencrush reported that when it was active, O'Neal's website said that after Clarissa Explains It All, ""he was approached to be the lead of a new boy band in Orlando in the vein of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync."" It would appear that such a band never happened, because I'm pretty sure all of Sam's many fans would've gladly bought his album ‚Äî and there's no record of it ever existing. Here's what appears to a recent photo of O'Neal, or at least, more recent than old Clarissa episodes.  So where'd you go, O'Neal? Are you secretly lying to the world and really ARE the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club? Have you gone into hiding because too many '90s girls want you to climb into their windows? Or are you just leading a perfectly happy, normal life somewhere out of the public eye? If you want to talk, feel free to drop me a line ‚Äî or better yet, just climb in through the window.

When asked if something held him back from getting married he revealed it was him and said: ‚ÄòI think I probably just got scared.‚Äô  However he also said: 'There are a lot of beautiful women, there are opportunities, but I think at the same time, if you find the right person, I believe in monogamy I believe in when you meet somebody who is right it will be right and you will stay there.'

48b18035-acef-4e82-aff7-7dfc91f4e8c7,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have been dating since 2016, and most of the relationship was formed over a long distance. So now that they've made things official and are about to get married, it's fair to wonder if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are living together now or if royal protocol has kept them under different roofs. The answer is not all that surprising.  When the couple first met, Suits was still filming in Toronto, which is where Meghan was posted up. To visit each other, the couple had to carry out an elaborate bait and switch plan to distract the paparazzi and keep their romance a secret, according to Us Weekly. Meghan would travel to London for events and they took vacations together, but it wasn't until late 2016 that the The Sun reported they were ""virtually inseparable"" and that Markle had ""practically moved in"" with Harry. By that time, the couple had made their relationship public.  An anonymous source also told the outlet, ""They‚Äôve taken things to the next level. They‚Äôre practically living together. She cooks for him, he pops out to the gym and they‚Äôre just enjoying hanging out."" For those who might be scandalized by the young couple living together before marriage, it's actually a lot more common than some might think -- even accounting for royal protocol.  A source told HollywoodLife last year, ""The royal family has had to move with the times in order to survive, and they are nowhere near as stuffy and old fashioned as they used to be. Prince William and Kate Middleton lived together before marrying, so it‚Äôs no shocker that Harry and Meghan plan to do the same.""  WPA Pool/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Right now, they're living in Nottingham Cottage, a 1,300 square foot house on the Kensington Palace compound, according to People. Ken Wharfe, a former police protection officer for the family, told the outlet that it's a ""lovely, classic Victorian cottage.""  He added that it's ""not very big, incredibly small,"" which is understandable by royal standards. Wharfe elaborated that the cottage, one of just a few at Kensington Palace, was originally used for estate staff, but in the past few decades has been occupied by family members. He added of the properties:  They are well restored, typical country cottages and originally used for the estate workers. In the past 40 years or so they‚Äôve been accommodation for senior members of the household. They‚Äôll be updated but there certainly wouldn‚Äôt be room for servants. Not far from there are apartments, almshouses that housed some of Princess Margaret‚Äôs staff.  Prince William and Kate Middleton also stayed in ""Nott Cott,"" as it's referred to by the British press, for two years whenever they were in London.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  For their wedding, Queen Elizabeth is supposedly gifting the couple a house at Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk, which is where the entire royal family spends the holiday season. That house has 21-rooms, which might be fun to decorate and make into a home, especially if they eventually have children.  The catch? That home is about 110 miles from London, and it seems a little odd that the young couple would want to be that far away from the hustle of the city. Harry did grow up at Kensington Palace, and Markle seems suited to city life, so it's entirely possible that they'll stay in Nottingham Cottage and keep the Sandringham Estate house for country getaways.  Then again, there are reportedly no air conditioners in the cottage and, according to Vanity Fair, Kate Middleton set up an entire system of fans when she lived there, so who knows how long they'll last in London-town after the wedding.  Wherever they end up living, they'll likely be very happy. And in the worst case scenario, they can always ask the Queen for some central air!",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,760

Protesting a tweet asking ‚ÄúWho would you save, Baby Groot or a porg?‚Äù he points out that Baby Groot is an entirely new being that is, at best, a son.  First Groot is dead. Baby Groot is his son. ‚Äî James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  This isn‚Äôt the first time Gunn has mentioned this tidbit, which never fails to get Guardians of the Galaxy and Groot fans worked up. In a 2017 Facebook post, Gunn wrote, ‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs more obvious in Vol. 2, as Baby Groot has a different personality than Groot, none of his memories, and is much, much dumber.‚Äù When the issue resurfaced today, Gunn lamented on Twitter, ‚ÄúThe internet is like Groundhog Day every time I point out first Groot died.‚Äù This time, however, the news seems to have gone viral, leading Gunn to repeatedly emphasize the point to people asking questions and freaking out.  Of course they are. Would you think an infant was your dead grandfather? That little jerk has not clue what‚Äôs going on. ‚Äî James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  It‚Äôs canon AF (and it‚Äôs in the movies). ‚Äî James Gunn (@JamesGunn) February 27, 2018  Given that Guardians of the Galaxy takes place in a fictional universe that includes talking raccoons, a scientific analysis may be beside the point. But if I were to push up my glasses here and talk about the technicalities, I might mention that asexual plant reproduction √† la stem-cutting ‚Äî like Rocket growing a new Groot from a twig ‚Äî would actually qualify as a clone. That‚Äôs because the new plant is genetically identical to the original, which means it‚Äôs not necessarily offspring. But I‚Äôm not here to get into a science fight!  What I do take issue with is Gunn implying that everyone who is shocked by this news is a dummy. James, my man, it is certainly not clear from the first film that the Groot sprout is not, in fact, the old Groot. Groot shows off his regenerative powers early in the film; the principle of Chekov‚Äôs gun would lead us, as viewers, to assume these facts are related. As for why Baby Groot is so stupid in the second film? I mean‚Ä¶ he has a tiny baby brain. Have you ever met a baby? They‚Äôre dumb.  Gunn wants Groot‚Äôs sacrifice in the first film to carry weight. But this Groundhog Day-style revelation he talks about muddies the revelatory waters. If he is in fact introducing a new Groot at the end of the first film, the timing is confusing at best. Offering up a cuter, tinier version of the same character in the credits is an emotional salve to heal up the wounds caused by Groot‚Äôs death before anyone leaves their seats, whether it‚Äôs a son, a clone, or just a great merchandising opportunity.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,753

a8bb2799-524c-4ab6-b2dc-10e270cfd77c,"Can music fans expect an amazing ""Starboy""/""Swish Swish"" mashup sometime soon? Katy Perry and The Weeknd recently had dinner together, according to multiple sources. But since the two singers are both currently single ‚Äî with Perry's breakup from Orlando Bloom and The Weeknd recently splitting from Selena Gomez ‚Äî could this dinner date be a sign of anything more than a friendship or a possible collaboration going on between the two?  Sources including Glamour UK and Vogue, reported that the two singers had a fashionable dinner date. According to The Sun's report, Perry and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, dined together in West Hollywood and apparently had a great time with each other. They then reportedly went home separately. The Sun's report suggests that the date between the pair was romantic and not just a dinner between friends, but take that with a grain of salt. Not only are there are no details available from the singers themselves, but other publications are reporting that they simply got dinner, no romance involved.  While many sources have reported on this dinner between Perry and The Weeknd, most outlets have yet to report anything regarding a potential relationship between the pair. Sorry to burst the bubble of any Katy Perry and The Weeknd shippers, but it's probably just a rumor that the two are dating ‚Äî at least right now.  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The Weeknd has found himself linked to a couple of different women after his breakup with Gomez, and it's not likely that he's actually dating every single person he'e seen with. On Nov. 11, Us Weekly reported that he was seen holding hands with Yovanna Ventura, who was previously linked to Justin Bieber, who is currently dating his ex-girlfriend (and The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, for that matter) Gomez. According to an Us Weekly source, ""[The Weeknd] was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the whole night.""  There were also reports that The Weeknd was back in contact with his ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid. Although they reportedly haven't gotten back together romantically, People reported on Nov. 17 that ""He is talking to Bella a lot and they've hung out too."" The Weeknd and Hadid apparently ""still love each other"" and are seeing where things go with them, according to E!. It was also reported by Hollywood Life that he sent Hadid flowers before the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show ""with a sweet note"". The abundance of rumors surrounding The Weeknd's love life, show that romance rumors might be quick to catch-on whenever he's seen hanging out with anyone, as in the case with Perry.  Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Romance rumors surrounding the ""Starboy"" singer have been abundant ever since he and fellow singer Gomez were reported to have broken up. According to E!, the two singers dated for 10 months before they called it quits in late October. The split was reportedly amicable and it had nothing to do with Gomez hanging out with her ex. A source said, ""The relationship was basically over before Justin Bieber and Selena hung out."" It wasn't long after those two lovebirds' reunion hit the headlines. But, since it doesn't sound as though there wasn't any bad blood with that breakup, it's likely that The Weeknd is just focusing on doing his own thing.  Does his own thing involve Katy Perry? Probably not in a romantic way. Until the two singers confirm anything about a potential relationship, it's more likely that they are just two friends hanging out and possibly making some fans' pop dreams come true.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,701
5a591582-07d2-48f1-96f3-731d0b01d5c1,"Preliminary polling showed that there was high interest among women in an Oprah Winfrey presidential candidacy in 2020. According to a Quinnipiac poll in January, women would back the former talk-show host 58 percent to 33 percent against President Trump. Men were evenly divided, with 45 percent supporting each.  But Winfrey shared that some influential men have encouraged her to consider a run for the White House.  ‚ÄúI had a lot of wealthy men calling, telling me that they would run my campaign and raise $1 billion for me. I think that when you have that many people whose opinions you value coming at you, it's worthy of thinking about,‚Äù she told ""60 Minutes Overtime‚Äù correspondent Ann Silvio.  Despite the offers, Winfrey said the lack of spiritual confirmation is what has kept her from seriously weighing a run.  ‚ÄúIf God actually wanted me to run, wouldn't God kind of tell me? And I haven't heard that,‚Äù she said.  So for now, it seems as though we can count Winfrey out of a presidential race.  ‚ÄúI am actually humbled by the fact that people think that I could be a leader of the free world, but it's just not in my spirit,‚Äù she told Silvio. ‚ÄúIt's not in my DNA.‚Äù  Much of the interest in the political aspirations of the mogul was rooted in her stirring Golden Globes speech on the sexual abuse and harassment of women by men in power. Winfrey, who in the past has talked about her own sexual abuse, has historically made respect for women part of her identity.  ‚ÄúI was just trying to give a good speech. I was looking for a way to express what was going on in this moment in terms of gender and class and race. I cared about landing that speech in the room,‚Äù Winfrey said.  Despite her past declarations of disinterest in running for president, many Americans rallied behind the moment. Overall, the Quinnipiac poll had Winfrey winning 52 percent of the vote to Trump's 39 percent if she ran against him in 2020.  Trump's overall approval rating has inched up since Winfrey's speech, but he is in the midst of a scandal about the White House's handling of allegations against now-former staff secretary Rob Porter, who was accused of abuse by two ex-wives. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by almost 20 women, has regularly stood up for men on his side who have been accused of sexual abuse or harassment, including Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore in Alabama, Fox News Channel's Roger Ailes and former talk-show host Bill O'Reilly.  And Saturday, in the middle of the Porter scandal, he did it again.  ‚ÄúPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused ‚Äî life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?‚Äù Trump tweeted.  A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll showed that more than 8 in 10 men view sexual harassment of women in the workplace as a problem. And only 35 percent of men think that the amount of national attention given to the issue has been sufficient.  It is clear from recent polling, Winfrey‚Äôs claims about male political donors as well as criticism against Trump that men also are looking for a leader who can respond effectively to the crisis of the abuse of women.  But it won‚Äôt be Winfrey, apparently.  However, the men who would back her in a presidential contest need not worry about her disengaging.  ‚ÄúI do feel that I have a responsibility, as a person who has a big voice in this country, to use it to promote justice and kindness and goodwill in the world. But it has never felt to me that that was supposed to be political,‚Äù Winfrey said.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,746

05b1b001-a1ac-4fcf-8fea-66301c883070,"  Terry Crews arrives at an event in Beverly Hills, Calif., in November 2017. (Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Last October, as the #MeToo earthquake was beginning to rip through the Hollywood power structure following abuse allegations connected to producer Harvey Weinstein, actor Terry Crews significantly readjusted the national conversation.  In tweets, the ‚ÄúBrooklyn Nine-Nine‚Äù star laid out his own claims of experiencing sexual harassment. At a party in 2016, a ‚Äúhigh-level Hollywood executive‚Äù came up to Crews and ‚Äúgroped my privates,‚Äù the actor wrote. Crews later publicly identified the executive as Adam Venit, a longtime industry power-player who represented marquee names such as Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn. Crews went on to file a police report about the incident, as well as a lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor.  But Crews‚Äôs revelation reverberated well beyond his own case. His public stand detonated stereotypes by showing a 240-pound former NFL player could also be the victim of sexual assault, thus widening the lens of the #MeToo movement. Time included Crews among the ‚Äúthe silence breakers‚Äù named in the magazine‚Äôs person of the year feature.  Now, Crews‚Äôs legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.  ‚ÄúTerry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,‚Äù the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. ‚ÄúIt will be dismissed.‚Äù  According to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews‚Äôs allegation.  After news of the settlement and Venit‚Äôs exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: ‚ÄúACCOUNTABILITY,‚Äù he wrote.  That was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.  ‚ÄúPeople need to be held accountable,‚Äù the actor told ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù last November. ‚ÄúThis is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he‚Äôs one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, ‚ÄòWho is going to believe you?‚Äô‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,‚Äù Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. ‚ÄúAs I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man‚Äôs horseplay is another man‚Äôs humiliation.‚Äù  In his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. ‚ÄúVenit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews‚Äôs penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,‚Äù the lawsuit stated.  Crews, who was not Venit‚Äôs client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of ‚Äúcorporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.‚Äù  In court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.  According to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of ‚Äúthe lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.‚Äù  But the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency‚Äôs internal review determined that Crews‚Äôs allegation about Venit was ‚Äúindicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.‚Äù The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency‚Äôs motion picture group.  Venit‚Äôs demotion ‚Äî and now exit ‚Äî from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school.

252656f1-e306-42fd-8925-48ef4bc68639,"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have ended their relationship once again, at least temporarily.  Reports have surfaced suggesting that the pair, who reunited in 2017 after nearly five years apart that was plagued with reconciliation rumors, are taking some time for themselves.  On March 11, 2018, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources confirmed the news of their split.  Rumors are swirling about the reasons for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's recent breakup  In addition to various reports about Justin and Selena's breakup itself, a number of different theories about their reason for taking time apart have surfaced. None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.  So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?  Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey  During their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.  Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.  A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'  However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.  'They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn't base her relationship off what her mom thinks,' a source said.  So apparently Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are on a break and all I can picture Justin singing ""What Do You Mean?"" ‚Äî Maddie (@maddie_harper99) March 14, 2018  Selena Gomez's family  It's not just Mandy that's not on board with the Biebs. According to Us, Selena Gomez's entire family had qualms about her and Justin Bieber getting back together.  The source said: 'Justin's family loves Selena, but Selena's family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don't trust Justin.  'Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed...but her family just isn't budging right now.'  E! shared a similar report, claiming 'family pressure' and other issues led to their breakup.  'She's on a break with Justin partly because of family pressure but also because of some issues surrounding his birthday,' a source said.  'She wanted to have a quiet birthday celebration with Justin and he wanted to go big and involve all of his church friends. They had a disagreement that didn't end well.'  jelena is fine. they hate the media and are doing everything they can to avoid it. and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that because they have nothing to prove to anyone. stop being so negative and good night ÔøΩÔøΩ ‚Äî . (@biebsftlife) March 15, 2018  Justin Bieber's attitude  Amid rumors that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber called it quits, Us reported that Justin's attitude may have been a contributing factor in the demise of their rekindled romance.  '[He] doesn't care about anyone but himself,' a source said.  'The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn't need him.'  Infidelity  A rumor is swirling among Justin and Selena fans on Twitter that Justin was unfaithful to Selena. Some seem to believe the once-troubled singer had something going on with Petra Collins, whom Selena recently unfollowed on Instagram.  That rumor hasn't been substantiated, however. Especially considering it appears Petra is spending time with newly-single Justin Theroux.  They didn't break up  While many outlets are reporting that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have definitely decided to take some time apart, others claim they're still going strong.  Entertainment Tonight maintains the duo are still dating, but that Selena is taking a little time for herself to avoid outside pressure that stems from all the attention the two get.  A source said: 'Selena is very delicate; her ""comeback"" to the spotlight has been tough ‚Äî especially with the interest in her personal life with Justin and her mother.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber spotted leaving the Saban Theatre in Beverly Hills, California together despite breakup rumors. pic.twitter.com/Ey7aHofjbT ‚Äî Pop Crave (@PopCrave) March 8, 2018  'She is taking time to herself. This is not the first time she has done this.'  The insider added: 'She wants to repair her relationship with her mother, that's a priority for her, too. She needs to figure out how to live the life she wants in the spotlight ‚Äî if that's even possible.'  This theory appears to be popular among fans of both Justin and Selena, who believe they're still together but are in hiding. Some tweeters seem to think the couple simply don't like the media circus surrounding their relationship, so they're laying low.  This theory does seemingly hold up, as both Justin and Selena have complained about paparazzi attention in the past.  Will Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber get back together?  A recent report from People magazine suggests that reconciliation is imminent for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber. Their sources say fans should expect to see that sooner, rather than later.  'They've been having disagreements, but it wouldn't be surprising if they're back together in a week,' the Jelena insider said.  Similarly, E! reported that this is 'likely not the end' for Selena and Justin.  Selena Gomez will be 75 years old and still on again/off again with Justin Bieber. I hope they don't procreate. ‚Äî CJ (@TheTweetsOfCJ) March 15, 2018  A source said: '[Selena] wanted some time to clear her head and get away before figuring out what's coming next.'  Another added: 'They will absolutely get back together and they are not over, but they both need some time away from each other.'  Justin Bieber-Selena Gomez relationship history  Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have a long, somewhat-sordid history that dates back to about 2010.  The pair, who met in 2009, were spotted out together sharing a meal at a Philadelphia IHOP in 2010, which prompted rumors about the status of their relationship.  At the time, Selena told Us: 'It was just pancakes!'  So basically jelena is still dating but just hangs out in completely private places. They‚Äôre not broken up y‚Äôall need to relax. ‚Äî chloe (@biebcum) March 14, 2018  Not long after that sighting, Selena and Justin were seen looking couple-like at a concert in Miami, however, Justin told MTV he was 'just having fun being a teenager'.  In January 2011, things between Justin and Selena heated up and they were seen locking lips during a vacation in St. Lucia.  The following month they were photographed together during Vanity Fair's Oscars after-party in Hollywood, California. They held hands at the event, essentially confirming that they were a couple.  They looks so sad. It is obvious that Jelena broke up pic.twitter.com/cV9RuvoI4Z ‚Äî Ann (@Guccifloralhs) March 15, 2018  In September 2011, Justin rented out the Staples Center for just himself and Selena. The pair enjoyed a private screening of Titanic. Afterward, Justin tweeted: 'Romance isn't dead.'  For Valentine's Day in 2012, Justin gifted Selena with a ring bearing a diamond encrusted J, which she proudly showed off on Twitter.  In April of that same year, the couple was caught on kiss cam while enjoying a Lakers game together. They pair obliged, but Selena later told Ryan Seacrest it was 'the most humiliating thing'.  Their love story came to a screeching halt in November 2012. The pair reportedly decided to take some time apart due to 'busy schedules'.  Rumors began swirling about them again in April 2013, when Justin shared a photo of himself shirtless in bed being snuggled by Selena.  The following month they were seen sharing a kiss, while Selena's gal pal Taylor Swift looked on in disgust.  Social media remained rife with speculation about the pair, who were later spotted by TMZ taking a Segway cruise around Calabasas, California, together.  Selena and Justin both dated other people while broken up, but eventually found their way back to one another.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1569

Steve Martin, 72, and Martin Short, 68, revealed on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" Tuesday that they have ""colonoscopy parties"" every other year with Tom Hanks, 61, and fellow friend Walter Parks to have some fun ahead of the procedure.  ""We‚Äôre very excited,'' Short said. ""We go to Steve‚Äôs house around 5 p.m. the night before. We call it 'Colonoscopy Eve' in Canada.""  They go through the process of avoiding solid foods, consuming liquids and clearing their bowels to get ready.  ""And it‚Äôs catered,'' Martin said. ""There‚Äôs Jell-O, you know, there‚Äôs not much you can (eat). You have to purge all day and then we toast.""  ""We thought, everybody at our age ... at a certain age, you want to get a colonoscopy,"" Martin said. ""We all came over, we played poker and we watched some funny movie and you drink all this stuff.""  Walter Parks, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Tom Hanks. The group joked about throwing ""colonoscopy parties."" Jimmy Kimmel Live/YouTube  Short also joked about the portion of the party that isn't so fun.  ""What‚Äôs shocking is with Steve, you know, he‚Äôs a wealthy man,'' he said. ""Who would think he would have one bathroom? I mean, by 10 p.m., the bathroom looks like Day 14 of a Carnival cruise.""  ""I thought the bathroom ended up looking like a Jackson Pollock,"" Martin added.  The four friends share one car on the ride to get their colonoscopies the next day, playing cards to determine who has to go last for his exam, the duo said.  ""It was fun,'' Martin said about the party. ""It's a great way to do something that you should do.""  The colonoscopy crew: Martin, Hanks and Short. Jokes aside, men should start getting colonoscopies starting at age 45. Getty Images  Kimmel himself has also been an advocate for raising awareness of the importance of getting colonoscopies. Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cancer death for men and women combined.  He celebrated turning 50 this year by having former TODAY anchor Katie Couric walk him through the process and go through the results in a hilarious scene while also stressing the importance of the exam. Couric's first husband, Jay Monahan died at 42 of colon cancer in 1998.  The legendary comedians correctly noted to Kimmel on Tuesday that colon cancer screenings should start at 45 instead of 50 under new guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society last month.  Colonoscopy parties don't need to be as frequent as every other year like those of the four friends. People who are in good health with no increased risk should have a colonoscopy every 10 years, according to the American Cancer Society.  If you‚Äôre at increased or high risk of colorectal cancer (or think you might be), talk to your health care provider to learn more. Your provider can suggest the best screening option for you, as well as determine what type of screening schedule you should follow, based on your individual risk.

Every year, the actress packs her holiday gift guide with suggestions that are sure to raise eyebrows, from kinky lingerie and sex toys to genitalia grooming kits to drug paraphernalia ‚Äî but for 2017 she's managed to outdo herself.  A section of the Goop gift guide for 'lovers,' in particular, really pushes the limits this year, recommending everything from sex toys ‚Äî 12, to be exact ‚Äî to pricey lingerie to a pen that delivers THC to the body right before sex.  'Tis the season! Gwyneth Paltrow's website Goop has released its 2017 holiday gift guide  The gold standard in orgasms! In a section for 'lovers,' the site suggests five different vibrators, including two plated with precious metals  When tickling is out of touch: There's also this feather ring for 'tickling' in the bedroom, which costs a jaw-dropping $673  That's a pricey rub: Most of the section is packed with lingerie and sex toys, like this massage ring for $795  That price will certainly make a girl clench! A vocal promoter of vaginal maintenance, Gwyneth recommends $885 benwa balls, which are used to strengthen pelvic muscles  Naturally, the gift guide is full of items so pricey that the general public might be surprised that anyone would ever spend that much.  The 'lovers' section is no exception to the high price point, and includes a $425 silky PJ set, a $595 lace kimono, a $168 lace bra, and lots of expensive jewelry.  But the most shocking items don't have just big price tags to set them apart. This year, Goop is recommending five different vibrators, including the $99 Crave bullet with 24k gold plating, the $149 Crave Vesper vibrator necklace (also gold-plated), and a $169 Lelo Tiani 3.  Then there are the toys that don't buzz ‚Äî but, despite a lack of mechanics, are still seriously expensive.  Suggested are the $673 Betony Vernon Marabou Pleasure Puff Ring, which 'works overtime as a playful tickler in the bedroom'.  The same brand has a double sterling-silver massage ring for $795, which looks like two simple metallic balls, as well as a set of $885 benwa balls, which women can carry around in their vaginas to strengthen pelvic muscles.  So kinky! She also suggests this BDSM-inspired piece of jewelry, which costs $1,505  Hurt me like my credit card statement! These leather tools for spanking and whipping cost hundreds of dollars  A true artist: This body-painting kit costs only $70 and comes with pain, disposable slippers, and a body scrubber for cleanup  For the budget fetishist: Less pricey are the pubic hair oil for $44 and $18 sexy bubble bath  There's also a 'Sado-Chic' piece of jewelry with a choker necklace and cuff bracelet, which are held together by a chain and clearly meant to be used in BDSM play. It costs $1,505.  Shoppers who want to shell out on leather goods for the bedroom have Gwyneth-approved options, too, including a $295 whip and a $195 paddle by Kiki de Montparnasse.  'Covered in supple textured lambskin leather, it makes for some utterly pleasurable chastising ‚Äî light lashing, soft spanking ‚Äî behind closed doors,' reads the Goop description of the paddle, which fails to mention that the human hand can do something quite similar and doesn't cost a thing.  And for those seeking a more experiential gift as opposed to something more materialistic, they need look no further than 'The Wild Woman's Way' tantra workshop ‚Äî a steal at $450.  Luckily, there are a few budget-friendly options for Gwyneth's more cash-strapped but kinky admirers, though those are mostly of the bath and beauty variety. Try $44 'fur oil' for public hairs, $18 'Get it On' body wash by PLANT Apothecary, and a $70 Love is Art x goop 'couple's paint kit' for ‚Äî ahem ‚Äî sensual body-painting.

The list includes a joint storage case and a pipe  Super strength! This $199 Elvie Trainer is meant to help the user strengthen the pelvic floor.  Perhaps the most unique item, however, is the HMBLDT Passion Dose Pen for $40 and up. The pen delivers a THC-dominant formula to give a 'euphoric feeling' to 'increase sensuality and heighten your sexual experience'.  In fact, the 'lovers' category isn't the only one in which Goop recommends products related to cannabis or sex.  For 'dreamers,' the site offers a $45 JvdF 'joint case,' the right shape and size to git two marijuana joints ‚Äî though Goop explains: 'It works great for storing any teeny essentials‚Äîjewelry, Advil, you name it.'  There is also a ceramic pipe under the Stocking Stuffers category.  For 'health nuts,' there's a $199 Elvie Trainer, which is slipped into the vagina like a tampon and controlled via Bluetooth. It is meant to help the user strengthen the pelvic floor.  Of course, not everything on the list is rated PG-13 ‚Äî but even the G-rated items can cost a few Gs.  Just expensive: The guide has a $130 match holder (left) and a $345 incense burner (right)  What does the fox say? (It says pricey!)

56904a3a-7855-4f39-a0d6-262e74174a65,"For other people of this name, see Henry Hall (disambiguation)  Henry Robert Hall, CBE (2 May 1898 ‚Äì 28 October 1989) was an English bandleader who performed regularly on BBC Radio during the British dance band era of the 1920s and 1930s, through to the 1960s.  Early life and career [ edit ]  Henry Hall was born in Peckham, South London. He won a scholarship to Trinity College of Music where he studied trumpet, piano, harmony and counterpoint.  His first job was as copyist at the head office of the Salvation Army for which he wrote several marches. During World War I, Hall served with the Royal Field Artillery and played trumpet and piano in the regimental band.  Hall's musical career was slow to start but eventually he was engaged by the London Midland and Scottish Railway to take charge of music throughout their then large chain of hotels, including Gleneagles Hotel, where he had previously led the band.  Hall describes in his autobiography, Here's to the Next Time, that on a Thursday in October 1923 he met a young woman named Margery while traveling by rail to Dartmoor. Hall mentions that he and Margery were about the same age and had much in common after discussing the C.B. Cochran production of the musical, ""Little Nellie Kelly"" and Paul Whiteman's take on ""Till My Luck comes Rolling Along"", a tune from the play. The following day, Henry invited Margery to a dance and proposed to her at the end of the evening. By Saturday, just two days after meeting, the two were engaged and were married in January 1924, at St. George's, Hanover Square, London.[1] Henry and Margery had two children during their marriage, Mike and Betty.  In June 1924, on the opening night of the Gleneagles Hotel, Hall persuaded the BBC to broadcast the event on radio, which began his long association with BBC radio.  The 1930s: broadcasting star [ edit ]  It was from Gleneagles that the BBC took him in 1932 to succeed Jack Payne as band leader of the BBC Dance Orchestra.[2] At 5.15pm each weekday, Hall's radio programme from Broadcasting House gathered a huge following across the nation.[3] His signature tune was ""It's Just the Time for Dancing"", and he usually concluded with ""Here's to the Next Time"".  In 1932 he recorded the songs ""Here Comes the Bogeyman"" and ""Teddy Bears' Picnic"" with his BBC Orchestra, featuring singer Val Rosing on vocals. The latter song gained enormous popularity and sold over a million copies. In 1934 his popularity was confirmed when his orchestra topped the bill at the London Palladium.  He featured in the documentary BBC The Voice of Britain (1935), the source of the ""This is Henry Hall speaking"" clip much used in documentaries on this period.  In 1936 Henry Hall made his first feature film and in the same year he was guest conductor of the ship's orchestra on the Queen Mary‚Äôs maiden voyage.  In 1937 the BBC Dance Orchestra played at the opening of the Gaumont State Cinema in Kilburn. The same year Hall left the BBC to tour with his own band, which comprised many members of his BBC band. He toured the halls of Britain and Europe, and generated controversy by dropping songs by Jewish composers while playing in Berlin in February 1938.[4]  Hall's band was the first to appear on television.[citation needed]  Later years [ edit ]  During the Second World War, Hall played for the troops, and gave concerts and shows in factories all over Britain. Many of these concerts came in the form of ""Guest Night"" broadcasts. From June to November, 1943, ""Guest Night"" was replaced by ""Henry Hall's Rhythm Entertainment"" intended to provide radio entertainment for troops overseas.  After the war he developed his show business interests, becoming something of an agent and producer. His BBC work again blossomed as he hosted Henry Hall's Guest Night on the radio and later on television. Hall was also involved in the launch of the television programme Face the Music.[citation needed]  Hall had a son, Michael, who served in the Royal Navy, and a daughter, Betty.  In 1955, Hall published his autobiography Here's to the Next Time. He dedicated it to his wife, Margery.  He ceased regular broadcasting in 1964 and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, CBE, in 1970. He died in Eastbourne, Sussex, in October 1989.  A green memorial plaque on the site of his former home at 8 Randolph Mews, Little Venice, was unveiled on 2 May 1996.[5] A blue plaque commemorates Hall at 38 Harman Drive in Cricklewood, London, where he lived between 1932 and 1959.[6]  Popular culture [ edit ]  Hall unknowingly lent his name to a work shift at Frickley Colliery in South Yorkshire. Miners at the colliery who worked the unpopular night shift referred to the shift as Henry Hall's shift or simply Henry's. This was due to the fact that the shift began at 6pm, the same time as Hall started his show on the radio. When he died, the local football club Frickley Athletic, who had close ties with the colliery, marked the occasion in their matchday programme with a page, dedicated to Hall, entitled ""No More Henry's"".[citation needed]",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1044

Regan was unable to return to reprise the role due to scheduling. (She's a series regular on TNT's The Last Ship, starring Grey's grad Eric Dane.)  Spencer, who is slated to return to NBC's Timeless for its 10-episode sophomore run next summer, will appear in a multiple-episode arc in the veteran medical drama's upcoming 14th season.  Regan originally guest-starred in a season 13 episode that included flashbacks as Owen's (Kevin McKidd) younger sister. While serving in the Army, Megan was romantically paired with Owen's best friend Nathan (Martin Henderson), and after learning he cheated on her, took off in a helicopter. She was presumed dead after the helicopter went missing. The season 13 finale revealed that Owen's sister is indeed alive.  Megan's return sets the stage for an awkward love triangle in season 14, as Nathan and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) finally took a major step forward in their burgeoning relationship.  Spencer's casting comes as Grey's Anatomy is poised to further explore Owen's and Amelia's (Caterina Scorsone) dynamic, as the married couple spent the bulk of last season separated, as well as Owen's relationship with Megan.  In addition to Spencer, former Grey's Anatomy series regular Kim Raver is set to reprise her role as Dr. Teddy Altman, Owen's former Army buddy, in season 14.  Spencer's credits include Rectify, Suits and Mad Men. She's repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment and Hansen Jacobson.  Grey's Anatomy returns Sept. 28 at 8 p.m. with a two-hour season 14 premiere.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,344

We‚Äôre wrapped up all warm and cosy in a Land Cruiser while our guide, wearing nothing more than shorts and a T-shirt, turns and asks what we want to see. Lets go find some cats, we say. As the sun rises we bound off into Kruger National Park on a jeep convoy.  Thousands of animals roam this vast space, an area roughly the size of Scotland. While the park is home to 147 species, the main draw is the Big Five ‚Äì that‚Äôs lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo. Picking our way through the bush it‚Äôs difficult to spot anything. There are rustles and strange sounds in the long grass but I can‚Äôt see any animals. The tracker perched on the bonnet with his rifle is much better at it. Despite (and very probably because of) being at risk of predators, he seems to notice the smallest of movements in the distance ‚Äì he‚Äôs an expert at finding exotic shapes, everything from hippos and lone giraffes to zebras.

Arriving at the scene of sleeping lions, I was very aware of the beautiful colours behind hi  Every now and again we stop to look at footprints and even fresh poop.  The main draw is the Big Five ‚Äì that‚Äôs lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  It looks like elephants passed through overnight. The rangers can read what direction they took and even how long ago. Soon enough, we gasp and nudge each other as he sights a leopard through the trees. It‚Äôs hunting something that we can‚Äôt make out. Impressed to find it stalking prey, we sit watching in silence. We see another safari vehicle and they report there are elephants near the river so we decide to leave our hungry feline to hunt alone.  NATALIE CHALK Nathalie Chalk on safari  The ground is dry and cracked due to a two-year drought, which has left parts of the park looking scorched with dead trees and uprooted branches. It‚Äôs hard to see how anything could thrive in this landscape. Yet as we approach the river, it‚Äôs like we enter a different country.

GETTY The main draw is the Big Five ‚Äì that‚Äôs lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo  On the banks are 30 elephants, including babies, close to their mothers, young bulls jumping on each other and adult males spraying water. It‚Äôs like being backstage on a David Attenborough documentary ‚Äì peeking into their secret lives off-camera. As our guide talks quietly about how an elephant‚Äôs ear resembles the shape of Africa, they begin to stroll our way. The herd is making its way to the road and coming straight towards the vehicle. It‚Äôs an uncomfortable mixture of excitement and terror. As we look at them, they stare back. Some of us get nervous. We hold our breath, grit our teeth and fall silent as they get closer. I am about to be nuzzled by the largest land animal on Earth.  I wish I had good rapport with nature. Instead I want to slide down the seat in front and hide under my blanket. Before turning to stone, I remember thinking what long eyelashes they have. Soon we are surrounded as they cross behind and in front. Some swing their trunks, which is how they smell, while others walk by munching on prickly branches. It‚Äôs the mother who stands guard. The guide tells us not to worry but we‚Äôre not convinced.

fe23b99f-c9b2-490f-900c-752fd545fe64,"Howie Mandel wasn't invited to the royal wedding ‚Äî but he has no hard feelings.  In fact, he doesn't really have any feeling about Meghan Markle at all, since he doesn't even remember her from their Deal or No Deal days.  Though Meghan, 37, was a model on the game show that Howie hosted, the 63-year-old told Dr. Oz this week that he had no recollection of working with her, and it came as a surprise when he learned the Duchess of Sussex was on the show.  Nope! Howie Mandel said this week that he wasn't invited to the royal wedding  Blending in: The 63-year-old also admitted he didn't remember Meghan Markle  Rising star: Meghan worked as a 'suitcase girl' on Deal or No Deal at the start of her acting career, between 2006 and 2007  Beautiful ladies: The two definitely met, though it doesn't seem like the future Duchess made an impression on Howie  In a preview clip of an episode of The Dr. Oz Show set to air on Thursday, Howie dishes as best he can on Meghan ‚Äî which is to say, he doesn't really dish at all.  'I was not invited to the wedding,' he says, answering Dr. Oz's question.  When prodding to share what he recalls of working together ‚Äî Meghan was on the show briefly in the mid-2000s ‚Äî Howie didn't have much to tell.  'What do I remember? I'm going to be totally honest with you. Nothing. I don't remember Meghan. I don't,' he said.  Gesturing to a photo of Meghan as a briefcase girl, Howie said, 'I saw that picture when she became the Duchess or when she got engaged.  'I saw that picture and they went, ""She was a Deal or No Deal model,"" and I go, ""Really? Really? What number?"" Then that picture, put up that picture again, as I was trying to remember, what number was she? There's no number even on her case. So, how do you know she was actually a model?  'I think she's just a young lady with a lot of baggage,' he joked.  Working the camera: The now-37-year-old was one of 26 women who had to carry a suitcase that was filled with a monetary amount, ranging between one penny and $1 million  Exciting: Her go-to briefcase number was 24, and she knew how to nail the necessary excitement for players who eliminated small dollar amounts  Surprise! Meghan appeared on the show ten years before she met Prince Harry, and said in 2013 that she did it in order to 'make ends meet' while auditioning for other roles  Meghan carried briefcases with more than one number during her time, but it was most frequently the number 24.  Speaking about her more, Howie had some generic, nice things to say.  'She's a wonderful, beautiful, young lady and I'm so happy for her. All I want for each and every person, they don't even have to be on my show to be successful and healthy,' he said.  When asked about Meghan at a Television Critics Association event in August, Howie joked that she was 'slightly duchessy' before praising all the women who held up the briefcases on the show.  'Not everybody will have the opportunity to meet royalty, but these are all accomplished people that have something substantial ‚Äî they‚Äôre not just standing there holding a case,' he said.  'They have careers, they have hobbies, they have families, they‚Äôre entrepreneurial‚Äîthey‚Äôre all people. So, when somebody like Harry meets somebody who just happened to be on our show, there‚Äôs a lot to offer.'  Revealed: Chrissy Teigen, 33, said she was on Deal or No Deal when Meghan was, and had only nice things to say about her  No big: Howie doesn't seem to crushed about not getting an invite  Diva?He did, however, joke that she was 'duchessy' earlier this year  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said  Meghan, meanwhile, reflected on her time on the show in a 2013 interview with Esquire.  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said, adding that it was 'in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet.'  Some of Meghan's fellow models also had nice things to say.  'I am especially a fan of Meghan,' Chrissy Teigen told Mail on Sunday this year. 'I was on Deal or No Deal with her and she was lovely. Now everyone asks me what she was like and I say, ‚ÄúSorry, no dirt. She‚Äôs gorgeous.‚Äù'  'Meghan is beautiful, smart, talented, I feel she absolutely deserves to be a princess,' former suitcase girl Aubrie Lemon told Inside Edition.  'One day she was next to me getting fitted for her dress, and the next day she's going to be the future princess,' Leyla Milani joked, before adding: 'She was always reading scripts behind the scenes when we had our down time... she was always working on her craft.'  Smile pretty: It was 'in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet,' she said  Winner! Although she revealed that she never had the winning case, Meghan certainly knew how to put on a show while appearing on the show in a series of very provocative outfits  There she goes! At the start of each show, Meghan would have to stroll down some stairs with her fellow models, carrying a suitcase in one hand and smiling at the camera (pictured with 11)  Over on the new episode of Dr. Oz, Howie also delved into more serious issues, talking about his mental health. The comedian and entertainer has spoken out before about struggling with OCD and anxiety.  In this interview, he recalled being on the Howard Stern show 25 years ago when he started to have a panic attack.  'But the truth is, because people think because I'm a comedian they thought I was joking,' he said. 'I started having an anxiety attack, which feels like a heart attack.  'Then in my panic I said, ""Howard seriously, I go to a doctor and I have OCD. I see a psychiatrist and I feel like I'm going to die right now. You've got to please, you got to let me out.""  Playing along: Howie also played a jokey game of Deal or No Deal with Dr. Oz, and opened up about his anxiety issues  Once Howard let him out, he realized that the show wasn't on break, and he'd set that all on air.  'I said, ""Oh, my God. I just said that publicly, on national radio."" So number one, I thought my poor family. I outed myself as a mentally unstable person. How are my kids going to be able to go to school?  'I mean, it's going to be horrible, number one. Number two, my career is over because who's going to hire, any show cost millions of dollars. Who's going to hire somebody who has mental health issues?  'Remember this is 25 years ago and it was the darkest day of my life.

The reality star is suing for emotional pain, emotional suffering, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life and other damages. She also alleges gender discrimination and a hostile work environment and says she‚Äôs still owed money that was guaranteed in her contract.  Last month, the MTV personality made multiple accusations against the network in a scathing Instagram post alongside a Teen Mom OG clip of her speaking with Morgan, who said she was a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù to work with.  ‚ÄúNever apologize for being an ambitious, confident, and strong minded women,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúAs I become the best Farrah I can be, I won‚Äôt let a man or network be little me, try to break me, lie about who I am to my core, I‚Äôm bullied, surrounded & hurt by all the manipulation, I no longer will allow as a protective mother this vulgar behavior, these crews aren‚Äôt trust worthy this ‚ÄòMTV family‚Äô is a disgusting gang of power tripping failed producers & executives who have failed.‚Äù  In early November, Abraham claimed she had been fired by Viacom for working as an adult entertainer.

Wochit  Spoiler alert: This story contains substantial details from Monday's episode of The Bachelor.  Hoo boy, what an episode! The team goes to Paris this week for FOUR dates: two one-on-ones, a group date, and a two-on-one that finally wraps up what seemed like a never-ending hell-scape of a plot point. Krystal is eliminated, and on top of that, Jenna departs. But maybe most surprisingly, Chelsea doesn't receive a rose. Our sweet mama is excused. Let's review.  Arie Luyendyk Jr. continues to look for love. (Photo: PAUL HEBERT/ABC)  The Rundown!  You Like Cheese? Wow.  Lauren B is probably a great girl, but there's something about Laurens this season. Maybe it's that they have to carry the date for both Arie and herself. Maybe it's that they don't want to. Either way, when she and Arie end up at a street market, you can't help but notice that the date is painfully, awkwardly quiet. But this time, it's kind of hard to blame Lauren, because the conversation literally went:  ARIE: We see cheese like this at home.  LAUREN: Wow.  Lauren B is stunning but I may not be able to finish the rest of the episode because this date is putting me to sleeeeep #thebachelor ‚Äî Christen Whitney (@Christen_mae_) February 6, 2018  That's not even a joke. But after all the painful silence, the date takes a turn when Arie talks about his previous girlfriend miscarrying their child and then immediately leaving him. Bachelor whiplash, y'all. In response, Lauren reveals she was engaged once, and if you're reading this and thinking ""those aren't similar stories,"" you're totally right. After mustering up some semblance of a personal anecdote, Lauren is gifted a rose anyway for simply managing to stay awake.  DATE PART ONE: *nothing*  DATE PART TWO: *nothing*  DATE PART THREE: My girlfriend got pregnant, then she lost the baby, and then she immediately left me.#TheBachelorpic.twitter.com/w4i7Biv4sH ‚Äî Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) February 6, 2018  Moulin Rouge  The group date heads to the historic Moulin Rouge where they learn to dance. Seinne immediately shines and Bekah M loves the costume, because Bekah loves the drama of it all. But the costumes and dancing all leads to a challenge, and whoever wins gets to dance with Arie on stage, which sounds low-key terrifying.  I‚Äôm hiding in a hole now ‚Äî Tia Booth (@tiarachel91) February 6, 2018  Tia locks in a real moment of connection with Arie, as does Seinne, who even drops a little bit of French on him because this is Paris, and Paris is sexy and romantic and vaguely exciting. It's Bekah M who lands the rose though and does a little dance number with Arie while the other girls contemplate ways to, you know, maybe kill her.  Krystal v Kindness  Krystal announces her and Kendall's two-on-one like an actual sociopath because intimidation is her game. They head to the French countryside and end up in a maze searching for him, like some twisted bougie white woman version of a horror movie. Krystal finds him, and honestly, I thank God because I wonder if Kendall would have survived if she had made it first.  Arie takes Krystal aside to talk about that little temper tantrum she had last week, which she totally flips around, eventually pivoting to how Kendall isn't emotionally available enough for a relationship. Arie immediately brings that up with Kendall, and girlfriend stays cool as a cucumber. When she gets back to Krystal, she very calmly tells her that she needs to let go of her hurt and insecurity because she's a good person who has just lost track of how to be good. It's either the most sympathetic gesture in history or a NEXT LEVEL DRAG.  Love love love Kendall moving towards and to Krystal in this setting and expressing empathy. So beautiful! Yes! #TheBachelor ‚Äî Taylor Nolan (@taymocha) February 6, 2018  Arie decides that he doesn't have enough information, so he pushes his decision to dinner. Later, Krystal tries to explain her way out of the conversation, but Kendall maintains all composure. When the rose comes out, it doesn't go in the way of Krystal. Kendall stays and the reign of terror is over.  Jacqueline?  Every season there's a seemingly great girl who appears five weeks in, and you're like, ""Who's that? Jacqueline? Has she been here this whole time?"" She and Arie take off in a car and go shopping in Paris for her one-on-one, and the whole thing is unfortunate because she is well-spoken and pretty funny, and you know this can't last too long. But in the end, Arie gives her a rose and keeps her around, which is great... for now.  I'm super happy because I want good things for Jacqueline, but I also hope she loses because I want good things for Jacqueline. #TheBachelorpic.twitter.com/xI7oY6QT8N ‚Äî Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) February 6, 2018  Superlatives!  Most Likely to Succeed  Kendall, who was easy to write off with all her sweet taxidermy talk, rose to the occasion on the Paris two-on-one date. With Krystal playing mad mind games on her, she leaned on the most powerful weapon of all: sincere kindness. By telling Krystal she was beautiful, but she was also imperfect like everyone else, Krystal went into dinner completely shaken while Kendall stayed completely composed.  Least Likely to Become a Rockette  Tia is handily a frontrunner this season, but that dance session? Well, poor girl couldn't carry choreography out if you put it in a bucket for her. Through a couple curse words and irresistible charm, she skates through the challenge, but man. Give the girl her frog legs and let her turn in those dance shoes.

""Sounds just like the original,"" Underwood wrote in the caption, adding a zany face emoji.  Fans loved the funny video, especially Isiah's laughing in the back.  ""Hahaha. Too funny. The giggling from backseat is priceless,"" one wrote.  ""Love hearing that sweet giggle,"" added another.  Underwood shared the adorable family moment the same weekend they celebrated Fisher's birthday. He turned 38 on Tuesday, but they waited until the weekend since Underwood was busy at the CMA Music Festival. He got a special hat-shaped cake that read ""Catchin' Deers.""  The singer also performed at the CMT Awards on Tuesday, belting out ""Cry Pretty"" while wearing glitter around her eyes to recreate the song's single art.  ""Cry Pretty"" is the title track of Underwood's sixth studio album. The song was written with The Love Junkies, made up of Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna and Liz Rose.  ""The first single is a song I love so much and can‚Äôt wait to share with you,"" Underwood said in a statement in April. ""The title refers to when emotions take over and you just can‚Äôt hold them back. It really speaks to a lot of things that have happened in the past year and I hope when you hear it, you can relate those feelings to those times in your life. It‚Äôs emotional. It‚Äôs real. And it ROCKS!""  Cry Pretty the album comes out on Sept. 14. Hopefully Fisher's version is included as a bonus track.  Fisher is an NHL veteran and reached the Stanley Cup Finals with the Nashville Predators after the 2016-17 season. He retired after the series, but returned to the Predators partway through the 2017-18 season. After they lost in the playoffs to the Winnipeg Jets, Fisher announced his plans to retire for good.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,503

CBS announced Tuesday that John Dickerson will replace the ousted Charlie Rose as the third co-host of CBS This Morning, joining Gayle King and Norah O'Donnell. He begins in the role Wednesday.  Dickerson, a CBS News anchor, hosts Face the Nation on Sunday mornings, and the network said he will leave that role ""in the coming weeks as CBS News prepares to name his successor.""  CBS cut ties with Rose a day after The Washington Post reported on Nov. 20 that eight women have accused the newsman of sexual misconduct. Rose also lost distribution of his eponymous interview show on PBS and Bloomberg TV, effectively killing it for now.  Since Rose's departure, King and O'Donnell have been without a third anchor on some days. On other days, members of the CBS family have filled it. On Tuesday morning, CBS Evening News anchor Jeff Glor joined the show.  The network has largely been mum on the succession process, and some in the industry suggested that the show go without a third co-anchor. In the end, CBS went with one of its most well-respected, high-profile journalists for the important role. (HuffPost first reported that Dickerson would get the job.)  ""With John, Gayle, and Norah together we will be doubling down on serious news coverage,"" CBS News president David Rhodes said in a memo to staff. ""That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre all committed to at CBS News. Our three co-hosts together will represent those values to the audience every morning.""  Dickerson will relocate to New York for the position.  Ryan Kadro, who produces the newsy morning show, called Dickerson ""the perfect complement to Gayle and Norah.""  At the time of Rose's termination, Rhodes said: ""Despite Charlie's important journalistic contribution to our news division, there is absolutely nothing more important, in this or any organization, than ensuring a safe, professional workplace ‚Äî a supportive environment where people feel they can do their best work.""  Rose has largely not been heard from since his much-publicized downfall.  NBC recently named 10 a.m. co-host Hoda Kotb as Matt Lauer's replacement for the first two hours of Today.

4ea0347c-8f0b-49ef-9bb0-4dfe8e1e7bc5,"The Big Bang Theory is going out on top. Despite recent remarks by CBS that it was in talks for more seasons of the highly-rated series, the network, producing studio Warner Bros. TV and executive producer Chuck Lorre just announced that the comedy will end its run in May 2019 with its upcoming 12th season. The Big Bang Theory still will rank as the longest-running multi-camera series in television history per WBTV, spanning 12 seasons and a record-breaking 279 episodes, .  ‚ÄúWe are forever grateful to our fans for their support of The Big Bang Theory during the past twelve seasons. We, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show‚Äôs success and aim to deliver a final season, and series finale, that will bring The Big Bang Theory to an epic creative close,‚Äù WBTV, CBS and Chuck Lorre Productions said in a joint statement.  CBS  The announcement about The Big Bang Theory coming to an end comes just two weeks after CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at TCA that ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs the final season; we are in preliminary discussions to renew the show with the studio that produces it, Warner Bros.‚Äù  I hear conversations about a possible two-year renewal were going on as recently as late last week.  Eleven seasons in, The Big Bang Theory remains one of the biggest shows on television. Season 11 averaged 18.9 million viewers, even with Season 10. It was the second most watched series of last season, edging Sunday Night Football and only behind the now-canceled Roseanne. Among adults 18-49, Big Bang slipped a bit (4.4 in Live+7 vs. 4.9 last season) but still ranked as the second highest-rated entertainment program behind only NBC‚Äôs This Is Us.  According to sources, the decision to end the series was largely a creative one made by the producers. It was perceived that Season 12 would be the show‚Äôs last when CBS in 2017 renewed Big Bang for seasons 11 and 12 after WBTV had closed new two-year deals with the cast. But then few expected that Big Bang would remain as strong in the ratings as it‚Äôs been, maintaining its viewership and top standing in the rankings when most broadcasting series have been sliding.  To go beyond 12 seasons, Warner Bros. TV would‚Äôve had to negotiate new contracts with the actors. The show‚Äôs original quintet are the highest-paid actors on TV with paychecks of around $1 million an episode.  REX/Shutterstock  There are no deals in place for next season between CBS and WBTV, between the studio and the cast as well as between the studio and the series‚Äô creative staff. While this was not a business call as CBS and WBTV would‚Äôve likely reached an agreement for more seasons, I hear that, with so many unknowns and not clear whether everyone wanted to come back, the producers had no desire to continue with the show creatively without the entire family on the show intact.  That and the lure of leaving on top, as the highest-rated comedy on television, having achieved the milestone of longest-running multi-camera sitcom, sealed the decision to end the series.  The final season of The Big Bang Theory will debut Monday, September 24 on CBS before moving to its regular time period on Thursday, September 27.  ‚ÄúThe Big Bang Theory has been the defining comedy of its generation,‚Äù Kahl said today. ‚ÄúAll of us at the Network take exceptional pride in this series that uniquely combines creative genius, commercial ratings success, cultural influence and characters who became so popular, they are easily known by just one name. We‚Äôre incredibly grateful for our partnership with Warner Bros., Chuck Lorre Productions and a brilliant cast and crew that has made such a ‚Äòbig bang‚Äô and lasting legacy on the television landscape.‚Äù  The Big Bang Theory, which debuted in 2007 and airs in syndication around the world, has received 52 Emmy nominations and 10 wins to date (though has never won for Outstanding Comedy Series), and 7 Golden Globe nominations.  Since its off-network launch, Big Bang has been a syndication powerhouse and continues to deliver big ratings for TBS and the stations that carry it, with its success possibly marking an end of an era and may never be matched again.  The Big Bang Theory is executive produced by Chuck Lorre, Bill Prady, Steven Molaro and Steve Holland. The series stars Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, Kunal Nayyar, Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch. The Big Bang Theory is produced by Chuck Lorre Productions, Inc., in association with Warner Bros. Television.  In 2015, the first-ever UCLA scholarship created by and named for a television series, The Big Bang Theory Scholarship supports undergraduate students in need of financial aid who are pursuing their higher education in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  And some fun facts: In addition to centering many of its episodes in the worlds of science and technology, The Big Bang Theory enjoys a healthy appreciation and support from the scientific community at large, including having a bee species (Euglossa bazinga), a jellyfish species (Bazinga Rieki) and a monkey at the Columbus Zoo (Dr. Sheldon Cooper) named in the show‚Äôs honor.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,998

Originally broadcast on Channel 4 and E4 and now broadcast on Channel 5 and 5Star, it involves a group of celebrities, called housemates, living in isolation from the outside world in a custom-built ""house"".[1][2][3][4] The actions of the participants are recorded constantly by microphones and cameras situated in each room.[2] Regularly, the housemates nominate two other members of the group each to face eviction; those with the most nominations face a public telephone vote, and the housemate who receives the most public votes is evicted.[2] This procedure continues until the final day, when the viewers vote for who of the remaining participants they want to win the programme.[3] Profits from premium-rate telephone votes are donated to charities such as Comic Relief, Centrepoint and Samaritans.[5][6]  Programme [ edit ]  Twenty-two editions of Celebrity Big Brother have been made, involving a total of 276 housemates. The programme has been the centre of controversies over the actions and inclusion of some of its housemates. For instance, viewer and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) complaints prompted Hertfordshire Police to remove a coat from the 2006 edition after Pete Burns claimed that it was made from gorilla fur and therefore against the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species agreement of 1975.[7][8] However, after an analysis at the Natural History Museum, it was later discovered that the coat was made from the fur of Colobus monkeys.[8] Fellow members of parliament criticised George Galloway's participation in the same series, stating that Galloway had missed important debates regarding his constituency, Bethnal Green and Bow, and rejecting claims that Galloway took part to raise political awareness amongst the British youth.[9] The family of Stuart Lubbock, a man who died in Michael Barrymore's swimming pool, criticised the programme makers for paying the entertainer ¬£150,000 to participate on the programme.[10] The mental states of the contestants were called into question during the first series; psychologist Mark Griffiths highlighted behaviour displayed by Anthea Turner and Vanessa Feltz as examples of the negative effects of the programme.[11] Germaine Greer voluntarily left the 2005 series after accusing the producers of using ""superior bullying"" tactics against contestants; commentators such as Graham Norton have argued that the housemates are not ""actual celebrities"".[12][13] During the 2009 series, 527 viewers complained to Ofcom, the majority concerned about Coolio's conduct towards female contestants, but it was decided that the broadcaster's code was not breached.[14] Comments made by Heidi Fleiss also proved controversial during the final series to air on Channel 4 of the programme in 2010; she accused Ivana Trump of smuggling drugs onto the programme, a claim that Trump's spokesperson denied, and made comments about abortion that attracted criticism.[15][16]  During the 2007 series, comments directed to and made about Shilpa Shetty from Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd, Jo O'Meara and Jack Tweed caused an international racism controversy.[17] The British and Indian governments commented on the issue, while Ofcom decreed that Channel 4 had been guilty of ""serious editorial misjudgements"" after 54,000 viewers claimed that Shetty had been the victim of racial discrimination.[18] The broadcaster was made to air a series of on-air apologies, and the programme was not included in Channel 4's 2008 schedule; it was replaced by Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack.[17][19] In 2009, Channel 4's director of television Kevin Lygo announced that Big Brother ""had reached a natural end point"" and the 2010 edition was the final celebrity series to air on the channel.[4][20] However, Channel 5 stated in April 2011 that it has signed a two-year deal with Endemol, the show's creators, to air both version of the programme for a reported ¬£220m.[4] The series started on 18 August 2011 and former Big Brother winner Brian Dowling replaced Davina McCall as the programme's presenter.[4] Dowling presented the programme until January 2013, his final series being Celebrity Big Brother 11.

An abdriged version of this review was originally published in Nathaniel's column at Towleroad.  Film festivals nearly always provide curious dialogues between films that you weren't expecting. On the same day on the exact same screen at TIFF I managed to see two films about female writers and the male writers in their lives who take up all the oxygen (and praise) in the room. Who would have thought that a film about the origins of Frankenstein (just discussed) and a star vehicle for Glenn Close in Stockholm would have so much in common?  THE WIFE (Bj√∂rn Runge)  Joan Castleman (Glenn Close) is a longsuffering wife who would bristle at that very description. She's married to a famous novelist Joe Castleman (Jonathan Pryce) and their homophonic names are no coincidence. The silver-haired couple have been together for nearly half a century and are inseparable if not quite interchangeable...  As The Wife begins we learn that Joe has just been named the Nobel prize winner in literature and the couple are to travel to Stockholm together for the ceremony. They're so happy they actually jump on their bed together in a singularly charming scene. This slow burn story may start out playful but it deepens as it goes thanks to Close's brilliant work.  the younger and the older CastlemansAll the principle characters in Joe's orbit also happen to be writers and resent him, if not quite his enormous success, for different reasons: his son David (Max Irons) never gets the encouragement he needs, his wife Joan was a promising writer who set her own career aside when she married him, and then there's Nathaniel (Christian Slater) who's been trailing the family for years trying to get permission to write Joe's biography.  The cracks in the happy marriage facade begin to show as the Nobel ceremony nears and flashbacks pile up. Annie Starke, Close's own daughter, plays her as a young college student and Elizabeth McGoven gives great cameo as an aggressive lady author who warns her away from the sexist literary world which just won't let women succeed. Bj√∂rn Runge, a Swedish director making his first English language film, doesn't find many ways to visualize all of the drama - it's mostly two or more characters arguing in rooms, planes, or hotels, but he's great with the actors who all deliver in this adaptation of Meg Wolitzer's bestseller.  The interpersonal dynamics and face-offs are the savory meat of the film. To my personal astonishment Glenn Close restricts herself to chewing on it rather than the scenery! Put simply it's the best work she's done in over 20 years.  Close's opacity as an actress, the unknowability of that glacial face, has often been disguised by her sheer volume and ferocity in so many gorgon roles. Here in Joan's quieter less sinister register, she's spectacular. You constantly attempt to figure Joan out but Joan will not have it. She prefers to remain a mystery, hiding her true feelings from everyone, including possibly herself. Her mercurial moods will shift within scenes; just when you expect her to double down on anger she'll throw compassion at you, and vice versa, keeping you off balance. At one point in a brilliantly acted private 'date' with that would-be biographer, she says ""I'm shy"" with something like mock flirtation. It sounds like a lie, but it's actually the truth of this mesmerizing character.  The film isn't quite as coy as Close, eventually revealing its hand. Joan Castleman and her poker face would not approve. But that, in a nutshell, is the satisfying friction of the film, a star vehicle wherein the star keeps threatening to jump from her own limo.  On set filming The Wife with the stunning and talented Glenn Close and her dog Pip.

dd81efdc-8c94-4f1c-8e53-bc110708adb3,"Earlier this week, it was announced Gigi Hadid will walk in the 2017 Victoria‚Äôs Secret Fashion Show, which will take place in Shanghai for the first time. After the location and Hadid‚Äôs participation were revealed, some on social media started bad-mouthing the model, insisting she shouldn‚Äôt be welcome in China after seemingly mocking Asians by squinting her eyes in a Snapchat video back in February. At the time, Hadid was accused of being racist, and now that criticism has resurfaced. That‚Äôs where the real news ends.  ZAYN has a history of coming to Gigi Hadid‚Äòs defense, but no one is really telling HollywoodLife that he‚Äôs ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù to do so again. Gossip Cop can explain how this story is an instance of real news being twisted into fake news.  Here‚Äôs where the fake news begins: ‚ÄúZayn Malik Desperate To Defend Gigi Hadid After Racist Accusations,‚Äù reads the headline of an ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù from HollywoodLies, which claims it ‚ÄúEXCLUSIVELY learned‚Äù he ‚Äúcan‚Äôt stand to see‚Äù his girlfriend ‚Äúhurting over the racist accusations made against her.‚Äù A so-called ‚Äúsource close to the supermodel‚Äù is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúZayn is furious people are accusing Gigi of being racist. He‚Äôs begging her to let him go on a Twitter rant defending her but she‚Äôs asked him to stay quiet for now. She doesn‚Äôt want him feeding the trolls.‚Äù  The webloid is trying to play this two ways. If Malik does tweet, it can claim it was right about him wanting to defend Hadid. If he doesn‚Äôt, the site can claim it was right about Hadid requesting he ‚Äúhold back.‚Äù Just like the tabloids, the bad blog often tries to cover itself. But HollywoodLies can‚Äôt cover up the fact that this story is inauthentic. The assertion that Malik wants to go on a Twitter rant defending Hadid isn‚Äôt really coming from a ‚Äúsource.‚Äù It‚Äôs coming from the singer‚Äôs own past.  He tweeted in defense of Hadid during the original controversy earlier this year, which led to additional angry messages as the backlash grew. (As previously reported, Malik said he was called ‚Äúignorant‚Äù and a ‚Äúterrorist.‚Äù) Because Malik did that before, it‚Äôs not exactly a stretch to think he‚Äôd be upset now and want to defend her again. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly pointed out, HollywoodLies likes to take hot topics (in this case, Hadid doing the fashion show in China) and craft ‚Äúexclusives‚Äù around it (Malik wanting to defend Hadid from haters) for the sake of traffic. But far from being pieces of genuine reporting, these are often fake news stories that contain information anyone could guess.  That is all that‚Äôs going on here. By the way, while HollywoodLies is also maintaining a ‚Äúdevastated‚Äù and ‚Äúdistraught‚Äù Hadid has been ‚Äúcrying a lot‚Äù over the situation, she actually looks pretty happy in the above photo from yesterday.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,586

Jackson and Judge Judy stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend, reminding us just how much we love this friendship. The ‚ÄùCaptain Marvel‚Äù star shared a candid photo with his pal ‚Äî aka Judith Sheindlin ‚Äî on Instagram.  Many users commented about the seemingly unlikely friendship, dying to know what the actor and daytime TV boss could be talking about. Well, these two actually go way back. ‚ÄúThe Kong: Skull Island‚Äù star was asked about the origin of their bond last year on ‚ÄúWatch What Happens Live.‚Äù  Jackson, 69, and Sheindlin, 75, had mutual friends, meeting through the actor‚Äôs agent, Toni Howard. The pair also know each other through Jackson‚Äôs lawyer ‚Äî ‚Äúmy lawyer‚Äôs husband is the guy who makes her deals,‚Äù he said.  As Jackson recalled, they met at Howard‚Äôs house, and they used to smoke cigarettes together. ‚ÄúSo we would sit in Toni‚Äôs backyard and smoke, and when Judy stopped smoking, she made me stop smoking. She sent me to her doctor in White Plains, who actually treats you with sodium pentothal, and I quit smoking. But Judy used to get up in the middle of the night to smoke. She‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòI used to wake up to smoke.‚Äô‚Äù  ‚ÄúWWHL‚Äù host Andy Cohen asked Jackson if Judge Judy was intimidating, to which he replied, ‚ÄúNo! Judy‚Äôs awesome.

In 2017, ‚ÄúJudge Judy‚Äù wrapped its fourth consecutive year as the most-watched syndicated TV show, and it continues to break records left and right. She counts her pal as one of her regular viewers.

Tommy Garcia/Bravo Lydia McLaughlin says that the time was right for her to return to Bravo's ""The Real Housewives of Orange County.""  ""It was actually really hard to decide to leave,"" McLaughlin told INSIDER of quitting the show after just one season in 2013. ""I think a lot of people thought I was crazy. One of the producers actually said, 'It's lightning in a bottle and it doesn't happen twice,' because I told them maybe I'll just take a break. I just felt like my kids were really young and I wanted to have another kid close in age to them. And so it was the right decision for my family, but it was hard.""  Four years later, McLaughlin and her husband, Doug, have added on to her family with a third son and they've created a new high-end men's magazine called ""Nobleman."" With that, McLaughlin decided to end her break and continue her story on the 12th season of Bravo's longest-running ""Real Housewives"" show.  ""I think that's a really interesting kind of story to follow, the two of us really going out, and taking a risk, and starting a magazine, working together, just the two of us to fulfill our dreams,"" the 36-year-old said.  ""And then obviously having the new baby being two years old, I felt like he was old enough where he literally isn't attached to me nursing anymore, so I can be more involved and kind of have something on my own,"" she continued.

Tommy Garcia/Bravo  After the first time around, McLaughlin said she learned some important lessons about trust that she brought with her to this season.  ""Last time, I was really nervous about editing or sharing something, for example, my faith is really important to me and sacred in my life, and I was nervous a lot times when I was filming and talking about that,"" she said. ""I was scared about the way it would be portrayed or how it might be edited. And this time around, I was just more free with it. I think if you do a reality show, you really have to trust the production and trust that your story will get told.""  Although she was more prepared for the rigors of production, McLaughlin was somewhat blindsided by the level of feuding between her cast mates. She hasn't caught up on the show after she left - referring to seeing what was happening on the show and with her cast mates without her as ""bittersweet,"" so she didn't have an accurate idea of where the women's relationships stood.  ""I hadn't watched it, so I was assuming that they don't like each other right now, but they just need to talk and it'll be fine,"" the self-titled ""Friendship Whisperer"" told us.  ""And then I quickly realized it's not something that talking is necessarily going to help, it might make it worse. These ladies have really hurt each other and there's a lot of pain there, so maybe they're not ready to move on. You know, a cup of coffee and a lunch date isn't going to help. So I kind of had to reevaluate my plan and try to figure out what the best thing is for everybody.""

1bd77b0b-11f5-4151-b619-ab4787cb2f00,"The greatest love story of our time 2018 has ended, TMZ reports. Pop singer Ariana Grande and Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson called off their engagement over the weekend, leaving many, many people wondering who will get custody of their pet pig, what they will do about their matching tattoos, and, most pressingly, what will become of the $93,000 pear-shaped diamond ring that Davidson bought for Grande.  People on Twitter were fixated specifically on the question of whether Davidson would be able to get the ring back, since it cost so very much. They didn‚Äôt have to waste away in limbo for long: TMZ reported in the wee hours of Tuesday morning that Grande had already returned it. But, clearly, this situation was about a lot more than a diamond ring.  Who?  Famous people get together and break up all the time, so it‚Äôs important to know that this isn‚Äôt just any celebrity romance. Grande and Davidson‚Äôs relationship captivated onlookers because of its speed, intensity, and incredibly public nature. It was also surprising, since Grande is, well, much more famous than Davidson.  They got together in late May, shortly after breaking up with partners they dated for multiple years ‚Äî the rapper Mac Miller and Cazzie David, Larry David‚Äôs daughter, respectively ‚Äî and fanned the flames of the public‚Äôs interest by flirting via Instagram comments. They got numerous tattoos for one another. After roughly one month of dating, they were engaged.  The usual rites of courtship happened at warp speed, magnified by Grande and Davidson‚Äôs visibility and collective wealth. They adopted a pig and named it Piggy Smalls. They moved into a $16 million apartment in New York together. Grande titled the penultimate song on her album Sweetener ‚Äúpete davidson‚Äù ‚Äî not something most people do in a relationship, but notable nonetheless.  It all seemed so unwise! So soon! But also ... so fun, a spectacle played out on social media, where anyone with an Instagram account could follow their declarations of love. Davidson confirmed the engagement to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fucking lit, Jimmy.‚Äù At the time, it kind of was.  In September, Mac Miller, Grande‚Äôs ex, died at age 26. Grande, who expressed her grief in an Instagram note later that month, has since canceled appearances at a benefit gala and on the season premiere of SNL, which replaced her with Kanye West.  When Davidson and Grande broke up this weekend, it might not have been a huge surprise, but Twitter nonetheless went into overdrive. Of course it did: Fans were here for the romance, and they‚Äôre here for the breakup. But beyond the emotional difficulties at hand, the question people really wanted answered was, who gets to keep that ridiculously expensive ring?  So who gets to keep that ridiculously expensive ring?  On Monday, celebrity sites were already reporting that Grande planned to give the ring back to Davidson, and according to TMZ, that‚Äôs what she did. (But Piggy Smalls remains in Grande‚Äôs custody.) That seems like the reasonable thing to do, and New York courts would agree, since the state considers engagement rings to be contracts, not gifts.  But it is telling that we‚Äôre so obsessed with the question. For most of us, the $93,000 ring, crafted by Manhattan-based jeweler Greg Yuna, seems like a massive financial investment ‚Äî an exorbitant purchase that echoes the all-in nature of Grande and Davidson‚Äôs early relationship. The fate of that ring is just one more piece of this unbelievable romance. (Yuna‚Äôs business has not responded to request for comment about whether it accepts returns on engagement rings.)  There‚Äôs something else happening here, though. A lot of people on Twitter have expressed joking concern over Davidson‚Äôs finances, saying that he‚Äôs going to want the ring back so that he can pay his bills again.  Pete Davidson stealing that diamond ring from @ArianaGrande so he doesn‚Äôt have to eat off of the dollar menu for the rest of his life! pic.twitter.com/Yy7LjAZhcu ‚Äî Dawndi (@Dawn24903615) October 14, 2018  pete davidson have to move to a one bedroom apartment now and pay rent sksksksklsk and he‚Äôs not even done paying for that engagement ring ‚Äî joys√© outsold (@stansroseanne) October 14, 2018  Pete Davidson realizing he can pay his bills this month by selling his engagement ring pic.twitter.com/2W6MwYCSdl ‚Äî ‚ú®David‚ú® (@SimplyDavie) October 15, 2018  im so amused by all the tweets about pete davidson being poor now even though we all know he's rich enough to give her a 100k ring ‚Äî spooky michelle (@michellelailai) October 15, 2018  To be clear: None of us know what‚Äôs up with Davidson‚Äôs finances. He probably makes a good salary on SNL, but that‚Äôs about as much as you can say! It seems like these comments have less to do with Davidson‚Äôs income and more with Davidson‚Äôs income in relation to Grande‚Äôs.  Grande is massively successful ‚Äî her albums, much like her hair, are certified platinum ‚Äî and she definitely makes more than Davidson does. Their income disparity flips on its head the societal norm that says men in heterosexual relationships should be the breadwinners. Suggesting that Davidson is broke stretches those stereotypes even further: If a man isn‚Äôt making as much as his female partner, he must be a complete failure. He must be financially reliant.  There was a real power imbalance in Davidson and Grande‚Äôs relationship, and that was one of the reasons people followed it so avidly. (The desire to understand what each party was bringing to the table is also related to the advent of the phrase ‚ÄúBig Dick Energy.‚Äù) Grande was a world-famous pop star; Davidson was a sketch comedian who hadn‚Äôt yet crossed over into mainstream Hollywood in the way that SNL alums like Will Ferrell or Amy Poehler have. In a way, Grande was Davidson‚Äôs big break, and on the late-night talk show circuit, he wasn‚Äôt shy about the differences in their career status.  ‚ÄúWe got a pig. Yo, can I just say, this girl, she was like, ‚ÄòI want a pig!‚Äô And then an hour later, it was just there,‚Äù Davidson said on Late Night With Seth Meyers in September. ‚ÄúYou know what I mean? I‚Äôm still trying to get a Propecia refill ... this girl got a pig in an hour.‚Äù  And in a GQ interview published in August, Davidson expressed a certain hesitance to call their apartment his own:  Davidson and Grande recently moved into a Manhattan apartment that reportedly cost $16 million. She bought the place, Davidson says, and he stocks the fridge. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs really sweet. She‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòThis is our house,‚Äô and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre very nice for saying that. Thank you for letting me stay here,‚Äô ‚Äú he deadpans. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre getting married!‚Äô And I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòI know, thank you for letting me stay here.‚Äô ‚Äú  On Monday, someone started a GoFundMe to give Davidson money for housing, though the page was removed that day.  Of course, when people express faux concern over Davidson‚Äôs finances, they might also be assuming that since Grande and Davidson rushed into a romantic relationship, one or both of them might also make rash financial decisions that they can‚Äôt actually fund. Onlookers might be conflating Davidson‚Äôs mental health challenges, which he‚Äôs been open about, with an inability to manage money.  The fact is, we don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs up. Only this: Love is dead.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1520

Felicity, who also starred in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, made a speech at the ceremony.  Wearing an expression of utter delight, she slicked her wavy dark hair back beneath a classic mesh veil that fell to the floor.  Meanwhile, her groom, 45, cut a dapper figure in a three-piece suit with silver trousers, a black jacket and a pale yellow waistcoat.  A day in the Cotswolds: The ceremony took place at Sudeley Castle, a spectacular structure near Winchcombe, Gloucestershire in England  Rounding off the look with a sky blue tie over a white dress shirt, he popped a flower in his lapel for his special day.

Rumors about trouble in David and Victoria‚Äôs marriage have been proliferating in the tabloids since the Royal Wedding, where the couple was photographed looking dour. Of course, there are always rumors about the Beckhams, who will (hopefully?) celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary on July 4. This time, though, social-media participants seem convinced that they are really heading for a split.  There are a few factors to consider when weighing the possibility of divorce. One is: Do you care? Another is: What have the Beckhams said about their marriage? (It‚Äôs F-I-N-E, according to their publicist, who called the rumors ‚ÄúJournalist Chinese whispers and fake news fueled by social media.‚Äù) And another is: What‚Äôs going on with the Beckhams‚Äô businesses?  Last week, the Daily Mail reported that David left his longtime manager, who also manages Posh, for a new team led by his friend David Gardner. This, to me, would be the strongest sign of an impending split, but the Beckhams quickly denied the report. Then, Victoria gave a speech at the Forbes Women Summit in New York, where she mentioned David specifically and called him an ‚Äúincredible husband.‚Äù  ‚ÄúI try really, really hard. I try hardest to be the best mother,‚Äù she said in her speech, according to People. ‚ÄúI am trying to be the best wife and the best professional. When I get home I try to put the phone down and spend time with the children and spend time with David. I have the support of an incredible husband. We really are equal with everything we do at home with the children. When I‚Äôm away he‚Äôs the one doing the school run and doing the cooking.‚Äù  So Victoria is trying. Is David? So far, he hasn‚Äôt personally said anything about the divorce rumors. I‚Äôd wait to see what he does next week for their anniversary.  In other celebrity relationship news, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are doing great. Shookus‚Äôs parents visited the couple in L.A. this past weekend, and they all went on a dinner date and a hike the next day. (Shookus‚Äôs 5-year-old daughter was present for the hike, too.) According to an ‚Äúeyewitness‚Äù who talked to People, Affleck was in a ‚Äúgreat mood‚Äù at dinner, and he ‚Äúpicked up the check at the end of the night.‚Äù  Photo: Juliano-rol/X17online.com  But Affleck and Shookus are not necessarily getting more serious, according to Entertainment Tonight. A source close to Affleck told the outlet, ‚ÄúBen knows he loves Lindsay, but he wants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety. He‚Äôs actually been told to take it slow and he‚Äôs heeding that advice ‚Ä¶ Ben isn‚Äôt ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon, but Lindsay feels he is worth the wait.‚Äù  What do you think? Is Ben Affleck worth the wait?  Moving more quickly is Shookus‚Äôs SNL colleague Pete Davidson, who just moved into a $16 million apartment in Manhattan with his new fianc√©, Ariana Grande. Grande‚Äôs 25th birthday is today, and Davidson wished her a happy birthday on Instagram just after midnight.  Last night, Grande posted a photo of Davidson on her Instagram story at 11:11 p.m. with the caption, ‚Äúi have no wish i have everything i ever wanted hi.‚Äù I love it!  Do you remember who Chris Martin is dating? It‚Äôs Dakota Johnson. They were photographed walking a dog in Malibu on Sunday.  Photo: DOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID  One small blessing from this week:  Martin‚Äôs ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, is preparing to marry her fianc√©, the television producer Brad Falchuk at the end of the summer. Here‚Äôs what she had to say about wedding planning this time around:  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very busy so I‚Äôm actually not that involved in it.‚Äù  Photo: XPOS/BACKGRID  And here‚Äôs an interesting blind item from this week, from Enty at Crazy Days and Nights:  ‚ÄúThis former A- list mostly television actress from a now defunct hit comedy is probably A-/B+ list mostly movie actress. She says that this A-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know spent three weeks chatting her up and doing everything he could to hook up with her.

Finally, I‚Äôll leave you with some incredible news: Emma Watson is back together with former Glee star Chord Overstreet. Or perhaps they never broke up? They first announced their relationship back in March, with a very obvious pap stroll in L.A.. Then, People reported at the end of May that they were over.

c0018393-39e7-4576-8d16-37cc176bfb39,"Many stars saw great success in 2016, but the year wasn‚Äôt without its major celebrity scandals. Here are some of the worst celebrity scandals of the year:  1. Chumlee‚Äôs home raided  ‚ÄúPawn Stars‚Äù favorite Austin Lee Russell, better known as Chumlee, was arrested in March after police serving a search warrant in a sexual assault investigation found methamphetamine, marijuana and a gun at his southwest Las Vegas home. The 33-year-old was booked on 19 drug-possession charges and one weapon charge. In May, the reality star took a plea deal and agreed to counseling and three years' probation.  2. Taylor Swift‚Äôs image questioned  Hollywood good girl Taylor Swift came under intense scrutiny in 2016 after her messy breakup with Calvin Harris and her reignited feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian.  First, Harris slammed Swift for comments her PR team made about a song they‚Äôd worked on together. Referencing Swift‚Äôs long rumored feud with Katy Perry he wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I‚Äôm not that guy, sorry...‚Äù  Then, Swift slammed Kanye West at the Grammys for his lyrics to ‚ÄúFamous,‚Äù in which he rapped about her ‚ÄúI made that bitch famous.‚Äù At the Grammys, Swift cautioned her fans about ‚Äúpeople‚Ä¶ who try to undercut your success or take credit for‚Ä¶ your fame."" West insisted he‚Äôd had the pop star‚Äôs permission to include her in his song, and in July, Kim Kardashian was ready to prove it. She released a recording of Swift speaking with West, approving of her name being used on the track.  The incidents left Swift fans wondering if the starlet was secretly a celebrity mean girl.  Since then, however, she has avoided controversy and done charity work that likely has her back in the good graces of the Twitterverse.    3. Ryan Lochte‚Äôs lie  Ryan Lochte had a lot going for him as he headed to Rio for the Olympics over the summer, but the spotlight-hungry swimmer was branded a liar after he claimed he‚Äôd been robbed at gunpoint while out in Brazil, and then recanted the story once inconsistencies became apparent. Lochte lost his sponsorships over the incident, and the Olympic Committee banned him from swimming through June 2017. He also lost $100,000 in bonuses.  Still, the swimmer landed a short-lived slot on ‚ÄúDancing with the Stars‚Äù and got engaged to his Playboy model girlfriend, so all in all he didn‚Äôt have the worst 2016 ever.  4. Accusations against Johnny Depp  In May, Johnny Depp made headlines for all the wrong reasons when his ex Amber Heard accused him of abusing her. In the weeks that followed, a video leaked of a violent clash between Heard and Depp and fans quickly turned on the actor. His camp denied the abuse allegations and several of his famous exes came forward to defend his character. In August, Depp and Heard quietly settled their divorce. He has since landed a role in J.K. Rowling‚Äôs upcoming sequel to ‚ÄúFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.‚Äù  5. Brad Pitt abuse allegations  Brangelina fans were shocked when Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced they were going their separate ways in 2016. The pair announced they were calling it quits in September, and things turned even more dramatic when rumors swirled that Pitt was being accused of abusing their oldest son Maddox. In November, the FBI wrapped their investigation into an alleged argument between Pitt and Maddox that took place on a plane, and the agency announced no charges would be filed against Pitt.  6. Kimye turmoil  Both Kim Kardashian and Kanye West faced serious struggles in 2016. Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in October in Paris and thieves made off with millions of dollars in jewelry. The Instagram addict removed herself from the public eye after the traumatic experience. She stopped sharing things on social media and avoided public appearances, opting to stay home with her family.  Then, at the end of November, her husband Kanye West‚Äôs trademark erratic behavior took a serious turn when he was hospitalized for a reported psychotic breakdown. The rapper had been ranting more than ever during his concerts ‚Äì something he is known for ‚Äì and abruptly canceled his Saint Pablo tour. He was then suddenly hospitalized and Kim rushed to be by his side. 2016 wasn‚Äôt the best year for the Hollywood hot couple to say the least.  7. Gigi mocks Melania  In November, model Gigi Hadid faced backlash after she mocked Melania Trump during her speech at the American Music Awards. ""I love my husband, President Barack Obama and our children Sasha and Malia,"" Hadid said through pouted lips and a fake accent, mocking Melania's RNC speech that lifted material from a speech given by Michelle Obama.

e6db1e7b-4aff-4c44-b4df-53747662e8d6,"With his off-kilter sensibility (Stupid Pet Tricks?) and his penchant for the oddball (what other host runs across the stage in silhouette before starting a show, or strikes up a telephone relationship with a woman who works in an office across the street?), David Letterman has left everyone who enjoys latenight television in stitches. Now, he‚Äôs about to leave them in splinters.  When Letterman signs off CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúLate Show‚Äùfor the last time early Thursday morning, he will deprive TV of its last direct link to Johnny Carson and an era when just one, then two, hosts could dominate the period. The arrivals of Jimmy Kimmel at ABC, then Jimmy Fallon at NBC, and, soon, Stephen Colbert at CBS have given rise to talk of a third generation of late-night talent (if Carson, not Jack Paar or Steve Allen, is to be seen as the root of this particular tree). A fourth and a fifth are already starting to grow.  Carson was the undisputed king of latenight, and Leno and Letterman merely viceroys over large populaces. These days, the land has no ruler. Simply put, by jumping to CBS from NBC after being passed over for the Carson job on ‚ÄúTonight‚Äù ‚Äì and tweaking the antics from ‚ÄúLate Night‚Äù for a broader audience at 11:30 p.m. ‚Äì Letterman signaled the TV business that anyone could make a go of it around midnight.  Related David Letterman's Departure Will Mark Irreparable 'Late Shift' for TV Conan O'Brien Journeys to Cuba in Search of Latenight Surprise  Anyone has. Thanks to Letterman, the post-local news slot is no longer the main beachhead at evening‚Äôs end. He (along with Tom Snyder) proved a younger crowd would tune in for non-traditional antics in the early hours of the morning. And so we have not only Seth Meyers hanging out in Letterman‚Äôs old roost, but James Corden stirring things up with a new ‚ÄúLate Late Show‚Äù on CBS that has the vibe of a raucous house party. Meantime, ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúNightline‚Äù has tried transforming itself into a ‚Äúyou-are-there‚Äù magazine program with decent results.  But that‚Äôs not all. Since Letterman proved that one could make a viable grab for less than the whole audience and still make a go of it, dozens of others have tried and continue to do so. Time Warner has backed Conan O‚ÄôBrien since he separated from NBC over the direction of ‚ÄúTonight.‚Äù Comedy Central has fared extremely well by launching ‚ÄúThe Daily Show,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Colbert Report‚Äù and ‚Äú@midnight,‚Äù though its success will continue to be tested by transition and Jon Stewart‚Äôs departure in weeks to come. And all of that doesn‚Äôt take into account the many hopefuls who have wrestled their own large or small piece of the end-of-day crowd over the years: Chelsea Handler; Joan Rivers; Pat Sajak; Chevy Chase; Arsenio Hall; Joan Rivers; Phil Cowan and Paul Robin of Fox‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Wilton-North Report‚Äù; Craig Kilborn; Craig Ferguson; Pete Holmes; and George Lopez.  The field will only widen, and ratings will dwindle as audiences disperse. Consider the fact that 42 million people tuned in to see Carson‚Äôs final turn on ‚ÄúTonight‚Äù in 1992 and just 14.6 million watched Jay Leno‚Äôs second adieu to the program in 2014.  There is still a lot to be said about late-night tradition, which is why CBS is placing so much importance on Stephen Colbert‚Äôs debut in September. Many TV networks clearly see opportunity in programs that speak to interesting niches. National Geographic Channel has already lined up astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson for a second season of a weekly run of his ‚ÄúStar Talk‚Äù podcast and radio show, which examines the ways in which science mixes with popular culture. CMT is readying a June 11th launch for ‚ÄúThe Josh Wolf Show,‚Äù which will examine country-music celebrities from Wednesday to Saturday. MTV is preparing two late-night concepts: ‚ÄúGirl Code Live,‚Äù which features three female comediennes mixing sketch comedy and celebrity chatter, and ‚ÄúMiddle of the Night Show,‚Äù which will force an unsuspecting celebrity to host a late-night program on the spot from his or her home.  With all of these bespoke efforts in the pipeline, it‚Äôs tempting to think the big, broad mainstays of the past are falling out of fashion. Not so.  Fallon and Kimmel have revitalized the format by trotting out clever stunts tailor-made for a younger audience that would rather stream the best bits at their leisure (what that dynamic says about the future of candid moments with celebrities is uncertain, though it was heartening recently to see Nicole Kidman confess to a crush on Jimmy Fallon at an earlier time and Fallon acknowledge he had missed her signals during a failed date). Conan O‚ÄôBrien is also pushing into new frontiers, readying a series of road trips that will feature him mixing it up with interesting people in sundry locales, much as he did during a recent sojourn to Cuba. Chelsea Handler‚Äôs coming format experiment on Netflix, which she has said will play like a hipper, faster version of ‚Äú60 Minutes,‚Äù will likely draw interest, just like the investigative humor John Oliver has burnished on HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúLast Week Tonight.‚Äù And Time Warner‚Äôs TBS could get into the game in a big way when it launches a new program featuring former ‚ÄúDaily Show‚Äù contributor Samantha Bee.  None of it would be possible without David Letterman, who bravely left a sure thing ‚Äì at one moment his ‚ÄúLate Night‚Äù was the coolest thing on TV ‚Äì for an uncertain one, and pulled it off. Leno won more viewers, but Letterman proved the distinction was in some ways negligible. Now, as TV viewing continues to fragment, advertisers say they are placing more emphasis on audiences that demonstrate true passion, not necessarily the shows that always draw the biggest crowds.  Letterman might have thrived if he continued (particularly if he proved able to maintain the new energy he has mustered in his current program‚Äôs last weeks). He has won notice for the most candid chatter in the time slot and is seen by many as the leading voice in bringing the nation back from tragedy after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.  In today‚Äôs TV-viewing environment, there is no more King of Late Night ‚Äì at least not in the way Johnny Carson was. ‚ÄúI think Johnny Carson was the last King of Late Night,‚Äù Jimmy Kimmel told Advertising Age in 2013 just before moving his program to 11:35 p.m. on ABC. ‚ÄúI hope to have a narrow edge on everyone else. That‚Äôs really all you can hope for.‚Äù  On May 20th, David Letterman won‚Äôt have to bring the house down. He did that in 1993 when he started up with CBS.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1315

We tapped a couple facial plastic surgeons to get a better understanding of facial anatomy.  ‚ÄúTimeline-wise, it's not clear when the facial paralysis started after laser hair removal. However, while anything can happen, it would be unusual for facial paralysis to result from laser treatments, as the facial nerve is usually deeper to the level of the burn,‚Äù explains Beverly Hills, CA facial plastic surgeon, Kimberly Lee, MD. ‚ÄúWith deeper burns, sensory nerve endings can be affected, which can lead to numbness. The facial nerve is a motor nerve that is deeper and more robust than sensory nerves. To affect this nerve, the burn would have to be quite deep and substantial and would have to be located in the course of the nerve itself.‚Äù  New York facial plastic surgeon Matthew White, MD agrees that while laser hair removal certainly isn‚Äôt risk-free, it‚Äôs not likely to cause facial paralysis. ‚ÄúThe lasers used for hair removal can‚Äôt penetrate deeply enough to damage the facial nerves directly,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúHowever, a laser could reactivate a virus, which can lead to Bell‚Äôs Palsy, [a condition that does cause paralysis].‚Äù  Bottom line: While it‚Äôs not so clear-cut what might have happened, Glanville‚Äôs experience is a reminder that all cosmetic procedures come with some risk of side effects.

Scott Menaged, 40, had previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft, the office said.  Menaged operated a real-estate investment business and retail furniture stores in Phoenix, the office said.  He had also appeared on the Discovery Channel's ""Property Wars.""  Embezzled money supported 'lavish lifestyle'  The office said Menaged embezzled millions of dollars in loans meant for real-estate purchases, provided fake real-estate purchase documents to conceal the fraud, and used the embezzled money to support a ""lavish lifestyle"" including travel, million-dollar homes and luxury vehicles.  Once Menaged no longer had access to the embezzled funds, the office said, he orchestrated an ""elaborate identity theft scheme"" with purported customers of his furniture stores.  Menaged used names and personal identification information of recently deceased individuals and used their information to submit fake credit application from his furniture stores to various banks, the office said.  The office said no real furniture purchases ever took place and the ID theft resulted in more than $2 million in losses to the banks.  'Fitting punishment'  ‚ÄúMenaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme and brazenly stole from his victims ‚Äî their money, their identities, and ultimately their trust,‚Äù First Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A.

6322e0d1-fcda-40f3-9717-e92065eef00e,"Those impatient with high-end Britfilm period product might worry that this movie takes a rather picturesque view of disability issues, and for the first 20 minutes I came pretty close to this standpoint myself. But you have to give Breathe time to let its charm and its heartfelt decency grow on you. The film is about an important figure in the history of how we think about and respect disabled people ‚Äì the wheelchair-use pioneer and polio survivor Robin Cavendish (whose son Jonathan is the movie‚Äôs producer).  Andy Serkis makes his debut as director, working from a robust screenplay by William Nicholson. Andrew Garfield plays Cavendish, a rather dashing fellow in the 1950s who zooms around the place in his sports car and plays a splendid game of cricket, hitting a six that breaks the teacups set out by the clubhouse and roguishly calling out: ‚ÄúSorry!‚Äù He spots a beautiful young woman among the spectators: Diana Blacker, played by Claire Foy. It‚Äôs love at first sight, and marriage soon afterwards, and then a rather memsahib-like existence for her in Kenya (pronounced Keen-ya) because Cavendish is a ‚Äútea broker‚Äù there.  But then one day Cavendish feels faint and collapses: he has polio, is paralysed from the neck down, and after he is brought back to England, the medical establishment curtly tells Diana not to expect her husband to live any more than a few months, and only as a prostrate patient who must be passive and obedient. But armed with love and courage, the Cavendishes demand more of existence than this, and Robin defies the grumpy doctors by using a new respirator-wheelchair invented especially for him. It is possible that for this role, Garfield studied Kenneth More playing the disabled Air Force pilot Douglas Bader in the biopic Reach for the Sky.  It‚Äôs a valuable and touching story, and it is extraordinary to think that so recently, disabled people in this position were treated like living corpses, there to be clinically warehoused and studied, and told to be grateful and mute. There is a chilling scene in which Cavendish and his friends are taken to see a facility in Germany that turns out to be some Kubrickian living morgue: white, brightly lit, with patients entombed in state-of-the-art medical sarcophagi.  As for the central relationship, it is a matter of getting on with it, keeping love alive in the little things and staying cheerful in a very British way ‚Äì which I‚Äôm sure is a fair depiction of exactly how the Cavendishes coped. There is a delicate allusion to what might be called their conjugal intimacy ‚Äì Robin says it is a matter of Diana ‚Äúdoing all the work‚Äù ‚Äì although the business of other bodily functions is not shown. The lump-in-the-throat seriousness is offset with fun small roles, principally for Tom Hollander, who plays both Diana‚Äôs twin brothers and provides some much-needed irony and cynicism. Hugh Bonneville has some fun with the role of scientist Teddy Hall, who invents Robin‚Äôs wheelchair.  The problem is that there is not much light and shade in the Cavendishes themselves ‚Äì and certainly not with Diana, at times a rather thankless role for Foy (given far less to chew on here than as the Queen in the Netflix series The Crown). She is loyal, loving, often exasperated and sometimes angry ‚Äì but it is still a pretty narrow emotional bandwidth. Robin has his own dark night of the soul, just after he is told that he will not walk again, but it is always clear that this bitterness is only temporary.  And those who wonder if the British film industry will tackle the issue of Kenya and the Mau Mau uprising may not be entirely happy with the way that is invoked: a rather saucer-eyed anecdote around the Kenyan camp-fire about Mau Mau prisoners choosing a Zen-willed suicide for themselves in detention camps. Most accounts suggest Mau Mau prisoners died rather more brutally than that, yet this quaint image is later revived to evoke Robin‚Äôs own stoicism when his own condition becomes too much to bear.  At all events, Breathe is an affecting account of the quiet courage needed to battle the deadly spores of discrimination and condescension that came with polio.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,792

Prince Philip, 96, left the private King Edward VII hospital in London at midday on Friday; he was admitted on Tuesday 3 April.  Buckingham Palace said he would continue his recovery at Windsor, adding: ‚ÄúHis royal highness would like to convey his appreciation for the messages of good wishes he has received.‚Äù  On Thursday, he was visited by his daughter, the princess royal, who said he was ‚Äúon good form‚Äù.  Anne, whose visit lasted about 50 minutes, is believed to be theonly member of the royal family to visit Philip in the central London hospital.  The Queen also gave an update, telling a wellwisher in Windsor: ‚ÄúHe said he‚Äôs getting on very well.‚Äù  The duke will have begun his rehabilitation, moving with the aid of a stick or crutches, and will face weeks of aftercare as he learns to walk again on his new hip.  For about a month before the operation, Philip had complained about trouble with the joint. Medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.  The Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure aged 95, followed by an emergency operation when she was 97.

772fe4e4-b16b-442a-a198-40a53c3504d6,"My mother, and the mothers of my friends in single-parent families, were the first inspirational group of women I knew. The majority of fathers that I saw when I was growing up in Vancouver didn't take the responsibility to look after their kids and I was aware that society is geared towards punishing single women. Because my mother didn't have someone else there, she had to give both her kids a lot more responsibility, which allowed me to deal with being an adult quicker.  I've always felt more comfortable in the company of women, and as far as girlfriends go, they've each been a learning experience. You meet someone at a certain point in your life, then break apart, but you always share that time. And you'll run into each other years later to find you have nothing in common, but you'll always have that mutual experience - that moment.  I wish I could still believe in the Romeo and Juliet way but it doesn't seem to work. I only believe in lust at first sight. Love takes much longer to develop, and it's constantly renewing. As an actor, it's always an odd occasion when you're building that false romance with someone, because the only way I've learnt to do it is to actually fall in love a bit. When you're playing those parts, you have to open yourself up to someone in the way you would to a lover, so you do emotionally connect. That's one of the bizarre aspects of our business - you build these incredibly intense relationships with people and then when the film's finished you all part ways and never see each other again. Everyone goes back to paying their bills and looking after their babies, and the film is just this little memory of sunlight.  I've worked with some brilliant actresses who teach by doing, not by saying, and through working on a TV show for six years I actually grew up with some amazing women. Katie [Holmes], at the beginning of Dawson's Creek was so natural - she'd never really worked before, so the words would go in her ear and come out her mouth with no filter and it was beautiful to watch. On Bobby I worked with an amazing group of women - Demi Moore, Helen Hunt, Sharon Stone, Heather Graham, Joy Bryant. And each represented a different thing.  Actresses have to be quite galvanised, so I meet women who are really headstrong. I find that strength attractive - I like a woman who can argue - I live in LA, and there are a lot of pretty, stupid women. My sister's very strong-headed too, which can be a pain in my ass I'll admit, but I'm from a family where you're not only expected to have an opinion but be able to defend it.  I have lots of hard-earned knowledge about women through heartbreak, and social faux pas. When I was about 15, thinking I was engaging in light conversation, I asked a woman when she was due. Of course, she wasn't pregnant. I learnt the lesson never to ask again. As a leading man you don't ask a woman's age, and you don't care about her natural hair colour or her weight.  There'll always be sexual tension between male and female friends - we're animals after all, wired to accept each other on a sexual level at all times. Of course we all agree to a variety of social restraints, but it doesn't mean the basic impulses aren't there, and I don't think sex is an unhealthy impulse. It's only when you try to hide and subvert it that it manifests itself in ugly ways.  Part of post-feminism, I think, is women taking responsibility for themselves, and for doing what makes them happy. I think there's more progress to be made, but I don't think many of us are raised with those sexist ideals about women any more. I think we're moving towards equality. But, you know, I have a 23-year-old sister, so I have to believe that things are changing. I have to.  ¬∑ Joshua Jackson's latest film, Bobby, is out now",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,809
66b8c01c-72cd-47c8-93b7-c86b9924edc3,"One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either ‚Äî but she managed to make it to the reception.  In the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all ‚Äî where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's ""no ring, no bring"" policy ‚Äî meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed ‚Äî for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)  As it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the ""no ring no bring"" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?  The way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)  courtesy of Lifetime  Unfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.  Oh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle ‚Äî in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place ‚Äî which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.  And look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding ‚Äî the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement ‚Äî likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,790

The original story led to the cancellation of the TLC reality show ‚Äú19 Kids and Counting.‚Äù  The sisters are not contesting the accuracy of the In Touch report ‚Äî indeed, they themselves subsequently confirmed that they were the victims in the case. Instead, they seem to be following the playbook of Hulk Hogan, who brought down Gawker with an invasion-of-privacy claim.  The sisters ‚Äî Jill Dillard, Joy Duggar, Jessa Seewald, and Jinger Vuolo ‚Äî also sued the city of Springdale, Arkansas, and Washington County, Arkansas, which released investigative records to In Touch pursuant to a public records request. The suit alleges that the localities violated state and federal privacy laws in releasing the documents.  ‚ÄúPlaintiffs had no knowledge that the highly personal and painful details revealed in their confidential interviews would be disclosed to anyone except law enforcement and child services personnel,‚Äù the suit states. ‚ÄúIndeed, they were instructed that their statements would remain confidential and not be released to the public.‚Äù  Related Josh Duggar Apologizes: ‚ÄòI Have Been the Biggest Hypocrite Ever‚Äô  According to the suit, local officials provided the sensitive police records just five days after receiving a records request from In Touch‚Äôs lawyer. The suit alleges that officials in the small town failed to properly consult with various branches of government before releasing the documents. If they had done so, the plaintiffs allege they would have discovered that juvenile records were not subject to disclosure.  The suit cites speculation within the Springdale Police Department that a department source had leaked information about the case to the media, given that outlets seemed to know exactly which records to ask for. The records did not name the victims, but the suit alleges that online commentators were quickly able to puzzle out the girls‚Äô identities.  ‚ÄúPlaintiffs were subjected to spiteful and harsh comments and harassment on the Internet and in their daily lives,‚Äù the suit states. ‚ÄúSome chastised their personal decision to forgive their brother while others used the opportunity to provide unwarranted commentary on all aspects of Plaintiffs‚Äô lives. Others simply reveled in the ad hoc disclosure of the lurid details of Plaintiffs‚Äô suffering.‚Äù  Unlike in the Hogan case, the material published by In Touch came from a government proceeding. News organizations are generally given wide leeway in the reporting of governmental conduct.  In Touch has not responded.

ROYAL aides are said to be concerned over the public outbursts of Meghan Markle‚Äôs dad, following a number of explosive TV interviews in recent months.  According to the Mirror in the UK, aides at the Palace have held at least three top-level crisis meetings on how to stop Thomas Markle upsetting his daughter.  It comes after the 74-year-old claimed the Duchess is ‚Äúterrified‚Äù of her new royal role and, royal insiders say, ‚Äúcrossed the line‚Äù with his comments that Princess Diana would have ‚Äúloathed‚Äù how he had been frozen out of the royal circle, reports The Sun.  The Mirror also claims that the matter has gotten so out of hand that royal sources say the only way to end the farce will be for the Queen to step in.  Sources suggest the talks have centred around three potential options to bring the situation to a close.  The first would be for Meghan to talk directly to her father via a phone call in a personal appeal for him to stop, and a second could be to arrange an intermediary meeting to appeal to him face-to-face.  A final scenario would be to cut him off, the Mirror has claimed.  Kensington Palace declined to comment on the claims.  The Daily Mail reported an unnamed friend of Meghan‚Äôs saying that a reconciliation is completely off the table.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no chance right now - he‚Äôs been a complete embarrassment,‚Äù the source said.

Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she's listening to Cardi B 's ""Be Careful,"" perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper's recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy .

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Kalhan Rosenblatt and Rima Abdelkader  Wall Street is going to the dogs ‚Äî or at least it did for a few hours on Monday.  That‚Äôs when artist Alex Gardega installed a pug statue called ‚ÄúSketchy Dog,‚Äù which appeared to be urinating on the ‚ÄúFearless Girl‚Äù statue‚Äôs leg.  ""Most people were amused or perplexed by it,"" Gardega told NBC News. ""Kids petted it, people were taking pictures with it. A few were upset and kicked it.""  Gardega said he created his clay and faux bronze ‚ÄúSketchy Dog‚Äù as an act of solidarity with guerilla artist Arturo Di Modica, who created Wall Street‚Äôs iconic ‚ÄúCharging Bull‚Äù statue.  ‚ÄúI have a lot of empathy for the creator of the bull, Arturo. He is very upset,‚Äù Gardega said.  Artist Alex Gardega placed his ""sketchy dog"" statue next to ""Fearless Girl."" Alex Gardega  Di Modica finished ‚ÄúCharging Bull‚Äù after the 1987 stock market collapse, and placed it in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a symbol of American resilience. The city initially removed it, but later re-installed it in its current location near Wall Street in the Financial District.  Conversely, the ‚ÄúFearless Girl‚Äù statue, was commissioned by one of the world‚Äôs largest banks ‚Äî State Street Global Advisors ‚Äî as a way to call attention to the gender pay gap and a lack of women on corporate financial sector boards, according to the company.  State Street is also the creator of the Gender Diversity Index SHE, which tracks gender diversity in companies. An inscription at the feet of ‚ÄúFearless Girl‚Äù reads, ‚ÄúKnow the Power of Leadership, SHE makes a difference.""  ‚ÄúThat piece, [‚ÄòFearless Girl‚Äô] was not made by some individual artist making a statement,‚Äù Gardega said. ‚ÄúIt was made by a billion dollar financial firm trying to promote an index fund. It is advertising/promotion in the guise of art. That was my only point.‚Äù  But Gardega said there is some value in the ‚ÄúFearless Girl‚Äù sculpture. He said it‚Äôs clear that it makes children happy, and ‚Äúart is supposed to make kids happy.‚Äù  After approximately three hours, Gardega took his ‚ÄúSketchy Dog‚Äù down.  ""I didn't want to leave it to be taken and certainly had no rights [sic] to bolt it to the ground,"" he said.  In response to the ""Sketchy Dog"" statue, State Street Global Advisors said it was proud of what ""Fearless Girl"" represented.  ""We continue to be grateful to the countless people around the world who continue to responded so enthusiastically to what the Fearless Girl represents ‚Äî the power and potential of having more women in leadership,"" a State Street spokeswoman wrote in an email to NBC News. ""Fearless Girl was created to stand as a reminder that having more women in leadership positions positively contributes to overall performance and strengthens our economy.""  Gardega said that there‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with the ‚ÄúFearless Girl,‚Äù and he created ‚ÄúSketchy Dog‚Äù with a sense of humor, but he said neither piece should interfere with Di Modica‚Äôs work.  ‚ÄúI'm a pretty happy person, not seething or angry and certainly not anti-feminist. My piece is not without a sense of humor but I do feel for Arturo and the integrity of his art,‚Äù Gardega said. ‚ÄúThere is plenty of room for ‚ÄòFearless Girl.‚Äô It just interferes with another artist's work/vision.‚Äù",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,703

It started on NPR over the weekend when McEnroe, on a promotional tour for his new book, ‚ÄúBut Seriously,‚Äù caught some heat for a comment he made about Serena Williams:  Garcia-Navarro: We‚Äôre talking about male players but there is of course wonderful female players. Let‚Äôs talk about Serena Williams. You say she is the best female player in the world in the book. McEnroe: Best female player ever ‚Äî no question. Garcia-Navarro: Some wouldn‚Äôt qualify it, some would say she‚Äôs the best player in the world. Why qualify it? McEnroe: Oh! Uh, she‚Äôs not, you mean, the best player in the world, period? Garcia-Navarro: Yeah, the best tennis player in the world. You know, why say female player? McEnroe: Well because if she was in, if she played the men‚Äôs circuit she‚Äôd be like 700 in the world. Garcia-Navarro: You think so? McEnroe: Yeah. That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt think Serena is an incredible player. I do, but the reality of what would happen would be I think something that perhaps it‚Äôd be a little higher, perhaps it‚Äôd be a little lower. And on a given day, Serena could beat some players. I believe because she‚Äôs so incredibly strong mentally that she could overcome some situations where players would choke ‚Äôcause she‚Äôs been in it so many times, so many situations at Wimbledon, The U.S. Open, etc. But if she had to just play the circuit ‚Äî the men‚Äôs circuit ‚Äî that would be an entirely different story.  As I wrote at the time, it was a pretty ‚Äògotcha‚Äô line of questioning from the host. McEnroe repeatedly lavished praise on Serena‚Äôs ability but didn‚Äôt steer away from the line of questioning above, creating a backlash that Serena responded to on Monday:  Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based. ‚Äî Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017  I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time.

65eae356-202a-4463-b830-4f3578747758,"There are so many things to love about Halloween: the candy that ends up everywhere, the creepy but adorable decorations all over the place, and the fact that all of your favorite foods suddenly taste like pumpkin. One thing that most people really love about the holiday is the chance to dress up in a costume, to spend a few hours (or different days) as someone you aren't. A lot of Halloween fans love the chance to go all out with the makeup, the clothes, and even the attitude. Because of this, it's easy to forget that not everyone enjoys dressing up ‚Äî in fact, some people love Halloween, they just don't love wearing costumes. So what are you supposed to do on Halloween if you're an adult who doesn't like dressing up?  Luckily, there are a lot of ways to celebrate Halloween without pretending to be your favorite TV character or movie star. You definitely don't need to be decked out in an expensive outfit you'll probably never wear again, or caking your face in costume makeup in order to be in the spooky spirit of things. After all, that's one of the great things about Halloween - there are so many different ways to celebrate it, and you should definitely embrace all of them.  So, if you're not a fan of Halloween costumes, try doing some of (or all of!) the below activities to have fun this October 31, and all of the days leading up to it.  1 Make Creepy Treats Half-Baked Harvest One fun way to show everyone how much you love Halloween without wearing a costume is to make some fun and spooky Halloween-themed treats. There are elaborate options, like these monster mash cookies from Half-Baked Harvest, or more simple things (like slice and bake cookie dough from the grocery store!). Either way, they'll be delicious, fun to make, and spooky in the best way.  2 Wear Halloween-Inspired Clothing ASOS ASOS Design Curve Halloween Resting Witch Face Shirt, $19, ASOS Even if you don't like wearing a costume, you can still wear Halloween-themed clothing so that you feel like you're still involved (or just for fun, because most things are really cute). There are tons of options out there, from skeleton shirts to scary movie tees to sassy sayings, like this one from ASOS.  3 Tell Ghost Stories Around A Bonfire Giphy Few things are better than sitting around a warm bonfire on a chilly autumn night. Plan a get-together with a few friends, make a fire, then tell ghost stories in the dark. It's a really cute way to celebrate Halloween.  4 Go To A Haunted House Giphy Creep yourself out by heading to a local haunted house. Sure, they can be pricey and you might have to wait on a long line to get in, but they're undeniably fun, and they're a great way to get into the spirit of things.  5 Wear All Black And Dramatic Makeup Giphy You definitely don't need to wear a costume, but if you want to try to wear something that feels appropriate for Oct. 31, then just wear all black (for some reason, that feels Halloweeny) and put on some dramatic makeup. Voila! You're ready to go out.  6 Do A Halloween Inspired Manicure Giphy Even if you don't like Halloween costumes, you might like the idea of Halloween accessories - like a cool manicure. Try something slightly spooky, or just go the orange and black route. You can do them yourself if you're skill enough, or ask to get a design done at the nail salon.  7 Have A Scary Movie Marathon Giphy Want to celebrate Halloween without going out and being surrounded by people in costume? Invite some friends over, stay in, and have a scary movie marathon. Watch some corny classics and some new scary films as well.  8 Wear A Halloween Pin Etsy Goth Ghost Brooch, $11.99, Etsy Want to wear something that feels right for Halloween? It can be as simple as a small pin. Attach it to your shirt, your jacket, or even your bag.  9 Make Halloween-Themed Drinks Half-Baked Harvest Get in the spirit of things with some Halloween spirits (hehe). You can grab a pumpkin beer and add some cinnamon sugar around the rim, or you can do something more elaborate and make creepy cocktails. This vampire drip cocktail from Half-Baked Harvest is one perfect option.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,852

fd7b2ae2-63df-4c01-91a5-038f1858cc28,"Jada Pinkett Smith broke the news that, before a recent reconciliation, she and Gabrielle Union had been feuding for nearly two decades. Two decades. That‚Äôs the length of some actors‚Äô entire careers, yet the public was none the wiser. The two actresses deserve some kind of award just for outwardly keeping the peace.  Pinkett Smith revealed the news to Extra while promoting her upcoming Facebook Watch talk show, which Union will eventually appear on. ‚ÄúI have a really touching episode with Gabrielle Union,‚Äù she told Extra. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt really been on the best of terms for 17 years, and we have a reconciliation. They were like, ‚ÄòWe wanna do a girlfriends show,‚Äô and I was like, ‚ÄòWell . . . .‚Äô Her name just kept coming up. It just couldn‚Äôt be anything else. So we brought it to the table.‚Äù  17 is a very specific number, not rounded up or down. It‚Äôs a number a person can rattle off because they‚Äôve kept the books up to date, and because something happened. That would mean that whatever went down did so in those halcyon days of 2001. This was post-Bring It On Gabrielle Union, and pre-The Matrix Reloaded Jada Pinkett Smith‚Äîaround the time of Two Can Play That Game and Ali, respectively. What could have possibly happened?  They were never on a set together as far as IMDb is concerned, though Union starred alongside Pinkett Smith‚Äôs husband, Will Smith, in Bad Boys II, in 2003. The only picture that exists on the newswires where the actresses appear in the same frame is from February 2016, at the 47th NAACP Image Awards, and they have three women‚ÄîTaraji P. Henson, Loretta Devine, and Tika Sumpter‚Äîbetween them. Was it a skirmish over the alarmingly few roles for black women in Hollywood? Or something more personal than professional? Pinkett Smith says neither of them can remember why it started. (Vanity Fair has reached out to Union for comment.)  The show airs Monday, May 7, and co-stars Pinkett Smith‚Äôs mother Adrienne Banfield-Norris and her daughter Willow Smith. I suppose we‚Äôll all just have to watch for more clues.  Update (Monday, May 7 at 10:50 a.m.): Union stopped by the Today show on Monday and told host Hoda Kotb that indeed the ‚Äúfeud‚Äù is over.  ‚ÄúJada nor I ever used the word feud, so it just became more of a media creation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúKind of like back in the day, neither one of us actually knows what originally took place back then. But the people we had around us were like ‚Äòwell you know how she feels about you‚Äô and they were like, ‚Äòwell you know how she feels about you.‚Äô And then it was like ‚Äògirl bye‚Äô for 17 years. Even though we‚Äôre both very outspoken women, both activists, our husbands are friends, I worked with her husband, we both had too much pride and too much insecurities to just say, ‚ÄòHey, did that ever actually happen or was that just a creation of someone who didn‚Äôt want to see two women rise together?‚Äô‚Äù",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,619

But in a series of vague tweets, the actress made several startling claims‚Äîincluding, it seems, that she left the show following ‚Äúmultiple physical assaults.‚Äù  Perrette, who has played fan favorite Abby Sciuto on the CBS procedural since its premiere in 2003, had so far kept silent about her specific reasons for leaving the series this spring. In a statement last year announcing her departure, the actress wrote, ‚ÄúThere have been all kinds of false stories as to why [she was leaving]. (NO I DON‚ÄôT HAVE A SKIN CARE LINE AND NO MY NETWORK AND SHOW ARE NOT MAD AT ME!) It was a decision made last year.‚Äù Over the weekend, Perrette also referenced articles she claims are false, writing, ‚ÄúI refused to go low, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never told publicly what happened. But there are tabloid articles out there that are telling total lies about me. If you believe them? Please leave me alone. You clearly don‚Äôt know me. (Sorry guys, had to be said).‚Äù  In the past, Perrette has identified herself on Twitter as a rape and domestic violence survivor. Last fall, after reports about Harvey Weinstein emerged, she shared her own story, writing that she was raped in high school by a football player: ‚ÄúMy rape led me into a series of abusive relationships, terrible self worth and self blame, dismissing a few groping incidents, allowing myself to be bullied by a powerful man for way too long.‚Äù  A day after her initial tweet regarding N.C.I.S. over the weekend, Perrette elaborated with a few more: ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm wrong for not ‚Äòspilling the beans,‚Äô‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúTelling the story, THE TRUTH. I feel I have to protect my crew, jobs and so many people. But at what cost? I don‚Äôt know. Just know, I‚Äôm trying to do the right thing, but maybe silence isn‚Äôt the right thing about crime. I‚Äôm... Just... ?‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere is a ‚Äòmachine‚Äô keeping me silent, and feeding FALSE stories about me,‚Äù Perrette continued. ‚ÄúA very rich, very powerful publicity ‚Äòmachine‚Äô. No morals, no obligation to truth, and I‚Äôm just left here, reading the lies, trying to protect my crew. Trying to remain calm. He did it.‚Äù  It‚Äôs unclear who ‚Äúhe‚Äù is. Perrette concluded with one more tweet, and has not made any additional statements on the subject: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been supporting ant[i]-bullying programs forever. But now I KNOW because it was ME! If it‚Äôs school or work, that you‚Äôre required to go to? It‚Äôs horrifying. I left. Multiple Physical Assaults. I REALLY get it now. Stay safe. Nothing is worth your safety. Tell someone.‚Äù  Representatives for Perrette did not immediately respond to V.F.‚Äôs request for comment.

d0848d29-ff5c-41f6-9285-94898d32a455,"In the fall of 2010, actress Paz de la Huerta was at her highest point professionally. Raised in SoHo and on the Lower East Side by a father descended from Spanish nobility and a mother who is a policy analyst on women‚Äôs issues in Third World countries, de la Huerta had been acting and modeling since her teens, and now seemed to be breaking through. The year before she had co-starred in Gaspar No√©‚Äôs Enter the Void, which had recently opened in the U.S. And her recurring role on HBO‚Äôs just-premiered Prohibition-period gangster drama, Boardwalk Empire, as mistress to Steve Buscemi‚Äôs Enoch ‚ÄúNucky‚Äù Thompson, had earned her critical praise.  One night that November, de la Huerta ran into Harvey Weinstein at the Top of the Standard bar at the Standard, High Line hotel in Manhattan. She had first met Weinstein while making the movie Cider House Rules when she was 14. De la Huerta had communicated with the producer over the years after their first meeting. At around age 21, she said, Weinstein sent her some science-fiction books and suggested she might be right for a role in one of his projects. When they met at the hotel in 2010 de la Huerta was 26 and Weinstein was at the height of his powers as an Oscar-winning producer. The Weinstein Company was about to enter a streak that would see it win best picture at the Academy Awards two years in a row, first for The King‚Äôs Speech in 2011 and then The Artist in 2012. Weinstein offered de la Huerta a ride home to Tribeca. In de la Huerta‚Äôs account of the night, Weinstein arrived at her apartment demanding to come inside and have a drink. ‚ÄúThings got very uncomfortable very fast,‚Äù the actress, now 33, told Vanity Fair in a phone interview on Wednesday.  ‚ÄúImmediately when we got inside the house, he started to kiss me and I kind of brushed [him] away,‚Äù de la Huerta said. ‚ÄúThen he pushed me onto the bed and his pants were down and he lifted up my skirt. I felt afraid. . . . It wasn‚Äôt consensual . . . It happened very quickly. . . . He stuck himself inside me. . . . When he was done he said he‚Äôd be calling me. I kind of just laid on the bed in shock.‚Äù  De la Huerta described a second assault that allegedly happened in late December 2010, when Weinstein showed up in her building lobby after she came home from a photo shoot. The actress said she had been drinking, and was frightened by Weinstein, who had been repeatedly calling her, despite her asking him to leave her alone. ‚ÄúHe hushed me and said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs talk about this in your apartment,‚Äô‚Äù de la Huerta said. ‚ÄúI was in no state. I was so terrified of him. . . . I did say no, and when he was on top of me I said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to do this.‚Äô He kept humping me and it was disgusting. He‚Äôs like a pig. . . . He raped me.‚Äù  Afterward, de la Huerta said, ‚ÄúI laid there feeling sick. He looked at me and said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôll put you in a play.‚Äô He left and I never heard from him again.

After her marriage with Justin Theroux ended, she has been constantly in the limelight being scrutinized for her reactions on how her ex is moving on after the split. A while ago it was Selena Gomez and now it is another actress who has been drawn into the picture. The Friends actress is fed up with hearing news of Emma Stone and Justin's budding romance.  The actress is reportedly furious seeing how things are unfolding for Emma and Justin. According to Radar Online, Jennifer is filled with 'furious rage' looking at both of them get close and taking various trips together. ‚ÄúIt bugs the hell out of Jen that Justin got close to Emma during their marriage and she isn‚Äôt taking this lying down,‚Äù a source told the website.

Saving lives! Doing the most! Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs,"" he wrote. The pair was also spotted leaving Met Gala together even though they arrived separately at the event.

ce034f9a-6b0f-419d-a931-99ddc349cac9,"Some two months after American Horror Story: Cult wrapped up last November, FX announced that season eight was a go. Here, everything we know so far about Apocalypse:  1. It began shooting in the summer. In April, showrunner Ryan Murphy said that shooting would commence in mid-June. Also in June, FX confirmed that the new season would premiere Sept. 12.  2. It is not called Radioactive, but Apocalypse. The past few seasons of AHS have stayed relatively mysterious until they premiered, and season eight is so far no different. Though internet sleuths discovered that a trademark was filed for American Horror Story: Radioactive and became convinced that the new season would be named as such, in July, FX announced that season eight is officially called Apocalypse.  3. It's set in the future, technically. While some rumors place the setting of the new season in 2032, Murphy said in April that it would be set ""18 months from today,"" so in October 2019. ""It‚Äôs still topical, but [set in] the future, which I‚Äôve never done,"" he said. ""I think people will like it. It‚Äôs different from what we‚Äôve done before."" Theorists have noted that Oct. 6, 2019 marks the 58th anniversary of a speech by JFK telling Americans to build nuclear bomb shelters, which would track with the alleged ""radioactive"" theme. Murphy has also said that it will be more fantasy-based than the show's previous two seasons. ""It‚Äôs heightened,"" he said in April. ""It‚Äôs not necessarily as real and grounded as the past season. We‚Äôre sort of getting back to Asylum, and Coven. That‚Äôs the tone of it.""    4. Kathy Bates will be back. After star turns in Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, and Roanoke, Bates had to sit out Cult due to her commitment to her Netflix show Disjointed, but Murphy has confirmed that she'll be back for season eight and that she's one of the leads. I hope she gets to yell ""LIIIIIIIES"" again.  FX  5. MVPs Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters will also be back. Paulson and Peters have lead roles, per Murphy, and Peters will be a hairstylist. Cheyenne Jackson, Adina Porter, Billy Eichner, Leslie Grossman, and Emma Roberts will be back too.  6. Dame. Joan. Collins. Murphy confirmed in April that the iconic Dynasty actress will join the cast in season eight, though of course has not given hints as to what she'll be doing besides being Evan Peters's grandmother. Does it even matter, though? She's Joan Collins.  Joan Collins in 2018. Getty Images  7. It's the Coven/Murder House crossover season. In June, Ryan tweeted that the next season of AHS would be the promised mashup of seasons one and three. Also of note: Connie Britton is no longer attached to 9-1-1, which means she could be free to return as her Murder House character Vivien Harmon (who died, but this show loves ghosts, so that doesn't really matter).    The Coven/Murder House AHS crossover season won't be happening next year...because it's happening THIS YEAR. AHS #8 WITCHES RULE THIS SEPTEMBER ‚Äî Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) June 14, 2018  On Aug. 26, Britton and Dylan McDermott confirmed their return as their Murder House husband-and-wife duo, Vivien and Ben. According to the Instagram caption from Britton's set photo, Sarah Paulson will direct at least one episode this season.  8. Remember the Harmon baby? He‚Äôs all grown up ‚Äî and he‚Äôs back. In July, Murphy announced that Cody Fern will reprise his role as Michael Langdon in Apocalypse.

I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôll tell you what: I love devil babies.  9. Jessica Lange is coming back. Lange hasn't appeared on the show since season four, Freak Show, so if you've been missing Constance Langdon, Fiona Goode, Sister Jude, or Elsa Mars, then you're in luck. During a TCA event in August, Paulson said that Lange would return as Constance.  On Sept. 19, Murphy shared the first set photo of Lange returning as Queen Constance. Bow down.  10a.

ce5aa039-9c49-464d-b3b2-c0c66f882f26,"Did you know who Kanye West was on October 23, 2002?  Maybe, if you were a hardcore rap fan, but probably not. Up to that point, Kanye West had a name mostly from his production work: the Chicago-native produced the bulk of Jay Z‚Äôs 2001 classic, The Blueprint. But he wasn‚Äôt known as a rapper: he would literally make his rapping debut a month later, appearing on Jay Z‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Bounce‚Äù (rapping as Ray Ray, for some reason).  But, in short, he was a nobody to most.  So when news came out that the rapper was in a serious car accident on October 23, 2002, many people just shrugged. No one knew that moment would probably end up being the most important moment of his career.  That night would be the inspiration for Kanye West‚Äôs first true big hit, ‚ÄúThrough the Wire.‚Äù  But, what happened that night? Throughout the years, Kanye has told the story a number of times. Essentially, after finishing a late night session with Beanie Sigel, Peedi Crack and The Black Eyed Peas, Kanye left the studio in L.A., at around 3AM, in his rented Lexus. While in the car, he was cut off and he ran head-on into traffic, colliding with another car just blocks away from the W Hotel.  The accident was devastating; he had to have reconstructive surgery for his face. Kanye was laid up in the hospital for weeks. He had no health insurance, paying for everything out of pocket.  Years later, while pushing Late Registration, Kanye talked about the incident in an interview with USA Today, saying:  ‚ÄúWhen I had my accident, I was working on Beanie Sigel, Black Eyed Peas and Peedi Crack, and let‚Äôs just say that those tracks were not my best work. If I would have passed that night, that would have been the end of my legacy. Now when I go into the studio, I act like this could possibly be my last day.‚Äù  However, there are parts that Kanye seemed to have left out. Last year, DJ Whoo Kid, who apparently was in the studio before Kanye left, talked about what happened that night.  According to the DJ, Ludacris was also in the studio. Kanye, trying to impress everyone, started spitting verses that Ludacris wasn‚Äôt trying to hear:  ‚ÄúSo Kanye‚Äôs looking crazy, you know, trying to impress Luda, but it wasn‚Äôt that time. Luda wanted to come in, do that verse and get the f‚Äìk out. So, what made it worse is he went out there and played a beat but by the time he got out there, Luda picked a Red Spyda beat. So now I gotta tell Kanye ‚ÄòYour services are not needed.‚Äô‚Äù  According to Whoo Kid, Kanye would leave the session furious.  Weeks after the accident, Kanye West would go back to the studio, loop up Chaka Khan‚Äôs ‚ÄúThrough the Fire‚Äù and create ‚ÄúThrough the Wire,‚Äù a song he rapped with a broken jaw.  The song wouldn‚Äôt reach the world until early 2003, when the track was on his debut mixtape, Get Well Soon. The tape was mostly a mixture of tracks that Kanye West produced. But there were also a couple of Kanye West songs, including unreleased classics like ‚ÄúHome‚Äù and ‚ÄúMy Way.‚Äù (There were also a couple of tracks that would appear on College Dropout, like ‚ÄúJesus Walks‚Äù and ‚ÄúTwo Words‚Äù).  After the song floated on the mixtape scene for a while, Kanye West, who wasn‚Äôt getting much label support from Roc-A-Fella at the time, took $30 grand, hooked up with Coodie and Chike and shot a cozy video.  The video premiered in November 2003 and the rest is kinda history. The song was the first single off of Kanye West‚Äôs classic debut College Dropout, which released on February 10, 2004.

In an extraordinary interview which recalls a doleful rant by his wife Jennifer Aniston earlier this year, the 37-year- old actor says he feels oppressed by fame and has come close to a nervous breakdown.  The star of Fight Club and Seven tells the magazine Vanity Fair he is bored with movies and acting and looks forward to retiring from Hollywood in five to seven years.  Pitt says he spent 18 months in therapy after hitting a psychological barrier. 'I crashed and burned so I wanted to understand how I operate.

In a reference to the singer who spent several weeks in hospital after a breakdown this summer, he adds: 'I've thought about pulling a Mariah Carey but I know too much now.'  Interviewed by Vanity Fair in April, Friends star Miss Aniston said the year in which she married Pitt had been the hardest year of her life and she was dogged by 'low self esteem' and a 'sense of shame'.

But wait ‚Äî if that‚Äôs the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre appearing pretty cuddly.

22120407-3985-495b-a411-2284265d75fe,"Craig Conover is still getting used to calling himself a lawyer after being officially sworn in to the South Carolina Bar on Thursday. ""It's pretty surreal is the best way I can describe it,"" Craig told The Daily Dish during an interview over the phone on Thursday. ""It's something that I've wanted for a long time now, and there's been a lot of speed bumps.""  After experiencing some challenges in finishing up his law school degree and lots of drama with the Southern Charm crew along the way, Craig finally passed the bar exam last April. Now that Craig can officially practice law and help people with their legal problems, he said he feels like his ""wings have been unclipped."" ""I just feel like I've been held back by not having the ability to practice, and now I'm pretty happy,"" he shared. ""Like, it was cool to pass the bar, but I wasn't an attorney yet. And now, we finally got over that last hurdle, and like I said, it's very surreal that I'm actually an attorney now.""  Craig had initially been approved earlier this month to be sworn in at the next official ceremony at the Supreme Court of South Carolina in Columbia in May. However, the clerk approved him to attend a special swearing in ceremony on Thursday, so he was glad he didn't have to wait three more months to be sworn in after going through such a long road already. ""What was crazy when I got there, and I had no idea, my best friend from law school, we sat next to each other every day first year and then he transferred to Wake [Forest], he was also swearing in today, and we had no idea,"" Craig said. ""So we started together and then finished together. That's who's in the pictures with me, so that's cool.""  The Southern Charm gent was also thrilled to have his parents there to witness his big day. ""They've been with me the entire time and my biggest supporters and the ones that actually knew it was gonna happen, like me; we just didn't know when. It's just really nice that my mom can go to sleep at night without having to think about this anymore. And it's not in the back of my mind, too,"" Craig said. ""And so having it with me, it's kind of like a mirror image of myself the whole time because all the stress that I had and all of the things that I had to do, I'm sure as a parent, they kind of felt like they were doing them, too. And so it was really cool to have them there and we kind of just got to close it out together because it really has been a long process. And I know that they loved it and they're happy. Having them there for the final stuff was kind of the perfect way to close this chapter.""  Craig said some of his fellow Charmers have already sent him their congratulations, including Shep Rose, Austen Kroll, and Cameran Eubanks, with whom he FaceTimed after the swearing in ceremony. ""She's very supportive,"" Craig said. ""She's rooting for me, and she's glad I'm happy. She knew how much I wanted it. So she was over the moon.""  Craig said he's planning on celebrating with some of the Charmers, as well as other close friends and his parents with a cookout in his backyard. ""This will be a really neat way for us to all celebrate and for my parents to see everyone,"" he said. ""For some reason, the bar was more of a party celebration, but this is more, I don't know, you just want to sit back and take it all in, have a few drinks with your closest friends.""  Though Craig encountered some challenges on his way to becoming a lawyer, he now considers them a blessing in disguise. ""During that time, I was really able to reflect on things that I needed to improve on. And back then, I probably wasn't responsible yet or accountable enough to handle,"" he said. ""I really pushed myself and did everything that I could do so that if this day did come, I'd be ready.""  Craig said he now hopes to work at a legal clinic in Charleston as his first post as a lawyer. ""I think it'll be perfect for me to get my feet wet again. So basically, I'll probably do 20, 30 hours, hopefully, at the legal clinic. And that's kind of right up my alley, anyway. That's why I always wanted to get into law is to help people,"" he shared. ""That's when I'm happiest, when I'm helping people who need it.""  Ultimately, Craig said he would like to help other lawyers or firms take on cases as what he described as something of a ""a lawyer for hire."" ""You can go be Superman for someone that needs it,"" he said. ""It's not a particular section of law other than it's kind of got to be a specialty firm where I can come in and close stuff off for people that can't do it themselves.""  The ability to see his law career take shape is what's really exciting for Craig. ""It's neat to actually be able to think about that question and answer that question because this has been such a long process, there was nothing good even thinking about what I would do when I swore in because there just were so many times I got my hopes up and then something would happen,"" Craig said. ""And so now, it's really cool that I can even start thinking about and plan out the next step.""  We'll catch up more with Craig when Season 5 of Southern Charm premieres Thursday, April 5 at 9/8c. Check out the full trailer above and then come back down here to see what else Craig has been up to these days.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1188

Not only is it always glowing and radiant, but her pores are virtually non-existent, she has an even skin tone and she doesn‚Äôt seem to have had a pimple in years.  So, it is understandable that when the model and founder of skin care brand KORA Organics shared her top skin care tips with Teen Vogue, including the product she uses to clear her blemishes overnight, we were all ears.  According to the model, facial oils are her go-to when confronted with a surprise pimple. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm having a breakout, I like to balance the pH of my skin with my Noni Glow Oil. I find that really helps, even with treating it overnight. I put it on after cleansing, misting, exfoliating and moisturising,‚Äù she said.  While we‚Äôre not debating the effectiveness the oil has on Miranda‚Äôs skin, we wanted to check in with a skin care expert to find out if facial oils can work as an effective pimple treatment for the rest of us. And if the advice from Bryan Barron Director of Research and Content at Paula‚Äôs Choice, is anything to go by, it isn‚Äôt good news.  In fact, Barron says, ‚ÄúWhile some people report success using oils to banish breakouts, mounds of research has shown that gently removing excess oil and controlling acne-causing bacteria with benzoyl peroxide, and using a leave-on exfoliant with salicylic acid is a proven, reliable approach for acne at any age.‚Äù  Ultimately, while facial oils are a vital addition in any skin care routine as they work wonders to nourish, plump and hydrate the skin, using them as a pimple treatment may not deliver the same results as the proven acne treatment duo of benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid.

9d48c74e-4804-4868-b1cc-53f15efe945a,"Shonda Rhimes' Scandal will come to an end next year, according to a report from TVLine. The series, which is part of ABC's popular T.G.I.T Thursday night lineup, has been a hit for the network and has helped secure Rhimes' dominance and make a big name out of star Kerry Washington, who plays Washington D.C.'s ""fixer"" Olivia Pope.  This should not come as a huge surprise to big Shondaland fans, as Rhimes herself said that the show would have a shorter shelf life than her original hit, Grey's Anatomy, which is now in its 13th season. ""I feel like there is a finite amount of Scandal to be told,"" she told NPR in 2013. ""So I know what the end of Scandal will be, and I feel really good about that. And I can see where the end point is.""  Thus the show's conclusion was the decision of Rhimes, not the network. Among the advertiser-coveted 18 to 49 demographic, the show was among the 20 highest-rated shows of 2016. The current season averages 5.699 million viewers and 1.46 viewers in the 18-49 demo. While this marks a drop from the fifth season's average of 7.18 million viewers, the current live number is impressive considering the steady decline of live-viewership. Scandal remains one of ABC's most popular series and a large reason why the network routinely beats the other broadcasters on Thursday nights.  These ratings, of course, have allowed the network to pull in a hefty amount in ad revenue. At its peak, Scandal was part of a Thursday night block that brought ABC over half a billion dollars. In 2016, Scandal brought in $75 million for ABC--more than How to Get Away with Murder or The Catch, according to iSpot.tv.  ""What Shonda Rhimes possesses is this extraordinary instinct and compass for what our audience needs,"" then-president of ABC Entertainment group Paul Lee told FORBES in 2013. ""That Shonda is free and has a huge amount of power to pursue her vision is precisely how the magic happens.""  The network isn't the only beneficiary of Scandal's popularity. The show's stars have risen to prominence--and their wallets have grown--with the series. Washington routinely lands high on Forbes' list of highest-paid TV actresses. Last year, she pulled in $12 million, with about half of that coming from her salary from the show. Being on the show has made her well-known enough to land lucrative endorsement deals with the likes of Neutrogena and a commercial with Apple Music.  As a black lead on a broadcast series, Washington's star turn has also brought much-needed diversity to prime time. After the success of Scandal, Rhimes brought another African American woman--Viola Davis, the first black woman to ever win the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama--to the limelight on How to Get Away with Murder. On broadcast TV, only 22.6% of series regulars are of underrepresented racial minorities according to the 2016 Annenberg report on diversity. In dramas, like Scandal, this percentage drops. Unfortunately, that means two dramas with black leads is a big deal for the industry.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always room for our film and television, for our art, to be more representative of who we are as a culture. I think for me especially, being a person of color and a woman, you really see that intersection,"" she told WWD.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,656

'They‚Äôve called off their legal attack dogs and are working through the logistics of withdrawing their divorce petitions‚Ä¶ They don‚Äôt want to throw away the 11 years they spent together,' a source spilled to the magazine.    The pair have been spending more time together ever since Ange, 42, and the kids moved into a mansion just down the road from Brad, 54, making it easier for the Fight Club star to spend more time with their children Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11 and twins Knox and Vivienne, nine.  Pitt and Jolie share six children Getty  'Things are so much better among the entire family now,' continues the insider, confessing that Brad is now fully committed to being sober.    'He‚Äôs sober and attending weekly therapy sessions. Even with all the drama, he‚Äôs come out a better person, and he‚Äôs grateful to Angie for kicking him in the pants when he needed it most.'    In fact, the shock split may have been Angie‚Äôs plan to get Brad to shape up.    Court documents obtained by the publication show the actress is still signing papers using her married name and that the pair have asked the court to extend the 'temporary judge' in their case so it remains private.    'Brad and Ange clearly don‚Äôt want the divorce to be finalised,' pills the source.    'When they‚Äôre ready, they plan to request that the court withdraw the divorce petition once and for all.'    In fact, there‚Äôs even a secret plan for a vow renewal ceremony once the petitions have been withdrawn!    'It‚Äôll be a spiritual reconnection. Brad wants Maddox to be his best man, as a way to put what happened on that plane to rest once and for all.    'Shiloh and Knox will be in charge of food and music selection.

It is hard to imagine a My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ‚Äî one of the greatest rap albums of all time ‚Äî without an ‚ÄúImma let you finish‚Äù at the 2009 VMAs.  His new album, ye, doesn‚Äôt merit any similar mercy.  On first listen, it doesn‚Äôt sound like any part of ye was recorded pre-MAGA hat picture, which blows a Kanye-head sized hole through the argument that the previous month‚Äôs behavior was a publicity stunt to promote the album. If anything, the album seems like an meek afterthought to the Twitter tirade and dive into right-wing politics. Most of it deals with the repercussions of the storm which came before it, and for the first time in his career, the artist‚Äôs personality is overwhelming the art.  The opening track ‚ÄòI Thought About Killing You‚Äô, if played in a vacuum, sounds like the work of a troubled mind. If a poem like this came from a loved one, it would surely merit discussion about a trip to the therapist. Kanye goes on to deliver cringe-worthy rhymes on issues ranging from Russell Simmons rape allegations to his petrification on realizing that his daughter might one day look like his wife. He teases a few tidbits of The Old Kanye, chopping up beats from Slick Rick and The Edwin Hawkins Singers samples on ‚ÄòNo Mistakes‚Äô, to keep his fans just interested enough. It‚Äôs telling that the one standout track, ‚ÄòGhost Town‚Äô is the track on which Kanye lurks in the background, devoting more time on production than on spoken word, and letting John Legend and Kid Cudi take over.  If one were to ignore everything that came before ye, it would still feel like Kanye didn‚Äôt even try this time. The usual meticulousness and perfectionism has apparently been supplanted by a Kanye shrug. The music is haphazard and hollow, mirroring the guy making it. Maybe he‚Äôs become blas√© and doesn‚Äôt want to spend time on music anymore.

Just kidding; they're off to a royal evening reception at Frogmore House, a location that's undoubtedly less awesome than its name, where they'll celebrate with family, friends, and fellow royals. For this, Markle changed into a reception dress that's just as divine as her ceremony gown.  The freshly married couple exited Windsor Castle, each having switched to a brand-new look. Both Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and Meghan Markle, now the Duchess of Sussex, looked less formal than in the chapel earlier, but still just as classic and sophisticated.

The [UK Telegraph] claims the Suits star was an item with the successful celebrity chef for two years and they were together when Meghan hit it off with Harry in July, 2016.

Just before they broke up, Cory praised his significant other for working with World Vision. ""So proud of my lady @meghanmarkle being named Global Ambassador for @worldvision #worldwaterday,"" he penned.  Cory and Meghan lived together in Toronto and were said to be together when Meghan first met Harry.  But was it always just going to be a flash in the pan?

Sources close to the couple claim Meghan's role on Suits, which is filmed in Toronto, played a part in their demise. ""It put a strain on the relationship. Trevor was in LA making movies, Meghan was in another country five hours' flight away and it simply took its toll,"" a friend told The Daily Mail. Most recently, Trevor was apparently set to cash in on his marriage to a could-be-potential princess with the explosive news he's working on a TV show with a very familiar plot line. According to Deadline, the show, which is not yet titled, will be based on an American divorced mother who moves to London to marry a British Prince. It will reportedly explore the difficulties of sharing custody with the royal family when your ex-wife is married to a Prince. Although the exes don't share any kids, the controversial concept was dreamt up after Trevor was chatting to his fellow producer Dan Farah, speculating what it would have been like if they did have to share custody of children.

At the royal wedding of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Kate and William took special interest in each other, going so far as to lean over poor Camilla to converse:    Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Prince William, Camila, and Kate Middleton in the pews of St George‚Äôs Chapel at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs May 19, 2018 wedding. Getty Images  Although body language typically reflects a couple's emotional connection, you can't fully interpret it without context ‚Äî particularly when observing how a royal couple behaves in public, according to body language expert Blanca Cobb based in North Carolina. ""They may be more reserved [than other couples] in their public displays of affection, but that doesn‚Äôt meant they love each other any less or aren‚Äôt excited about each other,"" Cobb says.  To better understand what *really* goes on behind palace doors, Cobb analyzed a handful of the couple's closest public encounters:  1. When Kate Leans Over Camilla  Getty Images  In the midst of a royal wedding, there's no such thing as a private moment ‚Äî but boy do William and Kate try! Above, they attempt to converse, leaning forward to make eye contact without overstepping into Camilla's personal space, Cobb observes. ""William and Kate prefer to be together and share moments privately,"" she says. So much for seating charts!  2. When Kate Tapped William's Knee  Kate taps William‚Äôs knee during a filmed interview. (December 2017)  Despite the recent hoopla surrounding this exchange, it isn't *really* about affection or romance, according to Cobb, who sees tapping as a way to signal, ""Hey, we can both relate,"" in lighthearted situations. That said, touching doesn't necessarily happen between any two people: ""There's a level of familiarity, comfort, and likability in touch. Through touch you connect with your partner. You let them know that they‚Äôre important to you,"" Cobb says. ""Gentle touches, playful moments, and sincere smiles show that they enjoy each other‚Äôs company and have fun together.""  3. When They Walked Arm-in-Arm  The couple walks together after a rowing race in Germany. (July 2017) Samir Hussein/ Getty Images  Cobb says couples who synchronize their movements are emotionally in sync, and in the photo above, Kate and William both lead with their left legs. ""This shows they are in tune with each other,"" Cobb says. Because Kate walks slightly ahead of William in this photo, it's a sign that she may be a dominant force in their relationship, according to Cobb.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  4. When They Stood in the Stands  The couple holds horns while watching the London Marathon. (April 2017) Samir Hussein / Getty Images  ""Body mirroring is another sign you‚Äôre really digging your partner,"" Cobb says, pointing out the way Kate and William both lean toward their left, and they both rest their left forearms on the railing.  5. When William Wrapped His Arms Around Kate  William embraces Kate during London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  ""You can get a temperature reading of how hot a couple is for one another by their physical proximity and the level of touch,"" Cobb says. Although this doesn't appear to be an intimate moment, since Kate and William aren't locking eyes, ""they‚Äôre seizing the moment with physical closeness that brings them closer emotionally,"" Cobb says.  6. When Kate Draped Her Arms Around William  The couple embraces during the London 2012 Olympic Games. (August 2012) Pascal Le Segretain / Getty Images  Cobb isn't concerned that the couples' eyes don't meet during this embrace, since they're watching a sports game. ""Her hands are relaxed on his shoulders, they're standing body-to-body with no air between them, and while his hands fall away from her a little, his fingers look relaxed with no tightness,"" Cobb says. ""They are very relaxed and comfortable expressing themselves the best way they can, as royals.""  Cobb thinks nothing of the way Kate is tilting her hips away from William in the photo above, in part because it's difficult to determine how much room Kate had to shift around in the stands. And because Kate and William tend to act demure around each other, facing each other, hip-to-hip, would seem out of character for them, anyway.  7. When Kate Air Kisses William  Kate kisses William on both cheeks after his polo team wins a competition (July 2011). Samir Hussein / Getty Images  Kate and William rarely kiss in public, and this cheek kiss would be a rare exception ‚Äî except that Kate doesn't actually touch her lips to William's face. ""You can't say she doesn't feel emotion for her husband,"" Cobb says. ""There's still no tension here. Kate is reaching out to him, has a relaxed bend in her arm, with her fingers relaxed on shoulder.""  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  William, on the other hand, looks less comfortable receiving affection in this context. ""He's body blocking by holding the gift between them,"" Cobb says, although this doesn't mean these partners don't show fondness toward each other. ""It could be that this is the extent of affection they're willing to demonstrate in public.""  8. When They Were Young  The couple poses for photo on the day of their university graduation. (June 2005) Middleton Family/Clarence House via GettyImages  ""Putting your hand on someone's stomach is more intimate than placing it on the shoulder or back,"" Cobb says. ""Although it's unclear whether William is trying to hold Kate's hand there or move it away, there's no curvature to his fingers, which means there no tension. He's most likely holding Kate's hand in place ‚Äî a sign of mutual comfort.""  9. When Kate and William Lean In  The couple sits side by side during a graduation ceremony. (October 2018) ARTHUR EDWARDS/AFP/Getty Images  ""Legs can be used as a psychological barrier expressing interest, disinterest, or discomfort,"" Cobb says of decoding lower-body language. ""William crossing his right leg toward Kate allows her into his space, so he's emotionally drawing her in.""  Kate leaning toward William suggests she's equally into him. ""We move toward things we like and are attracted to,"" Cobb says.  10. When William Touched Kate's Lower Back  The couple attends media event. (December 2017) Karwai Tang/ Getty Images  ""Couples who love each other want to touch each other, since it can convey your love without you having to say a word,"" Cobb says of William placing his hand on Kate's lower back. ""The back placement is a nice, intimate compromise, since if he goes any lower, he goes near the tush, and the shoulder seems too formal.""  11. When The Newly Marrieds Kissed On The Buckingham Palace Balcony  The couple kisses on their wedding day. (April 2011)  Cobb says the couple's wedding kiss is the least intimate interaction of them all. ""It was their wedding day! They should have been touching and embracing heart-to-heart,"" she says. Instead, they stand apart, without even holding hands, and reach only their lips toward each other to meet.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  During the kiss, Kate and William open their eyes at different moments before Kate ultimately pulls away. ""It signals a disconnect, since people who are really into each other automatically close their eyes to feel the moment, the breath of the other person, and the sensation of lips touching,"" Cobb says. ""It looks like they're going through the motions. I also get the sense she‚Äôs a little shy, embarrassed, or unsure, since she giggles right afterward, and raises her shoulders ‚Äî it's a nervous moment for her."" But hey, not everyone gets married in front of thousands of people!  The Bottom Line:  ""This isn't a typical couple, they're people of royalty with rules to follow on public decorum,"" Cobb says.

b4a85bf9-a02b-4cc8-974b-ad845bf62ac3,"Even though the tabloids might have you believe otherwise, Jennifer Aniston has gone on to do incredible things in the decade or so since she divorced Brad Pitt. She‚Äôs done a commendable share of philanthropic work (although she doesn‚Äôt advertise it) for St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, among other causes. She‚Äôs reached impressive new heights as a dramatic actress, with a performance in last year‚Äôs Cake so heartbreaking that many believed it deserved Oscar recognition. And she wrote a powerful essay this summer, trying to redirect the endless tabloid attention on her to more important issues in the world.  Nevertheless, when Pitt confirmed that he and Angelina Jolie were divorcing earlier this month, Aniston found herself swept back up into the magazine headline melee. Despite the suddenly aggressive tabloid and paparazzi attention since news of a celebrity breakup that has nothing to do with her, it seems as though Aniston has gone about her business as usual‚Äîjoining husband Justin Theroux in New York this week for the premiere of his latest film, The Girl on the Train. And while there, Theroux was tossed a question about the Brangelina breakup and Aniston‚Äôs new involvement in the headlines. Rather than refuse to answer the question, as is certainly his red-carpet right, the Leftovers actor took the decidedly classy route in responding.  ‚ÄúAs a child of divorce all I can say is that‚Äôs terrible news for those children and that's all you can really say,‚Äù Theroux told the Business Insider, referring to Pitt and Jolie‚Äôs six children. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs boring to sort of comment on anything else. People are having a bad time, that's horrible.‚Äù  Theroux also commented on the fact that Aniston has been dragged back into Pitt-Jolie headlines of late, calling the new tabloid narratives ‚Äúnonsense.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an endless appetite for trash, apparently, though everyone would say that they don‚Äôt have that appetite,‚Äù Theroux continued. ‚ÄúBut I think a lot of people do because people buy it. But there are bigger things to bitch about. It‚Äôs shocking how much bandwidth things can take up when there are far more important things going on in the world.‚Äù  This past summer, Aniston herself became so fed up with a different variation of the nonsense tabloid headlines‚Äîat that time, related to whether or not she was pregnant‚Äîthat she took it upon herself to write an essay on Huffington Post.  ‚ÄúLet me start by saying that addressing gossip is something I have never done,‚Äù Aniston wrote. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to give energy to the business of lies, but I wanted to participate in a larger conversation that has already begun and needs to continue . . . For the record, I am not pregnant. What I am is fed up.

e1800cee-e0f7-46d5-9e45-2886907591f6,"The actress alleges she was nixed for a role in 'Lord of the Rings' after she rebuffed Weinstein.  A California federal judge on Wednesday has decided that Ashley Judd can move forward in her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein. However, she will only be able to proceed on defamation and tortious interference claims. A sexual harassment claim has been rejected in the first iteration of the lawsuit.  The actress alleges in her complaint that she became Weinstein's victim when the movie mogul made demands on her in a hotel room about 20 years ago. Judd says that she only escaped after relenting to a deal where she would let him touch her if she won an Academy Award. Later, Judd says she was in serious discussions for a big role in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but that opportunity was torpedoed after Weinstein or someone at Miramax told the director that she was a ""nightmare"" to work with.  In a ruling on Wednesday, one day after hearing oral arguments on Weinstein's motion to dismiss, U.S. District Court Judge Philip Gutierrez examined whether Judd had brought a timely lawsuit or whether her claims were barred by statute of limitations.  The actress said she only learned that she was nixed for a role in Lord of the Rings after Jackson recounted what happened in a December 2017 interview. Although Weinstein argued she had a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation, she responded that it was unlikely that a powerful producer and film distributor would reveal something in confidence and disrupt the relationship.  The judge writes that Judd need only raise a plausible inference at this stage that she would have been unable to learn of Weinstein's statements about her to Jackson.  ""At this point, no evidence has been presented about whether it is common in the industry for actors to inquire into why they were not cast, and further, no evidence has been presented as to whether Jackson and Walsh would have informed Plaintiff about Defendant‚Äôs statements had she asked them why she was not given a role in the Lord of the Rings films,"" states the order (read here). ""Taking Plaintiff‚Äôs allegations as true ‚Äî as the Court must at this stage ‚Äî the Court concludes that she has raised a plausible inference that she would not have been able to learn about Defendant‚Äôs statements during the limitations period, even if she had conducted a diligent investigation.""  The judge also rules that Judd had adequately pled a defamation claim. Weinstein attempted to argue that if he stated that he had ""bad experiences"" with Judd, this amounted to a non-actionable opinion.  Judd ""argues that she can prove these statements false because Defendant had no previous professional interaction with her and her short two-day experience working on the Miramax film Smoke (where she alleges that she did not interact with Defendant) was uniformly positive,"" writes the judge. ""The Court agrees with Plaintiff.""  As for Judd's sexual harassment claim, the judge writes that he is skeptical that the statute being invoked (California Civil Code Section 51.9) ""can ever properly be applied to a relationship between a potential employer and a prospective employee.""  However, Gutierrez doesn't make a firm determination on whether a claim of this nature would ever fly. Instead, he looks at Judd's description of her single meeting with Weinstein to ostensibly discuss potential roles in films and finds this doesn't fit the type of relationship of someone providing professional services on an ongoing basis ‚Äî something that would actually be susceptible to sexual harassment in the workplace.  ""[Judd] argues that the statute was intended to cover harassment in 'power relationships,' but the statute does not use that term,"" writes the judge, later adding, ""A prospective employee usually either gets the job after an interview or series of interviews (and then becomes covered under sexual harassment laws applicable to employment relationships), or does not get the job, in which case the relationship ends. The temporary nature of a prospective employment relationship is qualitatively different than the often-more-permanent relationships common with the categories of individuals explicitly listed in the statute.""  Judd tried to position Weinstein's behavior as similar to sexual harassment perpetrated by attorneys, physicians, and teachers ‚Äî occupations referenced in the code as examples ‚Äî but the judge says that she hasn't alleged the same kind of professional responsibilities on Weinstein's part.  Gutierrez does note that the law isn't settled on this point. If this issue eventually gets to an appeal, it could become an important and closely watched one in the #MeToo era.  Judd will have an opportunity to file an amended complaint to try again with her sexual harassment claim.  Update:  Theodore Boutrous Jr., attorney for Judd, commented: ""We are very pleased that today the District Court held that Ashley Judd can proceed with her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and continue her effort to vindicate the wrongs he committed against her among so many other women. We are also pleased that the court gave us an opportunity to amend our complaint and present additional facts related to one of Ms. Judd's claims. We will move forward immediately with discovery, including Mr. Weinstein's deposition, and look forward to proving to a jury at trial that Mr. Weinstein defamed Ms. Judd, interfered with her ability to earn a living, and engaged in unlawful business practices. The law should not tolerate this abuse of power to damage another's career.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1022

Brothers, James Stanford Poore, 32, and Cedric Dwayne Poore, 39, were arrested and booked on four complaints each of first degree murder, Chief Chuck Jordan said.  On Monday, January 7, 2013, twin sisters Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Powell-Melchor, 23; Misty Nunley, 33, and Julie Jackson, 55 were found shot in the head, with their hands tied behind their backs inside a south Tulsa apartment, police say. A 3-year-old boy was also found inside the apartment, unharmed.  Chief Jordan said the murders were not gang-related. According to arrest reports, witnesses told investigators that the brothers left an apartment in the same building at Fairmont Terrace Apartments, near 61st and Peoria, saying they were going to pull a ""lick"" at the victims' apartment.  Witnesses told police the brothers returned about 20 minutes later with a bag full of drugs, cash, and jewelry. According to the report, James Poore told the witnesses that he shot one of the victims because she could identify him and that Cedric shot the other three. The witnesses told investigators the brothers split the money and that Cedric Poore took the jewelry to pawn.    When he was interviewed Wednesday, James Poore confirmed to investigators that he knew one of the victims and that he was in the apartment where the witnesses placed him. Before invoking his right to remain silent, he told investigators he knew one of the victims had used and sold illegal drugs and that Cedric drove a black van to the apartment the day of the murders.    The arrest report shows Cedric Poore denied being in the apartment the day of the murders and refused to speak to investigators any more.  Chief Jordan said the brothers both stayed at Fairmont Terrace Apartments. The property manager there told News On 6 that neither of them are on a lease.  Cedric Poore has been in Tulsa County jail on a traffic violation since January 14, and James Poore was arrested Wednesday morning. Department of Corrections records show both James and Cedric have been previously convicted and incarcerated for robbery with a firearm.  Chief Jordan said more arrests may still be made.  Mayor Dewey Bartlett released a statement Wednesday afternoon, in response to the news of the arrests:    ""The Tulsa Police Department is known for their quick efforts of finding perpetrators and they indeed lived up to their stellar reputation for this case. I have the utmost confidence in Chief Chuck Jordan and the Tulsa Police Department and I knew they would bring in those involved with this hideous quadruple murder in very short order. Although a direct tip from the public cannot be identified as the catalyst that led to the arrests, tips are always important, which is part of great police work from our force.""",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,537
30428923-b504-41ae-baed-d020a777b09e,"If you're at all familiar with the supermodel-heavy, glitter-coated televised spectacular that is the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show , you've heard of the Fantasy Bra: a one-of-a-kind undergarment handmade in collaboration with a jeweler to the exact measurements of one of the Angels that closes out the program (and is valued at a few million dollars). This year the honor of walking the sparkly runway in the very expensive bejeweled creation will go to Lais Ribeiro , the 27-year-old Brazilian model who got her Angel wings in 2015, but has been in the Victoria's Secret family since 2010. And though they're usually made aware of the appointment months before the show, Ribeiro admits that Victoria's Secret cut it a little close this year: She didn't find out until her fitting, which took place in August. (The show tapes in Shanghai on November 21.) So how did the lingerie giant pull off the surprise?  ""[Victoria's Secret] sent the new collection to me‚ÄîI tried [the bra], and I had to take pictures and polaroids,"" Ribeiro explains to Glamour. ""They said, ‚ÄòOh no, it‚Äôs just for a segment on the show.‚Äô I was like, 'Sure!'"" Imagine her surprise when she's trying on looks for the show, and someone wheels in the Fantasy Bra for her to see. Luckily, we don't have to get too creative with the details, because Victoria's Secret got it all on tape.  ""It was a mix of emotions inside of me,"" the model says of what was going through her head when she realized what was going on. ""I was so happy, thankful, honored to be chosen. Hard work pays off‚Äîthat‚Äôs all I thought about. Like, wow, I‚Äôve been working with the brand for seven years, but we never know."" As soon as she wrapped filming for the televised program (you already have a calendar alert set up for the 28th, when it airs on CBS, right?), Ribeiro got into the car to share the news with her family back in Brazil. Over FaceTime, she says, ""I put everybody in the room and I was like, ‚ÄòI have something to tell you guys‚Äô‚Äîthey thought I was pregnant, but I was like, ‚ÄòNo‚Ä¶‚Äô and then they started to scream and cry. My sister dropped the phone.‚Äù  Though she notes that her family was number one on the list of people she wanted to share the news with, she was just as psyched to show her fellow Angels. Adriana Lima was a particularly emotional one, because she's acted as a sort of role model for Ribeiro within Victoria's Secret. ""I remember that I was just crying so much [at the fitting], and we [went] back to the room to change, and Adriana was [there]‚Äîshe said, ‚ÄòHey,‚Äô and saw [the Fantasy Bra] and was like, ‚ÄòOh my gosh, so well-deserved.‚Äô"" For people who look up to the Angels, ""Adriana Lima is, like, the strongest because she‚Äôs a mother, she‚Äôs a sexy girl, she has such a strong personality‚Äîbut at the same time, she‚Äôs so open to teach us and welcome us to where she‚Äôs been living for so long,"" Ribeiro says. ""That‚Äôs what‚Äôs amazing about her.""  Pinterest PHOTO: Gary Gershoff  Ribeiro has said how, growing up Brazil, she didn't know much about the modeling world or Victoria's Secret‚Äîhowever, she vividly remembers the first time she learned about the Fantasy Bra: when fellow Brazilian Gisele B√ºndchen wore the $12.5 million ""Sexy Splendor Fantasy Bra"" in 2005. ""She‚Äôs just killing it; it‚Äôs so amazing,"" she recalls. ""And she‚Äôs from Brazil. I was just like, 'It‚Äôs so amazing to be from a country where we have so many top models and we are proud of what we do.' When you‚Äôre from the same country, you‚Äôre cheering for [each other]. That was my first and favorite‚Äîuntil now.‚Äù  When she hits the catwalk in Shanghai, all Ribeiro hopes for is that the image of her in the ""Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra"" feels true to her. ‚ÄúI hope I can show my personality‚Ä¶. I try to be calm and do me,"" she says. That's not as easy as it sounds when you're on that mega-runway in your lingerie, with heavy wings flapping behind you, Ribeiro assures: ""You‚Äôre walking and you feel like you‚Äôre bouncing""‚Äîbut at the same time you're trying to have that not read on your face because you know you have cameras pointed at you from every angle. Looking for familiar faces in the audience doesn't help calm her nerves, either. ""When I [see] them, I just want to cry. It‚Äôs kind of like, ‚ÄòOK, they‚Äôre there, they‚Äôre proud of me, but I can‚Äôt control my emotions,‚Äô because I‚Äôm very emotional,"" she admits. When the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show went to London, she actually couldn't keep it together: ""I saw my sister, and I just started to cry and everyone was like, ‚ÄòWhat is happening?‚Äô And I was like, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know!‚Äô""  Loading View on Instagram  The ""Champagne Nights Fantasy Bra"" will have its moment to shine on the 2017 Victoria's Secret runway later this month, but Ribeiro has gotten a few chances to try the style on for size since she got the news. So the million-dollar‚Äîor rather, two-million-dollar question is: What does the Fantasy Bra feel like? According to Ribeiro, ""It feels amazing, I have to say‚Äîit feels very powerful. I was just feeling myself when I was wearing it.""  Related Stories:  And the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Fantasy Bra Goes To‚Ä¶  The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Finally Cast Its Models!

(It‚Äôs still not too late to book your ticket now to London‚Äîyeah, you won‚Äôt be able to attend the wedding itself, but you can still sort of camp out nearby and listen for sounds.)  There are no doubt scores of spreadsheets and multiple binders dedicated to making sure everything goes smoothly for Kate‚Äôs sister‚Äôs nuptials, and most of the plans remain under wraps.

But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.  The outlet claims that Pippa has completed a ‚Äústrict bridal body boot camp,‚Äù a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn‚Äôt sound too different from a (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include ‚Äúa personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes‚Äù and ‚Äúthe club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.‚Äù  Oh, wait, there‚Äôs also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: ‚ÄúThe club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.‚Äù E! notes, of course, that it is ‚Äúunclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.‚Äù  Their source claims that Pippa has ‚Äúmet with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.‚Äù Per the source: ‚ÄúShe feels amazing.

""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn‚Äôt need him.‚Äù  The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday.

900ba07f-4bbb-4bc0-8391-f11e14c4f815,"A jury ruled against Bill Cosby in his sexual assault retrial on Thursday, finding him guilty for aggravated indecent assault in all three counts brought against him by Andrea Constand. The entertainer now faces the possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison.  While Cosby showed no visible reaction to the verdict, he did react loudly when District Attorney Kevin Steele called for the entertainer‚Äôs bail to be revoked, saying that Cosby had his own plane and could flee.  ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt have his own plane, you a‚Äìhole,‚Äù the man once known as ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Dad‚Äù shouted, provoking gasps in the hushed courtroom.  O‚ÄùNeill admonished the entertainer, but did not revoke bail.  Cosby, now 80, was found guilty of all three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Each count carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. Sentencing is expected later this year -‚Äì and it could be a forum for some of the more than 50 other women who have said they were sexually assaulted by Cosby.  Cosby was charged with drugging and molesting Andrea Constand, who was operations manager of the women‚Äôs basketball team at Temple University, at his home outside Philadelphia back in January 2004. Cosby contended the sexual contact was consensual.  Related Gretchen Carlson on How Her Roger Ailes Lawsuit Affected the Cosby Case Kevin Spacey Faces Felony Sexual Assault Charge, Posts Bizarre Video  The jury‚Äôs announcement ‚Äì delivered in a hushed courtroom at 1:45 p.m. ‚Äì marked the stunning end to the first celebrity trial in the heated atmosphere of the #MeToo movement. The panel of seven men and five women, including two African-Americans, began deliberating on the case on Wednesday morning, and announced the verdict on the 14th day of the retrial.  At a news conference later, Steele said that Constand, by coming forward with her accusation, was a ‚Äúmajor factor‚Äù in the #MeToo movement, and he said he hoped the verdict would help embolden other victims of sexual assault.  ‚ÄúWe hope this case sends a strong message that victims of these types of crimes can come forward and be heard,‚Äù said Steele as Constand stood quietly a few feet away.  Steele said Cosby was potentially ‚Äúfacing years in prison,‚Äù but he declined to say what type of sentence he would seek. He suggested that he would seek a substantial fine, noting that Cosby‚Äôs legal team had described the civil settlement of nearly $3.4 million that Cosby had paid in a lawsuit brought by Constand as a ‚Äúpaltry sum.‚Äù  Cosby has been accused of sexual assault by dozens of women in the past few years, but Constand‚Äôs allegations are the only ones that became the subject of a criminal case. The charges against Cosby were filed on Dec. 30, 2015 ‚Äì just days before the 12-year statute of limitations was due to expire.  The trial drew a number of the other Cosby accusers to the courthouse, and one of them broke down in tears and left the courtroom when the jury forewoman disclosed the guilty verdict.  The charges were first brought to trial last June, but the jury ended in a deadlock on all charges after more than 50 hours of deliberations.  The 80-year-old entertainer was accused by Constand, the former operations manager of the women‚Äôs basketball team at Temple University, of drugging and molesting her in January 2004. Constand said she became close with Cosby, who was a major supporter of the university, and viewed him as a mentor. She alleged that he abused her trust, however, when he invited her to his home in Montgomery County and offered her three blue pills to help her relax.  She testified that she took the pills because she trusted Cosby and believed they were some kind of an herbal relaxant, and soon became incapacitated. Then, she said, she felt his fingers inside of her, but ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt fight him off.‚Äù  Late Wednesday, jurors asked for a re-reading of Cosby‚Äôs deposition in the civil lawsuit brought against him by Constand, who received a settlement of nearly $3.4 million.  In the deposition, Cosby describes the moves he put on Constand on the night in question. Cosby also acknowledged that many years before, he used to give quaaludes to women he wanted to have sex with.  Cosby left the courtroom without comment, and his defense team had nothing to say on the way out of court. His lead defense attorney, Thomas Mesereau, had successfully defended Michael Jackson against child molestation charges in 2005. The team had mounted a strong defense on behalf of the entertainer.  The once-revered entertainer is the only major celebrity to face a jury amid the growing cultural awareness of the problem of sexual assault. In less than a year, dozens of rich and powerful men have been accused of sexual harassment or assault as more women have decided to publicly address the issue.  While Constand had no public reaction to the verdict, her lawyer, Dolores Troiani, thanked the team of law-enforcement officers and prosecutors for taking on such a powerful man. She said that Constand had first filed the complaint against Cosby 14 years ago ‚Äì and that it had taken all that time for her to obtain justice.  ‚ÄúAlthough justice was delayed, it was not denied,‚Äù said Troiani.  She said it has taken Constand a long time to deal with what had happened to her. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that she had to work out every day‚Äù since January 2004, said Troiani. ‚ÄúThis is a life-altering experience for any victim.‚Äù  Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents a number of the women who say Cosby sexually assaulted them, said the verdict was a victory for the victims. ‚ÄúAfter all is said and done, women were finally believed,‚Äù said Allred.  Following the guilty verdict, network Bounce TV announced that it was pulling all reruns of ‚ÄúThe Cosby Show‚Äù from its schedule.

Last week‚Äôs episode of ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù revealed that she left the Hilltop with the mysterious Georgie during the big time jump that came at the end of Rick Grimes‚Äô final episode.  And it turns out that may have also been Maggie‚Äôs final episode ever. Clearly, the creatives on the show and the folks at AMC are hedging their bets by not killing her off. But it‚Äôs entirely possible she‚Äôll never appear on ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù ever again.  We had heard rumblings of Cohan‚Äôs exit from the series all year, following stories of a contentious contract dispute in which Cohan wanted equal pay with other longtime series regulars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus. After signing on to ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhiskey Cavalier,‚Äù which will debut mid-season, Cohan did say she would be able to come back to ‚ÄúThe Walking Dead‚Äù for at least part of Season 9.  Also Read: 'Walking Dead': Everything We Know, and Think We Know, About Georgie  But it looks like that part of the season is now over, as ‚ÄúTWD‚Äù showrunner Angela Kang has confirmed that they don‚Äôt have plans for her to appear again in Season 9. And on the episode of ‚ÄúTalking Dead‚Äù after the season 9 mid-season finale, Chris Hardwicke read a statement from the producers which re-confirmed that Cohan won‚Äôt be back this season but that ‚ÄúMaggie‚Äôs story is not done‚Äù and that they ‚Äúhope to have her back‚Äù at some point in the future.  This all probably feels like it‚Äôs coming totally out of left field, considering how Maggie did not get any kind of real sendoff. Her final (as far as we know) episode also being Rick‚Äôs last didn‚Äôt help, since the episode basically functioned as Rick‚Äôs death episode.  But what AMC is doing with Rick may also be the path for wrapping up Maggie‚Äôs story. Two weeks ago, at the end of their final episode, Rick ended up being airlifted by helicopter away from Virginia, and what happens to him wherever he ends up will be the subject of a series of movies.  Also Read: Here's What You Need to Know About That Talking Zombie on 'The Walking Dead'  Meanwhile, it‚Äôs long been theorized that the helicopter belongs to the same group that Georgie hails from ‚Äî the Commonwealth, an actual large city of people in Ohio. If that theory pans out, and Georgie‚Äôs people are also the helicopter‚Äôs people, then there‚Äôs plenty of reason for Rick and Maggie to cross paths in this new corner of the ‚ÄúWalking Dead‚Äù universe.  But everything remains shrouded in mystery, and it sounds like nobody involved actually knows at this time what Maggie‚Äôs fate will end up being. If Georgie actually is with the Commonwealth, then the subject of Maggie is going to have to come up again sooner or later ‚Äî the Commonwealth is the next big storyline in the comics after the Whisperer War that is about to begin on the show.

Bundchen told ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts that right now she is in the valley of her life.  ""I'm a very visual person so that's why I describe it as the mountain and the valley,"" she said. ""Both of them are incredibly important, because from the mountaintop you can have a broader view of what's happening,""  ""You can see things from the top. There's a lot of sun on the mountaintop ... which is being on top of my career,"" Bundchen explained. ""And then the valley is ... you know, is the quieter place. It's the families, the home. It's where you do the work that doesn't get seen, but it's so important.""  Venturelli/Getty Images, FILE  A native of Brazil, Bundchen now lives outside of Boston with her husband, Tom Brady, the New England Patriots' quarterback.  The couple have two children together, and Bundchen said she has ""always wanted to be a mom"" and ""have a family.""  ""When I became a mother,"" she added, ""it really became my priority.""  ""I just wanted to be with my kids,"" she said. ""I couldn't ... see anything more important than being there for them ... and to be there for my husband too.""  ABC News  Despite this, transitioning from an international supermodel to domestic life took some time to adjust to, she said.  ""I was actually living what I love so much, which is being a mom, and a nurturer, and taking care of my family,"" Bundchen said. ""It was just very different than what I was used to. So it took some time to adjust.""  John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images, FILE  Bundchen opens up about her deeply personal journey to self-acceptance in her new book, ""Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life.""  In the book, she details how she used to suffer from crippling panic attacks in her 20s.  ""That was definitely rock bottom for me,"" Bundchen said of that time period.  One panic attack was so severe Bundchen said it led her to contemplate suicide.  She said she is sharing these ""very private"" and ""very vulnerable"" stories now ""with the hopes that people don't feel alone.""  ""It was like I was trapped and I couldn't breathe, and even outside of my own balcony,"" she recalled of a severe panic attack she had years ago. ""And from that moment on, you know, I realized that my life needed to change.""  After overcoming the urge to jump from that balcony, Bundchen committed to a full lifestyle change: Trading in cigarettes, wine and sugary coffee drinks for a clean, plant-based diet.  ABC News  She said she is teaching her children health habits and asks them to help tend the family's garden.  ""They also learn that it takes time to grow -- like we plant the seed and then they have to wait,"" she said.  Bundchen also credits the discovery of meditation and yoga with saving her life. She described meditation as ""being in the place in the seat of the observer versus in the monkey mind.""  ""Somebody told me a quote that I thought was fantastic one time: 'The mind is an instrument, don't let it play you,'"" she added.  She said she also finds a sense of peace in the steadiness of her husband.  ""He's very calm and very centered,"" she said. ""And I feel like, you know, I'm very emotional and very changeable.""  ""What I've learned from him is to kind of take a breath,"" she said. ""Take a breath.""  Jackson Lee/Getty Images, FILE  While in the past Bundchen has been vocal about wanting Brady to retire from football, she now says he will stop playing when he is ready.  Brady recently said he would like to play five more years.  ""I never seen someone love something as much as he loves football, and it makes me happy,"" Bundchen said.

When her 8-year-old son asked her, ""Mom, What's a celebrity?"" Bundchen said she made it clear that just because someone is famous does not mean they're more important.  ""I said, 'You know, a celebrity is simply someone that has a job that is more public than other jobs ... It doesn't mean that the job is more important than other jobs,"" she added.

Hyland is one of the stars of ABC's Modern Family and Sherwood is one of the stars of Freeform's Shadowhunters. Fans are wondering: Why did Sarah Hyland and Dominic Sherwood break up? Elite Daily reached out to both Hyland and Sherwood's teams for comment, but did not hear back by time of publication.  According to Entertainment Tonight, Hyland and Sherwood's relationship had just run its course. And hey, I get that. Things are good for a while, and then you just realize you're not right for each other. It doesn't mean it was a bad relationship, it's just one that's over. The pair first met when they co-starred in Vampire Academy back in 2014. (Hyland has also had a recurring role on Sherwood's Shadowhunters recently.)  Hyland and Sherwood went public with their relationship in March 2015 when they were seen kissing at a Lakers game in Los Angeles. They used to post pictures of each other on their respective Instagrams all the time, but Hyland hasn't posted anything about Sherwood since April 15, and Sherwood hasn't posted anything about Hyland since April 22.  Of course, Instagram posts realistically have nothing to do with the status of any given relationship. But that's just about the only indication we've had that these two were going to call it quits (albeit a very, very small indication). They celebrated their two-year anniversary in Feb. 2017. Hyland posted about the anniversary on Instagram with a caption that read, ""Happy 2 year to my #1 @domsherwood.""  Sherwood talked about his love for Hyland in an interview with ET in Feb. 2017. In the interview, he said,  Sarah makes me want to be a better version of myself. That's what I love most about her. She inspires me to be the best version of me.  When she joined the cast of Shadowhunters, Sherwood said,  Everyone fell in love with her on set. It was a real joy ... She's been coming in since season one, coming to visit me. Having her on set as an actress was just phenomenal.  At this point it's unclear why Hyland and Sherwood broke up, but it was wonderful while it lasted!",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,449

Kim, on the other hand, is expecting her third baby via surrogate. And get this ‚Äì they all are due around the same time next year! Could this really be just a really smart, orchestrated move? Or are the claims just baseless rumours?  ""Kris knew having three daughters simultaneously expecting would bring drama, tears, attention, competition ‚Äî everything she's trying to sustain for the sake of bigger paydays,"" an insider reported Star magazine.

Clearly, as Kris seemed to have been convinced, the triple baby boom news is doing its bit, if the source's claims are authentic.  ""She can't wait for all the attention,"" the source continues to explain. ""But, more importantly, for the cash to start rolling in."" This clearly refers to the alleged $25 million that the Kardashian-Jenner women are reportedly making off the baby news announcement and deals that have been offered to them.

And they might have dropped some passive hints on their social media accounts too! While sources have confirmed to multiple entertainment magazines that the rumours are true and the pregnant couples are absolutely thrilled, could this be just another stunt they pulled for money?

Returning cast members from previous seasons include Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Cheyenne Jackson, John Carroll Lynch, Chaz Bono, Adina Porter, James Morosini, Emma Roberts, Mare Winningham, Frances Conroy, and Jamie Brewer, along with new cast members Billie Lourd and Alison Pill.

Additionally, Paulson and Porter were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie respectively at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards while Peters received a nomination for Best Actor in a Movie or Limited Series at the 8th Critics' Choice TV Awards.  Plot [ edit ]  The fictional city of Brookfield Heights, Michigan is left divided by the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Local restaurant owner Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is utterly distraught by Donald Trump's victory and several of her longstanding phobias, including coulrophobia, hemophobia, and trypophobia, flare up as a result. Similarly devastated is fellow Brookfield Heights resident Winter Anderson (Billie Lourd), a liberal college dropout. Contrarily, Kai Anderson (Evan Peters), Winter's estranged and manipulative brother, rejoices at the election results and is enticed to pursue political power. Kai recruits a disillusioned Winter and frustrated newscast reporter Beverly Hope (Adina Porter).  Ally finds herself relentlessly terrorized by masked clowns. Those close to her, including her psychiatrist Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson), question whether the attacks are real or merely anxiety-fueled hallucinations. Ally's paranoia, escalated by suspicious activities perpetrated by new neighbors Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow Wilton (Leslie Grossman), hinders her relationships with her wife Ivy (Alison Pill) and their son Oz (Cooper Dodson).

He also said that he will be ""illuminating and highlighting"" groups of people he believes to be ""ignored by the current [Trump] administration and who are afraid and feel terrorized that their lives are going to be taken away.""[17]  It was later confirmed that the season would be set in the aftermath of the presidential election, with the first episode taking place on election night.[18][19] Murphy explained it will be about ""the fallout of that night, which to many people, from all sides of the camps is a horror story.""[20] He also revealed the season would not feature Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, stating ""Horror Story is always about allegory, so the election is allegory.""[20] In April 2017, Murphy confirmed that archive footage of the election night would be used in the season premiere.[21]  Murphy revealed via Twitter that the details of the seventh season, including the title, would be revealed on July 20.[22] He also teased that the opening sequence of the series would return in this season, following its absence in Roanoke.[23]  On July 20, 2017, it was announced at the San Diego Comic-Con that the title of the season would be Cult. Murphy also revealed it would be set in Michigan, and confirmed it would consist of a total of 11 episodes, premiering on September 5, 2017. For the first time, the series did not air on Wednesdays but rather on Tuesdays. On August 3, 2017, online posters revealed the names of multiple characters of the season.[24] On August 21, 2017, the opening title sequence of the season was revealed, following its absence in the previous season.[25] That same month, Murphy confirmed that, contrary to the past seasons, Cult would not feature supernatural elements.[26]  Casting [ edit ]  During the Winter 2017 TCA Press Tour, series mainstays Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters were reported to be starring as the leads in the season.[15][14] In March 2017, Billy on the Street host Billy Eichner was announced to be cast in the series, playing a role in the life of Paulson's character.[19][27] His character is slated for appearing in ""six or seven"" episodes.[19] The next month, it was reported that Scream Queens alum Billie Lourd will also star in the seventh installment of the series.[18][20] In May 2017, Leslie Grossman, who starred in Murphy's series Popular, joined the cast of the series,[28] and Angela Bassett hinted she may return in a recurring role.[29] Despite this, Bassett didn't appear. Later that month, it was confirmed via set pictures that Adina Porter and Cheyenne Jackson were also returning.[30][31] In June 2017, Murphy confirmed via his Instagram account that Colton Haynes, whom Murphy worked with previously on second season of Scream Queens, was joining the casting for the seventh season.[32] Later that month, set pictures revealed that Alison Pill was joining the cast of the season, seemingly portraying the partner of Sarah Paulson's character.[33] In July 2017, Murphy revealed via his Twitter account that Lena Dunham was joining the season.[34] She is set to play Valerie Solanas, author of the SCUM Manifesto and attempted murder of Andy Warhol, via flashbacks.[35] Murphy also confirmed the returns of Frances Conroy and Mare Winningham. Conroy has appeared in all the seasons except Hotel, while Winningham has appeared in Coven, Freak Show and Hotel.[36] In August 2017, Murphy confirmed the return of Emma Roberts, who appeared in Coven and Freak Show,[37] while Roanoke actors Chaz Bono and James Morosini also confirmed their returns.[38] In the seventh episode, Murder House, Coven and Freak Show actress alum Jamie Brewer returned to the show.  On June 26, 2017, it was confirmed that Lady Gaga would not return for the seventh season due to other projects.[39] Despite rumors, Entertainment Weekly reported on July 7, 2017, that Vera Farmiga, sister of American Horror Story alum Taissa Farmiga, would not appear in the season.[40] Later that month, it was confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter that Kathy Bates will not appear in Cult, after four seasons of regular appearances.[41]  Murphy also revealed via his Instagram account that Freak Show character Twisty the Clown would return in the seventh season, indicating that John Carroll Lynch would reprise his role.[42]  Filming [ edit ]  In February 2017, it was announced the season would begin principal photography in June 2017.[16] By the next month, filming was moved to May 2017.[19] On May 24, 2017, writer and producer John J. Gray confirmed the show started filming.[43]  Edits [ edit ]  On October 7, 2017, it was confirmed that the sixth episode of the season would be edited as a direct result of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that occurred on October 1, 2017. The episode originally featured a scene lasting 2 minutes and 16 seconds where Leslie Grossman's character Meadow Wilton begins to fire at Evan Peters' character, as well as a crowd, during a campaign speech. The episode was edited to de-emphasize the violence and to mostly have it featured completely off-screen[44] - as a result the opening sequence of the episode was cut in half, several on-screen deaths were removed and two separate close-up shots of the handgun firing were removed.[45]  While only the edited episode was broadcast on FX, the original uncut episode was released via VOD, FXNOW and FX+.[45]  Reception [ edit ]  Critical response [ edit ]  American Horror Story: Cult received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a 73% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.05/10, based on 47 reviews. The site's consensus reads, ""American Horror Story: Cult intrigues with timely, over-the-top creepiness - and lots of clowns - despite being hampered by broad political generalizations and occasional holes in the narrative's logic.""[46] On Metacritic, the season was given a score of 66 out of 100 based on 24 reviews, indicating ""generally positive reviews"".[47]  American Horror Story (season 7): Critical reception by episode Season 7 (2017) : Percentage of positive reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[48]  Awards and nominations [ edit ]  In its seventh season, the series has been nominated for 22 awards, 3 of them were won.

8fb875bd-7491-47d0-a3bc-41db10510f80,"There have been times in the past when we've questioned the behavior of Kevin Bacon, a Philadelphia-born actor and musician whose father shaped our city and therefore matters more to us than other celebrities.  Like, why did he wear spandex for an Apple commercial that aired exclusively in Europe? It was funny. That's a good enough reason. Also, ever since his grave misfortune at the hands of Bernie Madoff, Bacon has been vocal about the need for creatives to take a more structured approach to managing their finances. Perhaps the money was worth the spandex.  The latest Bacon question: Is he really singing the praises of President Donald Trump?  In the depressing age of fake news, there is a dual responsibility to identify the difference between news that is actually false or fabricated and news that simply rubs us the wrong way, generally because it comes with a slant or there are omissions that would otherwise provide a more comprehensive picture.  We can decidedly say that a recent story claiming Kevin Bacon believes we are all ""blessed"" to have Donald Trump as our president is utterly untrue.  The dubious news blog Worldwide Politics published a story on Sunday recapping a supposed interview Kevin Bacon had on ABC's ""This Week With George Stephanopoulos."" During this interview, the actor reportedly gushed over President Trump.  ‚ÄúI honestly think that we are blessed to have him as President ‚Äì he is the only one who can take care of all this mess,"" Bacon supposedly said. ‚ÄúHe should be given the Medal of Freedom for talking his mind in such a bold, honest, and straightforward manner.‚Äù  Bacon, of course, campaigned for John Edwards in 2007 and later donated to Barack Obama in 2008, officially endorsing the former president during his successful re-election bid in 2012. That's not to say some Obama voters didn't shift their support to Trump in 2016, but little about Bacon's political past suggests he would have done so himself.  Here's the kicker: Kevin Bacon last appeared on ""This Week"" in 2007 and never spoke a word about Donald Trump.  Worldwide Politics is the epitome of a fake news website. It's also not the only one that traffics in falsified celebrity news. Late last month, the Daily News for Americans ran a made-up story claiming actress Julia Roberts ‚Äî an attendee of the Women's March in Washington, D.C. ‚Äî called Trump ""the best president in US history.""

d951d1e4-3c9d-460c-ad14-6fa8686cb7a5,"The latest development in the push to express strength among women and solidarity in the wake of the #MeToo movement comes in the form of a classic symbol: a white rose.  White has long been associated with the fight for women‚Äôs equality, going back to the days of the suffragettes. Now attendees of the 2018 Grammy Awards are mobilizing to wear white roses to the ceremony as a way of recognizing the ongoing cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and abuse occurring across several industries, including entertainment.  Industry marketer Meg Harkins and promoter Karen Rait came up with the idea earlier this week, according to Billboard, at a dinner where they and other music industry insiders brainstormed ways to ensure that the #MeToo and Time‚Äôs Up movements were acknowledged at the Grammys, just like they were at the Golden Globes.  After they had chosen the white rose ‚Äî which they settled on as a symbol of peace, hope, and resistance ‚Äî they began to spread the word by way of a mass email from Atlantic Records chair Julie Greenwald. Celebrities who‚Äôve confirmed they‚Äôll be wearing white roses to the Grammys include Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper, and Rita Ora, among others on a list that reportedly numbers in the hundreds.  When informed of the movement during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Grammys host James Corden immediately voiced support and said he‚Äôd be wearing one as well.  Harkins and Rait told Billboard they were working to coordinate their messaging with the leaders of the Time‚Äôs Up campaign, which has been generally viewed as a leveling-up of the #MeToo movement to call for action and change in Hollywood. Time‚Äôs Up also doubles as a legal fund for anyone fighting sexual harassment.  The push to extend the conversation around the movement into the Grammys is significant; so far, despite prominent actors like Casey Affleck and James Franco coming under scrutiny in the wake of a wave of sexual assault allegations throughout Hollywood, there‚Äôs been little similar pushback against prominent members of the music industry.  A few, like mogul Russell Simmons, have experienced repercussions after allegations against them. But others, like musicians R. Kelly and Chris Brown, continue to maintain successful careers despite ongoing controversy surrounding accusations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against them.  The organizers of the plan to wear white roses to the Grammys are all too aware of this dichotomy. ‚ÄúWe have not had the tsunami [in the music industry] that politics and Hollywood has had,‚Äù Harkins told the Associated Press on Wednesday, ‚Äúbut we are still women.‚Äù  The effort to extend #MeToo and Time‚Äôs Up into the music industry comes at a moment when the latter campaign is already drawing backlash for expanding its reach outside of Hollywood, even though it‚Äôs not even a month old; the campaign has been criticized for not remaining narrowly focused on Hollywood reform. But the fact that in just a few days, hundreds of women in the music industry have vowed to show solidarity with Time‚Äôs Up at the Grammys indicates that, if anything, an expansion of the movement‚Äôs reach is still desired by many.  Ensuring that the conversation remains galvanized around the Grammys, then, will be an important task for the rose wearers. Corden told the Hollywood Reporter that the topic will be a major part of the awards show ‚Äî most visibly through a prominent performance by Kesha intended to spotlight the #MeToo movement.  Kesha has become an inadvertent leader in conversations about how to reform the music industry to keep sexual predators from being structurally protected, due to her long fight to win contractual and financial independence from her alleged rapist and former manager, the producer Dr. Luke. Her struggle speaks to the ongoing need for conversations around abuse and assault in the music industry as well as to the growing call for change.  ‚ÄúWe all agreed it was really necessary,‚Äù Harkins told the AP. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all felt the political and cultural change in the last couple of months.‚Äù  Still, the Grammys are already receiving criticism for not doing more to center the ceremony on such a glaring issue. Whether or not the red carpet is full of white roses, all eyes will be on the men and women of the music industry to see what comes next.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,816

Most also have whipped cream and more ""blood"" drizzled on top.  Singapore's stores are offering two slightly different versions this year: Mr. and Mrs. Vampire Frappuccino. The Mr. version has chocolatey cereal layered on top, while the Mrs. has a pump of vanilla syrup added.  There's still plenty of time for the U.S. to catch up, though. Last year, American Starbucks' locations brought back the Frappula a few days before Halloween, but only for a few days. And since the ingredients are available year round, you can technically order it any time you want.

""Soon as kylie and tyga broke up Chyna was over the game. She had a baby out of spite and I'll never view her the same,"" he wrote.  Should Chyna choose to pursue legal action against Rob, he could face serious consequences. California, which both Rob and Chyna call home, has had a revenge porn law since 2013, TMZ reports.  ""A person who intentionally distributes the image of the intimate body part of another ... knowing they'll cause emotional distress"" is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to 6 months in jail, the law states.  However, problems between the two appear to go deeper as Chyna has responded to the social media tirade with worrying accusations of domestic abuse.

af2e9d98-8c66-457e-a0a2-dc4886200b76,"We are one week away from the end of the world. Well, the AHS world that is.  On September 12, American Horror Story: Apocalypse will premiere on FX and if the trailer is any indication the fallout will have near-biblical proportions.  We already know the AHS universe has a guaranteed 10 seasons, but with only seven days until the Apocalypse premiere... we can't get too ahead of ourselves. So let's try theorizing with what we've got.  Here's everything we do and don't know about the impending doom of Apocalypse.    The end of the world hits October 2019 (and other timeline details)  Back in April, creator Ryan Murphy teased Season 8's timeframe during an Emmy FYC panel saying it took place ""18 months from today."" That puts our apocalyptic end sometime during October of next year. (Yes, this contradicts Murphy's earlier statement that Apocalypse would take place 10 to 20 years in the future.)  Season 8's first episode is fittingly titled ""The End,"" meaning our story, in the words of EP Alexis Martin, ""begins with the end of the world and then our world begins."" That being said, AHS will likely explore the lead-up to the disaster as well.  Seriously, flashbacks are almost as big an AHS staple as surprising sex scenes.      Season 8 is the long awaited Murder House/Coven crossover  The promise of the Harmons and the witches of Miss Robichaux's Academy pairing up for a season of chaos has been rumored for awhile... but Murphy didn't officially confirm the connection until June.  The Coven/Murder House AHS crossover season won't be happening next year...because it's happening THIS YEAR. AHS #8 WITCHES RULE THIS SEPTEMBER ‚Äî Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) June 14, 2018  Since then, Murphy has posted shots of the Murder House and Coven casts on familiar sets. Viviene and Ben Harmon are seen here in what looks a lot like the Los Angeles Murder House.  Connie, Sarah and Dylan. The Harmon‚Äôs are scaring up drama at The Murder House with Director Supreme Paulson. pic.twitter.com/L6e9N3LTtY ‚Äî Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 25, 2018  And here we've got the coven posing on a mod-staircase fit for their New Orleans home.  The Coven Returns. What a thrilling night with the legend Stevie Nicks on the set of AHS. pic.twitter.com/wsI1FlfN1W ‚Äî Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 19, 2018  It's unclear how AHS plans to bring these geographically different stories into the same arena. Personally, I'm hoping for a Zombieland style, post-apocalyptic search for Twinkies, but that may not be possible given the radiation levels...  That evil baby/Antichrist from Murder House is back  That explains all the scary fetus promos.  Excited to announce Cody Fern will be playing the role of Michael Langdon in American Horror Story: Apocalypse. Premieres September 12 on FX. pic.twitter.com/kFYQ2GAncd ‚Äî Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) July 26, 2018  In July, Murphy announced that American Crime Story alumnus Cody Fern would be assuming the role of grown-up Michael Langdon ‚Äî son of Viviene Harmon and Tate Langdon. Which is great news considering Fern's evident acting chops... but also presents a confusing timeline.  If Apocalypse is set in 2019 and Michael was born in 2012, then this little Beelzebub baby is growing up super fast. Or we're looking at a dash of demonic 13 Going on 30.  We got our first glimpse of the age-defying world-ender in AHS's first teaser trailer and he looked a lot like Edward Mordrake of Freak Show. I would say it was just a coincidence, but... is anything in AHS ever a coincidence?  Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Stevie Nicks (among others) will return  Guess who's coming back for AHS APOCALYPSE? Taissa Farmiga, Gabourey Sidibe, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy and....Stevie Nicks. So thrilled the family is together again! #AHSApocalypse ‚Äî Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 7, 2018  Sadly, powerhouse Angela Bassett won't be returning for this season of American Horror Story. However, the equally legendary Kathy Bates and Stevie Nicks will make appearances.  The long awaited return of early series star Jessica Lange as Murder House's Constance Langdon has also been confirmed.  As if that wasn't enough (c'mon, I'd pay anything to see that three-woman show), plenty of other series' alumni ‚Äî including Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Emma Roberts, Adina Porter, Billie Lourd, Cheyenne Jackson, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy, Connie Britton, Billy Eichner and many, many more ‚Äî will return for Season 8.  Yes, even Rubber Man... in whatever form that takes.      Some actors will be doubling-up  No, not in a Bette and Dot kinda way‚Äîthough Sarah Paulson will be plenty busy. Given the collision of anthologies set to unfold, a number of performers will reprise old roles as well as new ones.  Sarah Paulson is set to portray the still Supreme Cordelia Foxx of Coven and Craigslist medium Billie Dean Howard of Murder House‚Äîalongside her new Apocalypse character, Venable, first introduced through the clip below.  Evan Peters will similarly bring back the weirdly hunky Tate of Murder House and venture into new territory with an Apocalypse original character Murphy said was a ""comedic hairstylist.""  Taissa Farmiga, also a Coven and Murder House veteran, will rock both her roles as Zoe Benson and Violet Harmon. I'm not sure how much the young witch can do for us in the end of days, but I'm pretty stoked the Antichrist's half-sister is around... something tells me we're gonna need her thoughts.  Other crossover castings are possible, but not yet confirmed.  Joan Collins is joining the cast  If this isn't resonating with you as a big deal, that's okay. Take a mere 200-ish hours to watch all of the 1980's soap opera Dynasty. Don't worry, I will wait for you. This is important.  All done? Perfect. Joan Collins is (as you now know) a delightful, devilish legend. Her addition to the AHS universe is a gift and we need to treat it as such.  Outside of Collins playing Evan Peters' grandmother, very little is known about her role.  However, we do know how she got it. Turns out Collins met Ryan Murphy at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, mentioned the show, and two weeks later got an offer. Could this woman and her career be anymore supremely glamorous? (Get it? Supreme? Seriously, there is no way this woman is not a coven leader... right?)      And Billy Porter  Yep. The Pose icon is shuffling over to the dark and twisted parts of the Murphy-verse.  Very little is know about Porter's character, though set photos imply he is Coven related.  ""All I can say is dreams do come true,"" Porter said of the opportunity. ""They may not come when you want them, but it‚Äôs all right on time. Keep on fighting, keep on showing up for your life. Keep on pushing. I‚Äôm a living witness that dreams come true. You change the world when you change your mind, and we all can make a difference in this world.""  The glamor is gonna get weird  With Evan Peters and Joan Collins' stylish castings plus the fabulous gowns in the trailer taken into account, the gorey but glamorous promos AHS has been rolling out make a bit more sense.  This ""haircut"" clip is almost as chic as the new dark, pixie Kathy Bates is rocking for her role as Ms. Meade.  And the whole sucking the life out of someone feels very Fiona Goode of Coven.  Overall, we can probably expect more of the sleek style and finesse we saw in Coven‚Äîeven if it's the end of the world. (Rapture or no rapture, that dark lipstick on Sarah Paulson could kill anyone. Goodness gracious.)  Expect something crazy to go down in Episode 5  What could be more intense than the apparent nuclear apocalypse of the trailer? Personally, I don't know, but there is allegedly a ""huge thing that happens in Episode 5."" In a conversation with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy alluded to the big midseason development, calling it the season's ""hook.""  Notably, Episode 6 has a Murder House-heavy cast lined up with Sarah Paulson in the director's chair. Not sure what that means for the preceding episode, but we could be looking at a flashback.      ""Hail, Satan.""  Okay, so you heard Kathy Bates say that at the end of the trailer too?  Clearly, the Satanic overtones of Apocalypse are not going to be subtle, Sarah Paulson is going to be far from sweet, and that bunker is going to be Hell on Earth.  Do we have a 10 Cloverfield Lane situation on our hands? A Handmaid's Tale situation on our hands? Just tell me. What do we have on our hands?!  Looks like only time will tell. One more week, horror fans.  American Horror Story: Apocalypse premieres Wednesday, September 12 at 9pm on FX.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1731

08df367a-7a1b-4c8a-8afc-43c536ed044f,"Whoa. Did the Kardashians get banned from one of the biggest Oscar pre-parties of the year?! A shocking new report claims that the reality superstars were actually forbidden from entering the Raleigh Studios‚Äô ‚ÄòNight Before‚Äô extravaganza this year after getting in trouble for their ‚Äòdrunk,‚Äô messy behavior in years past. Ouch!  When Hollywood‚Äôs biggest stars hit the red carpet at the Oscar pre-parties on Feb. 27, we couldn‚Äôt help but notice that a couple famous faces were noticeably missing from the A-list lineup: of course, we‚Äôre talking about the Kardashian/Jenner clan! The Internet-breaking family was a no-show at the Raleigh Studios annual pre-party, and as it turns out, it had nothing to do with their busy schedules. In fact, a shocking new report claims that the women were actually BANNED from the VIP festivities after raising eyebrows with their ‚Äúdrunk‚Äù behavior in years past! Well, this certainly doesn‚Äôt look good for the brand!      Despite being some of the biggest names in Hollywood, the Kardashians were reportedly not welcome at the annual ‚ÄúNight Before‚Äù party at Raleigh Studios after displaying what some claimed was some pretty unacceptable behavior, according to a new Star magazine report. The reality TV stars were allegedly all denied an invite to the star-studded event ‚Äî Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stalone, Kerry Washington and Alicia Vikander were among those who did make the cut, in case you were wondering ‚Äî after a source tells the outlet Kris Jenner rubbed some people the wrong way with her sloppy behavior at a previous party. ‚ÄúKris Jenner went years ago and got drunk and no one liked that,‚Äù the insider explained to the magazine. HollywoodLife.com has reached out for further comment.  Yikes! How bad could her behavior have been to get her entire family banned from the event? While it‚Äôs no secret that Kris is a fan of her vodka drinks ‚Äî it‚Äôs been a running storyline on Keeping Up With The Kardashians for several seasons now ‚Äî it‚Äôs well-known that the majority of her daughters aren‚Äôt big on drinking, which makes this whole thing seem rather unfair, don‚Äôt you think?  In fact, in it was Khloe Kardashian who recently opened up about her family‚Äôs sober ways, admitting that while she and Kris may love their cocktails, the same doesn‚Äôt necessarily hold true for the rest of the family. ‚ÄúKimberly does not drink alcohol whatsoever,‚Äù Khloe told Elle magazine. ‚ÄúPregnant or not, she‚Äôs just never been into it. Kendall and Kylie are not into it. Even when Kendall goes to Europe where the drinking age is 18, she‚Äôs never‚ÄîKendall‚Äôs really focused and determined.  ‚ÄúKourtney used to drink a lot more in college and probably before she had kids. She‚Äôs literally been pregnant for, like, six years or breastfeeding, so I think that has obviously changed her life now,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúMy mom has a drink every night with dinner. That‚Äôs her thing, and that‚Äôs what she loves to do. I don‚Äôt like the taste of alcohol like that, so if I drink, I drink for intent. Like, I don‚Äôt care to just have a glass of wine. No, I want to get f**king buzzed or drunk. That‚Äôs the point!‚Äù      Still, that‚Äôs not to say that the Kardashians haven‚Äôt had their sloppy moments in years past. In fact, it was in a recent episode of KUWTK that we saw a totally wasted Khole go off on Kris during her spectacular Great Gatsby-themed 60th birthday party. In the episode, Kris was just about to give a speech thanking all of her friends and family for celebrating with her when KoKo ripped the mic out of her hand and said, ‚Äúno one cares about her f**king speech.‚Äù Yikes!

Almost a year after pleading guilty to bankruptcy fraud, Dance Moms‚Äô Abby Lee Miller was sentenced Tuesday to a year and a day in prison by a federal judge in Pittsburgh, according to Deadline. She‚Äôll also have to pay a fine of $40,000, along with an additional $120,000 for a currency-reporting violation she was investigated for last summer. Miller filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and was first indicted in 2015 on 20 charges of bankruptcy fraud, concealment of bankruptcy assets, and false bankruptcy declarations. Her legal woes came to a head after federal agencies found evidence that she tried to hide $775,000 in income from Dance Moms, the spinoff Abby‚Äôs Ultimate Dance Competition, and other Dance Moms‚Äìrelated appearances and merchandise.  In Tuesday‚Äôs hearing, character witnesses said Miller isn‚Äôt anything like the combative and demanding dance instructor she was portrayed as on the Lifetime show. Afterward, Miller took the stand to defend herself, saying, ‚ÄúDance Moms became a hit and I became the laughingstock of reality TV.‚Äù Miller will likely serve nine months in a facility close to Los Angeles, and have an additional two years of supervised release.

The case is now closed and the body is ready for pick up,‚Äù Ed Winter of the Los Angeles Coroner Office tells Us Weekly on Thursday, February 1.  As previously reported, the coroner confirmed to Us that the Glee alum died on Tuesday, January 30. Salling was found by a riverbed in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Us confirmed that one of Salling‚Äôs family members reported him missing at 3 a.m. before his body was discovered on Tuesday.  The 35-year-old actor, who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor in December 2017, was set to be sentenced on March 7. In October, he agreed to a plea deal that included four to seven years in jail. According to the court documents previously obtained by Us, Salling was also ordered to pay approximately $50,000 in restitution and register as a sex offender after his stint in jail.  However, a source close to his child pornography case explained to Us on Wednesday, January 31, that Salling‚Äôs estate might not have to pay his victims because he was not sentenced before his death.  ‚ÄúRestitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge ‚Ä¶ He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,‚Äù the insider told Us. ‚ÄúTherefore I doubt that there is anything to take to civil court. Any restitution order would be allocated among multiple known victims.‚Äù  The source added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that there isn‚Äôt some lawyer out there willing to file suit on behalf of someone claiming to be a victim. But I am saying, that there is no order to be enforced, for $50,000 or any other amount on behalf of anyone.‚Äù  Criminal defense attorney Troy Slaten, who is not directly involved in Salling‚Äôs case, further explained that Salling‚Äôs victims would have to file a suit in civil court to pursue any restitution.  ‚ÄúAny victims can sue his estate in civil court and receive monetary awards for damages. These awards ‚Ä¶ can be in the neighborhood of hundred of thousands of dollars or even in the millions,‚Äù Slaten said. They have to file suit in civil court, if they have not already, which they want to do quickly, because you do not want the estate to distribute assets.

7243d11a-9cea-4be7-ab7a-b9cef8018c9e,"  Princess Elizabeth and Philip, Duke of Edinburgh pose on their wedding day on Nov. 20, 1947.  Britain, 1947. The Second World War had ended but the nation‚Äôs struggle was far from over.  Rationing was still in place for myriad food items. In the streets, people queued for jobs, for handouts and for fresh fruit. Families torn apart by war tried desperately to rebuild, many without the men who had left home for battle and never returned. Access to fuel was limited. Then one of the coldest winters on record hit, destroying Britain‚Äôs wheat crop and leaving thousands of people in rural areas isolated.  When Princess Elizabeth‚Äôs engagement to Philip Mountbatten was announced that summer, many Brits welcomed the news. After so much suffering, the prospect of a royal wedding seemed to lift the nation‚Äôs spirit. ‚ÄúOh, it gave us all a boost,‚Äù recalled Pat Bannell, a 97-year-old from East London. ‚ÄúWe were all for it, especially if we got a day off work,‚Äù she said, chuckling.  The wedding of the future Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip came just four months after the engagement and was attended by 2,000 guests.  Across the country and around the world, people listened to the events unfold on the radio. Thousands gathered on the streets of London and outside Buckingham Palace, where they waited patiently for hours to catch a glimpse of the newlyweds after the nuptials. As the couple stepped out onto the balcony and waved, they were met with a roar of whistling, claps and cheers.  Describing the ‚Äúvast crowds‚Äù and ‚Äúshining happiness of the bride,‚Äù the Daily Telegraph reported the wedding would ‚Äúlive long in the memory.‚Äù  On Saturday, those long-ago newlyweds ‚Äî the queen is now 92, Prince Philip is 96, and the couple celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in November ‚Äî are expected to attend the royal wedding of their grandson Prince Harry to American actress Meghan Markle. (Prince Philip is recovering from a hip operation.)  [Britain‚Äôs black queen: Will Meghan Markle really be the first mixed-race royal?]  Planning any wedding is stressful ‚Äî and mishaps are inevitable. Just ask Queen Elizabeth. On the morning of her wedding, the jewel-encrusted fringe tiara she was given as her ‚Äúsomething borrowed‚Äù by her mother snapped as it was placed atop her head. The royal family, of course, had a jeweler on standby who was able to repair it and save the day.  Elizabeth‚Äôs wedding cake was nine-feet tall, and she received 10,000 telegrams of congratulations. The material for the wedding gown was purchased with ration coupons collected by the bride. Members of the public who wanted to help had sent their own coupons for the princess to use, although these were kindly returned to the senders.  Elizabeth‚Äôs dress was made from ivory silk and embellished with 10,000 pearls. But royal wedding dresses have not always been white. Before the 19th century, many royal brides opted for color, the bolder and brighter the better. When Queen Victoria wore a white ball gown to marry Prince Albert in 1840, she changed wedding traditions ‚Äî royal and commoner ‚Äî forever.    An illustration of the Feb. 10, 1840, wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in the Chapel Royal at St. James‚Äôs Palace in England. (Associated Press)  The demands of history always play a role in royal weddings. Not only do couples need consent from the queen to marry, they must also deal with an additional layer of pressure: to follow or jettison age-old traditions.  When the bride and groom exchange vows at Windsor Castle‚Äôs St. George‚Äôs Chapel this weekend, comparisons with the past will certainly be made. Kensington Palace announced this week that Markle‚Äôs father will not walk her down the aisle, as tradition demands. Instead she asked Prince Charles, her father-in-law, to perform the honor.  A statement from Ms. Meghan Markle: pic.twitter.com/TjBNarmuBU ‚Äî Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 17, 2018  Not having her father escort her isn‚Äôt without precedent. Queen Victoria was accompanied to the altar by her uncle. And Victoria walked her own daughter, Princess Beatrice, down the aisle in 1885.  On Saturday, smaller dramas will revolve around the royal couple‚Äôs decorative choices, sentimental touches and ceremonial decisions. All will be scrutinized. While many customs have prevailed throughout royal wedding history, others have been tweaked or replaced entirely.  The vows  When Elizabeth married Prince Philip in 1947, she took a traditional vow, promising to ‚Äúlove, cherish and obey‚Äù him.  It was Diana, Princess of Wales who broke with tradition in 1981 when she married Prince Charles by omitting the word obey. Diana instead promised to ‚Äúlove, comfort, honor and keep‚Äù her new husband.  Diana‚Äôs decision sparked controversy not just at home but also overseas. ‚ÄúLADY DIANA WON‚ÄôT VOW TO OBEY CHARLES,‚Äù the New York Times wrote.    Princess Diana and Prince Charles on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after their wedding on July 29, 1981. (AP Photo)  [Diana‚Äôs final hours: Dodi‚Äôs yacht, a Ritz suite, a diamond ring and relentless photographers]  Royal brides who came after Diana did not follow suit. When Sarah Ferguson married Prince Andrew in 1986, she vowed to obey, as did Sophie Rhys-Jones during her wedding to Prince Edward. (Bishop of Norwich Peter Nott, who led the wedding service, said use of the word ‚Äòobey‚Äô was about trust and did not mean Sophie was going to be ‚Äúsubservient.‚Äù)  In the run-up to Kate Middleton‚Äôs wedding to Prince William in 2011, speculation was rife about the impending vows. Would Kate do a Diana? The answer was yes. Standing in Westminster Abbey, she vowed to ‚Äúlove, comfort, honor and keep‚Äù her husband, with no mention of obeying him.  Now it is Meghan Markle‚Äôs turn to decide.  Flowers  When it comes to flowers and royal weddings, arrangements are traditionally all white ‚Äî although size and style have varied dramatically over time.  Kate‚Äôs bouquet was described as simple by some and underwhelming by others. Diana‚Äôs bridal arrangement was quite the opposite, weighing in at more than four pounds. The bouquet was ostentatious, and she did not just have one, she had two. This is rumored to be because Elizabeth‚Äôs was allegedly misplaced by a footman and went missing at some point during her wedding day ‚Äî much to the dismay of the official photographer. When it came time to take the family photo, her arrangement was nowhere to be seen.    Elizabeth‚Äôs bouquet was missing in this family portrait. (Associated Press)  Despite the differences in size, flower selection and personal preference, the inclusion of myrtle, which symbolizes love, is a tradition that dates back to the wedding of Queen Victoria‚Äôs daughter and is expected to continue with Meghan this weekend, although many anticipate she will add her own touch to the creation.  Wedding rings    Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon with Britain‚Äôs Duke of York, who became King George VI, on April 26,1923. (Associated Press)  At the time of her marriage to the future King George VI in 1923, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later known as the Queen Mother, opted for a wedding ring made from rare Welsh gold. From this date on, the Welsh wedding band became somewhat of a statement. Since then, the unique gold has been used to form the rings of the queen, Princess Margaret and Princess Diana. The wedding rings are formed from the same nugget, carefully extracted from the Clogau St. David‚Äôs gold mine in Wales. After his engagement, Prince William was given Welsh gold by the queen so Kate could wear a Welsh band.  Prince Harry recently said yellow gold is Meghan‚Äôs favorite, but it is not yet known whether her choice of wedding ring will follow royal tradition.  The date  Royal weddings often occur during the week, which, in the past has resulted in a day off for most workers. Queen Elizabeth and Philip were married on a Thursday. Prince Charles and Princess Diana on a Wednesday. Prince William and Catherine married on a Friday, and pubs and bars across the country had their opening hours extended to make room for extra drinking time.  Not only are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tying the knot on a Saturday, but it is also one of the biggest soccer matches of the year, the FA Cup final. For FA President Prince William, who is also Harry‚Äôs best man, it is shaping up to be quite the day.

Yet, Chastain says that might be how her Italian in-laws, the parents of her fashion executive husband fashion executive Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, feel about her. Last night when she stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live, she opened up about an awkward season of holiday meals with her husband's family as well as her own ‚Äî mostly due to her vegan diet and cultural differences.  The two families met in the Alps, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, where things got ""interesting."" ""My family is from Northern California,"" Chastain told Kimmel. ""And his family is from Veneto, Italy. My family doesn't speak [Italian] and his family speaks very little English... It was a very quiet holiday, but there was a lot of pointing and a lot of food.""  That's where the families differed: ""We've known each other for about six years and Americans eat in about an hour,"" says Chastain. ""A meal starts and then it's done. When I went to Italy, I didn't realize that meals last for three or four hours... I don't understand this but Sunday brunch will go from 1 pm to 5 pm. You eat one course and it's delicious. Then the second your plate is done, his mom is putting more food on my plate. So I have a trick where I just push the food around on my plate for hours.""  Chastain's vegan diet, however, poses more of an issue for her in these situations than the duration of the meals. ""In the beginning, I would say I'm vegan. Which is like the worst thing. I don't eat 10 meals and I'm vegan. I would say, 'I'm sorry I can't eat that,' and [my mother-in-law] would say, 'No problem, we have fish'.""  ""Do you think they hate you?"" Kimmel asks, to which Chastain responds, ""Maybe that's why it's so quiet. They just hate me.""  Chastain explained why she went vegan last year, telling W , "" I found myself going to veganism because a friend of mine had a two week vegan food delivery program she wasn‚Äôt going to use so I used it, and immediately I just had more energy than I‚Äôve ever had in my life... Being vegan was not anything I ever wanted to be. I just really was listening to what my body was telling me.""

1ed3d539-3209-4b75-8f51-c63c75a9e0b8,"EXCLUSIVE: Warner Bros escaped a potential Fantastic Beasts PR nightmare today as Johnny Depp was denied an attempt to push back the trial over his $25 million fraud suit against his former business managers.  The rejection came this morning from a Los Angeles Superior Court judge for the Pirates of the Caribbean star after a lengthy profile in Rolling Stone that was far more of a train wreck than testimonial for Depp, who has been faced with many lawsuits as of late. What is perhaps equally unusual is that this is Depp‚Äôs lawsuit.  In a role much more commonly assumed by defendants, the plaintiff actor was trying to delay the suit that he instigated. It was a pose that Depp repeatedly also tried with the deposition he finally gave to lawyers at Kinsella Weitzman Iser Kump & Aldisert LLP in late May.  Having flown in from Washington D.C., Depp‚Äôs primary lawyer Benjamin Chew sought to have the August 15 jury proceedings shoved another 60 days ‚Äî which would be in mid-October. If the ex parte application had been successful, it could have had the unanticipated consequence of throwing rotten egg on the now AT&T-owned WB, the studio of Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald which is set for a November release.  Already forced to weather more than a little controversy over Depp‚Äôs participation in the JK Rowling‚Äôs franchise and now under new bosses, the last thing WB would have wanted was the possible waft of Depp‚Äôs dirty laundry ‚Äî financial and otherwise ‚Äî to come out during their peak press period for the tentpole pic.  Fortunately for the studio, who had nothing to do with today‚Äôs actions, the Honorable Teresa Beaudet wanted to stick to the schedule and get things dealt with sooner rather than later. ‚ÄúThe ex parte application is denied at this time,‚Äù the LASC Judge wrote in longhand on the proposed order Friday.  She added, ‚ÄúThe parties are to work with the discovery referee to create a schedule to complete the discovery prior to the FSC (final status conference).‚Äù  ‚ÄúThe parties have agreed to and scheduled a mediation on July 14, 2018 before the Honorable Peter Lichtman (Ret.) of JAMS,‚Äù noted Chew in the unsuccessful application with the court today. Chew is now with DC‚Äôs Brown Rudick. Prior to that, he was with repping Depp at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips LLP.  ‚ÄúThat date was the first available date that the parties and Judge Lichtman could conduct a mediation,‚Äù Chew added. ‚ÄúIn light of the close proximity of that mediation date to the August 15th trial date and the related pre-trial filing dates which back up from the August 3, 2018 Final Status Conference, without a trial continuance the parties will effectively had been required to complete virtually all of their discovery and trial preparation prior to attending the mediation. A brief trial continuance would enable the parties to some extent to conserve the resources which would otherwise be devoted to completing discovery and trial preparation to be used for settlement purposes at the mediation.‚Äù  Not so much, retorted the other side.  ‚ÄúAlthough the parties have scheduled a private mediation for July 14, 2018‚Äîthe first available date because of Depp‚Äôs current rock n‚Äô roll tour‚Äîcontinuing the trial date prior to the mediation would be counter-productive,‚Äù said Team TMG.  ‚ÄúThere is no reason to assume that the action will settle at the mediation, and continuing the trial date will only decrease the odds of settlement,‚Äù the defense lawyers declared. ‚ÄúThe discovery grounds upon which the Depp Parties seek a trial continuance are the result of their own gamesmanship, delay and lack of diligence.‚Äù  Now battling ex-bodyguards who claim drug abuse and owed pay as well as a countersuit from his former longtime attorney, Depp first sued The Management Group back in January 2017.  At the time and since, the actor alleged that, despite making hundreds of millions of dollars, he was feeling the financial pinch because of having been swindled in the Hollywood accounting shell game by those he trusted and the much-respected TMG.  The Management Group swung back with a countersuit of their own in early 2017 over unpaid commissions and tales of excess and irresponsibility ‚Äî to put it very mildly. The suit proclaimed that the actor, who banks upt $20 million a picture plus a share of profits, had spending habits that were the real cause of his emptying bank accounts. Among the various residences, dozens of vehicles, tens of thousands a month on wine, guitar collection, artwork, hangers-on, sibling provisions, security, acting assistants and other indulgences, TMG‚Äôs reaction revealed that the Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas star paid out $3 million to have Hunter S. Thompson‚Äôs ashes shoot out of a cannon in 2005 and forks out more $2-million in monthly expenses.  Doing himself a few favors as custodian of his own funds, Depp bragged to Rolling Stone that the cost for the tribute to Thompson was actually closer to $5 million and that he blew a lot more than $30,000 a month on wine.  Late last year, before Depp started shedding lawyers faster than Jack Sparrow does goodwill, TMG add another lawsuit to the pyre. ‚ÄúDepp listened to no one, including TMG and his other advisors, and he demanded they fund a lifestyle that was extravagant and extreme,‚Äù the business managers stated in foreclosure filings against the actor for a $5 million loan TMG said they made to him to bail him out a few years back.  As the summer trial seems certain to occur, Depp himself was not in court today. Playing a set tonight at the Hellfest in Clisson, France, the guitar-strumming actor is on a summer tour with Alice Cooper, Aerosmith‚Äôs Joe Perry and other members of the Hollywood Vampires band ‚Äì livin‚Äô the dream, for now.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1103
c576f2f0-7b65-420e-8339-4df50f55c5bd,"The estate of Tony winner Jonathan Larson will exec produce the live musical of the HIV/AIDS-themed play. Marc Platt is also on board.  Fox has found its follow-up to Grease Live.  Following prolonged negotiations, Jonathan Larson's Tony-winning HIV/AIDS-themed musical Rent is set as the network's next live musical, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Larson's estate is on board to executive produce alongside Marc Platt (La La Land, Wicked). Rent marks Platt's latest live project for following NBC's Jesus Christ Superstar and Fox's newly announced A Christmas Story and last year's Grease. Additional auspices, as well as a premiere date and casting, will be announced later.  The rock musical, loosely based on La Boheme, tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in New York's East Village in the days of the Bohemian Alphabet City and under the shadow of HIV/AIDS.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning play was created by Larson, who died suddenly before Rent opened off-Broadway in 1996 and then moved to Broadway. Rent won Tony Awards for best musical, book of a musical and original score ‚Äî all for Larson ‚Äî and scored co-lead Wilson Jermaine Heredia a win for featured actor for his performance as Angel Dumott Schunard, a drag queen drummer with HIV/AIDS.  ""Rent‚Äã‚Äã was Jonathan‚Äôs dream of sharing the ‚Äãtheater and the passion he had for it with a whole new generation,‚Äù Julie and Al Larson said in a statement. ‚ÄúNone of us could have imagined the massive impact that the messages and themes in Rent would have on the ‚Äãtheater‚Äã community or the world ... except for Jonathan. We are absolutely thrilled to be continuing Jonathan‚Äôs legacy and ‚Äãthe still-relevant ‚Äãthemes of ‚Äãthe show in this way.‚Äù    The original Broadway cast also included Adam Pascal, Daphne-Rubin-Vega and Idina Menzel, who all collected Tony nominations, as well as Anthony Rapp, Jesse L. Martin and Taye Diggs.    ""We are so honored to partner with the estate of the brilliant Jonathan Larson and producer Marc Platt on one of the great musicals of our time,"" said Dana Walden and Gary Newman, chairmen and CEOs of Fox Television Group. ""The title is so iconic, the music is so beloved, and the themes are as meaningful today as they were when the show first premiered on Broadway. With Marc overseeing this project, we are sure it will have a profound impact on the legions of fans who know and love this musical.""  The production was adapted for the big screen in 2005 with Chris Columbus directing and produced by Robert DeNiro, Jane Rosenthal, Columbus, Mark Radcliffe and Michael Barnathan. Stephen Chbosky adapted Larson's book, with nearly all of the original Broadway cast returning to reprise their roles. With a $40 million budget, the pic grossed a disappointing $31.6 million. The play marked its 20th anniversary in 2016 with a tour.  Fox's production will be exec produced by Platt, Adam Siegel, Julie Larson, Al Larson and Revolution Studios' Vince Totino, Scott Hemming and Marla Levine. The original production was produced by the New York Theatre Workshop and on Broadway by Jeffrey Seller, Kevin McCollum, Allan S. Gordon and the NYTW. Larson, for his part, also earned a Pulitzer Prize for the production.  Speaking with THR at the Emmys, Walden said Rent ""would be a dream ‚Äî a dream your biggest dream"" to land as the network's next live production. ""That would be a title that's perfect for Fox and something that we could do in a meaningful way. Our network is distinguished by cutting-edge programming and being able to take subject matter ‚Äî whether it was Glee or Shots Fired ‚Äî I think our brand is perfect for that title. I would love it.""  Rent, with a legion of loyal and diehard fans, has big shoes to fill. Grease Live ranked third this year at the Emmys, collecting a total of five statuettes including for outstanding special class program and directing for Tony winner Thomas Kail (Hamilton).  The news comes after Fox announced A Christmas Story would air in December, opposite NBC and Jennifer Lopez with Bye Bye Birdie. NBC also noted this week that it would tackle Jesus Christ Superstar for Easter 2018. (There remains no word on NBC's A Few Good Men live production.)

Even after a year of the two superstars living separately, stories about one or the other keep making headlines.  If a recent report is to be believed, Brad Pitt apparently thinks that leaving Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolie was 'the biggest mistake of his life'.  A source told InTouchWeekly.com that Brad is now 'in touch with his emotions and his true self like never before'.  ""He's come to realise that leaving Jen for Angelina was one of the biggest mistakes of his life,"" the source told the website.  ""And while he's not in love with Jen, he realises how much he does love her. Brad keeps telling friends that he's seeing everything more clearly,"" said the source.  Jennifer Aniston, meanwhile, is married to her Wanderlust co-star Justin Theroux. The two tied the knot in 2015.  Brad, on the other hand, split with Angelina Jolie last year, after a nine-year relationship, followed by a two-year marriage. The War Machine star is reportedly sober now, after his therapy and is seeing everything more clearly.  But he does not want to wreck Jennifer's marriage with Justin. The source informed the website that while Brad would not 'dream of ruining his ex's new marriage', he 'would take a second chance at love with Jen in a heartbeat'.  Pitt was married to Aniston when he fell for Angelina Jolie, on the sets of Mrs And Mrs Smith. His five-year marriage to Aniston soon hit choppy waters and a divorce followed.  Brad and Angelina went on to have a nine-year-long relationship that culminated in a fairy-tale wedding in 2014. And then, last year, Brangelina left the world shocked with the revelation that they had ended their marriage.  About two months ago, there were reports that Brad might have finally apologised to Jennifer for leaving her when he fell in love with Angelina.

It was the most intimate conversation Brad and Jen have ever had,"" a source told a publication in September this year.  An overwhelmed Jennifer is said to have broken down after Brad's heartfelt apology. ""All the hurt feelings and resentment she'd suppressed for years came flooding to the surface, and she broke down in tears,"" the source added.

bacd7d40-da93-4209-84c9-8d79bfc8221e,"The 'Grace and Frankie' star will appear as prosecutor Jack McCoy later this season.  Jack is back.  Sam Waterston, who starred on Law & Order for 16 seasons, will reprise his role as prosecutor Jack McCoy on Law & Order: SVU, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.  The actor will guest-star on an upcoming episode of the NBC spinoff's 19th season, which kicks off Sept. 27. The role reunites him with new SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin, who worked on Waterston's first two seasons of the mothership and helped create the character of Jack McCoy. Fellow SVU exec producer Julie Martin also worked on the final season of the original series.  Waterston joined the NBC legal drama in its fifth season and stayed through the drama's 20th and final season. NBC then abruptly canceled the series in 2010 ‚Äî one season before Law & Order could break Gunsmoke's record for longest-running primetime drama.  Law & Order's abrupt cancellation means the writers were unable to wrap up storylines for Jack and the other characters. (Fellow longtime cast member S. Epatha Merkerson had already planned to exit at the end of season 20 and was given an emotional final season arc in which her character battled breast cancer.)  This will actually be Jack McCoy's fourth appearance on SVU following several crossovers in the early aughts. In recent years, SVU has welcomed back other characters from the mothership including prosecutors Connie Rubirosa (Alana De La Garza) and Michael Cutter (Linus Roache).  During his 16-season stint on Law & Order, Waterston won a Screen Actors Guild award for best actor in a drama series and earned three Emmy nominations in the same category. Since Law & Order, he was gone on to roles in Aaron Sorkin's HBO drama The Newsroom as well as movies including Miss Sloane and Please Be Normal.  In addition to his starring role on the Netflix comedy Grace & Frankie, Waterston will next appear in the Netflix Western miniseries Godless. He is repped by Gersh and Industry Entertainment.  Despite his busy schedule, Waterston expressed interest in reviving Jack McCoy as recently as 2015, when NBC and Dick Wolf were in talks for a potential Law & Order revival. ""Sure, I'd love it,"" Waterston told THR in May 2015. ""Got to break the record.""  Chernuchin also talked to THR about bringing back Jack McCoy earlier this year when he was the showrunner on Chicago Justice. Justice saw the return of several flagship favorites including Richard Brooks, Lorraine Toussaint and Tovah Feldshuh. ""We actually talked for a brief second about having Sam come in, but we thought it was too early,"" Chernuchin told THR in January. ""But maybe in the future.""  However, Chicago Justice was canceled in May after one season and Chernuchin subsequently took over the top job at SVU. In his move to SVU, Chernuchin is bringing an important member of the Law & Order universe with him: prosecutor Peter Stone, the son of Law & Order character Ben Stone, played by Waterston's predecessor Michael Moriarty. Philip Winchester played the role of Peter on Chicago Justice and will join SVU full-time later this season.  ""We've connected all the Dick Wolf shows,"" Chernuchin told THR recently about adding Winchester to the cast. ""The original New York franchise, the Chicago franchise, it's like the small Dickensian universe in London where different characters show up in different novels. That was one of the intriguing things to me by bringing Philip over, is to connect all the franchises.""  Like SVU, which pulls solid numbers in syndication on USA Network, Law & Order continues to live on in repeats on TNT, SundanceTV and WeTV, among other channels.

The memory of Carrie Fisher had curled up here on Thursday morning, at the start of Star Wars Celebration, the semi-regular Lucasfilm-organized ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù to its fans, though by the end of the opening ceremonies, a ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù family reunion of cast and crew, Fisher loomed largest. Princess Leia ruled over the Orange County Convention Center.  A large man in a knitted Leia side-bun wig rumbled past. Then Leia-themed T-shirts reading ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Mess With the Princess‚Äù and ‚ÄúRebel.‚Äù Fisher‚Äôs head, given David Bowie lightening bolts, adorned dresses. There were grandmothers and infants in white flowing robes. And at the reunion, the series‚Äô 40th, George Lucas‚Äò voice wavered for a moment, croaking out that Fisher was a ‚Äúmodern woman‚Äù; Billie Lourd, the actress‚Äò daughter, recited one of her mother‚Äôs ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù speeches as if it were prayer; and by the end, after Williams silenced thousands with a single finger and the Orlando Philharmonic finished Leia‚Äôs lilting theme, the sobs and sighs and sniffles could be heard in the dark.  Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd speaks at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando. Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd speaks at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando. SEE MORE VIDEOS  Which, if you‚Äôre Mark Hamill, also known as Luke Skywalker, and you‚Äôre hosting your own tribute to your movie sister, begs the question: What‚Äôs left to say about Fisher?  On Friday night, before a packed hall, Hamill, now 65, walked out and sat in a large fluffy chair and, without much of a warm-up or the usual welcoming niceties, just said:  ‚ÄúHere was something I was hoping wouldn‚Äôt come for another 30 years.‚Äù  He stared out at the silent audience.  He said he had been trying to deal with Fisher‚Äôs death in December. He said he wanted to be here to help him deal with it, that speaking to fans might be cathartic. He said she had been at every Star Wars Celebration and she would have been here again. He said that he looked up the definition of ‚Äútribute‚Äù and then, fumbling a bit, he just told stories.  Star Wars Celebration is being held in Orlando April 13-16, 2017.  When they were told by Lucas that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were actual twins, ‚ÄúI was stunned,‚Äù Hamill said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm five years older than Carrie. I said ‚ÄòWait a minute, if I‚Äôm Luke Skywalker from a moisture farm on Tatooine, does that make me royalty?‚Äô And without missing a beat, Carrie said ‚ÄòNo!‚Äô And I said ‚ÄòOK, OK, just asking!‚Äô‚Äù  He pointed out she had been Hollywood royalty, the daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, and he came from a middle-class family. But in fame, Hamill and Fisher were kin, destined to be forever remembered as pop creations, as contemporary mythology, but they embraced their destines with a wink and a boundless respect. Unlike Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo and never seemed comfortable by the intensity of the fandom (or the inevitability of being forever conjoined with a character), Hamill and Fisher made it fun and warm; indeed, you need only look as far as Hamill‚Äôs own Instagram account for evidence of an actor incapable of phoning in appreciation.  What he gave was a true eulogy, referring to notes and then, simply talking. It was a lovely ramble of a memorial. He said she was a joy to be around ‚Äúmost of the time,‚Äù that he could have never handled her as a girlfriend, that she helped find him an apartment once, that she would force him into crazy outfits and parade him around the studio lot and he would go along with it. He was generous and candid and intimate, a good mimic, a friend at the edge of his seat, recalling memories for a couple of thousand confidants.  MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR  There was that time shooting ‚ÄúReturn of the Jedi‚Äù and they were suspended on space bikes for hours when Fisher pulled out copies of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and a highlight marker, and read.  ‚ÄúI said ‚ÄòCarrie, why bring Kierkegaard onset when you have National Inquirer in your trailer?‚Äô She said, ‚ÄòBecause I want them to think I‚Äôm smart!‚Äô‚Äù  Fans dress the part at the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.  There was that time, more recently, when he suggested they pose with their wax figures at Madame Tussaud's in London and she never replied then posted a picture on Twitter posing with a wax Princess Leia. He complained to her, and said that he thought they would do it together and she said, dismissively, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a great idea, you should do that.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhen I read the script (for ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù) I thought nothing defines this princess more than this: We risk our lives and board this technical marvel of a Death Star and get her back to the Millennium Falcon and she says (looking at the ship), ‚ÄòYou came in that?‚Äô‚Äù  He said she was that person.  There were also tributes from Lucas, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, and new ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù director Rian Johnson and even Warwick Davis, who played an Ewok. But Hamill had the knowledge of a person that shapes how we remember a person. He believed she would have been a great older actress, and that there was a long time when they didn‚Äôt speak, and he never knew for sure when things were OK or not -- he likened it to being in a band that ‚Äúsupernovas‚Äù then breaks up for a while. He recited a few lyrics from the Kink‚Äôs ‚ÄúCelluloid Heroes‚Äù:  I wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show  A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  And celluloid heroes never really die  He said she was 19 when they met and he was ‚Äúa worldly 24.‚Äù Reading the statement he made after she died, his old Luke Skywalker yelp, there but rougher, cracked. He held a fist to his face, fighting tears, and said it was an honor to know her, ‚Äúmy beloved space-twin.‚Äù But he said that she promised, if he died before her, she would heckle his funeral. ‚ÄúWhen I think of her now, I think of her looking from the celestial stratosphere with her big brown eyes and that wry smile and... she lovingly extends a middle finger.  ‚ÄúAnd that was Carrie.‚Äù  cborrelli@chicagotribune.com  RELATED STORIES:  Fans thrilled and confused by 'Last Jedi' trailer  'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' trailer revealed at Star Wars Celebration  Complete Star Wars Celebration coverage from Chicago Tribune",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1351

The show is the original show in the Flip or Flop franchise.  Premise [ edit ]  The El Moussas were both real estate agents prior to the crash in 2008, and later they began flipping homes, mostly in Orange County, California.  In 2011, Tarek asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV. The friend filmed an entire episode of the process of house flipping from start to finish. The audition tape was sent to HGTV, and they were interested in talking to the couple. In 2012, HGTV signed the couple to a regular weekly program that shows the process of buying distressed property and renovating it.[2]  Christina's expertise is primarily in design, and she works with Tarek to find and renovate homes. She handles the designs of the new spaces and keeps everything on schedule. The show follows them as they buy homes, typically bank-owned, short sales or foreclosures, to renovate and resell.[3]  Hosts [ edit ]  Personal life [ edit ]  Tarek El Moussa grew up in Buena Park, California and Christina Meursinge Haack grew up in Anaheim Hills. Tarek, who earned his real estate license at age 21, met Christina while working in the real estate industry.[4] The couple were selling real estate in the Southern California area[5] when the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash; they went from living in a $6,000 per month home to a $700 per month apartment.[6]  The couple married in 2009 and have two children, a girl named Taylor Reese and a boy named Brayden James.[7]  In 2013, a registered nurse and viewer, Ryan Reade, contacted the network after seeing a lump on Tarek's neck during a Flip or Flop marathon. Tarek had previously had the lump examined, and he said there was no issue. After Reade contacted producers, Tarek had the lump checked again; doctors discovered that he had stage 2 thyroid cancer.[8] The El Moussas thanked Reade in a video that can be seen on HGTV.com.[9]  In May 2016, the couple had secretly split due to ""challenges"" in their marriage.[10] In January 2017, Tarek officially filed for divorce from Christina.[11]  Real estate career [ edit ]  Tarek and Christina run a real-estate agency, The El Moussa Group, in Orange County, California, an area with one of the largest foreclosure rates in the country. Tarek, Christina, and their partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment house in Santa Ana for $115,000. After selling the property for a profit of $34,000, the trio split the money and continued to flip houses, expanding their real estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.[12]  Series overview [ edit ]  Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 13 April 16, 2013 ( ) May 28, 2013 ( 2013-05-28 ) 2 14 April 8, 2014 ( ) July 8, 2014 ( 2014-07-08 ) 3 15 October 7, 2014 ( ) July 7, 2015 ( 2015-07-07 ) 4 15 December 3, 2015 ( ) March 24, 2016 ( 2016-03-24 ) 5 15 June 9, 2016 ( ) September 22, 2016 ( 2016-09-22 ) 6 15 December 1, 2016 ( ) March 30, 2017 ( 2017-03-30 ) 7 8 June 15, 2017 ( ) July 20, 2017 ( 2017-07-20 ) 8 TBA May 31, 2018 ( ) TBA  References [ edit ]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,710

Someone poured paint -- or something that looks like fake blood -- all over the President's plaque on the Walk of Fame.

It appears the swastikas from Wednesday morning had just been scrubbed before this latest incident.  Some guy vandalized Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with swastikas ... and we got him on camera doing it.  TMZ captured the crime in progress through our live stream feed on Hollywood Blvd., and you can see a man dressed in black bend down and scribble all over Trump's star.

We're told no one filed a police report about the vandalism. Of course, this is just the latest hit job the President's star has received over the past couple years.

Ben Affleck has become strangely evasive over his future as the DCEU's Batman after unconfirmed reports started circulating that he'd be stepping down from the role in the near future.  There's been something of a snowballing effect with rumours over the past few months, growing out of the shadows of Batman vs Superman's critical lashing, and reaching a new peak when Affleck stepped down as director of The Batman solo film.  War for the Planet of the Apes' Matt Reeves has since stepped in, essentially throwing Affleck's script out of the window and starting again. But what of Affleck himself?  ""Batman is the coolest f*cking part in any universe. DC, Marvel..."" he told fans in Hall H. ""I'm so thrilled to do it. I know there's this misconception that because I'm not directing it, maybe I wasn't enthusiastic about it. It's f*cking amazing... I would be a f*cking ape on the ground for Matt Reeves.""  However, off stage, his stance seemed less sure. ""My status remains what it always is,"" he told Entertainment Weekly. ""I‚Äôve done the two movies. I‚Äôve always intended on doing a third if Warners wants to make it. Certainly, if the Batphone rings, I will answer.""

According to Woman‚Äôs Day, Jolie has been a ‚Äúconstant fixture on the red carpet‚Äù recently and is ‚Äúpulling out all the stops to look simply stunning at every occasion,‚Äù but her ‚Äúflawless show-off is purely for Brad and Jennifer‚Äôs benefit.‚Äù The narrative suggests Jolie wants her estranged husband and his ex-wife to see how well she‚Äôs doing, even though she‚Äôs privately upset. ‚ÄúAnge is one green-eyed woman right now and can‚Äôt stand the thought of Brad spending time with Jen,‚Äù a so-called ‚Äúsource‚Äù is quoted as saying.  ¬© Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs seething even thinking about it,‚Äù the tabloid‚Äôs supposed snitch continues, alleging Jolie was ‚Äúalways petrified‚Äù Aniston would ‚Äúrear her head again.‚Äù In fact, the purported tipster claims Jolie would ‚Äúsquirm and spit venom‚Äù if she ever saw a ‚Äúglimpse‚Äù of Aniston‚Äôs name during her marriage to Pitt. The gossip magazine even contends ‚ÄúJennifer‚Äôs name was banned from the Jolie-Pitt household,‚Äù and asserts that with a ‚Äúromantic reunion [in] the cards between Brad and Jennifer,‚Äù Jolie‚Äôs ‚Äúbiggest fears could be realized.‚Äù  The outlet‚Äôs aforementioned ‚Äúsource‚Äù alleges, ‚ÄúThe very thought of Jen playing ‚Äòstepmom‚Äô to [her] kids‚Ä¶ makes her toes curl. She says it‚Äôs her worst nightmare, which she can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt let happen.‚Äù And so the publication claims Jolie plans on getting her ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù by proving Pitt ‚Äúgot back with Jennifer before they had officially broken up in 2016.‚Äù Explains the questionable insider, ‚ÄúAnge is convinced that proving they were talking before the split and uncovering their romance will give her more ammunition‚Äù in her divorce battle with the actor.  ‚ÄúShe hopes it will help her get full custody of the kids by exposing Brad‚Äôs ‚Äòirresponsible‚Äô behavior,‚Äù contends the ‚Äúsource,‚Äù prompting the tabloid to editorialize, ‚ÄúSounds like the war is about to get even messier.‚Äù But while Jolie and Pitt do still need to work out their divorce settlement, there is no ‚Äúwar‚Äù involving Aniston. In fact, Pitt and Aniston haven‚Äôt even seen each other in ages.  The suggestion that they were carrying on an affair in 2016 behind Jolie‚Äôs back, while Aniston was committed to her own husband Justin Theroux, is out-and-out fiction. Indeed, this entire story relies on false premises. Pitt and Aniston were not secretly engaged in a ‚Äúromance‚Äù during their respective marriages, and there‚Äôs no ‚Äúromantic reunion‚Äù on the horizon now. Therefore, Jolie has no reason to get ‚Äúrevenge‚Äù on the pair or drag Aniston into her divorce proceedings.  Furthermore, the notion that Jolie is only attending red carpet events to get Pitt and Aniston‚Äôs attention is ridiculous and false. In most cases, she has been at awards shows, such as the BAFTAs earlier this month, because her film First They Killed My Father was nominated. Other times, Jolie‚Äôs received special honors, like at the recent American Society Of Cinematographers Awards, and in other instances, she‚Äôs been invited to participate as a presenter. This all has nothing to do with Pitt and Aniston.

6dceb30a-286c-4d69-8b59-2c71543d29ae,"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have dated on and off since 2011. Christopher Polk/Getty Images  Justin Bieber recently announced his engagement to Hailey Baldwin.  This took many by surprise, especially considering Bieber's long history with Selena Gomez.  Much of the surprise, however, has crossed over into invasive speculation and unnecessary concern for Gomez's wellbeing.  Gomez is being inserted into a narrative she didn't ask to be a part of.  This is a trend with female celebrities whose exes move on ‚Äî largely because our society has difficulty recognizing that a woman can be happy alone and, in particular, without a man.  Where were you when you found out Justin Bieber got engaged? Correction: Where were you when you found out Justin Bieber got engaged to someone who is not Selena Gomez? I was minding my own business on the subway while mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. Suddenly, my thumb stopped and hovered over Bieber's Instagram post where he referred to his 21-year-old fianc√©e Hailey Baldwin as the ""love of his life."" I immediately sent the post to a handful of friends writing, ""Truly speechless."" My best friend wrote back, ""Doesn't that make you sad for Selena?"" My response? ""10000000%.""  Bieb's early music served as the soundtrack to my teen years. Who didn't listen to ""One Time"" on repeat while wondering how we got so #blessed with this shaggy-haired heartthrob? (OK ‚Äî maybe a lot of people, but I wasn't one of them.) I fully embraced the pop star who quickly became every teenage girl's dream guy, including a very famous one: Selena Gomez. So, yeah, when I found out Bieber was marrying Baldwin instead of Gomez, I couldn't help but feel bad for Sel. She clearly has a lot of love for her on-again, off-again ex. But isn't it a bit sexist to feel bad for a wildly successful woman just because her ex-boyfriend is marrying another woman? Why does she have to lose just because he wins?  Though I'm not the only person mourning the end of Jelena, nowhere in Bieber's lengthy Instagram post does he mention his ex's name ‚Äî yet media headlines about Bieber and Baldwin are littered with mentions of Gomez. From a Vogue beauty article that conjectures that Gomez's new hairstyle is because of her ex's engagement to E! News' in-depth feature about why she wasn't the woman for Bieber (sigh), Gomez is being inserted into a narrative she didn't ask to be a part of. Plus, let's not forget these gems of headlines: ""Inside Selena Gomez's New Life Without Justin Bieber,"" ""Selena Gomez's Post-Justin Bieber Engagement Makeover Includes New Hair and a Pointed Statement T-Shirt"" and the lovely ""Fans on Selena Gomez Watch in Wake of Bieber Engagement.""  Gomez and Bieber in their heyday. Craig Barritt/Getty Images  Look, I used to work for a celebrity tabloid, so I know the drill. When a big star gets engaged, you immediately check up on their exes and their relationship history. This isn't a new narrative, but it's a tired one. Don't believe me? Just look at what's widely considered to be the most controversial celebrity breakup of all time: Brad and Jen. Flashback to 2005, when Brad Pitt left Jennifer Aniston for his ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" costar, Angelina Jolie: And the reign of Brangelina began.  Of course, a media frenzy ensued after Aniston and Pitt's dramatic split, and fans declared themselves #TeamAniston or #TeamJolie. Everyone felt bad for Aniston, but it was like a car crash ‚Äî they just couldn't look away. Almost 13 years later, if we're being honest, we still can't look away from Aniston's love life. People say that they want to see the OG girl next door ""happy,"" but that's really code for ""coupled."" A guy can be single and revered ad infinitum (just look at George Clooney, pre-Amal), but a woman ‚Äî even a wildly successful and world-famous one, such as Aniston or Gomez ‚Äî needs a man to openly declare ""she's good enough! I'm marrying her!"" for the public to not think there's something wrong with her. It's the ugly truth.  That's why when Pitt and Jolie broke up in 2016 after nearly 12 years together, the world collectively gasped before turning to Aniston, waiting patiently for her next move. Was she happy that karma finally caught up to her ex? Did she want to get back together? Just like Gomez, Aniston had nothing to do with her ex's romantic news, yet she was mentioned in article after article. She was a major character in Pitt and Jolie's breakup, even though she was seemingly happily married to actor Justin Theroux.  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston in 2004; Pitt and Angelina Jolie in 2006. Evan Agostini/Bryan Bedder/Getty Images  It didn't matter that Aniston split from Pitt more than a decade ago and had moved on with her life. She was once again the source of speculation due to her ex's love life. Perhaps the most overt sign of this was the New York Post cover that featured a laughing Aniston with the headline, ""BRANGELINA 2004-2016."" The coverage was so unfair that think pieces started popping up coming to Aniston's defense. Entertainment Tonight published: ""Leave Jennifer Aniston Out of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce!"" Her soon-to-be estranged husband, Theroux, also came to her defense in the press.  After Aniston eventual split from Theroux, in February 2018, the world once again mourned her impending divorce, because God forbid one of the most successful actresses of our time dare to be single and childless. The ""Poor Jen"" narrative has been so rampant that mainstream media outlets even started calling each other out. Life & Style published an article with the headline ""Sorry, Jennifer Aniston! Justin Theroux Is Moving in with Emma Stone"" while the Daily Mail wrote, ""Why can't Jennifer Aniston find a lasting love?"" This type of coverage spurred The Guardian's article, ""I'm sick of 'Poor Jen' sexism on repeat. This is The One Where Aniston Was Just Fine and USA Today's ""It's time to leave Jennifer Aniston alone.""  Honestly, the likelihood that Aniston cares about her exes' love lives is slim, as is the likelihood that Gomez shed tears over Bieber's engagement to Baldwin. These women haven't inserted themselves into their exes' love lives, so why do we insist on doing it? Jelena came into existence in December 2010 after the young lovebirds were spotted holding hands. In the eight years since, they've broken up multiple times, written songs about each other and dated other people. Their relationship statuses have changed, but one thing has remained the same: the media's obsession with their relationship ‚Äî and their projection of Gomez's ""devastation"" every time Bieber starts dating someone else.  In 2016, Bieber had a brief romance with Sofia Richie (before her Scott Disick days) and just like now, the media was quick to paint Gomez as ""destroyed"" by her ex's new relationship. Hollywood Life published an article titled ""Selena Gomez Devastated Justin Bieber Is Finally Over Her & Into Sofia Richie,"" in which they called her ""hysterical"" and reported that she was ""constantly crying."" They wrote this even though Gomez had done absolutely nothing to back up these claims‚Ä¶ except fall in love with Bieber when she was a teenager.  So I can't help but fear that Gomez is in danger of becoming the Aniston of our generation. She was part of a celebrity power couple. She and Bieber had not just one but several public splits. And now he's moving on while she's still single. But why do we always assume that's a bad thing? Is it so far-fetched to think that Pitt wasn't the one for Aniston, even though they were married? Maybe Gomez and Bieber were first loves, but not forever loves.  I, for one, am tired of the media and the public turning women into victims just because their exes are moving on. As much as we all loved Jelena, their time came and went. So instead of speculating about Gomez's feelings about Bieber's engagement to Baldwin, let's just blast ""It Ain't Me"" and move on with our lives. Gomez sure is.

The former 1D singer introduced himself to Gigi at a Victoria‚Äôs Secret party and asked her on a date during their first meeting.

News reports, Prince William was surprisingly candid about the role his mother would play in his children‚Äôs lives if she were still around.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare.‚Äù  There is no doubt, he said, that she would love her grandchildren to the Moon and back. But William also said that she would spoil them rotten, much like your own grandmother likely did to you.  ‚ÄúShe‚Äôd come in probably at bath time, cause an amazing‚Ä¶ scene, bubbles everywhere, bathwater all over the place, and then leave.‚Äù  It may sound just like the normal parent/grandparent relationship to your ears. But coming from the Royal Family, that type of thing is borderline shocking.  Back when Prince William and Prince Harry were young boys, Princess Diana‚Äôs parenting style was hands-on to an almost shocking degree. Sure, she had nannies to do the ‚Äúheavy lifting,‚Äù such as changing dirty diapers and such. But her level of involvement with her sons was leaps and bounds more direct than that of any other Royal in history.  null  She openly and publicly showered them with affection. She took them to theme parks. She involved them in her personal causes. She let them wear jeans and baseball caps and eat at McDonald‚Äôs.  That type of hands-on parenting, typical for just about every last parent in the Kingdom but unheard-of for Royals, is now being practiced by William and Kate. Kate, for example, has been known to sit and supervise her children herself while her husband is here or there, doing royal duties. And of course, though she, too, has a team of nannies at her disposal, she‚Äôs been known to do much of the heavy lifting herself.  For William, it‚Äôs all about balance. His oldest son, Prince George, will almost certainly be the King of England someday, and there is no escaping that.  null  That means that George and his siblings won‚Äôt be able to avoid much of the trappings of royalty. For example, George‚Äôs younger brother, Louis, was baptized wearing a replica satin-and-lace gown that mirrored the one worn by Queen Victoria‚Äôs eldest daughter back in 1841.

It consists of eight episodes. The pilot opens with the discovery of the plastic-wrapped body of popular high school student Laura Palmer, an event which moves residents of the small town of Twin Peaks, Washington. Sheriff Harry S. Truman investigates Palmer's murder in conjunction with Dale Cooper, an eccentric FBI agent. As Cooper settles into his life in Twin Peaks, he meets the town's residents, who each prove bizarre and quirky in their respective ways. As the series progresses, the seemingly normal appearance of the town begins to fade, revealing various secrets that expose Twin Peaks as the disturbed, unsettling town that it is.  Season 2 (1990‚Äì91) [ edit ]  Before the season began, a companion book, The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer, was published. Some but not all of the diary entries mentioned during the season were in the book.[17]  The second season premiered on September 30, 1990, during the 1990‚Äì91 United States network television schedule. It consisted of 22 episodes. Lynch directed the first two, as well as the season's seventh episode (""Lonely Souls""), where Laura Palmer's killer is revealed. He also directed the season finale. In February 1991, Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, announced plans to put Twin Peaks on hiatus;[18] By May, Iger said ""it's unlikely that Twin Peaks will return"".[19]  The season continues Cooper's investigation of Laura Palmer's murder. He receives some clues from a mysterious ""giant"" that appears to him in a dream. A new murder leads to the discovery of Laura Palmer's killer. Later, Cooper is suspended by the FBI due to his participation in an unauthorized raid on the One Eyed Jacks casino. Cooper's former partner, Windom Earle, escapes from a psychiatric hospital and comes to the town for a confrontation with Cooper. As the town prepares for its ""Miss Twin Peaks"" contest, Cooper tries to uncover the secret of the Black Lodge with help from Sheriff Truman.  The Return (2017) [ edit ]  The third season[32] is a limited series set 25 years after the events of the season two finale. All episodes were written by David Lynch and Mark Frost.[7] The series was originally planned to have nine episodes, however, after re-negotiations between Lynch and Showtime, the episode order was doubled, with Lynch confirmed to direct all episodes.[33] The new series premiered on May 21, 2017, and consists of 18 episodes identified only by number. Each episode (except the first, ""Part 1"" and the last, ""Part 18"") featured a different musical guest playing live at the Roadhouse as the end credits roll.  Episode titles [ edit ]  For the original series, creators David Lynch and Mark Frost assigned no episode titles, only episode numbers. When the series aired in Germany, titles were assigned, which were then translated to English. The episodes are untitled on the DVD sets, but the titled episodes appear on the official Twin Peaks CBS website and on Netflix when streaming the episodes.[50] Episode 2, known as ""Zen, or the Skill to Catch a Killer"" is also known as ""Zen and the Art of Killer-Catching"". When episodes 29 and 30 aired in Germany, they were aired as a single broadcast, with only episode 30 being assigned a title. Fans then decided to title episode 29 ""Miss Twin Peaks"", which is how the episode is titled both on the CBS website and on Netflix. However, when episode 29 was re-run in 1996, it was assigned an alternate title which translated to ""The Night of the Decision.""[51][52]  Ratings [ edit ]  Twin Peaks : U.S. viewers per episode (millions) Season Episode number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 1 34.6 23.2 19.2 16.7 17.4 17.3 15.6 18.7 N/A 2 19.1 14.4 13.7 12.8 11.4 11.3 17.2 13.3 12.4 11.1 12.1 10.3 9.8 8.7 8.2 7.8 9.2 9.2 7.9 7.4 10.4 10.4 Audience measurement performed by Nielsen Media Research.

But then the drama went on to do something that few recent breakout freshman series have accomplished: it became an even bigger hit in Season 2, where it was the highest-rated entertainment broadcast series in the adults 18-49 demographic last season, with a 5.4 rating.  After avoiding the dreaded sophomore slump, This Is Us returns tonight for Season 3, and NBC‚Äîwhich won‚Äôt have the Super Bowl, Winter Olympics or Thursday Night Football to help inflate it this season‚Äîwill be counting on the show to help keep it on top in the 18-49 demo for what would be the third straight season.  Robert Greenblatt, in an interview before he announced yesterday that he was stepping down as NBC Entertainment chairman after seven years, said that This Is Us shows the power of broadcast TV, which is ‚Äúthe only place where you can gather a huge group of people together for a shared experience,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhen 12 to 14 million people watch America‚Äôs Got Talent in the summer, or more than that watch This Is Us in the fall or spring, that‚Äôs an extraordinary cultural achievement.‚Äù  While Greenblatt scuttled the show‚Äôs Thursday move last year after realizing the extent to which Thursday Night Football would disrupt the show‚Äôs narrative arc, he didn‚Äôt consider relocating the show to Thursday this season, after the network lost Thursday Night Football to Fox.  ‚ÄúWe felt, by this point, that it‚Äôs a Tuesday staple, for I‚Äôm happy to say a large part of the country. We also got some nice traction on Thursday with Will & Grace, and The Good Place is really coming into its own,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúSo we thought, rather than jumble the cards again, let‚Äôs keep a good thing going on Tuesday and let‚Äôs build more of a good thing on Thursday. We‚Äôre really excited about putting [Law & Order:] SVU on Thursday at 10, which is a great thing for that night also. There‚Äôs a lot to be said for stability on your schedule.‚Äù  As for how the show was able to avoid stumbling in Season 2, ‚Äúwe have extraordinary writers and [creator] Dan Fogelman is just the greatest sort of visionary,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen a creator who‚Äôs as far advanced in plotting a series than he is. He‚Äôs weaving in elements from seasons four, five and six, which haven‚Äôt even been completely conceived yet. But he knows where all these stories are going.‚Äù  Fogelman ‚Äúknew from the beginning of the first season what the second season was meant to be: the year of what happened to [Milo Ventimiglia‚Äôs character] Jack, and his death. We had the Super Bowl [last season] and we knew early on we were going to make that the ultimate episode in the middle of the season,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúSo there were a couple of things that came together that made Season 2 as anticipated as that first season was.‚Äù  NBC thinks the show‚Äôs momentum will continue this season. ‚ÄúI feel very bullish about Season 3 for a lot of reasons, which will remain sort of mysterious because I don‚Äôt want to give anything away,‚Äù said Greenblatt. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs some extraordinary things he‚Äôs going to do this year.‚Äù",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,694

It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 23 May 2017.[4] The song's accompanying music video was released on 2 June 2017.

Background [ edit ]  ""Strip That Down"" features a guest appearance from Quavo (pictured), from the Atlanta-based hip hop group, Migos  After One Direction went on a hiatus, Payne, who co-wrote songs on each of the group's five albums, intended to focus only on songwriting. He told Billboard:  To be honest with you, I wasn't going to do a solo venture. I was just going to go into songwriting and carry on and do that. But then I was like, 'You've been trying to do this since you were 14 years old. You would be ridiculously stupid to turn down the option to have a deal.' Coming out of the band, we had some pretty good opportunities around us. I had to do something.[5]  The singer met Ed Sheeran in London in late summer of 2016, ""We went in, sat around and discussed a bunch of things about life, and [the song] basically just came together,"" said Payne. After working with Sheeran and producer Steve Mac, Payne decided to add Migos member Quavo into the mix as the song's featured artist.[5] While talking about how that collaboration came together in an interview with iHeartRadio, Payne said; ""I was thinking, like rapper time, it was going to take two or three weeks.

Lyrically, the song contains themes of wealth, celebrity appeal and newfound career independence.[9] While talking about the song, Payne said; ""It just sets a few things straight, but then also the chorus is more about stripping back the music. I like to hear it loud sometimes, but sometimes you got to strip it back.""[6] For the concept of the song, Payne stated that they contemplated what Justin Timberlake would release as his debut solo single in 2017.[10]  ""Strip That Down"" contains an interpolation of 2000 single ""It Wasn't Me"",[11] written by Orville Burrell ""Shaggy"", Rikrok, Shaun Pizzonia, and Brian Thompson.

Therefore, they are also credited as songwriters.[12]  Critical reception [ edit ]  Rolling Stone staff called it a ""summer club banger"".[13] Writers from Billboard thought Payne ""seems to be aiming for a DJ Mustard/Tyga vibe,"" and concluded that ""the song's fun: The swaggering, Directioner-baiting pre-chorus especially, which is probably the JT-est thing any of the five members have done since going solo.""[14] Comparing it to One Direction's catalogue, Jordan Harris from Express and Star opined it ""is a lot more danceable, incredibly fun to listen to"" and added, ""Another similarity, and one which Liam would do well to use as a benchmark going forward, is the vocal style of Justin Timberlake.""[15] In Digital Spy, Laurence Mozafari wrote ""the song screams of trying to be grown up.""[16] Time magazine listed ""Strip That Down"" as one of the worst songs of 2017.[17]  Music video [ edit ]  On 18 May 2017, the lyric video for ""Strip That Down"" was uploaded to Payne's Vevo channel.

As the video transitions from black and white to colour, it shows Payne in a neon world of bright lights, dancing, and an appearance from featured artist Quavo.[19]  Reviewing the ""sleek, colorful"" clip, Rolling Stone staff wrote: ""Payne rocks gently in what appears to be the inside of tanning bed.""[13] In Digital Spy, Justin Harp opined Payne ""sheds One Direction's wholesome image in the sexy music video,"" and added, ""The promo clip does exactly what it says on the tin, as the former boybander demonstrates his newfound hip-hop vibe while slinking around with twerking back-up dancers.""[20] Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that the video is ""as awkward as the song"", saying: ""The Migos rapper appears completely at ease in his surroundings, while Liam looks like he accidentally wandered on to the set.""[21]  As of November 2018, the video has over 280 million views on YouTube, becoming Payne's first Vevo-certified music video outside of One Direction.

1830ce4b-aefc-4b96-b79d-a1f9767e3d92,"Bradley Cooper is set to make his directorial debut in A Star Is Born alongside Lady Gaga later this year. The musical, a remake of the 1970s drama starring Barbra Streisand (also a remake of the 1937 and 1954 versions) chronicles the life of a small-town girl who moves to the big city to become a star. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a has-been rock singer, to Gaga's Ally, the talented small-town girl in question. The plot will likely stay true to the original, showcasing the pitfalls and inevitable romance between Jackson and Ally along her rise to stardom.  Cooper recently opened up about his experience shooting the film, telling Vulture, ""[Gaga] said right from the beginning that there would be a barter. [She said] 'I'm gonna rely on you to get a performance that's honest out of me' [...] 'and I'm gonna make sure that you're going to turn into a musician. Because we're going to sing everything live.' And I went, 'Wait, what?'""  That's correct: Bradley Cooper will be singing live in the movie! Gaga reportedly told the 43-year-old actor that she wasn't a fan of movie stars lip-syncing to a prerecorded song in films. ""She's right!"" he agreed. ""[Singing live] was terrifying, and I really relied on her. I spent about a year and a half taking vocal lessons and preparing."" Even though the movie took only 42 days to shoot, Cooper revealed it took three years for him to fully get into character.  ADVERTISEMENT  ""The broken love story in A Star Is Born kept haunting me. Shots kept coming into my head. I would dream about it. I realized I had to [direct it], whether it fails or not,"" he shared. ""I knew I had to try, and I wound up absolutely loving it. You can't hide when you sing. The best way to express love is through singing and music. I knew if I could marry that in a way, it would be special.""  The film, which is slated to hit theaters on Oct. 5, has finally released its highly-anticipated trailer (above), where you can get a taste of Cooper's singing. To be totally honest? We're impressed.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,448

Trump met with Prince Harry, a former soldier and son of Princess Diana, who started the games in 2014. (Sept. 23) AP  Prince Harry met with first lady Melania Trump, who's on her maiden solo foreign trip as first lady, ahead of Saturday evening's Invictus Games opening ceremony. (Photo: Chris Jackson, Getty Images)  TORONTO ‚Äî Britain‚Äôs Prince Harry and U.S. First Lady Melania Trump met Saturday ahead of the opening ceremony of the royal's Invictus Games for wounded veterans, set for 7 p.m. ET.  ‚ÄúNice to meet you,‚Äù Harry said as he was introduced to Mrs. Trump and they shook hands. They stood together and smiled for the British and American news media before sitting in adjoining club chairs placed in front of their countries‚Äô respective flags.  The first lady sported a gray Dior pantsuit with a cropped hem, a look she has favored on many occasions.  Mrs. Trump‚Äôs decision to lead the U.S. delegation, whose members include Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, professional golfer Nancy Lopez and entertainer Wayne Newton, reflects the first lady‚Äôs ‚Äúutmost respect‚Äù for the hard work, courage and sacrifice of the U.S. military, said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump.  ‚ÄúShe feels strongly that they ‚Äî and their families ‚Äî should be honored every day,‚Äù Grisham said.  Grisham said Mrs. Trump also has ‚Äúgreat admiration for the role the games have played in empowering those who have been injured while serving.‚Äù  At a recent event marking the 70th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force, the first lady thanked the many military members who assisted thousands of people in Texas, Louisiana, Florida and the Caribbean whose lives were upended by recent hurricanes.  A native of Slovenia who became a U.S. citizen in 2006, Mrs. Trump also thanked service members‚Äô families.  ‚ÄúYou endure time apart, are expected to move when new orders come in, and face the uncertainty that can come in times of need,‚Äù she said at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, before introducing her husband. ‚ÄúThis kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of courage and your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated.‚Äù  Mrs. Trump has been slowly warming up to her new role, waiting to move to the White House until her 11-year-old son finished the school year in New York and holding few public events of her own. She accompanied the president on his three overseas trips so far this year.  Prince Harry, a military veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, established the Invictus Games in 2014 for sick and wounded service members and veterans from around the globe. More than 550 people from 17 countries are expected to participate in 12 sports during the coming week, ranging from cycling to wheelchair tennis to sitting volleyball.  London was the setting for the inaugural event in 2015, followed by Orlando, Florida, last year.  Mrs. Trump‚Äôs participation continues White House involvement with the games, which Harry launched during President Barack Obama‚Äôs tenure.  Jill Biden, wife of then-Vice President Joe Biden, led the U.S. delegation to London as part of a military initiative undertaken with then-first lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama helped open last year‚Äôs competition in Orlando.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yk4sPM",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,644
3eb8f7c6-0765-4bf1-8196-147ca8d1e729,"Taylor Swift is the queen of breakup songs. And songwriting in general, but especially breakup songs. Narrowing them down to the top 15 was difficult, but I think I've got them chosen from the least to the most heartbreaking.  1. Forever And Always  I feel this deserved to be mentioned since it's one of her most well known songs. Who could ever forget the song she wrong about Joe Jonas breaking up with her on the phone?  My favorite line: ""So here's to everything, coming down to nothing. Here's to silence that cuts me to the core.""  2. Haunted  This song is haunting, as the title suggests. The music in the background, her lyrics all add up to a breathtaking song.  My favorite line: ""He will try to take away my pain, and he just might make me smile but the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead.""  3. I Almost Do  This song is one of her saddest, but not because it's so heartbreaking as it is reminiscent of a past relationship. I think what's so upsetting about this song is that it's about a relationship that could possibly work again, but she's too afraid to get hurt.  My favorite line: ""I confess, baby, that in my dreams you're touching my face and asking me if I wanna try again with you, and I almost do.""  4. Wildest Dreams  This song isn't about a breakup per se as it is about a relationship that is going to reach its inevitable end. It's haunting and beautiful nonetheless.  My favorite line: ""Someday when you leave me, I bet these memories follow you around.""  5. You're Not Sorry  While I've always been a huge Taylor Swift fan, I first heard this song when she guest starred on CSI and I've loved it ever since.  My favorite line: ""Coulda loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold, and you've got your share of secrets and I'm tired of being last to know.""  6. Breathe  This is one of her more underrated songs, I think. This song was composed with Colbie Calliat and it's a masterpiece.  My favorite line: ""People are people and sometimes we change our mind, but it's killing me to see you go after all this time.""  7. Sad Beautiful Tragic  Another underrated song from her Red album. It's very sad, very somber, and very emotional.  My favorite line: ""Time is taking its sweet time erasing you.""  8. White Horse  Another Taylor Swift classic and one that's sure to hit you right in the feels. This one is sure to help anyone through a breakup, as it begins sad and heartbroken and ends with her realizing that she deserves to be treated better.  My favorite line: ""I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy-tale, I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well.""  9. Come In With the Rain  Underrated and one of my favorite. This track appears on her Fearless Platinum Edition and if she ever performed this live I would certainly die. In this song, she's tired of fighting for a broken relationship and instead is waiting on the love interest to make his move.    My favorite line: ""I've got you down, I know you by heart, but you don't even know where I start.""  10. The Last Time    Taylor performs this song on her Red tour with Gary Lightbody from the band Snow Patrol. This is a song anyone who has been in a back and forth relationship can understand. Taylor battles with letting in the guy who continues to hurt her and he battles with never staying yet desperately loving her.  My favorite line: ""You wear your best apology, but I was there to watch you leave.""  11. Cold As You  This will always be one of my favorites by Taylor. There aren't many words I can use to describe this song except the fact that, while I am not much of a crier, this one gets to me. Always.  My favorite song: ""You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray, and I stood there loving you and wished them all away. And you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.""  12. If This Was A Movie  This comes from the deluxe edition of her Speak Now album. I find that many of her bonus track songs are some of her best and underrated, and this is no exception. This is a song where Taylor compares her love life and what would happen if life was indeed a movie, to the harsh reality of the life we are dealt and how relationships don't always work.  My favorite line: ""I know people change and these things happen but I remember how it was back then, wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin', cause nothing like this ever happened to them.""  13. Dear John  Ah, the song Taylor so blatantly wrote about her ex John Mayer. This is a song where Taylor calls John out for the terrible way he treated her she recognizes that she maybe should have listened to everyone who told her he was a bad idea. But hindsight is 20/20 and when you're in love it's hard to see past how in love with them you are, even if they are bad for you.  My favorite song: ""Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame, or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away,"" or ""You are an expert at 'sorry' and keeping lines blurry, never impressed by me acing your tests.""  14. Last Kiss  If you've heard this song, it needs no explanation. And if you haven't heard this song, go listen to it. Now.  My favorite line: ""I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed. You can plan for a change in the weather and time, but I never planned on you changing your mind.""  15. All Too Well  My favorite Taylor Swift song ever happens to be her saddest, in my opinion. This song paints a vivid picture of the wonderful beginning of a relationship all the way to the bitter end, when you're left alone with the memories and the heartbreak.  My favorite line: ""Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much, but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up,"" or ""You call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest.""",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1325

(The other two were Luann DeLesseps and Bethenny Frankel, both of Bravo's Real Housewives franchise. Jen ... we're concerned.)  Given that Jen chose Scott over any of the women in the Kardashian clan, it's not surprising that certain tabloids already have these two bedding down together.  It's also not surprising that some of these same publications are casting Kourtney in the role of the insane ex:  According to the Australian version of OK! magazine (because why wouldn't news about three American celebs reach Sydney first?), Kourtney is pissed about the possibility of Jen and Scott hooking up.  In fact, Kourt has reportedly warned Lawrence to keep her mitts off her boozy baby daddy.  The subtly-titled piece ‚ÄúKourtney Warns J. Law: Stay Away From Scott!‚Äù doesn't offer anything in the way of quotes or evidence, and instead poses an argument along the lines of ""makes sense if ya think about it.""  The article also doesn't mention the fact that Kourtney is dating Younes Bendjima.  Or that Scott is with Sofia Richie.  Or that Jen was clearly joking, and her ideal dinner party would really just consist of Meryl Streep playing three different roles.  Look, we believe Jen when she says she genuinely enjoys Keeping Up With the Kardashians (though it's worth noting that she's said she watches the show ""to fall asleep."" Celebrities--they're as bored with the Kardashians as the rest of us!).  But there's a difference between enjoying a reality show and wanting to enmesh yourself in that world.  We like watching Naked and Afraid, but the thought of a single genital mosquito is enough to keep us inside for the bulk of 2018.  Hey, if the mere mention of Scott Disick doesn't bring to mind a bloodsucker who will spread disease to your nether regions, then you're not sufficiently wary of the Lord.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,498
62ea1ccb-1c06-4870-ad50-ea199a46cca4,"  Rumors of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West getting a divorce are highly exaggerated. The superstar couple are still married.  According to Gossip Cop, OK! Australia recently published an issue with the headline ""Kim & Kanye: It‚Äôs Finally Over! Divorce Papers Signed!"" The cover even showed documents, claiming they proved the divorce. But one never happened.  In fact, the documents on the cover are actually from Kardashian's 2004 divorce from her first husband, Damon Thomas. They are in the public record, so the documents can be easily obtained on the web.  The content in the report is exactly the same as what appeared in In Touch Weekly.That issue included a supposed quote from Kardashian, ""Kanye's not the man I fell in love with."" The cover also claimed West broke down in tears and Kardashian took their three children to live with her mother, Kris Jenner.  At the time the two reports were published, both OK! Australia and In Touch were owned by the same company, Bauer Media. As of July 1, In Touch is owned by American Media Inc., the publisher of Us Weekly, Radar Online and the National Enquirer.  In Touch claimed that Kardashian was pushed ""over the edge"" after they went to Paris in June. A source told the magazine Kardashian was upset after seeing West hug Virgil Abloh at the Louis Vuitton fashion show. But if Kardashian was upset, she did not show it publicly. In fact, she retweeted a video of the scene, adding a heart emoji.  The trip was emotional for Kardashian, since it marked her first time in Paris since she was robbed there in October 2016.  The tabloid report also claims Kardashian told her family she was leaving West after his infamous remarks about slavery to TMZ and his tweets. In reality, Kardashian publicly supported her husband. Later, West did admit he thought Kardashian would leave him.  ""There was a moment where I felt like after TMZ, maybe a week after that, I felt like the energy levels were low, and I called different family members and was asking, you know, 'Was Kim thinking about leaving me after TMZ?'"" he told The New York Times last month. ""So that was a real conversation.""  West also referred to Kardashian's decision to stick by him in his son ""Wouldn't Leave,"" in which he raps, ‚ÄúTold her she could leave me now/But she wouldn‚Äôt leave.‚Äù  West and Kardashian have been married since 2014 and share three children, 5-year-old North, 2-year-old Saint and 6-month-old Chicago.

Royalty is 2 and has 5 times more money than Soulja Boy already. I'd be mad too.""  The ""Grass Ain't Greener"" singer also slammed Soulja Boy for dragging Rihanna, 28, into the spat, saying, ""This s‚Äìt is beneath me.

1526b407-cc5c-40c6-a48a-93ad8351bc16,"(WENN) -- Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner have reportedly agreed on a settlement in their divorce.    According to editors at TMZ, the estranged couple has been locked in a complicated and time-consuming battle over their property, which has prevented their divorce from becoming final.  Ben and Jennifer did not have a pre-nuptial agreement in place, so all their earnings during their marriage had to split equally.  The superstar couple, who split in 2015 after 10 years of marriage, share three children - Violet, 12, Seraphina, nine, and Samuel, six.  Sources told the gossip site that the final settlement will be filed with the court once Gone Girl star has finished his stay in rehab.    The 46-year-old actress showed up at Ben's Pacific Palisades home in California on Wednesday afternoon and allegedly begged him to get help for his ongoing alcohol abuse issues. She told waiting photographers to give the couple privacy, and said ""it was not a good time"".  Jennifer was then spotted leaving with the actor/director and a person believed to be a sober coach and drove Ben to an unnamed rehab facility.  Friends of the star tell Page Six Ben has been ""struggling"" with sobriety since breaking up with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus, and it was photographs obtained by The Blast showing him taking a delivery of alcohol that reportedly forced his ex to take action.  In recent days, the Justice League star has been linked to 22-year-old Playboy playmate Shauna Sexton.  Despite the fact they split in 2015, Jennifer and Ben have remained close, but the double Oscar winner was noticeably absent from his estranged wife's Hollywood Walk of Fame star unveiling ceremony on Monday.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,311

You can apply them any year, at any time, as Markle intended. The resolutions she listed (we‚Äôll go over those next) coincide with her future goals as a member of the royal family.  Markle‚Äôs bucket list, of sorts, is relatable and, unsurprisingly, as down-to-earth as the former actress and philanthropist appears.

He pleaded guilty in May to transferring obscene material to a minor and agreed not to appeal against a prison sentence of 27 months or less.  Weiner, 53, quit Congress in 2011 over a sex scandal and was again exposed in his 2013 run for New York mayor.  His lawyers had asked a US District Judge for probation instead of jail.  But in sentencing Weiner, US District Judge Denise Cote said: ""This is a serious crime that deserves serious punishment.""  She also said Weiner ""has a disease. He has a compulsivity. Some say a sex addiction.""  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption As a New York City mayoral candidate, Anthony Weiner confronts a heckler  Acting Manhattan US Attorney Joon H Kim said in a statement that Weiner ""asked a girl who he knew to be 15 years old to display her naked body and engage in sexually explicit behaviour for him online"".  ""Justice demands that this type of conduct be prosecuted and punished with time in prison.""  In addition to jail time, Weiner was sentenced to three years of supervised release, according to a statement from the US Attorney's Office.  Weiner's lawyers contended the former politician had acted out of the ""depths of an uncontrolled sickness"" and was now seeking treatment.  In a letter to Judge Cote, Weiner said he felt ""profound"" regret for his crimes and that his misconduct had ""crushed the aspirations"" of his wife, Huma Abedin, and ruined their marriage.  Ms Abedin filed for divorce on the same day as her husband was found guilty in May.  She did not attend the sentencing, but asked for leniency on their son's behalf in a letter to the judge.  Image copyright Reuters Image caption Anthony Weiner (L) and Huma Abedin split last year  The FBI began investigating Weiner last September after the Daily Mail reported that he had exchanged obscene messages with a North Carolina teenager.  The 15-year-old girl said he had asked her to undress on camera.  A month earlier, Ms Abedin announced she was separating from her husband after it emerged he sent a photo of himself in his underpants with his toddler son nearby.  The New York Post reported that Weiner had sent sexual messages along with the photo to an unidentified woman in 2015.  Once a rising Democratic star, he stepped down from Congress in June 2011 after a graphic image sent from his Twitter account went public.  Initially claiming his account was hacked, he eventually confessed to having lied.  Weiner also admitted indulging in explicit online exchanges with at least six other women and pledged to seek therapy.  He tried to revive his political career in 2013 by running for mayor of New York.  But his campaign imploded amid reports of further graphic online messages.  The investigation into Weiner's sexting case played a role in last year's 2016 presidential election, when authorities found emails on his laptop from Ms Abedin, who was a senior aide to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.  A separate FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's private use of email while she was secretary of state was closed after officials said nothing incriminating was found.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,634

Before Meghan adopted him in 2015, he was going to be put down by a shelter in Kentucky after he was discovered in the woods but no one wanted to take him home, according to The Guardian.  He was then taken in by Dolores Doherty, who runs A Dog's Dream Rescue, an Ontario-based charity that saves beagles on the kill list in the US and brings them to Canada for refuge.  After Guy traveled a 500-mile journey to the border, Doherty brought him to an adoption event just outside Toronto, where Meghan was living while filming Suits. Surely enough, Markle turned out to be one of the hopeful dog owners at the event.    Guy has moved to London with Meghan, a Kensington Palace rep confirmed in November. Markle's other dog, Bogart, couldn't make the trip across the pond due to his old age, The Guardian adds.  Queen Elizabeth II with one of her corgis in 1970 Getty Images  A love of dogs is something Markle shares with her grandmother-in-law, who's known to be very fond of corgis. Just last month, Her Majesty's last corgi, Willow, passed away at the age of 14. Perhaps hanging out with her new four-legged friend, Guy, has helped fill that hole.  Markle also instantly connected with the Queen's dogs, saying they laid happily at her feet during tea when she first met them. ‚ÄúFor 33 years, [I‚Äôve been] barked at, and this one walks in, and absolutely nothing, just wagging tails,‚Äù Harry recalled in their first interview together.

9646f30f-25e8-4b50-9cc1-984532f27014,"Report claiming Queen Elizabeth gave Michelle Obama a ""brutal beatdown"" or that Barack Obama ""stalked"" Prince Harry on Twitter is fake news.  A fabricated story that Michelle Obama tried to ‚Äúsneak a spot‚Äù on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs wedding guest list is untrue. A blog called Just News USA claimed that Queen Elizabeth ‚Äúdelivered a brutal beatdown‚Äù to Michelle for trying to wormhole her way to being one of the exclusive guests at the royal wedding, which is to be held over Memorial Day weekend in 2018.  The website also alleged that Barack Obama ‚Äúpractically stalked‚Äù Prince Harry on Twitter, sending a message of congratulations to him ‚Äúwithin seconds of the [engagement] news coming out,‚Äù which ‚Äúperhaps had an undertone of letting the royals know that he and Michelle were available that day to attend.‚Äù It went on to claim that the former president posted a number of ‚Äúdesperate‚Äù tweets to Prince Harry in an effort to score a place on the guest list. The article added that the queen ‚Äúroyally snubbed‚Äù Barack and Michelle Obama‚Äôs attempts to attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs wedding.  Gossip Cop reports that the only shred of truth to the the website‚Äôs story is that Barack‚Äôs congratulatory message to Prince Harry was soon after the wedding announcement. He wished the prince and Meghan Markle ‚Äúa lifetime of joy and happiness‚Äù on Twitter. The message was in no way a massive hint to the royals that he and Michelle were ‚Äúavailable‚Äù to attend their wedding ceremony. Just that alone is false because Harry and Meghan‚Äôs wedding date hadn‚Äôt yet been revealed until two days after their announcement.  The claims made by Just News USA that Michelle Obama tried to ‚Äúsneak a spot‚Äù on the wedding guest list is largely viewed as ludicrous, especially since no other details are offered regarding Queen Elizabeth‚Äôs ‚Äúbeatdown‚Äù of her.  Story About Queen Elizabeth Giving Michelle Obama ‚ÄúBeatdown‚Äù Over Prince Harry Wedding Invite Is Made-Up https://t.co/X3FQsNnLc9 ‚Äî Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) December 4, 2017  As Gossip Cop reports, if the Obamas get invited to the royal wedding, it‚Äôll be for other reasons ‚Äî such as being good friends with Prince Harry. It won‚Äôt come as a result of desperate pleas on social media. The article is characterized as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù by the site that often debunks rumors and other made up stories about celebrities. The site will probably be correcting a number of inaccurate articles between now and when the royal wedding is held next year. All of the commotion about who‚Äôs going to be included on the ultra exclusive guest list will be talked about for months to come.  It‚Äôs unknown if Barack and Michelle Obama will attend Prince Harry and Meghan Markle‚Äôs wedding, but speculations suggest they‚Äôll most likely be on the guest list.

fea9aefc-3667-4ebe-af6a-0eb17a008794,"She Is Cait. The first episode for Caitlyn Jenner's brand-new E! docuseries, I Am Cait, shows the former Olympian continually moving along in her transition from male to female, with the support of close friends and her famous family members.  Us Weekly rounds up the top five moments from the premiere, screened to press in NYC and L.A., on Tuesday, July 21, including revelations like Caitlyn's friendship with Kris' former best friend Ronda Kamihira, her mom's reaction to her debut as a woman, as well as Kanye West's thoughts on her societal impact.  PHOTOS: Caitlyn Jenner's journey through the years  1. Who Is Ronda Kamihira?  After Caitlyn (previously known as Bruce) finalized her divorce last fall, the former decathlete stepped out with her ex's longtime best friend and former assistant Ronda Kamihira ‚Äî and it was rumored that they were dating. A source told Us at the time that while Kamihira and Caitlyn attended an Elton John concert together, joined by Brandon and Leah Jenner last October, it was unclear whether they were actually a couple.  In the debut episode, Kamihira's relationship with Caitlyn is fully revealed, and it's not romantic at all. She is introduced as Caitlyn's assistant and her close friend, and the two share a surprising bond. Caitlyn says in her docuseries that she began confiding in Ronda about transitioning close to two years ago. Ronda even helped her pick the name ""Caitlyn.""  PHOTOS: Celebs' coming out stories  2. Esther Jenner Meets Caitlyn for the First Time Ever  Esther Jenner ‚Äî Kylie, Kendall, Brandon, and Brody's maternal grandmother ‚Äî has continually voiced her public support for Caitlyn, even prior to the star's sit-down interview with Diane Sawyer, during which the athlete confirmed, ""For all intents and purposes, I am a woman.""  In the first few scenes of I Am Cait's premiere, Caitlyn is seen nervously pacing at home, because her sisters and her mother are on their way over. This is the first time the family has been all together in a whopping four years, and Caitlyn is fretting because Esther has yet to meet Cait. She wonders how she should sign her mother's birthday card ‚Äî as Bruce or as Caitlyn? (Spoiler alert: She ends up signing it as Caitlyn).  When the family arrives, Cait says to her mom, ""It's okay, it's okay."" Esther replied, ""I knew it would be,"" as the entire clan hugs in the entryway. In her one-off with the camera, the Jenner family matriarch has sweet notes about Cait's new appearance. ""I think he's a very good looking woman,"" Esther muses. ""He's still Bruce. I love him so much."" While making an effort, she admits that the transition will require ""a lot of getting used to."" They also meet with a therapist, who helps facilitate a larger conversation with the family. ""I really want to learn more,"" Esther repeats throughout the episode. ""I need to understand more""  In another scene, Caitlyn's mom tears up as she discusses how ""it's not easy"" getting used to the newfound identity of her child. The supportive mom gets visibly emotional. ""You have the same soul you were born with,"" she notes to Cait.  PHOTOS: Kardashian Christmas cards through the years  3. Kylie Sees Caitlyn for the First Time Ever ‚Äî Via FaceTime!  Caitlyn's youngest daughter Kylie, 17, sees her for the first time ever as a woman via FaceTime. The teen, who graduated from high school this past week, is waking up from anesthesia in a dentist's chair when she sees Cait in her female form. ""You look so pretty!"" Kylie gushes, still slightly out of it from her operation.  Later, Kylie comes over to see her in person and puts teal ombre hair extensions (from her own line, ha!) in Cait's hair. Kendall's younger sister says she was Google-imaging snapshots to figure out the best color scheme.  After Kylie leaves, Cait expresses how excited she is about her daughter being accepting and gracious. Cait tells her sister that Kylie never really wanted to come by before, and she's glad that she finally did.  PHOTOS: How Kylie has evolved  4. Kim and Kanye Make a Brief and Memorable Cameo  The superstar couple's brief appearance in the premiere is marked with their usual antics ‚Äî Kanye West gives a very sincere and philosophical statement, while stepdaughter Kim Kardashian pulls some tricks in the closet.  ""What's up,"" the rapper says to Caitlyn as he gives her a hug. West then tells Cait that she's ""changing society in the most meaningful way,"" adding that what the former Olympian did was ""one of the strongest things that have happened"" in her entire lifetime. ""You're a celebrity, your daughter is a supermodel, and you're saying this is who I am.""  Meanwhile, Kim brings some comic relief to the episode as she raids Cait's closet and sifts through her newly revamped wardrobe. The Vogue cover girl largely approves most of the items in Cait's closet with the exception of one maxi dress. Caitlyn has a lot of items from Diane von Furstenberg and Tom Ford that the designers themselves have sent over directly.  ""I love this Tom Ford dress,"" Cait tells North West's mom. Kim then notes that Kris has the same Tom Ford dress in a different color. The two joke about setting the momager up for a ""Who Wore It Best"" (shout-out to Us Weekly!). Kim jokes that she'll invite Cait over when Kris is in the dress.  PHOTOS: Caitlyn Jenner's best style moments ‚Äî so far!  5. Caitlyn Meets With the Family of a Trans Teen Who Committed Suicide  Last, but certainly not least, the most somber part of the episode featured Caitlyn meeting with the family of a young transgender boy named Kyler, who tragically committed suicide. Caitlyn, who confessed at one point in the episode that she contemplated suicide, then attends a memorial with Kyler's friends and family. Together, the group releases memorial balloons on the beach in San Diego.  BONUS!  The previews for the second episode include several juicy tidbits, including one scene where Candis Cayne asks Cait if she wants to go on a date. Another moment features a miffed Kim telling Cait, ""You don't have to bash us on your way up.""  Tune in to the premiere of I Am Cait on E! on July 26 at 8 p.m. ET.

b38ef9f5-d876-4c1e-ac1e-21004859645d,"The NBC revival addressed the absence of two beloved actresses who appeared on the show during its original run.  [Warning: This story contains spoilers from Thursday's episode of Will & Grace, ""Rosario's Quinceanera.""]  Will & Grace said goodbye to one of its most beloved characters on Thursday.  Thursday's tearful episode of the revival saw the death of Karen's longtime maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison) following a heart attack. When Karen & Co. went to visit an then-ailing Rosario in the hospital, Karen promised to throw her a quinceanera when she was discharged because Rosario's mother had never given her one.  However, Rosario died in the hospital soon thereafter from complications and Karen then turned the funeral for her longtime sidekick into ‚Äî yup ‚Äî a quinceanera.  ""We knew that we weren‚Äôt going to have Shelley anymore and so the character wasn‚Äôt going to be on the show,"" co-creator Max Mutchnick tells The Hollywood Reporter. ""As writers, it just presented us with a situation that was too interesting to not explore and to write.""  Giving Rosario a funeral also allowed the show a chance, as co-creator David Kohan put it, ""to give her a proper sendoff.  The creators, who also serve as showrunners, revealed in August that Morrison would not be returning for the revival after appearing in all eight seasons of the show's original run. During her 68-episode run, Morrison not only played Karen's maid and BFF but also Jack's (Sean Hayes) wife when they married to secure a green card in season two.  Although Morrison appeared in the first cast reunion, the 2016 ""Vote Honey"" video created to support Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, she had otherwise retired from acting. Her last onscreen appearance was in a 2006 episode of My Name Is Earl that aired seven months after the Will & Grace series finale. She continued doing voiceover work until 2012.  When it came to write Rosario out of the series, Mutchnick and Kohan said they told Morrison about their plans to kill Rosario off ahead of time.  ""To deal with Karen dealing with death and how that character would manage herself and how she would ultimately have a moment of truth in dealing with it ‚Äî that was too rich of an area for us to not write and so we went for it,"" Mutchnick says. ""As we suspected, Megan Mullally delivers a tour-de-force performance in this episode.""  Thursday's episode also addressed the December 2016 death of Debbie Reynolds, who appeared in 10 episodes of the show's original run as Grace's mom, Bobbi Adler. Eagle-eyed viewers might have noticed Reynolds' appearance in previous episodes of the revival, specifically in a photo of her and Messing in character that was featured prominently in Will and Grace's apartment in the new episodes.  Thursday's episode revealed that Reynolds' character had passed away some time before the events of the revival. In Thursday's episode, Grace (Debra Messing) tried to console Karen by talking about her mother's death.  ""I get what you're going through. When my mother died, I was a wreck. On the day of her funeral, my sister had to dress me. I couldn‚Äôt even do my own blowout and I really wanted pretty hair for my mom, you know? But I made it and everyone said how brave I was and how pretty I looked and everyone said how proud they were of me,"" Grace said as she started to cry. ""It doesn‚Äôt change how much it hurts.""  However, in the end it was Will (Eric McCormack), not Grace, who was able to get through to Karen with the simple act of a hug. Although Karen had missed nearly the whole funeral to drown her sorrows at a nearby bar, she went to the church and said an emotional goodbye to Rosario.  ""Sorry I wasn‚Äôt here, but come on, what the hell was I going to say?"" Karen said. ""She was my maid. She was my sparring partner. She was my best friend. You were my everything, Rosario Yolanda Salazar.""  ""People keep asking, 'What do you need? What do you need?' I need for you to not be gone,"" she continued as she gave Rosario a ring from her hand, a family heirloom that previously belonged to her mother.  ""It was actually a very emotional night and it was something that we took very seriously. There was a hush on the stage the two times that Megan delivered her goodbye to her best friend,"" Mutchnick recalls. ""It was something that I will never forget and one of the best nights I've ever had on the stage of making this show. It was an incredible thing to witness and highly emotional.""  Will & Grace airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on NBC.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,935

There was a strict no-photos policy, though, so we're unlikely to see any snaps on social media.  News of Schumer's relationship with Fischer broke in November 2017, when they were spotted dining together at Caf√© Altro Paradiso in New York.  View this post on Instagram Yup A post shared by @ amyschumer on Feb 15, 2018 at 8:53am PST  Fellow comedian, Bridget Everett, told Us Weekly in December that her best friend Schumer was in a new relationship. She said, ""I won‚Äôt say anything other than I‚Äôm happy that Amy‚Äôs very happy.""  Schumer appeared to confirm her relationship with Fischer by sharing photos of him on Instagram, including this snap of them kissing at Ellen DeGeneres' 60th birthday party:  Us Weekly reports that Fischer's sister is Schumer's assistant, so that's likely how the couple first met. Fischer runs his family's Beetlebung Farm in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, Massachusetts, and released the award-winning The Beetlebung Farm Cookbook: A Year of Cooking on Martha's Vineyard in 2015.    Prior to getting married, Schumer dated Ben Hanisch, who she met on a dating app in November 2015. The relationship ended in May 2017.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,354
eabfc104-c8d0-4bd1-9d3a-23f0296b402c,"If you're rooting for John Cena and Nikki Bella to get back together, then it sounds like a certain WWE Superstar is right there with you. When John Cena opened up about his and Nikki Bella's breakup on the Monday, May 14 episode of TODAY, he told Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford that he still loves his ex-fianc√©e.  The Blockers star said,  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been incredibly reflective, which is amazing, but it‚Äôs very difficult. I had my heart broken out of nowhere ‚Äî or, for me, it was out of nowhere ‚Äî and anyone who's experienced that knows that it comes with a series of bad feelings. I‚Äôve looked at myself every day, and I‚Äôve tried to evaluate myself every day, and the woman I love. For anyone out there speculating on what I‚Äôm doing with my life now: I still love Nicole. I would still love to marry Nicole. I still would love to have a family with Nicole.‚Äù  That ""I still would love to have a family with Nicole"" line should throw Total Bellas and Total Divas fans for a loop. Cena has been adamant about not wanting kids for years, while Bella has made it pretty clear that she‚Äôd like to settle down and start a family. This point of contention came up over and over again on both E! reality shows, and the WWE power couple never seemed to get to the same page. Many speculate that this failure to see eye to eye might've fueled their breakup. But now they may finally be on the same page about kids but also broken up? Oof, how's that for crummy timing.  TODAY on YouTube  Cena and Bella began dating in 2012, and as Total Divas and Total Bellas fans know all too well, the topics of marriage and children were recurring issues in their relationship. Bella hoped to wed and have kids with Cena, whereas Cena wasn't on board with either. But then, Cena apparently changed his mind on the whole marriage thing and proposed to Bella at WrestleMania in 2017. Their wedding was scheduled for May 5, but the pair announced their breakup on April 15.  Cena told Kotb and Gifford that he is neither happy about being single nor interested in being in a relationship with anyone other than Bella. He said,  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want anybody else. I love Nicole. And I‚Äôm really trying to support her in her trying to find whatever it is that she wants that made this fall apart in the first place ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt have any other hopes, other than maybe one day, we can work it out.‚Äù  Meanwhile, Bella spent Monday morning at the NBCUniversal upfronts. She did not see Cena's latest TODAY appearance, but she heard all about it when Extra filled her in during the upfronts red carpet. After hearing that Cena said he wanted to be with her and start a family with her, Bella replied, ""Wow, I'm speechless."" But is it a good speechless, bad speechless, or a ""we're totally getting back together please don't spoil anything"" speechless?  E! Entertainment on YouTube  When E! News chatted with her at the upfronts, the WWE Superstar said that watching her and Cena's relationship unravel on the upcoming season of Total Bellas will ‚Äúbe definitely very hard to relive,‚Äù but she did not want to cut it from the show. She told E! News, ""I feel like I would be cheating [the viewers] if I was to take away all that footage because it's real life.""  Bella added,  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already seen some of the episodes and I‚Äôm watching myself and I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄòOh, my gosh.‚Äô I think a lot of people are going to be able to relate to it and it‚Äôs also going to give a lot of people courage and bravery to speak up. I think sometimes we go through things because we‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòOK, this is what we need to do. It‚Äôs too late.‚Äô It‚Äôs never too late to make a decision, so. Yeah.‚Äù  But does this mean she's done with with Cena for good? Maybe not.  E! Live from the Red Carpet on YouTube  Like Cena, Bella seems relatively open to possibly getting back together at some point down the line. She told E! News,  ‚ÄúJohn is the love of my life. He‚Äôs absolutely an amazing man. I‚Äôm so lucky to have these amazing six years with him. There‚Äôs some of us that we hope that in the end it can work out. I just think the most important part is you want to make sure live the rest of your life happy. You don‚Äôt want people to force things or have to change themselves so much. And so those are the things we‚Äôre just stepping away and seeing what we both really want out of life, and when we come back together will it make us happy for the rest of our life? We both don‚Äôt want to live in regret. So we‚Äôre being very mature, which is great ‚Ä¶ So we‚Äôll see.‚Äù  And the gossip magazines sure think a reunion may very well be in the tea leaves. Last Tuesday, Us Weekly reported that a source claimed Bella has been ‚Äúspending nights‚Äù with Cena at his place. And last Monday, a source claimed to People that the WWE Superstars are ‚Äúon a path to reconciliation.‚Äù  Keep those ""You can't see me"" fingers crossed for Cena and Bella to do whatever makes both of them happy for the rest of their lives.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1105
72a3f9eb-815c-436c-aa81-8d2437731576,"Fake news and fake history of family separation  Straight talk  By George H. Rodriguez  The liberal Washington Post is joining the chorus of pro-one borders, pro-illegal immigration groups that are upset that illegal alien families are being separated by immigration officials. They write an emotional opinion piece that manipulates historical facts.  Writer DeNeen L. Brown says America has a history of separating children from families. She uses Native American and black slave children as examples to compare to illegal alien children being separated from their illegal alien parents. But the differences in these three situations are great. How can anyone but a liberal blinded by misguided sympathy ignore the facts?  Native Americans did not come to the U.S. illegally from a foreign country. The policy of separating children from their families was terrible because they were American and they had not done anything wrong. Blacks were forced to come to the U.S. chained to ships and forced to work without pay or benefits. They had committed no crime other than to be a different skin.  Illegal aliens are foreigners who are not forced to come to the United States. They come willingly and, because of their decision, receive legal help, shelter, and food upon arrival and the detainment, even though they broke immigration laws. Illegal aliens make their own decision to travel to the U.S., endangering themselves and their children ‚Äî the result of breaking immigration laws is the separation of children and families. That‚Äôs the same as anyone who commits a crime, especially if they have children along with them when they commit the crime.  This seems to be another liberal media effort to make America look evil for protecting and controlling its borders.  What part of the word illegal don‚Äôt Ms. Brown and the Washington Post understand? Illegal aliens come here willingly and of their own decision, bringing and endangering their children. That was not the case with Native American and black slave children.  The ‚Äúhumane‚Äù solution is to deport the entire family quickly. We cannot continue to excuse and reward illegal immigration, and we cannot allow our nation to turn into the world‚Äôs orphanage for illegal alien children.

Samantha Bee, the host of TBS' Full Frontal With Samantha Bee, on Thursday afternoon issued an apology for using a vulgarity to refer to first daughter and White House adviser Ivanka Trump on her Wednesday night show.  ""I would like to sincerely apologize to Ivanka Trump and to my viewers for using an expletive on my show to describe her last night,"" Bee said. ""It was inappropriate and inexcusable. I crossed a line, and I deeply regret it.""  Bee's comment came at the end of a segment about the Trump administration's harsh treatment of illegal immigrants. She told Trump to ""do something about your dad's immigration practices"" and called her a ""feckless c‚Äî.""  The remark quickly became a political football, with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders taking the unusual step of formally blasting Bee in a statement. Sanders called the comment ""vile and vicious.""  TBS supported the host's apology on Thursday with a statement of its own: ""Samantha Bee has taken the right action in apologizing for the vile and inappropriate language she used about Ivanka Trump last night. Those words should not have been aired. It was our mistake too, and we regret it.""  Autotrader.com announced plans to suspend sponsorship of Bee's show. ""The comments expressed by Samantha Bee were offensive and unacceptable and do not reflect the views of our company,"" the brand said on Twitter.

A Little Havana plot near Marlins Park ‚Äì the home of the city‚Äôs baseball team ‚Äì was felled by Miami's hatred for the Marlins Park venue.  In January he announced he had finally found his site, in the Overtown district. But the area, described by the Miami Herald in December 2016 as ‚Äúground zero‚Äù for the city‚Äôs opioid crisis, was soon deemed unsuitable.  On Thursday, with his deep-pocketed business partner Jorge Mas beside him, he unveiled his fifth plan ‚Äì a $1 billion (¬£760m) project to be called Miami Freedom Park, involving the leasing and redevelopment of the city-owned Melreese golf course near Miami International Airport. The plan would include the construction of a 25,000-seat stadium, plus restaurant and retail space, office buildings, hotels, athletic fields and a public park.  In addition to the privately-funded construction, Beckham's group would also pay $4-5 million in annual rent for the 73 acres of land, as well as state, county, city and school board taxes, reaching an estimated total of $44 million.  His presence in the city on Thursday was celebrated by football fans, with hundreds trying to pour into the city commission meeting. But it was lamented by golf aficionados, deeply concerned at the loss of the city‚Äôs only public course.  Even sports stars turned against Beckham.  Ray Allen, a former star of the basketball team Miami Heat, urged people to sign a petition against Beckham‚Äôs plan, arguing that it will mean the end of the city‚Äôs First Tee youth golf programme.  ‚ÄúMelreese has an awesome First Tee program that is ran out of this course that really teaches young children the game of golf and gives them a public place to play,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúNot to mention all the great tournaments and events the course hosts.

The agonising wait for Beckham was prolonged by Ken Russell, chairman of the commission, a man who was perceived as the swing vote among the deeply divided group. He criticised the Beckham group for not conducting any outreach in the neighbourhood immediately east of Melreese. He then sought verbal assurances from them on issues from the replacement of lost park space, to the question of who would pay for cleaning up contaminated soil.  He also wanted assurances that workers on the project would be paid a living wage.  ‚ÄúWe can continue to negotiate,‚Äù said Mr Russell. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm not ready tonight.‚Äù  A new hearing was set for 10am on Wednesday.  Francis Suarez, the mayor of Miami who has spoken passionately in favour of the referendum, expressed his frustration with the commission‚Äôs decision to defer the vote.  ‚ÄúI really wish they would‚Äôve made a decision tonight,‚Äù he said, in comments surely echoing Beckham‚Äôs own thoughts. ‚ÄúSo then we could have moved to the next phase.‚Äù",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,635

507d9254-7167-4d59-9a1d-e0de044609a4,"Update: Michael Phelps defended his Shark Week finale episode that left some viewers lukewarm on Sunday. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way ‚Ä¶ I thought it turned out incredible,‚Äù he said.  The much-hyped race between Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps and a great white shark was anticlimactic to some, because the man and fish did not actually race, as the channel suggested.  The ‚Äúrace‚Äù constituted Discovery Channel calculating the speed of a great white shark (over 100 meters) and superimposing shark footage over Phelps. The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark‚Äôs natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.  Phelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark. The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than C√©sar Cielo‚Äôs 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore.  Regardless of Phelps‚Äô abilities, Discovery‚Äôs perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers‚Äô sentiments. After the race, comments like the following appeared to be the major takeaway:  Turns out ‚ÄúMichael Phelps races a shark‚Äù was really just ‚ÄúMichael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark‚Äôs time.‚Äù ‚Äî Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) July 24, 2017  Me pretending to be ok with Michael Phelps not racing a real shark pic.twitter.com/QnCF98NfBB ‚Äî Gabi Palamone (@Yo_Gabi_Gabi__) July 24, 2017  Michael Phelps not racing a real shark is like being sold Kanye tickets and then watching a Kanye hologram perform ‚Äî Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) July 24, 2017  ‚ÄúAll the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn‚Äôt a side by side race,‚Äù said a spokesperson from Discovery to Rolling Stone. ‚ÄúDuring Michael‚Äôs pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of ‚ÄòPhelps vs. Shark,‚Äô this message was clear.‚Äù  Michael Phelps also defended the race while taking questions on Facebook Live. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you feel that way ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs hard to swim in a cage when you‚Äôre next to a shark ‚Ä¶ It wouldn‚Äôt be able to move at the right speed.

But the couple is calling a truce, for the sake of their 6 children. The ex couple released a joint statement late last night which will seemingly end the back-and-forth drama in their Hollywood divorce. √¢¬Ä¬úThe parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues,√¢¬Ä¬ù the statement said. √¢¬Ä¬úThe parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.√¢¬Ä¬ù Basically this means the couple is going work together, but it also means we won√¢¬Ä¬ôt be in the loop going forward, which isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt necessarily a bad thing for the couple. This new statement comes after a judge initially denied Brad√¢¬Ä¬ôs request for privacy in his custody battle. Last month the actor asked for the custody documents to be sealed, but they were not. Angelina√¢¬Ä¬ôs lawyers felt Brad only wanted to protect himself and not the childrens√¢¬Ä¬ô well-being.

So my health is something I have to monitor.‚Äù  Taking it a step further, she describes how her body is doing.  ‚ÄúI feel sometimes that my body has taken a hit, but I try to laugh as much as possible,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe tend to get so stressed that our children feel our stress when they need to feel our joy. Even if you are going through chemo, you need to find the ability to love and laugh. It may sound like a postcard, but it‚Äôs true.‚Äù  Now that Jolie doesn‚Äôt have any acting or directing projects on the table and her kids are getting older, she will refocus her time.  ‚ÄúI think now I need to rediscover a little bit of the old me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI think we lose our way a bit.

The chief was not pleased. Turned out, Amelia‚Äôs consult was with Geena Davis‚Äô Herman, who cracked that she and Arizona looked swell before admitting that she was still blind as an earthworm. At the coffee cart, Maggie clarified that she and Jackson were attending the wedding together ‚Äî sort of their first public outing as a couple. Shortly, Matthew came in on an ambulance ‚Äî he‚Äôd rolled his car and was in rough shape. OK, so now we knew for sure who April‚Äôs ride had been. But where was she?!? While Jo revealed that she and Alex had a cake-tasting with Kepner at 11, an ambulance raced back to the scene of Matthew‚Äôs accident, Owen in tow. At the site, he spotted April unconscious, her lower extremities apparently chilling in a frigid lake. At that very moment, Mer was back at Grey Sloan asking Jackson if he knew where his ex was. When she received Owen‚Äôs text, she elected not to fill in Avery, as he was about to go into surgery. By the time the ambulance arrived at Grey Sloan, Owen reported that April was hypothermic, with no pulse and no vitals, and an EMT added that they had no way of knowing how long she‚Äôd been down. ‚ÄúI think we lost her,‚Äù said another EMT. ‚ÄúNo, we didn‚Äôt,‚Äù replied her friends almost in unison.  While Mer paged Maggie, Bailey explained to the interns that they had to raise April‚Äôs temperature before they could try to jump-start her heart. The team accomplished that by working to pump blood through her body manually. An hour later, with Mer and Maggie still at it, Pierce urged her half sister to tell Jackson. When she ran into Alex in the corridor and he mentioned his appointment with April, Mer burst into tears. (She wasn‚Äôt the only one!) In the O.R., as docs took turns pumping blood through Kepner, Alex admitted that he‚Äôd hated her at first, because he‚Äôd wanted to be more like her. Nurturing, caring, all that good stuff, she just was naturally. ‚ÄúYou gotta stop saying ‚Äòwas,'‚Äù Mer told him. Nearby, Richard operated on Matthew, whose spleen wasn‚Äôt looking so good. To feel like she was doing something, anything, Bailey pitched in. ‚ÄúThis boy must be cursed,‚Äù Webber sighed. He might be onto something there, too. Jackson was fresh out of surgery and informing Jo that he was basically broke when he overheard Casey say they needed all the blood to save Kepner‚Äôs life. Not the way he should‚Äôve found out.  ‚ÄòDON‚ÄôT TAKE APRIL, PLEASE‚Äô | Bursting into the O.R., Avery learned that April had been there for three hours. Nothing to do but wait. ‚ÄúAnd pray,‚Äù said Owen, asking everyone to do what April would‚Äôve wanted and pray for her. From there, the group waited to see any sign of a heartbeat in April, and Maggie, eventually convinced that she had, began using the EKG paddles on her over and over. Finally, Pierce actually did get a rhythm, and they ‚Äî and we ‚Äî breathed a huge sigh of relief. In recovery, Matthew came to and immediately asked about April. At that very moment, Amelia was noting that Kepner‚Äôs brainwaves were slow and irregular. As soon as Arizona found out what had happened, she rushed into her friend‚Äôs room and explained that April and Matthew had been seeing each other again for months. They‚Äôd even fallen back in love. Soon, Ben arrived and was welcomed with a huge hug by Bailey. Overnight, it appeared, April‚Äôs friends sat at her bedside. At this point, to my relief, I was thinking, ‚ÄúOK, she‚Äôs gonna pull through!‚Äù But then it seemed for an awful instant like she was basically brain-dead. Tearfully, Jackson told April that he didn‚Äôt just want to believe she was still there, he would believe it. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do whatever you want,‚Äù he then told God. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take her away, OK?‚Äù And at that second, she squeezed his hand ‚Äî ever so gently ‚Äî and opened her eyes. Lord, what an emotional roller coaster! As Amelia reported that April‚Äôs reflexes were good, Kepner related that she remembered calling 911, feeling warmer and warmer and safer‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúAnd then I was here,‚Äù she said, delighting in pointing out to Jackson that ‚Äúyou prayed for me, and it worked.‚Äù She quickly added that she hadn‚Äôt died and come back ‚Äî that was Jesus‚Äô jam. Before they all left her to get some rest, April thanked Owen. ‚ÄúYou always come and bring me back,‚Äù she said. Later, April thanked Maggie, too, for saving her life, and at last she was reunited with Matthew.  ‚ÄòSO YOU DID BRAIN SURGERY WHILE YOU NEEDED BRAIN SURGERY?‚Äô | During Amelia‚Äôs consult on Nicole‚Äôs case, Grey Sloan‚Äôs former Head of Fetal Surgery complained of headaches and dizziness. She also revealed to Arizona that she‚Äôd been keeping tabs on her career and was eager to catch up. Ticked at having been abandoned by her teacher, blind or not, Robbins didn‚Äôt appear quite so keen to. When Arizona revealed to Herman that she was going back into peds and leaving behind fetal surgery, her former mentor balked that that was unacceptable. After Nicole‚Äôs scan, she ordered Arizona not to even consider quitting fetal surgery. ‚ÄúAfter blind school, I hit a rough patch,‚Äù Nicole said by way of explaining why she‚Äôd ghosted Robbins. ‚ÄúI went very, very dark.‚Äù But hearing what Arizona had been up to had excited her ‚Äî Herman had succeeded in downloading into Robbins her whole brain! It made her realize that she could teach and create a whole lot more Arizonas. And ‚Äúthat saved my life,‚Äù she said. At the same time, Amelia feared that Nicole‚Äôs tumor was back, but she just couldn‚Äôt find it, damn it. If the tumor was back, Amelia resolved, she was telling Herman that she‚Äôd had a tumor when she operated on Nicole. During a spinal tap on Herman, Arizona and DeLuca learned that Nicole didn‚Äôt have a tumor. When Amelia then tried to refer Nicole to Koracick to have her shunt put in, Herman revealed that she‚Äôd overheard ‚Äî while in Tom‚Äôs bed! ‚Äî all about her former doc‚Äôs huge, honking tumor. Left alone with Arizona, Herman told her that she‚Äôd just gotten a grant and wanted to move forward with the Robbins Herman Center for Women‚Äôs Health and launch Arizona‚Äôs cart program. ‚ÄúCould we do it in New York?‚Äù Robbins said. ‚ÄúWe could do it wherever you want,‚Äù Nicole replied before asking Arizona to warn her the next time she‚Äôs lunging in for an embrace.  ‚ÄòIT‚ÄôS GONNA BE SO BEAUTIFUL‚Äô | As the episode came to a close, Betty confessed to Amelia that she hadn‚Äôt really been clean for six days and had been too high to miss her son. She‚Äôd only come home because she‚Äôd been cold. Not surprised, Amelia took her straight to a meeting. When Jackson passed by the chapel on his way out of the hospital with Harriet, he couldn‚Äôt help but stop in to say a silent thank you. At home in bed with a snoozing Ben, Bailey appeared to be mulling something over, something big. Jolex looked forward to their wedding; Mer, realizing how lucky she was to have once pulled through a trauma that had been chillingly similar to April‚Äôs, took a sweet gaze at Derek‚Äôs Post-It wedding vows before placing his cap on top of them in her drawer; and Kepner and Matthew recovered with their hospital beds pushed up against one another.  So, how did you handle ‚ÄúCold as Ice‚Äù? Relieved much? And since April survived, what do you make of Ellen Pompeo‚Äôs remark that the finale is ‚Äúnot easy‚Äù?

Kim Kardashian has always been the one from the Kardashians siblings who still tried to be a part of the life of their ex-stepdad, Caitlyn Jenner. However, it appears that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now taking a step back, especially when it comes to Khloe Kardashian‚Äôs feud with the former Olympian.  Khloe Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner used to have a really close relationship, especially when the former‚Äôs dad passed away and the latter took over as the reality star‚Äôs father figure. Unfortunately, their bond was ruined when the 68-year-old retired Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete transformed into a woman and started to talk badly about the Kardashian clan.  Since the 33-year-old TV personality will be welcoming her first child with Tristan Thompson soon, many wondered, including Ross King of the ITV show Lorraine, if this will mend her broken relationship with Caitlyn Jenner. When asked if the arrival of her baby will ‚Äúaffect things‚Äù with her former stepdad, Khloe Kardashian replied that things will remain as they were.  Although Khloe Kardashian didn‚Äôt exactly say that she will keep the child away from Caitlyn Jenner, a Hollywood Life source claimed that Kim Kardashian supported her sister‚Äôs decision to not make the I Am Cait star a part of her child‚Äôs life.  ‚ÄúKim is standing behind her sister and she will always have her back,‚Äù the insider revealed. ‚ÄúTheir family still feels slighted by Caitlyn about what she said about Kris in her book and they‚Äôve really rallied around Kris.‚Äù  However, Gossip Cop noted that Kim Kardashian‚Äôs loyalty to her family is old news.

Here‚Äôs what went down: Tran‚Äôs lawyers notified the court seven days in advance that she would be unable to attend the hearing in person due to work obligations, and instead planned to participate via phone. Gossip Cop has learned that at the hearing, Brown‚Äôs camp tried arguing for a dismissal, on the grounds that Tran should have given 12 days‚Äô notice, not seven.  As Gossip Cop reported, Tran obtained a temporary restraining order against Brown in late February, accusing him of harassing her, assaulting her, and threatening to kill her. The model-actress‚Äô best friend LaCour was also awarded a temporary restraining order after making similar allegations. Both are now seeking to get permanent stay-away orders against the singer.

ABC‚Äôs fan favorite, fantasy drama Once Upon a Time is getting a major creative reboot in Season 7, along with a batch of fresh, new faces. Both Gabrielle Anwar (Burn Notice) and Dania Ramirez (Devious Maids) have signed on as full-fledged series regulars, while Adelaide Kane (Reign), Mekia Cox (Chicago Med), and Rose Reynolds (Poldark) have been given recurring roles.  As of now, details about the five latest additions are scarce, but expect some new information to trickle down at the Once Upon a Time panel at Comic Con San Diego.  Clearly, things weren‚Äôt looking so good for the show after it lost key cast members Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Dallas, Emile de Ravin, Jared Gilmore, and Rebecca Mader in a rather shocking casting shake-up. We‚Äôll just have to wait and see if the show‚Äôs newest additions can fill in the void left by these beloved characters.  tumblr  As shown in the Season 6 finale, the forthcoming season will revolve around a very grown-up Henry (played by The Walking Dead‚Äôs Andrew J.

Patridge called the Irvine Police Department on Sept. 6 after she stated in court papers that Bohan had been harassing her. After the investigation, the evidence was presented to the Orange County District Attorney‚Äôs office which, after review, rejected the case.  ‚ÄúThe prosecutor reviewed all of the information provided by the Irvine Police Department and, unfortunately, the prosecutor did not feel that they would be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" a spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney‚Äôs office told ET on Monday.  Patridge's rep tells ET in a statement, ""Audrina is putting on a brave face, but these exchanges between Audrina and Corey are court ordered to take place at a police station for her protection. There is still a family law domestic violence case open.""  Corey Bohan Responds to Audrina Patridge's Restraining Order as She Requests He Be Forced Out of Their Home  Patridge and Bohan tied the knot last November after dating on and off since 2008, and share 1-year-old daughter, Kirra. Patridge filed for divorce on Wednesday, citing irreconcilable differences, and listed her and Bohan's date of separation as Sept. 6. According to court documents obtained by ET, two days prior to filing for divorce, Patridge requested a temporary restraining order against the Australian BMX rider for an alleged domestic violence incident. A judge in Orange County, California, granted Patridge's request, ordering Bohan to stay 100 yards away from her. Bohan was granted monitored visitation of Kirra, and their next hearing is set for Oct. 6.  ""Audrina‚Äôs No. 1 priority is her daughter and she asks for privacy at this time,"" Patridge's rep told ET at the time.  On Saturday, the 32-year-old reality star broke her silence about the divorce drama, posting a video of Kirra on Instagram.  ""Light of my life.

652c8b2b-2a79-4bf5-bb6b-49d11992bd8d,"The murder of Jason Hudson occurred on October 24, 2008, when 29-year-old Jason Hudson and his 57-year-old mother, Darnell Donerson, were discovered shot to death inside Donerson's home in Chicago, Illinois.[1] The victims were the brother and mother of singer Jennifer Hudson. Jennifer's seven-year-old nephew Julian King, the son of her elder sister Julia Hudson, was initially reported missing and an AMBER Alert was issued; Julian King's body was found on October 27 in Chicago's West Side area, in a parked car matching the AMBER Alert description.[2] Autopsy results indicated that Julian King's death was due to ""multiple gunshot wounds.""[3] A pistol found in a West Side vacant lot was confirmed as the murder weapon by Chicago police.[4]  Investigation [ edit ]  On the day that the bodies of Hudson's mother and brother were discovered, Chicago police took Julia Hudson's estranged husband William Balfour, 57, into custody but did not file charges against him.[5] Balfour was on parole and spent nearly seven years in prison for attempted murder, vehicular hijacking and possession of a stolen vehicle. The Illinois Department of Corrections' records reveal one of Balfour's addresses to be the home where Donerson and Jason Hudson were murdered.[1]  After the Chicago police had held Balfour for the maximum 48 hours allowable without charging him with a crime, he was held by the Illinois Department of Corrections on a parole violation.[5] At the November 10, 2008 parole hearing, the prisoner review board was told by the Cook County State's Attorney's office that Balfour's current or former girlfriend told investigators she saw Balfour with a gun identical to the murder weapon several days before the murder occurred.[5] Board chairman Jorge Montes said that although Balfour may have violated other conditions of his parole, including failing to get anger management and substance abuse counseling, the gun allegation alone was sufficient to hold Balfour until a December 3 hearing before the full Illinois Prisoner Review Board.[5]  Montes said that the allegations from the woman included that Balfour had admitted to her that he was involved in the murders, but those allegations were not part of the parole review hearing.[6] Balfour appeared at the hearing without an assigned attorney because he had not been charged with a crime.[5]  Arrest and Conviction [ edit ]  On December 1, 2008, Balfour was arrested and charged with three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Donerson, Jason Hudson and King, as well as one count of felony home invasion.[7] At a December 3 court hearing in which Balfour was denied bail, a prosecutor alleged that Balfour had committed the murders out of anger that his estranged wife was dating another man.[8] Balfour's attorney Joshua Kutnick said that his client maintained his innocence in the crimes.[7] Balfour was indicted on December 30.[9] On January 20, 2009, he pleaded not guilty to all charges.[10] He was convicted in May, 2012 and sentenced to 3 life sentences plus 120 years.  Legacy [ edit ]  In the aftermath of the deaths, Hudson's family announced the creation of the Hudson-King Foundation for Families of Slain Victims, a foundation ""to care for the needs of families who have lost relatives to a violent crime,"" according to a statement released to the press.[11]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,658
54fb0935-464e-44a2-b1a7-126021109944,"And now, there‚Äôs her hugely anticipated single titled ‚ÄúWork.‚Äù It‚Äôs about working for a paycheck no matter what else is going on in your life. It is also, of course, designed to get her that paycheck. You might call the way it goes about attaining this goal brazen for anyone else but Rihanna: Tempting accusations of boringness, hackiness, and crimes against art, the song offers a hook that practically parodies pop‚Äôs love of repetition‚Äîand then repeats it, a lot. But there‚Äôs something fascinating about the tune, something that elevates it beyond ringtone status. It doesn‚Äôt really go anywhere. It approximates what work feels like.  The producer Boi-1da‚Äôs bright, bubbly beat creates a see-sawing sensation out of a few sounds. A keyboard ping anchors the downbeat and then climbs up, up, down, down, returning to its starting point. Electronic notes on the low end burble out a more asymmetrical pattern recalling reggae, but they too have the general shape of ascending and descending. The percussion is subtle, rendered with a skittering sound that recalls the shaking of a kettle. When Rihanna‚Äôs voice comes in, so do some signifiers of ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s dance and rap: digital handclaps, distorted shouting. It all adds up to the feeling of a lot of bustling in one spot‚Äîactivity, but not necessarily movement.  Rihanna‚Äôs hook conjures a different kind of monotony. After a few quick notes in yet another up-and-back pattern, she gets stuck, like a needle in a groove, for ‚Äúwork work work work work.‚Äù There‚Äôs no stopping this getting in your head. ‚ÄúWork‚Äù becomes ‚Äúdirt‚Äù becomes ‚Äúlove‚Äù becomes ‚Äúturn,‚Äù but the modulations don‚Äôt matter‚ÄîRihanna has found her next great nonsense syllable, another ‚Äúooh na na‚Äù or ‚Äúella ella eh.‚Äù Her singing in the verses, where she dresses down some guy who isn‚Äôt meeting her expectations, is actually rather pretty. I‚Äôve seen a lot of commenters say she‚Äôs copying the mumbling trend that‚Äôs taken hold among younger pop vocalists like Ariana Grande, but the truth is that Rihanna helped popularize the notion of liquifying words in the name of catchiness.  As for Drake‚Äôs verse, it strikes me as pretty terrible‚Äîthe disappointed lounge singer schtick from ‚ÄúHotline Bling,‚Äù but without the silken melody or sense of surprise. ‚ÄúIf you had a twin I would still choose you‚Äù is the only real attempt at a memorable line. Whatever. Drake being as popular as he is right now will be yet another incentive for radio playlist makers to keep this song in rotation, possibly giving it the activating energy needed to become a hit.  And to be sure, it will need a good deal of exposure to reach the success levels of Rihanna‚Äôs previous smashes. The song‚Äôs undeniably catchy, but it also has a strangely unfinished quality. To me, though, that‚Äôs its charm. The verses, choruses, and bridge mostly bleed into each other, forgoing soft-to-loud explosions or exciting rhythmic changes. Boi-1da does create some sense of escalation‚Äîanother drum beat for the second chorus, flashes of flutes, autotuned harmonies, and far-off piano. But the shifts are subtle and fleeting. Unlike a lot of radio pop, ‚ÄúWork‚Äù is about small modulations, a singer and a producer and a rapper plugging along as we all must do. At the end, the song makes the unfashionable move of simply fading out. Rihanna put in her three and a half minutes of work; now pay her what you owe her.

dca74922-9d2c-48d1-bfd9-0329302b98e8,"One of the weirdest TV stories of the year has been 13 Reasons Why season 2. The original run of the Netflix original was one of the most talked-about series of the year, often by fans who loved it, sometimes by critics who lamented how it handled its tough issues like suicide and rape.  But season 2 has come and gone with‚Ä¶almost no buzz at all. It was a very, very strange phenomenon. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever seen a show go from all anyone could talk about to a complete void of coverage for its sophomore season, yet that‚Äôs exactly what happened with 13 Reasons Why.  The theory was that, perhaps, after a relatively conclusive ending to season 1 (13 episodes, 13 tapes, the end), that simply no one was watching the second season. But that appears not to be the case as Netflix has announced today that yes, 13 Reasons Why is returning for season 3. They also gave these details alongside the announcement:  Production on the new season will resume later this year. The new season will premiere in 2019.  Season 3 will have 13 episodes.  Brian Yorkey will be returning as the series' creator and showrunner.  Brian Yorkey, Joy Gorman, Mandy Teefey, Kristel Laiblin, Tom McCarthy, Steve Golin and Selena Gomez are returning as EPs.  The new season will be produced by Paramount Television and Anonymous Content for Netflix.  Despite being a huge fan of season 1, I still have not watched season 2 yet. Partially because I just finished up a big move and didn‚Äôt have time, but also because I heard that‚Ä¶it wasn‚Äôt very good. Season 1 has an 80% from critics on RottenTomatoes while season 2 has a 28%. I have read a number of rants from critics and fans alike about the decisions made in season 2, but I suppose I am going to have to just watch it for myself to fully make up my mind.  While Netflix does tend to bring shows back more often than rival networks, considering it doesn‚Äôt care about viewership all that much, it must have faith in the series and it must see that it does have a loyal fanbase, even with the drama, or lack thereof, surrounding season 2. 13 Reasons Why also has the benefit of essentially being‚Ä¶a bunch of kids walking around a high school, as opposed to some of Netflix‚Äôs more high cost projects from Altered Carbon to The Crown. It also probably helps that the entire cast is made up of relative unknowns, though by season 3, I hope these kids are getting something of a pay bump, as Netflix clearly sees value in them.  There‚Äôs also a teaser trailer for 13 Reasons Why season 3 you can check out below. If you watched season 2, are you excited for another season?  Follow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

The ""Missed Calls"" rapper and Grande split back in May after about two years together.

""Like the whole thing is a little strange, but it's not negative.

And it's that simple, you know?""  Kevin Mazur/Getty Images  The rapper said he purposely stayed away from social media -- but not because of the breakup. Instead, he wanted to focus on his highly-anticipated forthcoming album, ""Swimming,"" out Aug. 3.

""So, you know, people have assumed that I'm ... 'Are you OK? Is everything OK?'""  ""Because I was about to drop the album,"" he said. ""I don't know, it just all seemed kind of unimportant, the need to show people I was OK. Like, what is that? Where does that come from? Why?

But when asked on Watch What Happens Live, he acknowledged he regretted the tattoo: ""The answer is yes. Absolutely. That was a horrible idea.""  ""You know, don't let a 47-year-old man without his reading glasses tattoo you,"" Kinnaman added ""That is the life lesson.""  Despite that regret, he admitted he received exactly what he asked for in the end. ""It's supposed to be a shitty tattoo,"" he said, ""so that's what it is.""  Suicide Squad 2 is expected to see return Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg, Will Smith as Deadshot, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Jared Leto as The Joker and Viola Davis as Amanda Waller.

c6446fed-cb9f-4741-8964-0ff7c9088e7b,"GULLIVER recently wrote about a pet that suffered a grizzly end after it was not permitted to fly. Spirit Airlines refused to allow a hamster on board as an emotional-support animal and it ended up being flushed down an airport toilet. But sometimes it is more dangerous for an animal to be permitted to ascend to 35,000 feet. Particularly, it seems, if it is flying on United Airlines.  On March 12th, on a flight from Houston to New York, a United Airlines flight attendant knowingly stowed a French bulldog in the overhead compartment, where it died, the family that owned the dog alleges. United quickly apologised to the family for what it called ‚Äúa tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin.‚Äù The airline promised an investigation ‚Äúto prevent this from ever happening again.‚Äù  Get our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.              But on United, things like this seem to happen again and again. Last year, a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel died in a United plane‚Äôs cargo hold when the flight was delayed on the tarmac‚Äîalso in Houston‚Äîfor two hours. Most infamously, a giant rabbit called Simon travelling from London to the Iowa State Fair died on a United flight, possibly freezing to death because it was subjected to cold temperatures or placed next to dry ice. A week of headlines in British tabloids, such as ‚ÄúNow United‚Äôs killing fluffy bunnies!‚Äù, left its reputation in one of its most valuable foreign markets in tatters. And on March 14th, United fessed up to yet another blunder, this time flying a German Shepherd dog from Oregon to Japan instead of its intended destination, Kansas City in Missouri.  In fact, according to data from America‚Äôs Department of Transportation, United was far more dangerous to fly on as a doggy or bunny last year than any other airline. Some 18 animals perished on United flights, compared with two each on American, Delta, and Alaska, and zero on all other airlines tracked by the department. Some 13 animals were also reported injured on United flights; no other airline had more than one injury. That comes out to 2.24 incidents for every 10,000 animals transported on United. The second-worst offender, American, had 0.87 incidents per 10,000.  United gained notoriety for its treatment of human passengers last April when a Vietnamese-American passenger, David Dao, was forcibly dragged off an overbooked flight in Chicago. The company‚Äôs initial response was possibly the worst bit of crisis-PR in history. As videos of the bloodied man quickly went viral, Oscar Munoz, the carrier‚Äôs boss, woodenly apologised for having to ‚Äúre-accommodate‚Äù customers and blamed the flyer for not co-operating. After a passenger backlash the company quickly changed its policy and sought to make amends.

I wasn‚Äôt sure what I was watching, but I knew it was riveting. I knew that it had the potential to change the entire series as we‚Äôve known it so far. Yes, at the beginning of the episode, Karamo was not wearing a satin bomber jacket. It was actually a knit. Like a sweater. Sure, it still zipped up the front so it wasn‚Äôt so far from his usual uniform, but still. I didn‚Äôt quite know what to do with myself.  While that shocked me, the real shock was watching this episode‚Äôs makeover subject, Skyler, getting his top surgery. We see Skyler wake up and look down at his chest, which used to have breasts, and see it flat and masculine as he always wanted it to be and his face erupts with emotion. It was really and truly moving way to begin the episode.  The other shocking thing is that redheads are bad with anesthesia. Who knew this was a real thing? I certainly didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs such a shame that Skyler not only had to spend $8,000 of his own money to have the surgery, but will now face thousands of dollars of medical bills because of the complications just from being a redhead.  As hard as being a ginge is, being trans is even harder. Many people know the struggle of being transgender in our society, but what really struck me about this episode was how even the silly everyday things that so many of us take for granted can be triggering for a trans person. I never would have thought that getting a suit tailored would lead to an emotional breakdown for Skyler because he felt uncomfortable with someone all up in his pants business. Or the fact that some bitch at the DMV could cause such emotional pain. I mean, we‚Äôve all felt existential dread at the DMV, but this is a whole different level for Skyler.  I must say that trans people really are heroes. The strength it takes for them to be themselves every day is so hard, but they continue to soldier on when there is still so little support for them. It‚Äôs absolutely astonishing and brave. That said, it doesn‚Äôt mean that some of them don‚Äôt have truly awful style. Sorry, Skyler.  Skyler dresses in poorly fitting basketball jerseys, silly novelty hats, and the worst shoes I have ever seen on someone who isn‚Äôt named Mario Batali. He‚Äôs just so happy to be a boy that he‚Äôs dressing like a 19-year-old at a third-tier state school. His house is decorated like one too, with the raised bed and all of his crap underneath it. He tells us that he had to leave his parents‚Äô house at 17 after he came out to them, and it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs living in this arrested ideal adolescence that he never got to enjoy.  Maybe I should cut him a bit more slack, but this guy has a couch that is literally called the ‚Äúcat pee couch.‚Äù The only thing worse is all of the rainbow-flag Pride paraphernalia around the house. Ugh, I am a proud homosexual, but I hate that stupid rainbow flag. There is no way that you can make it look not tacky. No matter what you do with it, it still looks like a tourist in Key West wearing a fanny pack while on a break from a Princess Cruise. The rainbow flag and the fact that Christina Aguilera isn‚Äôt a bigger star are the twin scourges of the queer community.  Because this is a very different episode, we didn‚Äôt even get that much of a makeover. Instead, we mostly heard about Skyler‚Äôs story. And that was fine with me because, girl, did I sob. I sobbed when he got a license that says he is male, I sobbed when he tried on the first suit that really fit him well, and I sobbed when he got up onstage at his ‚Äúcoming-out party‚Äù and started stripping for the crowd and showing off the body he was so proud of.  I loved that Tan wanted Skyler to look good in a suit because, he‚Äôs right, every man‚Äôs body looks more masculine with some good tailoring. It was really sweet that he brought in his friend whose suiting company works a lot with the trans community and has a few easy tricks to make their suits fit their bodies more comfortably. However, I am pissed at Tan. How the hell does he not know who Todrick Hall is? Has he not watched Drag Race? The only thing I hate more than the rainbow flag is people who say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to take your gay card away,‚Äù but I feel like Tan shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to film any more of these episodes at least until he‚Äôs watched All Stars 2.  Also, as soon as Skyler kept going on about his love of the YouTube star and Drag Race fixture, I thought, ‚ÄúIf we leave this episode without a guest appearance from Mx. Hall, then these queens did not do their job.‚Äù Thankfully, they did not disappoint and Todrick showed up on Skyler‚Äôs doorstep for a teary t√™te-√†-t√™te. It would have been very easy for Skyler to just fan out about Toddy‚Äôs videos and singles, but instead I was really touched by what he said about how Todrick really showed him how he can blend the feminine and masculine energies together to make something that is totally unique and wonderful. There are plenty out there who scoff at YouTube celebrities, but that is the power of the medium is harnessed correctly. (Speaking of harnessed correctly, I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing Todrick Hall in a harness, if he‚Äôs taking requests for his next video.)  Meanwhile, Bobby got rid of the cat pee couch and made Skyler‚Äôs room look like a rec room at St. Jude‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Hospital, but even that was a vast improvement. Antoni showed Skyler how to make poke and I will not make fun of Antoni in this recap because it was all so moving and lovely. Yes, I made this oath during an episode where he wears guyliner, so basically I‚Äôm deducting this recap on my taxes as a charitable donation.  Jonathan had the hardest job of all: He had to convince Skyler to trim his signature beard, which is what he thinks makes his face look the most masculine. But Jonathan was right, his bright-red beard was a bit too manicured, so it actually made his face look more feminine rather than the opposite. When Jonathan gave Skyler a haircut and a beard trim, he not only looked butcher but he also looked younger, which is a good look on anyone. Let‚Äôs face it: Being trans is hard enough, so the least that the Fab Five can do is give a trans man a good beard and rid his house of all of that ugly rainbow.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1402

But if you remember anything, odds are it‚Äôs the S.N.L.

Well, Portman, Samberg, and the Viking helmet are all back for another go at, well, basically the same thing. In other words: once more, with Jar Jar.  With Beck Bennett in the Chris Parnell role as an interviewer both bemused by and scared of Portman‚Äôs rap persona, the Annihilation star takes us all on a tour of what she‚Äôs been up to in the intervening years.

Black Swan, Portman‚Äôs kids, and her ballerino husband all get a shout-out in this updated sketch. The sequel may not be quite as successful as the first attempt (mostly because it lacks the element of surprise), but a Samberg cameo is always welcome.

025c8832-45ca-4f25-8f14-f7a087a68e61,"Ever since men and women flooded the Golden Globes red carpet two weeks ago with signs of all-black sartorial solidarity and ‚ÄúTime‚Äôs Up‚Äù pins, there has been questions swirling around some of the men claiming to be allies of the movement against sexual misconduct. Actress Scarlett Johansson, giving her second barn-burning speech at a Women‚Äôs March in as many years, called out Globe winner James Franco on Saturday saying: ‚ÄúI want my pin back, by the way.‚Äù  In addition to winning a Golden Globe two weeks ago, Franco, who wore a Time‚Äôs Up pin while claiming his prize, also garnered a lot of attention thanks to some comments on social media during the ceremony including some pointed, since-deleted tweets from actress Ally Sheedy. A few days later, the L.A. Times printed a report of five women accusing Franco of sexual misconduct. Franco denied the allegations. The actor has now been publicly addressed by Johansson, one of the original signers of the Time‚Äôs Up announcement letter and a major donor to the cause.  Though she didn‚Äôt name him directly during her speech in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday, a rep for Johansson later confirmed to the L.A. Times that the actress was indeed referring directly to Franco when she said: ‚ÄúHow could a person publicly stand by an organization that helps to provide support for victims of sexual assault while privately preying on people who have no power?‚Äù Pausing for effect, she then asked Franco for her pin back. Her comments start at the 1:25 mark.  Johansson posed further questions on much-debated topics such as abuses of power and what some deem grey areas of consent before saying she felt a ‚Äúrage‚Äù bubbling up inside her on behalf of women who have been abused and also, she admitted, on behalf of herself.  Johansson then related her own personal experience: ‚ÄúSuddenly I was 19 again and I began to remember all the men who had taken advantage of the fact that I was a young woman who didn‚Äôt yet have the tools to say no, or understand the value of my own self-worth,‚Äù said Johansson who appeared in her first film at the age of 10. ‚ÄúI had many relationships both personal and professional where the power dynamic was so off that I had to create a narrative that I was the cool girl who could hang in and hang out, and that sometimes meant compromising what felt right for me.‚Äù  ‚ÄúNo more pandering,‚Äù Johansson concluded. ‚ÄúNo more feeling guilty about hurting someone‚Äôs feelings when something doesn‚Äôt feel right for me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have made a promise to myself to be responsible to my self, that in order to trust my instincts I must first respect them.‚Äù",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,526
e457a245-e77e-4d63-857d-f97c56f4727f,"Teen Mom‚Äôs Briana DeJesus Shows Off Body Transformation After Plastic Surgery  After pregnancy, many moms are expected to bounce back to their pre-baby bodies.  While some women are able to lose pregnancy weight and regain their figures through diet and exercise, most women experience physical changes that may require additional help.  Fortunately, plastic surgeons are able to perform a mommy makeover to address sagging breasts, loose abdominal muscles and skin, and excess fat in the abdomen, flanks, hips, and thighs.  For most patients, a mommy makeover is something that they want to do to look and feel better about themselves.  Women may have friends that have had this procedure or know of celebrities or social media stars that have had a surgical body transformation. Such is the case with Teen Mom‚Äôs star Briana DeJesus, who recently underwent a Mommy Makeover procedure.  What Is a Mommy Makeover?  A mommy makeover includes several plastic surgeries, which may be performed at once, to help women reshape and contour their bodies after they have given birth.  Many patients will be treated with a breast lift, breast augmentation, tummy tuck, liposuction, and other body contouring treatments.  Who‚Äôs a Good Candidate?  Most plastic surgeons recommend that women have a mommy makeover once they are finished having children.  Many female patients may begin considering this series of surgeries anytime during their child-bearing years, but may delay treatment until after their last pregnancy.  Additionally, women that are breast-feeding will often wait until they have transitioned their child to a bottle or solid foods, before undergoing any type of surgery.  What Surgeries Are Involved?  A breast lift can tighten breast issue, remove excess skin, and resize or reposition the breast and areola for a perkier appearance. Women, especially those that breast feed, may also have a breast augmentation to address volume loss.  An abdominoplasty or tummy tuck tightens muscles, eliminates saggy skin, and creates a new belly button to restore feminine curves and a streamlined silhouette.  Additionally, liposuction may be perfumed on one or more areas of the body to target excess fat, and a Brazilian butt lift can boost a women‚Äôs less than pert backside.  For DeJesus, her doctor combined a tummy tuck with a breast lift.  ‚ÄúI did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before‚Äîshe wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier‚Äîso we changed her implants out for smaller ones,‚Äù said Dr. Miami, via E! News. ‚ÄúAnd we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.‚Äù  Recovery  Depending on the number of procedures, women may have one to four weeks of downtime following a mommy makeover. They can expect to be evaluated by their surgeon several times during this period.  Patients will receive detailed post-operative instructions from their treating physician including exercise and other physical restrictions. They will continue to be under the care of their plastic surgeon for routine follow-ups over the next 12-18 months.  Additionally, it‚Äôs important for patients to have physical and emotional support from their significant other, family, and friends during the recovery process.  If you would like additional information about a mommy makeover, please call Washingtonian Plastic Surgery today to schedule an appointment.

213d2233-88a7-44c9-81cb-753d9e7f5275,"Jennifer Lopez was apparently worried enough about the state of her four-month romance with Alex Rodriguez that she hired a private investigator to confirm or debunk allegations that he is a serial cheater who was still seeing a former mistress, according to a report in Us Weekly.  Lopez made this move because she was alarmed by a story that broke in the National Enquirer in June, in which his alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter claimed that the former New York Yankees third baseman isn‚Äôt faithful, the report said.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs sexually attracted to her,‚Äù Hunter told the Enquirer.  Hunter, 34, said her affair with Rodriguez began in 2011 when he was still seeing actress Cameron Diaz. Hunter said their affair continued even after she had a baby with former football star Marcus Allen in 2014.  Hunter added that Rodriguez contacted her as recently as May about having a rendezvous, and she has the text messages to prove it. Stories about Lopez, 47, and Rodriguez, 41, dating began in March and they went public with their relationship at the Met Gala in New York in May.  But Hunter contended that he was probably imagining her when he was with Lopez and described his very adventurous sexual tastes, including threesomes.

The series aims to expose ‚Äúthe secret life of a woman we all grew up watching: the sitcom wife,‚Äù the network said in a statement. ‚ÄúA beauty paired with a less attractive, dismissive, caveman-like husband who gets to be a jerk because she‚Äôs a nag and he‚Äôs ‚Äòfunny.'"" The show aims to illuminate said secret life by switching between ‚Äúsingle-camera realism and multi-camera zaniness.‚Äù  Hayes even tweeted about it:  This project is the second buzzed about this week that directly challenges long-established Hollywood tropes. The first? ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt It Romantic,‚Äù an upcoming movie that centers on a cynical woman (Rebel Wilson) who faces her worst nightmare when she gets trapped in a cheesy romantic comedy. (Yes, the same movie Wilson was promoting when she incorrectly claimed to be the ‚Äúfirst-ever plus-sized girl‚Äù to lead a rom-com.)  AMC opened a writers' room for the sitcom ‚Äî as well as workplace drama ‚ÄúRainy Day People‚Äù ‚Äî under its ‚Äúscript-to-series‚Äù development model, used for projects with promising pilot scripts.  ‚ÄúUnder the approach, AMC foregoes the traditional pilot process and instead opens writers' rooms to develop scripts for several episodes and a detailed look at a potential first season before deciding whether to move to a straight-to-series order,‚Äù Deadline reported last year.  So while there‚Äôs no guarantee ‚ÄúKevin Can F*** Himself‚Äù will make it to the finish line, AMC programming president David Madden did note that the network has had ‚Äúgreat experiences‚Äù with the creative team behind it. Things are looking up. We (Kevin) Can‚Äôt Wait!  Read more:  Wondering how ‚ÄòKevin Can Wait‚Äô will get rid of Erinn Hayes?

0e82c0bb-00cb-4446-bb3a-02abe2b48c29,"WWE Hall of Famer Nikolai Volkoff -- real name Josip Nikolai Peruzovic -- has died, WWE announced Sunday. He was 70.  Peruzovic's wife, Lynn, said Sunday that he has had heart problems and that when she went to give him medicine he was not responsive.  Peruzovic, who was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, was best known in the world of professional wrestling for his over-the-top Soviet/Russian character during his time in the World Wide Wrestling Federation (later the WWF) in the 1960s, '70s, '80s and '90s. In reality, Peruzovic was born in what was then Yugoslavia and now stands as part of Croatia.  Peruzovic's most famous run came as part of the then-WWF's explosion in popularity in the mid-1980s, as he teamed with the Iron Sheik to form one of the most successful heel teams in the history of pro wrestling while being managed by the legendary ""Classy"" Freddie Blassie. He famously sang the Soviet Union's national anthem while the Iron Sheik taunted and stoked the anger of crowds around the world by playing upon real-life conflicts.  The Iron Sheik and Volkoff won the WWF tag team championship at the first WrestleMania in March 1985.  Over the course of five decades, Peruzovic found himself opposite icons such as Hulk Hogan and Bruno Sammartino and made sporadic appearances in WWE as recently as 2014.

And it has emerged supposed non-smoker Khloe Kardashian was holding a marijuana joint in a recent episode of her clan's television show portraying their holiday in Costa Rica.  In a typically exciting installment of Keeping Up With The Kardashians on Sunday, she was shown holding a suspicious-looking cigarette in her hand as she enthusiastically embraced her sister Kourtney's former lover Scott Disick.  No smoke without fire: Khloe Kardashian is said to have been holding a marijuana joint on Sunday's Keeping Up With The Kardashians  According to TMZ, sources close to production said they did not mind the fact the 32-year-old was holding a drug in the scene because it was a natural moment.  In addition, while marijuana is illegal in the United States, it is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica.  However it is hardly the first time the star has caused a stir due to smokling.  For back in 2014 she was photographed puffing away on a suspicious looking cigarette while in a nightclub with her then lover The Game.  However her spokesman claimed at the time: 'She doesn‚Äôt smoke pot or cigarettes. It's a Hookah stick, which is tobacco free. It‚Äôs called Phantom Smoke.'  Watch the joint: Khloe seemed careful as she went in for a hug with Scott Disick  Carried away: But she seemed to be relishing her clinch with sister Kourtney's former lover  No wonder it's so popular: Marijuana is decriminalised for personal use in the Costa Rica  She was spotted smoking while on the dance floor while getting very close to rapper and self-proclaimed 'weed enthusiast,' whose real name is the rather less flamboyant Jayceon Taylor.  At one point in her exciting evening the classy broad was even seen waving her gargantuan behind at him, Miley Cyrus style.  The 37-year-old rapper recently raised by confirming he had slept with sisters Kim and Khloe, as well as their future sister-in-law Blac Chyna.  Chivalrous Jayceon told Wendy WIlliams after she quizzed him on his single Sauce, where he raps, 'I used to f*** b****s that Usher Raymond passed on, Then I f***ed three Kardashians.'  Sly puff?

That‚Äôs why Ellen‚Äôs been urging her to attend counseling sessions with her, according to a new report. They‚Äôve hit a rough patch in their relationship and apparently Ellen wants them to get back on track before they head towards a divorce.  Things have gotten so bad between Ellen and Portia that they‚Äôve been fighting non-stop, both at home and in public. In fact, one insider said that Ellen and Portia often get into heated arguments on the set of her daytime talk show. To make matters worse, Ellen hates it when other people gossip about her personal problems. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs been pushing Portia to attend counseling sessions with her as one last effort to save their crumbling marriage.  One source close to the situation told Life & Style Weekly, ‚ÄúEllen has been in counseling, both solo and with Portia. Part of their therapy is to go on more date nights. That‚Äôs why they‚Äôve been seen out and more together lately. It‚Äôs all about spending quality time together, but still giving each other space during the workday.‚Äù  Yet, the last time Ellen and Portia were spotted together was back on February 25th during a pre-Oscars party in Los Angeles. Since then, Portia has been keeping her distance from Ellen, or at least in public. One of the reasons why Portia is looking for a way out is because she‚Äôs tired of having to constantly listen to Ellen and her demands. Previous reports even indicated that Portia was fed up with Ellen‚Äôs controlling behavior. Insiders say that Portia is fed up with Ellen calling all the shots at home. She feels like she lives in a golden cage with Ellen. If that weren‚Äôt enough, Ellen likes to have the last say, especially when it comes to her career, personal and even day-to-day choices.  Of course, time will only tell if Ellen and Portia‚Äôs counseling will save their marriage. Tell us, do you think Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are having marital issues?

The pair have been dating since 2015 and generally keep their relationship under wraps (Picture: MEGA)  While enjoying each other‚Äôs company, the pair shared a kiss before heading back off to the festival to enjoy the rest of Saturday‚Äôs evening.  Advertisement  Advertisement  This photo has emerged after Kristen was rumoured to be meeting up with her ex flame Robert Pattinson.  The 28-year-old and her former Twilight co-star were allegedly spotted by fans having a drink together at a bar in California.  Five years after their massively public split, onlookers took to Twitter to share the news that they had finally reconciled.  However, it has recently been rumoured that Kristen has been meeting up with her ex flame Robert Pattinson (Picture: Getty Images)  One fan tweeted: ‚ÄòWas just at bar enjoying my friends birthday and in comes Robert Pattinson which blew my twilight mind up, and then Kristen Stewart walked in and now I‚Äôm reliving my highschool twilight fantasies.‚Äô  While some questioned whether it was true, someone shared that the place was so tiny it would have been ‚Äòrude‚Äô to take a snap. But enough fans tweeted the sighting that it appears to have been legitimate.  Twihards don‚Äôt get your hopes up though on the pair reigniting their relationship, as Kristen officially came out last year during an episode of SNL, where she revealed she is ‚Äòlike, so gay‚Äô.  Speaking with People on her decision to come out during the show, she said: ‚ÄòConsidering I had so many eyes on me, I suddenly realized [my private life] affects a greater number of people than just me.

The Love, Simon star and the Baby Driver actress were spotted getting incredibly cozy on a romantic getaway near Muyil on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico over the weekend. Photos of the two show them kissing and holding one another as they took a trip on the Muyil Lagoon. Gonz√°lez, 28, was seen sporting a skimpy, sharkskin bikini, while Duhamel, 45, wore white board shorts during their aquatic romp.  It's unclear how long the two have been an item. It's been less than a month since the couple decided to go public, but they reportedly kept their relationship under wraps out of respect for Fergie, whom Duhamel separated with in September after eight years of marriage. The two have a 4-year-old son together, Axl.  BACKGRID  ""He felt guilty that he had feelings for another woman so quickly and he wants to be respectful to Fergie so he has kept this relationship very, very private,"" a source told ET in June, when the couple finally stepped out in public.

The claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing ‚Äúsexual favors‚Äù for Weinstien, 65.  ‚ÄúIf Harvey said that, he‚Äôs full of shit,‚Äù a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.  Weinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: ‚ÄúMr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It‚Äôs ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It‚Äôs simply not true.‚Äù  As previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expo≈ões published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy. The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October. The scandal has inspired more women to come forward with their own alleged accounts of sexual abuse in Hollywood.  Weinstein‚Äôs wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him one week after NYT published its story. Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6.  ‚ÄúGeorgina is doing very well.

aa661da7-0a27-4ddc-98da-80fa8dc2f5c4,"Adam West, the actor who brought deadpan comedy and a hero‚Äôs jutting jaw to the title character of TV‚Äôs landmark ‚Äô60s superhero series Batman, died yesterday at the age of 88. A spokesperson for the family said West died of leukemia, surrounded by family.  A cultural phenomenon from the moment it debuted on January 12, 1966 on ABC, Batman was a twice-weekly treat for children ‚Äì with its comic book-style POW!s and BAM!s highlighting the climactic fight scenes ‚Äì and, with its campy humor and pop-art visuals, adults as well.  Rex Features via AP  A parade of weekly villains ‚Äì from Cesar Romero‚Äôs Joker, Frank Gorshin‚Äôs Riddler, Burgess Meredith‚Äôs Penguin and, impeccably, Julie Newmar‚Äôs Catwoman ‚Äì passed through 120 episodes from beginning to the March 14, 1968 end, but it was West and Burt Ward as his sidekick (and ward) Robin that anchored the happenings with a note-perfect send-up of stoicism.  ‚ÄúOur dad always saw himself as The Bright Knight,‚Äù West‚Äôs family said in a statement, ‚Äúand aspired to make a positive impact on his fans‚Äô lives. He was and always will be our hero.‚Äù  West is survived by his wife Marcelle, six children, five grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren. His career spanned six decades during which he appeared in more than 50 films and television shows, most recently as the voice of Mayor Adam West on Family Guy, and as a guest star on The Big Bang Theory.  West, a Seattle native born William West Anderson on September 19, 1928, began working in local radio while still in college, served as an announcer on American Forces Network television during an Army stint, then worked at various local TV stations, at one point landing a gig in Hawaii co-hosting a weekday show with Peaches the chimp.  A Warner Brothers contract brought a steady stream of bit roles, guest shots and series regular spots on episodic television as the ‚Äô50s eased into the ‚Äô60s: Lawman, Sugarfoot, Cheyenne, Bronco, Colt .45, 77 Sunset Strip, Hawaiian Eye, The Detectives, Bonanza, Petticoat Junction, Bewitched, and films like Tammy and the Doctor and, with the Three Stooges, The Outlaws Is Coming.  Oddly enough, it was West‚Äôs appearance in a spy-themed Nestle‚Äôs Quik commercial that got noticed by producer William Dozier, and West was soon cast, along with newcomer Ward, in the arch series about arch-villains and the Caped Crusaders who, week after week, tracked them, fought them and finally handed them over to Commissioner Gordon (Neil Hamilton) and Police Chief O‚ÄôHara (Stafford Repp).  Though the series quickly attained an odd combo of mass popularity and cult fervor, the joke ‚Äì and the budget ‚Äì began wearing thin just as fast, and a third season crept along without as much assistance from Yvonne Craig‚Äôs new Batgirl as might have been necessary.  Associated Press  West, like Ward and others who populated the California-sunny Gotham City, would never overcome the typecasting, and by 1980 was eking out a career in embarrassments like The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood. After semi-retirement in Idaho, he‚Äôd eventually embrace his past by voicing animated programs from 1984‚Äôs Superfriends: The Legendary Super Powers Show to 2004‚Äôs The Batman (not, alas, in the title role). He became familiar to 21st Century generations via Family Guy (as Mayor Adam West), Comic-Con and other nostalgia appearances and the 2014 release of Batman on DVD.  West received a star on The Hollywood Hall of Fame star in 2012, a moment captured in James E. Tooley‚Äôs 2013 doc Starring Adam West.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,707

Jon Christopher LuVisi, 49, has allegedly been peppering Sweeney‚Äôs various social media accounts with comments for years, but they‚Äôd recently gotten more hostile, prompting Sweeney to apply for the restraining order.  ‚ÄúThe Defendant‚Äôs unwanted contact with the Plaintiff has spanned the course of years, but in the past nine months escalated to such an extent that Plaintiff reasonable fears for her safety and the safety of her family,‚Äù read the court documents.

The order also states that he must stay away from her kids‚Äô school.  Sweeney, 40, has said in the past that LuVisi has tried to extort money from her and consistently threatened her. He also implied that he and the Days star were having an affair. (Sweeney has been married to California Highway Patrol officer David Sanov since 2000.)  She didn‚Äôt want to take any chances, especially when LuVisi allegedly sent her messages like ‚ÄúB***h you better answer me,‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt push me.

768fa085-54e7-46b2-9b5f-24fd7c399dac,"Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.  But, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.  Emerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.  Associates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.  Several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.  One old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""  She certainly takes vigorous exercise.  Exercising more than is healthy  As well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.  Recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.  Although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.  Currently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.  The healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.  She is, then, clinically underweight.  Because she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.  Her agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.  Catherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don't know what the fuss is about.""  Those protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.  But Valentino says her figure is perfect  Miss Kidman looks stunning, posing in clothes by a string of designers.  (""She has the most perfect figure,"" coos Valentino.)  Her influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of Chanel No 5 perfume.  In media terms, she has blossomed since splitting from Cruise; it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand.  But the question many are asking is why Nicole, who has relocated to New York with her two adopted children, Conor and Isabella, is looking so tired and nervy?  And why, they are wondering in Italy, has she pulled out of the Venice film festival?  And why, they wonder in Hollywood, has she turned down a ¬£10million payday - the biggest of her career - to star in a film opposite Brad Pitt?  There are signs that Nicole - who said in the spring that she feared a ""burnout"" - is under a considerable amount of pressure, both emotional and professional.  She is still alone, despite a fling with rap star Q-Tip and a flirtation with rock star Lenny Kravitz, from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated.  Her romantic friendship with Russell Crowe has foundered, and he has now married his on-off girlfriend Danielle, who is expecting a baby.  How painful this must be for Nicole, who longs to have a baby herself.  Overwhelmed with grief after miscarriage  She was, by her own admission, almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to Cruise ended.  Those who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted.  ""I don't think two people could have been happier than Tom and I,"" she mused.  I was desperate to have a baby with Tom  ""He swept me off my feet and I fell madly, passionately in love. I was consumed by it. And I was desperate to have a baby with him. That's what I wish I'd done.""  Her vulnerable state of mind is not helped by a recurrence of the insomnia which has plagued her for much of her adult life.  Furthermore, she has been driven to the brink by film roles about rejected, depressed and oppressed women - with whom she identifies to a remarkable extent.  In an interview she said that she hesitated to play the suicidal Virginia Woolf in The Hours, because she feared the effect on her own state of mind.  ""I wasn't sure I could go through with it. Virginia Woolf's unhappiness was just too similar to my own.  Hesitated to play suicidal Virginia Woolf  ""I was afraid to do it because I thought it would be too painful,"" she said.  ""But I think characters come into your life sometimes because they're meant to ... I was able to use her and her knowledge.""  There are signs that she is no less troubled currently on the set of Stepford Wives in New York.  The crew are said to be muttering about delays because she does not want to film outside in strong sunshine.  Her representatives say this is utter nonsense. ""No one is more professional than Nicole,"" they aver, sternly.  But whatever the truth of those reports, one does wonder whether the film - a remake of the Seventies classic, about a town where wives are replaced by compliant domestic robots - has uncomfortable resonances for Nicole, whose Catholic beliefs were put aside by her Scientologist husband, and who, during her marriage, lost her identity in his.  What she yearns for is love - the love she gave to Cruise and which she still feels for him.  She yearns for love  ""I've said to Tom, I will be there for him for the rest of his life, always,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Tom and I had 11 years together. Your heart has to stay loving.""  She surprised everyone by admitting at the Cannes Film Festival that she would give up her career for love.  ""I won't do this for the rest of my life, there's other things that interest me,' she said.  ""I think when I fall in love, I'll stop doing as much of this because I want to settle down again.""  What she has experienced since then, though, are little more than dangerous flirtations.  Q-Tip, her escort at the premiere of The Hours, appeared to have been chosen because he is as unlike her former husband as it is possible to be.  Kravitz, meanwhile, took her to Puff Daddy's birthday party - again an event which would be anathema to strait-laced Cruise. In private, Nicole talks a great deal about concentrating on her children and trying to ""make it up to them"" - she feels immensely guilty about the divorce.  She also complains that she would like to find a man with whom she could have an intelligent conversation.  She is unhappily single  The Jude Law episode - when she was falsely accused of breaking up his marriage - was bruising and she felt humiliated that anyone would think she would steal another woman's husband.  Their meetings on both sides of the Atlantic were professional. In short, she remains steadfastly but unhappily single.  What a pity, for this is surely the golden period in Nicole's professional life. She took the Best Actress Oscar this spring for The Hours.  Later this year Cold Mountain, the Civil War epic directed by Anthony Minghella, will be released, and there is already an Oscar buzz forming about this bleak film.  Also later this year she will be seen in The Human Stain, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Then there is Birth, a film about a grieving widow, which she made early this year, and after that Stepford Wives, scheduled for release next year.  Because of delays in filming Stepford Wives, she has had to pull out of the Venice Film Festival, and because of the promotional schedule of Cold Mountain she has had to pull out of Mr and Mrs Smith, opposite Pitt.  Her diary is indeed creaking at the seams. And she is determined to make the most of her status while she can, despite the insecurity which leads her sometimes to fear taking on projects in case she is not good enough.  ""There was a time when part of me didn't really want to take on too many projects because I had other priorities like my marriage and my family,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Now I feel more confident. Also I find with two children that are older, that allows me a bit more time to devote to making films.  ""They don't need you every five minutes and they spend time with their father.  ""In any case I'm a pragmatist, and I won't always be offered these opportunities. Work while you can, I say.""  She is living very much the burnout life which she described in Cannes this year, travelling constantly and working hard.  Burnout lifestyle  ""You give so much of yourself and you've got to step away at some stage. You can't do it for ever,"" she said.  Could it be that the worryingly slight figure that emerged this week is evidence she is reaching the point of no return?",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1806

""Then it made me think ... that every day in my life, I wake up thinking, how do I look? Was I going to be accepted in my job?"" Lima, who is from Brazil, wrote. ""And in that moment I realized that (the) majority of women probably wake up every morning trying to fit in a stereotype that society/social media/fashion etc., imposed.""  She added that women can't continue ""living in a world with such superficial values.""  ""It's not fair for us,"" Lima wrote. ""Beyond fair, it's physically and mentally not healthy.""  Supermodel Adriana Lima says she won't take her clothes off anymore for 'an empty cause.' She made the announcement in an Instagram post about the stereotypes and pressure women face. Getty Images  The model also wrote about the ""pressure"" she faces as a model, adding that she has her own insecurities.  Not taking her clothes off except for worthy causes appears to be Lima's way of taking a stand against the beauty standards women face. But it will be a stark change from her history with Victoria's Secret. Just last month, the lingerie giant hosted its annual fashion show in Shanghai, featuring Lima and other high-profile models, including Alessandra Ambrosio and Candice Swanepoel, strutting the runway in bright-colored lingerie separates and outrageously festive wings.  Lima wrote that it's time for her to ""make that change.""  ""It will start with me,"" she wrote. ""I refuse to embrace that. I am next to you. And I stand by you.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,402

(Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images)  Kevin Hart is finally coming clean about cheating on his pregnant wife, Eniko Parrish, earlier this year.  In August, the comedian laughed off reports he had strayed and later said he was being extorted over images taken without his knowledge in Las Vegas hotel room with another woman.  The following month, Hart simply copped to having made ""a bad error in judgment,"" and apologized to his wife and kids in an emotional video on Instagram.  Now, the Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle star is admitting to cheating.  In an appearance on New York's Power 105.1 radio show, The Breakfast Club, Hart called himself ""beyond"" irresponsible. He said, ""That's Kevin Hart in his dumbest moment. That's not the finest hour of my life. With that being said, you make your bed, you lay in it.""  Kevin Hart and his wife, Eniko Parrish, attended the premiere of 'Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle' together on on Dec. 11. (Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images)  Hart, 38, said he wasn't thinking and had gone to Vegas on a whim while his family was out of town.  ""I'm guilty, regardless of how it happened and what was involved and (expletive) I can't talk about,"" he told The Breakfast Club.  The woman involved, Montia Sabbag, said publicly she was not suing or extorting the actor after their ""intimate relationship.""  Hart said afterwards that he decided to face the music. He shut down the production of his film and made his then-pregnant wife aware of the situation, ""hoping that she has the heart to where she can forgive me and understand that this is not going to be a recurring thing.""  ""We talked,"" he said. ""That's when the bond of your union will be questioned. No one is perfect.""  More: Kevin Hart shares first photos of 'my little man,' newborn son Kenzo  Hart and Parrish married last year and welcomed their first child, a son named Kenzo, on Nov. 21.  He also has two other children from his previous marriage to actress Torrei Hart: Son Hendrix, 10, and daughter Heaven, 12.  Hart called the infidelity ""a reality check and a gut-punch from God.""
