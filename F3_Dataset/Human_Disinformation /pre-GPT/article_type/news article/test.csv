The singer, 46, filed for divorce in July 2016 after 12 years of marriage.

063cae8f-b0e7-4f8f-893e-2973b202ba97,"Mindy Kaling nailed her commencement speech at Dartmouth College’s graduation ceremony in Hanover, New Hampshire, on Sunday, June 10. In her 17-minute address, the 38-year-old, who graduated from the Ivy League institution in 2001, shared practical advice — buy a toilet plunger before you need one — and opened up about life as a single mother.  The Mindy Project creator and star welcomed her daughter, Katherine Kaling, on December 15. She honored her late mom, Dr. Swati Roysircar, by choosing the middle name Swati for her first child. Kaling has not revealed the identity of the infant’s father.  “After my daughter was born in December, I remember bringing her home and being in my house with her for the first time and thinking, ‘Huh. According to movies and TV, this is traditionally the time when my mother and spouse are supposed to be here, sharing this experience with me,’” Kaling told the crowd. “And I looked around, and I had neither. And for a moment, it was kind of scary. Like, ‘Can I do this by myself?’”  The brief moment of panic quickly passed. “That feeling went away, because the reality is, I’m not doing it by myself,” Kaling shared. “I’m surrounded by family and friends who love and support me. And the joy I feel from being with my daughter Katherine eclipses anything from any crazy checklist.”  The Oceans 8 actress urged graduates to not “be scared” if they “don’t do things in the right order” and to remember that life takes unexpected twists.  “I didn’t think I’d have a child before I got married, but hey, it turned out that way, and I wouldn’t change a thing,” she said. “I didn’t think I’d have dessert before breakfast today, but hey, it turned out that way and I I wouldn’t change a thing.”  Kaling, who starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in A Wrinkle in Time, also shared wisdom on self-confidence. “I was not someone who should have the life I have now, and yet I do,” she revealed. “I was sitting in the chair you are literally sitting in right now and I Just whispered, ‘Why not me?’ and I kept whispering it for 17 years; and here I am, someone that this school deemed worthy enough to speak to you at your Commencement.”  She continued: “Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something, but especially not yourself.

6edfd502-48d8-4ac4-9a60-522529f2f966,"How intolerant can a group of people get, folks?If they don’t want to be a part of the country and culture then they should go back to where they came from. This should apply universally to all who chose to migrate.Wouldn’t it be a novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!According to the Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, Australia is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs. According to their spokesman, Unthman Badar, “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”Here’s the pledge:From this time forward, [under God,]I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,whose democratic beliefs I share,whose rights and liberties I respect, andwhose laws I will uphold and obey.Pretty oppressive, right? If you are graciously accepted into a country and you can’t even say that pledge, is there any chance of assimilating into the culture? Here’s the national anthem:Australians all let us rejoice,For we are young and free; We’ve golden soil and wealth for toil; Our home is girt by sea; Our land abounds in nature’s gifts Of beauty rich and rare; In history’s page, let every stage Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair. Beneath our radiant Southern Cross We’ll toil with hearts and hands; To make this Commonwealth of ours Renowned of all the lands; For those who’ve come across the seas We’ve boundless plains to share; With courage let us all combine To Advance Australia Fair. In joyful strains then let us sing, Advance Australia Fair.Super oppressive lyrics, right?If a group of radicals cannot assimilate and integrate within a western society, they can go right back where they came from.Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that they will adhere to the principles and laws of that host country.If those seeking entrance cannot abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.Watch Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesman, Unthman Badar, make the case against Muslim school children singing the national anthem. It begins around the 10 minute point.This is outrageous! Muslims everywhere act like this when they reach a certain percentage of a western nation’s population, because it is all part of the great plan to achieve a global totalitarian theocracy. WQe cannot let them get away with these things!Either assimilate, or LEAVE.They are Muslim first, last and always. Geographic boundaries and national laws mean nothing to them. Their only loyalty is to Allah. It’s their faith. The west doesn’t get it because most liberals are faithless.It irks me that these intolerant groups of radicaks go to a country of their own and then don’t want to be patriotic to that country.. How about you go back where your from!! Next they will demand that Australian’s convert or be beheaded!It makes me sick that our children were denied the American flag under Obama, and couldn’t pray… but Muslim children can and do.. we are denied Christ but they are not denied Allah during school hours! This is wrong on more than one level! Next they won’t want to learn the country they have invaded history… because its not theirs!Muslims are nothing but foreign invaders with no intention of loyalty or assimilation into the country they go to.This what you get with Socialist politician bent on destroying their country.Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their host nation or be allowed to force changes to suit them?",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,764
9e1c29ea-8d19-4747-8b62-5bfca64cd8b6,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Yesterday, multiple outlets reported that Brad Pitt is under investigation for child abuse by both the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Child and Family Services after an incident that occurred on his family’s private plane last Wednesday. More details have emerged about the incident that reportedly caused Angelina Jolie to file for divorce and request full custody of the couple’s six children. Us Weekly is reporting that at least part of the alleged fight was caught on film, and TMZ and People are reporting that the fight involved Pitt and Jolie’s 15-year-old son, Maddox.  According to TMZ, “the details of precisely what happened” are “murky,” but the anonymous person who reported Pitt to the DCFS alleged that Pitt “attacked” Maddox on the family’s flight home from Nice, France. From TMZ:  Here’s what’s alleged – shortly after the plane took off, Brad and Angelina began arguing and Maddox jumped up to verbally defend his mom. We’re told Brad then lunged at the boy and Angelina jumped in between them to block her husband. Brad connected in some fashion with his son.  People, which has presented Pitt’s side of the divorce story throughout the week, reports that Pitt “did not hit” Maddox during the incident. A source close to Pitt provided People with the following account:  Pitt “was drunk, and there was an argument between him and Angelina,” says the source. “There was a parent-child argument which was not handled in the right way and escalated more than it should have.”    The source says Pitt did not hurt his son. “He is emphatic that it did not reach the level of physical abuse, that no one was physically harmed. He did not hit his child in the face in any way. He did not do that; he is emphatic about that. He put his hands on him, yes, because the confrontation was spiraling out of control.”    A source close to Pitt says any accusations beyond that are “a combination of exaggerations and lies. They have taken the overall smallest kernel of truth – that a fight got out of hand and reached a regrettable peak, and that as a result DCFS is looking into it – and they are manipulating it to best suit their attempts to gain custody.”  Lainey Lui of Lainey Gossip points out that, at some point last night, People removed the following sentence from the report: “The Pitt source adds that the star ‘was not black-out drunk’ and that ‘he absolutely remembers that evening and has been interviewed at length to that effect.’”  TMZ notes that Pitt’s sources and Jolie’s sources do not agree on whether or not Pitt was drunk during the incident, so that point remains unclear. TMZ reported yesterday that sometime after the incident, the plane landed in Minnesota to refuel, and “that’s when eyewitnesses say Brad was ‘out of control’ on the tarmac and even tried to leave in a fuel truck.”  Pitt has yet to release an official statement regarding the allegations. Us Weekly reports that, on the video of the incident, Pitt can be seen “looking drunk” and “yelling.” Us Weekly’s source claims, however, that “nothing physical” happens on the tape.  According to TMZ, Pitt still plans to fight for joint custody of his children.

ec2401a5-f1fa-4324-99bc-67788eb49b53,"Kim and Kourtney Kardashian's feud wages on.  The sisters seemingly haven't been able to see eye to eye in dramatic promos for season 15 of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, and in an exclusive new clip, things get even more heated.  After Kourtney held her ground on picking a time to shoot their family Christmas card, Kim called her ""the least exciting to look at"" -- pushing her older sister to the breaking point. Kourtney breaks down in an emotional phone call to Khloe, who just so happens to be sitting with Kim and their mom, Kris Jenner.  ""I'm not here to be mistreated by my f**king b**ch family,"" she cries. ""Kim saying that I'm the least interesting to look at -- who even speaks like that?""  ""You guys just have really different values than me. I choose to be a mother to my three kids. I am not here looking for another job. I already work enough, more than I would like to,"" Kourtney continues, as Kim gets out of her chair.  ""You don't do f**king sh*t!"" Kim yells, causing Khloe to get up and walk away, with Kim following her.  ""You would honestly think that we have more jobs, so work around our schedule,"" Kim yells. ""You do whatever the f**k you want to do and you don't do sh*t, so be accommodating to the people who actually do sh*t.""    That's when Kourtney takes it to the next level, calling Kim a ""very distraught, evil human being."" ""I'm not going to live my life around people that make me not feel good on a daily basis,"" she says.  ""Well, clearly you're going through something else, because you're acting like a f**king lunatic. So maybe deal with that,"" Kim shouts back, forcing Khloe and Kris to take Kourtney's side.    ""Oh my god, Kimberly. That's not OK to say,"" Khloe interrupts.  ""What I said was rude and I wasn't even being serious. I said I'm sorry for that, but you're the most entitled f**king person on the planet when you work the least,"" Kim continues.  But the fight isn't over! Watch below.  Kim can definitely dish it, as she's clapped back in several celebrity feuds over the past few years, with stars like Piers Morgan, Bette Midler, Lamar Odom and Taylor Swift. Watch below.

b3fafd28-d4cd-4c50-818e-b7d40940ef17,"Strip That Down is the debut solo single by English singer and songwriter Liam Payne, featuring guest vocals from American rapper Quavo. It was released as the lead single for his forthcoming debut studio album on 19 May 2017, via Capitol Records in the UK and Republic Records in the US.[3] The song was written by Payne, Ed Sheeran—who contributes uncredited vocals to the song, Steve Mac and Quavo. It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on 23 May 2017.[4] The song's accompanying music video was released on 2 June 2017. The lyrical content is supposed to reflect Payne's freedom to venture into raunchy musical elements after departing from the British-Irish boy band One Direction.  Background [ edit ]  ""Strip That Down"" features a guest appearance from Quavo (pictured), from the Atlanta-based hip hop group, Migos  After One Direction went on a hiatus, Payne, who co-wrote songs on each of the group's five albums, intended to focus only on songwriting. He told Billboard:  To be honest with you, I wasn't going to do a solo venture. I was just going to go into songwriting and carry on and do that. But then I was like, 'You've been trying to do this since you were 14 years old. You would be ridiculously stupid to turn down the option to have a deal.' Coming out of the band, we had some pretty good opportunities around us. I had to do something.[5]  The singer met Ed Sheeran in London in late summer of 2016, ""We went in, sat around and discussed a bunch of things about life, and [the song] basically just came together,"" said Payne. After working with Sheeran and producer Steve Mac, Payne decided to add Migos member Quavo into the mix as the song's featured artist.[5] While talking about how that collaboration came together in an interview with iHeartRadio, Payne said; ""I was thinking, like rapper time, it was going to take two or three weeks. But, we got it, played it straight away, and we were like, 'We absolutely love it.' He's a great man to have on the team.""[6]  Composition [ edit ]  Ed Sheeran (pictured) co-wrote the song and provided uncredited vocals to it. ) co-wrote the song and provided uncredited vocals to it.  ""Strip That Down"" is a trap and hip hop-influenced[7][8] pop and R&B track. Payne croons over ""pulsating"" synth-bass and chants with minimalist production style. Lyrically, the song contains themes of wealth, celebrity appeal and newfound career independence.[9] While talking about the song, Payne said; ""It just sets a few things straight, but then also the chorus is more about stripping back the music. I like to hear it loud sometimes, but sometimes you got to strip it back.""[6] For the concept of the song, Payne stated that they contemplated what Justin Timberlake would release as his debut solo single in 2017.[10]  ""Strip That Down"" contains an interpolation of 2000 single ""It Wasn't Me"",[11] written by Orville Burrell ""Shaggy"", Rikrok, Shaun Pizzonia, and Brian Thompson. ""It Wasn't Me"" interpolates War's ""Smile Happy"", composed by Sylvester Allen, Harold Ray Brown, Morris Dickerson, Lonnie Jordan, Charles William Miller, Lee Oskar, and Howard E. Scott. Therefore, they are also credited as songwriters.[12]  Critical reception [ edit ]  Rolling Stone staff called it a ""summer club banger"".[13] Writers from Billboard thought Payne ""seems to be aiming for a DJ Mustard/Tyga vibe,"" and concluded that ""the song's fun: The swaggering, Directioner-baiting pre-chorus especially, which is probably the JT-est thing any of the five members have done since going solo.""[14] Comparing it to One Direction's catalogue, Jordan Harris from Express and Star opined it ""is a lot more danceable, incredibly fun to listen to"" and added, ""Another similarity, and one which Liam would do well to use as a benchmark going forward, is the vocal style of Justin Timberlake.""[15] In Digital Spy, Laurence Mozafari wrote ""the song screams of trying to be grown up.""[16] Time magazine listed ""Strip That Down"" as one of the worst songs of 2017.[17]  Music video [ edit ]  On 18 May 2017, the lyric video for ""Strip That Down"" was uploaded to Payne's Vevo channel. The music video for the song was released on the same channel on 2 June 2017.

As the video transitions from black and white to colour, it shows Payne in a neon world of bright lights, dancing, and an appearance from featured artist Quavo.[19]  Reviewing the ""sleek, colorful"" clip, Rolling Stone staff wrote: ""Payne rocks gently in what appears to be the inside of tanning bed.""[13] In Digital Spy, Justin Harp opined Payne ""sheds One Direction's wholesome image in the sexy music video,"" and added, ""The promo clip does exactly what it says on the tin, as the former boybander demonstrates his newfound hip-hop vibe while slinking around with twerking back-up dancers.""[20] Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that the video is ""as awkward as the song"", saying: ""The Migos rapper appears completely at ease in his surroundings, while Liam looks like he accidentally wandered on to the set.""[21]  As of November 2018, the video has over 280 million views on YouTube, becoming Payne's first Vevo-certified music video outside of One Direction.  Chart performance [ edit ]  ""Strip That Down"" charted within the top 5 in the charts of Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The single reached number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 on the issue dated 16 September 2017, becoming Payne's first top ten as a solo artist and Quavo's fourth.

ef966f10-a4db-46e5-ac31-f66cc27c13fc,"Flip or Flop is a television series airing on HGTV hosted by real estate agents and real-life husband and wife Tarek and Christina El Moussa,[1] and beginning with season 7, episode 6, the two continue working together although divorced. The show is the original show in the Flip or Flop franchise.  Premise [ edit ]  The El Moussas were both real estate agents prior to the crash in 2008, and later they began flipping homes, mostly in Orange County, California.  In 2011, Tarek asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV. The friend filmed an entire episode of the process of house flipping from start to finish. The audition tape was sent to HGTV, and they were interested in talking to the couple. In 2012, HGTV signed the couple to a regular weekly program that shows the process of buying distressed property and renovating it.[2]  Christina's expertise is primarily in design, and she works with Tarek to find and renovate homes. She handles the designs of the new spaces and keeps everything on schedule. The show follows them as they buy homes, typically bank-owned, short sales or foreclosures, to renovate and resell.[3]  Hosts [ edit ]  Personal life [ edit ]  Tarek El Moussa grew up in Buena Park, California and Christina Meursinge Haack grew up in Anaheim Hills. Tarek, who earned his real estate license at age 21, met Christina while working in the real estate industry.[4] The couple were selling real estate in the Southern California area[5] when the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash; they went from living in a $6,000 per month home to a $700 per month apartment.[6]  The couple married in 2009 and have two children, a girl named Taylor Reese and a boy named Brayden James.[7]  In 2013, a registered nurse and viewer, Ryan Reade, contacted the network after seeing a lump on Tarek's neck during a Flip or Flop marathon. Tarek had previously had the lump examined, and he said there was no issue. After Reade contacted producers, Tarek had the lump checked again; doctors discovered that he had stage 2 thyroid cancer.[8] The El Moussas thanked Reade in a video that can be seen on HGTV.com.[9]  In May 2016, the couple had secretly split due to ""challenges"" in their marriage.[10] In January 2017, Tarek officially filed for divorce from Christina.[11]  Real estate career [ edit ]  Tarek and Christina run a real-estate agency, The El Moussa Group, in Orange County, California, an area with one of the largest foreclosure rates in the country. Tarek, Christina, and their partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment house in Santa Ana for $115,000. After selling the property for a profit of $34,000, the trio split the money and continued to flip houses, expanding their real estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.[12]  Series overview [ edit ]  Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 13 April 16, 2013 ( ) May 28, 2013 ( 2013-05-28 ) 2 14 April 8, 2014 ( ) July 8, 2014 ( 2014-07-08 ) 3 15 October 7, 2014 ( ) July 7, 2015 ( 2015-07-07 ) 4 15 December 3, 2015 ( ) March 24, 2016 ( 2016-03-24 ) 5 15 June 9, 2016 ( ) September 22, 2016 ( 2016-09-22 ) 6 15 December 1, 2016 ( ) March 30, 2017 ( 2017-03-30 ) 7 8 June 15, 2017 ( ) July 20, 2017 ( 2017-07-20 ) 8 TBA May 31, 2018 ( ) TBA  References [ edit ]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,710
de0dafbb-d10f-4baf-a142-0ff9a3482a11,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.  MTV said on Monday that “Lohan Beach Club” will follow the actress as she works to expand a recently launched nightclub and restaurant business in Greece.  The TV network said the show, expected to air in 2019, will see Lohan, 32, lead a team of “brand ambassadors” who will help promote her business “while striving to rise above the temptations the Mykonos night life scene has to offer.”  Lohan, once one of Hollywood’s most-sought after young actresses after starring roles in “The Parent Trap” and “Mean Girls,” went to rehab six times between 2007 and 2013, and was in and out of jail and court repeatedly for offenses ranging from theft to drunken driving and drug possession.  Her last feature movie was the 2013 low-budget thriller “The Canyons” after which she moved to London, and later Dubai. Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy “Sick Note,” in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.  The Mykonos beach club is Lohan’s third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.

5c86ccf7-34ac-474b-9a2a-8fa9507663ad,"Independence Day director Roland Emmerich sent shockwaves through Hollywood when he declared that the film's star Will Smith was “too expensive and too much of a marquee name” to star in the sequel, scheduled to come out in 2015. Emmerich had previously declared that it would be impossible to do a sequel without Smith. The about-turn, announced while Emmerich was promoting his new film, White House Down, this week, is part of a changing of the guard in Hollywood that has seen Smith, Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt lose some of their cachet. The announcement also comes just as Hollywood has seemingly deemed it no longer needs its three biggest male stars to launch blockbuster movies.  The knives had been sharpened for Pitt when zombie thriller World War Z was being designated a megaflop even before it hit cinemas. With a budget rumoured to be in excess of $400m (£260m) including marketing, it was being touted as this year's John Carter. When the sci-fi adventure bombed last summer Disney boss Rich Ross resigned from his post; the film reputedly lost $200m. The worry was that Pitt's name alone could not sell the picture. In the end, the opening weekend saw the Pitt film take home more than $60m at the American box office and $117m worldwide. The dire pre-release predictions meant that what were in modern blockbuster terms quite ordinary numbers were painted as a success, with suggestions there might be a sequel.  While on the surface the numbers looked good for Pitt they did not quite mask the new reality in Hollywood that views star-vehicle blockbusters as a risky commodity. Monsters University, an animation film from Pixar, beat World War Z to top spot in the box office. Other films released this year with production costs in the $200m budget range, such as Man of Steel and Iron Man, opened with weekends garnering well over $100m in the US alone. The mixed critical reaction of the zombie thriller could also see the WWZ box office plummet in the way that Man of Steel faltered in its second week. For now Pitt has at least avoided the box-office curse that afflicted his contemporaries earlier this year.  It seems laughable to talk about the former Fresh Prince having to rebuild his castle because After Earth “only” took $27m on its opening weekend. But to film trade magazine Variety it was a “crash landing”. There were numerous reasons why, none of which looks good for Smith. Since the 1996 release of Independence Day, every Smith summer movie has debuted at No 1 at the American box office. But After Earth came third, behind Fast and Furious 6, on its second week of release and, even more surprisingly, Now You See Me, a heist movie starring Jesse Eisenberg and Mark Ruffalo. The number is also bad when comparing like with like. Of Smith's previous films, the gross is more in line with his low-budgeted dramas such as The Pursuit of Happyness than blockbuster titles Men in Black and Hancock. All this points to why financiers believing there is no upside in paying Smith a small fortune for the Independence Day sequel.  Tom Cruise seemed to be back on track when Oblivion opened with a more than respectable $38m first weekend. That was the second highest opening for a Cruise vehicle outside of the Mission: Impossible franchise and followed years of diminishing returns from the likes of Jack Reacher, Rock of Ages, Valkyrie and Knight and Day. But that was where the good news ended. Word of mouth was bad and audiences tumbled to such an extent that Oblivion is yet another Cruise effort to not score blockbuster numbers in America. When not playing Ethan Hunt, the last Cruise-led film to break the $100m barrier was 2005's War of the Worlds.  It's commonly asserted that the start of Cruise's demise was his couch-jumping proclamation of love for Katie Holmes on Oprah. Yet Cruise can argue that his box-office average has remained high since. But take away the Mission: Impossible franchise and the numbers are bleak. Before 2005 every Cruise film for a number of years made more than $100m.  The fact is that these box-office figures for Oblivion, After Earth and World War Z would look amazing if the budgets for these movies were not north of $100m before marketing costs. Once you add the cut that cinema chains and home-video outlets take on revenue, movies need to make many times their budget to start being considered a success. Studios need a blockbuster film to pull in nearly $1bn theatrical, another $1bn on DVD and a good, multi-year sale on television for a $200m picture to be deemed a success.  Indeed, the high cost of releasing films is making film-makers sweat at both ends of the budget scale. Steven Soderbergh said he had to make Behind the Candelabra for HBO as the budget of the film was $5m, but the marketing needed for an American release is a minimum of $70m – numbers that don't make sense.  George Lucas and Steven Spielberg, speaking recently at the University of Southern California, predicted that there would be an “implosion” in the film industry and only big-budget superhero movies would make it to the cinemas and cost $50 to see, while low-budget dramas would be made for ever smaller budgets and go straight to the small screen.  Compounding the stars' misery is their ageing audience. Three-quarters of the spectators for Oblivion that first weekend were over 25. Younger audiences and families opted for Monsters University over World War Z.  While Hollywood has increasingly been more forgiving about middle-aged male action stars there has always been a tipping point where it becomes far more of a stretch to believe that they are taking on the world single-handedly. Presently that tipping point seems to come at around 50. Cruise was born in Syracuse, New York in 1962. Oklahoma-born Brad Pitt will turn 50 this year. Will Smith, the youngest of the trio, is 44, but the Philadelphia native has nearly always banked on audiences buying into his youthful exuberance as a key selling factor.  Pitt is the curiosity of the current trio fighting against the sands of time. His box office has never been of blockbuster proportions. The big franchise of his career has been the Oceans trilogy, which had numerous stars to share the burden. His stardom has come from public perception and high-profile relationships. But add up the American box office of his last three films, Killing Them Softly, Moneyball and The Tree of Life, and the total gross is less than what Benjamin Button took home. World War Z is his big attempt at venturing into blockbuster territory and, while the raw numbers gave Pitt his highest grossing opening weekend, they are not blockbuster and it seems that he has gambled a decade too late.  The three are such big stars that they even run their own production companies – Pitt runs Plan B, Smith chairs Overbrook and Cruise founded Cruise/Wagner Productions. They call the shots on their movies, hiring directors, working on the scripts and picking projects. Pitt staked his star name that he could turn Max Brooks's novel into the start of a franchise. The jury is still out.  Studios now have more control over their product when stars are not involved. This is especially true of superhero movies. The exception that proves the rule came recently when Robert Downey Jr caused a ripple by threatening to stop playing Iron Man. The studio dithered, no doubt knowing they could save a fortune by letting him go. Fans balked and the studio relented. A hefty payday will see him star in Avengers 2 and 3, a comic-book ensemble that doesn't need Downey Jr in it to guarantee bums on seats.  A caveat is that the appeal of the stars seems to have not been so diminished in foreign markets, especially nascent territories such as China and Russia. There has been a big shift in Hollywood studios' attitudes in the last 10 years as the takings from foreign markets have started to dwarf those of domestic audiences. So while After Earth was deemed to have bombed in America, foreign takings a week later softened the crash landing.  The reaction of Cruise and Smith to their box-office numbers suggest they are in consolidation mode. Cruise has abandoned plans to star in an adaptation of 60s TV show The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and announced that he's making a 5th instalment of Mission: Impossible. There's also talk that he's considering turning Jerry Maguire into a TV show. Will Smith has been on American talk shows downplaying the weak opening of After Earth and, while talking about looking for more risks in his choices and moving away from blockbusters, he has also been rumoured to be preparing for sequels of Bad Boys, I, Robot and Hancock. Although his Men in Black franchise has seen each sequel make less money than predecessors. The stars are following the studios in relying on their best-known characters to sell their movies.  What's intriguing is that there seem to be no successors to Cruise, Pitt and Smith. The recent huge blockbuster franchises have been superhero movies, Batman and Spider-Man, or ensembles based on books, Harry Potter, Twilight and Lord of the Rings. It's hard to imagine Christian Bale breaking box-office records outside of the bat-suit. The summer blockbusters have evolved away from being star vehicles as studios have hit on a formula where they can call the shots. That's bad news for the non-tights-wearing action star.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1786

You won’t be wrong — now. There are no poor answers within reason.  But we put forth our own 16-player bracket two weeks ago and asked fans to decide. The winner? Tennessee’s Grant Williams, who beat Indiana’s Juwan Morgan in the final vote.  In his sophomore campaign last season, Williams averaged 15.2 points, 6 rebounds, and 1.3 blocks, earning him SEC Player of the Year honors on a Tennessee team that went 26-9 overall and finished in first place in the conference with a 13-5 record.  Tennessee returns all five starters this season, and all six of its leading scorers, so Williams will have plenty of help as he tries to get Tennessee past the Sweet 16 for the first time since 2014.  Sixteen student-athletes qualified for our tournament of preseason player of the year candidates, seeded No. 1 through No. 16, in a four-round, single-elimination format. Voting was conducted on the @MarchMadness Twitter account and Instagram account beginning Monday, Oct. 15. The student-athlete with more fan votes in each matchup advanced to the next round.

(2) Zion Williamson, Fr., F, Duke: Williamson is a physical specimen that will dominate his position and be must-see every time out.

(7) Kyle Guy, Jr., G, Virginia: Guy is determined to erase the memory of the UMBC loss by taking the Cavs back to the top of the ACC. Guy has become one of the more reliable shooters under Tony Bennett.  (8) Caleb Martin, F, Sr., Nevada: Martin came back instead of staying in the NBA draft to join the most talented Wolf Pack roster ever. He has a chance to create a legacy with a trip to the Final Four.  (9) Rui Hachimura, Jr., F, Gonzaga: Hachimura has improved mightily in each season. He continues to embrace the role of being a go-to player on a roster that should make a run for the title.  (10) Tyus Battle, G, Jr., Syracuse: Battle flirted with staying in the NBA draft but he returns to lead the Orange a few steps further than the Sweet 16 last season. His numbers climbed during the season and he should be one of the more consistent scorers in the ACC.  (11) Shamarie Ponds, Jr., G, St. John’s: Ponds enters the season as one of the favorites for Big East player of the year. He is a must-watch guard who will have MSG rocking this season as the Red Storm rise toward an NCAA bid.  MORE: How do the preseason top 25 fare in March Madness?

The 31-year-old actor - who is best known for starring as Edward Cullen in the 'Twilight Saga' - admitted he used to play the fantasy role-playing board game Warhammer but he would always play by himself.  Speaking to W Magazine, Robert said: ""Growing up, I was pretty much a dork. I really liked playing Warhammer, but I never actually figured out the rules. I just made up my own. So I never played with anybody else, because I was playing by my own rules. I was alone a lot.""  Pattinson starred alongside on-screen and ex-girlfriend Kristen Stewart [Bella Swan] in the popular vampire saga, and whilst he enjoyed doing the first film because he was able to ""create his own footprint"" with his alter ego, the four subsequent movies made him want to ""break out"" of doing the same character.  In an interview with Deadline, he recently said: ""When I came to doing the first 'Twilight', I actually felt I had a lot more control over my performance, because I didn't really realize what it was. And that was because of Catherine Hardwicke, as well - she made it so malleable, which it can be when nobody knows what something is.  ""I really liked doing all of those films, but on the first one I definitely felt like, because we hadn't set the footprint for the thing ... I feel like, as soon as you set a footprint your instinct immediately is to want to break out of it, and you can't. There are too many reasons you can't just throw it all up in the air.

It’s not fair to them.  “I did my last tour because I had this unexpected life crisis and then the music came pouring out of me from that,” Stefani explained. “It was such a lifesaver and a beautiful moment for me to be able to write again. I put that tour on at the last minute and went on a summer tour with the kids. It was so much fun for them, they loved it.

RELATED: Gwen Stefani Reveals Fun Fact About Blake Shelton’s Ex-Girlfriend  “I’m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician… because of my age, and I’ve been doing it for thirty-something years,” she said. “It’s perfect for me to be able to do a Vegas show because not only does it work for me as a mom, but it also works creatively.  “It’s going to be a way to express myself and do my whole catalogue of the music that defines every time period in my life; all the crises and all the joys.”  Stefani also dished on the artists that inspire and make her better. Two such names are Jennifer Lopez and Stefani’s boyfriend Blake Shelton.  “I’ve always looked up to her [Lopez] in the sense that we’re exactly the same age and I remember when No Doubt was first coming out and she hadn’t done ‘Jenny from The Block’ yet, but she had that song out, ‘Waiting for Tonight’,” Stefani recalled. “At the time I was working with Prince and he started comparing me and Jennifer.  “I didn’t even see how I was in the same category with her,” she revealed. “She was Jennifer Lopez and I was in a band called No Doubt (laughs). But now here we are both doing these residencies all these years later, and we’ve known each other through the years. She’s always invited me to her kids’ birthday parties and things like that. She is a crazy work[horse].”  Speaking of JLo’s Vegas residency, Stefani paid close attention to how the “On The Floor” singer crafted her shows.  “I was studying the production of her show. The show was incredible, and she works so hard on stage,” explained Stefani. “When I came backstage to talk to her afterwards, she comes out of the dressing room looking like a Barbie doll.

But some negativity ensued, too.  “The divorce rumors came and then we really knew the perceptions had changed,” the Arrested Development star, 45, told Us Weekly exclusively at the General Public x RH Celebration in West Hollywood on Wednesday, June 27. “I’m not kidding. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when that started happening I thought, ‘Oh, now we’re finally accepted.’ We get the same s–t as every celebrity couple.”  Split rumors aren’t the only ones that de Rossi has faced. “I thought, ‘Wow, this is great that I’m pregnant, not pregnant, divorced, not divorced, whatever,” she added. “That means there is an acceptance for this.”  The actress said she and DeGeneres, 60, don’t necessarily laugh off the speculation. In fact, they try to ignore it completely.  “I was at a newsstand … and there was a cover of Brad [Pitt] and Jen [Aniston],” she recalled. “I literally just stared at it, and I was like, ‘They haven’t seen each other. … How is this even a thing? I know for a fact.’ … I actually took a picture of it and sent it to Ellen and said, ‘Can you believe this?’ Anyway, no, in other words, we avoid it. We don’t care.”  De Rossi also spoke with Us about launching The Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund in honor of her wife’s birthday in January. “All of it was a complete surprise, which was very difficult. It was so difficult to keep it from her,” she said. “She’s so observant. I literally had to take my email address off all of our shared devices at home … because I knew that if she saw an email coming in from Africa, it would be all over. She would put it all together.”  The philanthropist explained that she wanted to do something special for the TV host’s milestone day. “I thought this was a big birthday, 60, and she’s not going to do her talk show forever, and I want her to be able to look forward to retiring, to know that there was something the entertainment industry that she could sink her teeth into,” she told Us. “It was those two things.”  In addition, de Rossi opened up about how her company, General Public, partnered with Restoration Hardware. “I’m an art lover and collector. I wouldn’t call myself an expert, I’m just a fan,” she said. “I saw the disparity between the quality of art that you can get in the fine art market and decorative art that is available to most people. I just thought that it was kind of a shame that you have to be extremely interested in art — or interested enough to go to an art gallery or learn the art market — in order to get a better quality of art than what is available. I really wanted to bridge the gap a little and just introduce more artists into this kind of vortex in between and really support them because most of the art that you see that’s available at retail is made by graphic designers or computer generated.

c1985e37-99d1-4671-97ec-1dcdc55b324d,"Anmer Hall is a Georgian country house in the village of Anmer in Norfolk, England. It is about 12 miles (19 km) north east of King's Lynn, about 2 miles (3.2 km) east of the Queen's residence at Sandringham[1] and about 2 miles (3.2 km) west of Houghton Hall. Anmer Hall was a wedding gift to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge from the Queen.[2]  The current house was built in the 18th century and has formed part of the Sandringham estate since 1898. The house was registered as a Grade II* listed building in 1984 but was later de-listed.[3]  History [ edit ]  The current late-Georgian house dates from the 18th century, although it may be built around an earlier core. It has two storeys and attic with dormer windows. The long south front comprises 13 bays, and was refaced with red bricks c. 1815. It has 13 ground-floor windows set in blank arches and a semicircular porch on two Tuscan columns, with 11 windows on the first floor. The three central bays are topped by a pediment. The north front is of rubble carstone and includes four c. 17th century ogee-headed sashes on the first floor. Renovations c. 1900 added a brick dressed skin to the north front, together with a projecting entrance porch and a tower towards the eastern end, in the corner formed with a carstone service wing also added c. 1900.  The surrounding estate became a scheduled ancient monument in 2003, and includes earthworks marking the sites of buildings from the medieval village of Anmer.[4] The village church, St Mary, lies close to the house, but a short distance away from the modern village.  Occupants [ edit ]  Anmer Hall was the seat of the Coldham family from at least 1705. The Sandringham estate was bought by Queen Victoria in 1862 as a wedding present for the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, and neighbouring land was added to the estate in the subsequent years.  In 1896, the estate was purchased at auction for £25,000 by the famed serial fraudster[5] Ernest Terah Hooley before his first bankruptcy. The Prince had attempted to purchase the property prior to Hooley's acquisition.[6] Through an intermediary, the Prince asked Hooley that he be allowed to purchase it from him, ostensibly for his daughter Maud. Hooley agreed, allowing him to buy it at cost in 1898. It has been alleged that a motivation for the Prince's action was to avoid the possibility of Hooley's business promoter Alexander Meyrick Broadley, whom the Prince had earlier forced from Society, from becoming a constant guest on the estate, and therefore near-neighbour.[7] Together with the Prince's eldest son and an equerry, Broadley had been implicated in the Cleveland Street Scandal.[8][9]  Anmer Hall, shown with new roof, in October 2014  Anmer Hall was leased to John Loader Maffey, 1st Baron Rugby (1877–1969), who was to become Governor-General of the Sudan, Permanent Secretary of the Colonial Office and wartime Ambassador to Dublin. His daughter Penelope (1910–2005) socialised with the Royal Family, and was reportedly a favourite of King George V.  From 1972 to 1990, the house was leased to the Duke and Duchess of Kent as their country house. In February 1990, the Duke and Duchess of Kent left Anmer Hall, moving to Crocker End House in Nettlebed in Oxfordshire. From 1990 to 2000, it was rented by Hugh van Cutsem (1941–2013).[1] It was then leased to the family of James Everett, owner of kitchen timber company Norfolk Oak.[10]  In January 2013, it was reported that the Queen had allocated Anmer Hall for use by William, Duke of Cambridge, his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and family.[11][12][13] The lease to the Everett family was terminated early, before its expiry in 2017, to allow redevelopment.[14]  To accommodate the Duke and Duchess using the house as their main residence whilst William worked as a pilot for East Anglian Air Ambulance, a £1.5 million refurbishment programme was put in place. Paid for from private Royal family funds, this included: a complete new roof; new kitchen; the addition of a conservatory designed by architect Charles Morris (who previously designed extensions to Highgrove House);[1] complete internal redecoration; and an extensive tree-planting programme to afford the Duke and Duchess greater privacy.[15]",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,857

f347cbec-ad76-49b3-a515-8f745d4ecfa1,"Actor Ving Rhames says that police officers once held him at gunpoint in his own home in Santa Monica, California, after neighbors reported that a “large black man” had broken in.  The “Mission: Impossible” star recounted the event during a Friday interview on the Clay Cane show on Sirius XM. Rhames was responding to a question about how racism had affected his life.  Rhames said it was about 2:15 in the afternoon when he heard a knock on the front door.  “I open the door and there is a red dot pointed at my face from a 9 millimeter,” he said. “They say, ‘Put up your hands,’ literally.”  According to Rhames, he was confronted by three police officers, the captain of police and a police dog. The situation de-escalated after the captain recognized Rhames from their sons’ playing sports together and apologized. He said police told him they were responding to a 911 call from a woman who “said a large black man was breaking into the house.”  Ian Lawrence via Getty Images Ving Rhames filming scenes for ""Mission Impossible 6"" in London.  When Rhames and police questioned the woman who had allegedly made the report ― she lived across the street ― she denied ever calling, the actor said.  “Here I am in my own home, alone in some basketball shorts just because someone called and said a large black man is breaking in,” Rhames said. “When I opened up the wooden door, a 9 millimeter is pointed at me. My problem is ... what if it was my son and he had a video game remote or something, and you thought it was a gun?”  The Santa Monica Police Department released a public statement about the incident on Saturday. The statement said police received “several calls” from neighbors reporting that a “black male was seen entering a residence and did not live there.”  “As officers were assessing the residence, they encountered the resident at the front door,” the statement reads. “Officers recognized the resident and the situation was quickly de-escalated with no use of force occurring.”  While Rhames said the event happened this year, the press release describes it as occurring in July 2016. The statement adds that after the incident, the department launched a “Meet Your Neighbors” community initiative to encourage neighbors to get to know one another and “address situations such as these.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,461

7593ce6c-5dad-4e33-bd1c-7ea52b991246,"By Abigail Malbon 4 months ago  The public has well and truly fallen in love with royal bride-to-be Meghan Markle. Which must, by default, mean that Kate Middleton is jealous of her rising star. Right?  Short answer: no.  But, if the public speculation is anything to go by, you’d be forgiven for thinking so.  The Hollywood Gossip recently ran an article titled ‘Kate Middleton: Jealous of Meghan Markle?‘ in which they claimed that the Duchess’ upcoming third baby and lack of involvement in the royal wedding could mean “potential for resentment”.  Similarly, the Daily Beast wrote, ‘Step Aside, Kate. Meghan Is the New People’s Princess’.  But it’s not just the media. Millions of Twitter fan accounts are dedicated to Meghan, many of which seem to be focused on tearing down Kate Middleton in their wake.  The reality of royal life is very different.  9Honey’s royal correspondent Victoria Arbiter says there’s no truth in the rumours that there’s tension between the two.  “It’s interesting isn’t it? Society loves to pit women against women… so clearly because Meghan is suddenly so popular Kate must be cowering in the corner feeling sorry for herself,” she said.  “But I simply don’t think that’s how Kate operates.  RELATED: The biggest pressure Meghan Markle will face as a royal (post continues)  “She’s been in the royal fold since 2011, she’s done an incredibly good job...and I think Kate is very content with her role. She loves being a mother.  “I think she’s quite happy to let Harry and Meghan have the limelight at the moment, because it is a lot when you’re front and centre all the time, when you’re dealing with the press intrusion, public intrusion. And of course, in this day and age, when everyone has a camera phone, you really can’t ever escape it.”  The intrusion Victoria mentions was all new to Kate when she was introduced to the world as William’s fiancee in 2010, but flashing cameras and screaming fans are rather more familiar to former Suits actress Meghan.  (Getty)  While Kate had a family-orientated upper middle class upbringing in the UK, Meghan’s divorced - but loving - parents raised her in the USA. Kate went on to study at a prestigious British university, where she met William, while Meghan established her career in Hollywood. Kate married the man she met when she was a young woman, whereas Meghan is a divorcee.    But while their lives have been very different, the two women appear to be forming a close bond - one which, Victoria believes will be built on their unusual circumstances.  “I definitely think Kate will have been a tower of strength for Meghan,” she said. “And I think Kate will be offering Meghan everything which was perhaps lacking when she married into the royal family.”  Victoria believes that the public outpouring of love for Harry and Meghan might just be something of a welcome relief for the Duke and Duchess, who are about to become parents for the third time.  “I actually think William and Kate are going to be quite happy to take a bit of a step back, but also share the limelight with Meghan and Harry,” she explained.  The ""Fab Four"" - as they have already been coined by some - may have a world of pressure on their shoulders, but it seems more than likely that both Meghan and Kate are simply happy to have a friend to understand their unusual life path.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,699

USA TODAY Sports  Former Olympian Tonya Harding  Tonya Harding has long denied she knew a plan was afoot to injure Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships.  That, actually, was not the case, Harding said in Truth and Lies: The Tonya Harding Story that aired on ABC on Thursday night. In fact, she said she basically figured out that her ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and his friend, Shawn Eckardt, had likely been behind the plot to attack Kerrigan shortly after she won the U.S. figure skating title.  Harding stuck to her story that she's repeated for 24 years now: She had no role in planning the attack. In part of the interview that ran on Good Morning America earlier this week, Harding, however, said she did overhear Gillooly and Eckardt talking about ""taking somebody out"" to ensure Harding made the 1994 U.S. Olympic team.  ""It popped in my head two or three days after we got back (that Gillooly and Eckardt were involved),"" Harding said in part of the interview that didn't run until the two-hour special Thursday night.  MORE: Tonya Harding threatens to end interview with Piers Morgan  The special comes as I, Tonya, a sympathetic look at Harding's life that is in theaters, has received critical acclaim.  But Harding's mother isn't fan.  “I don’t give a (expletive) about the movie,"" said LaVona ""Sandy"" Golden, who was played by Allison Janney in the movie. ""I don’t care how it portrays me. I could care less about that movie than the dirt outside.”  MORE: Harding, mother give differing accounts of abuse, drinking  Janney, who won the best supporting actress in a motion picture at the Golden Globes on Sunday, portrayed Golden as a physically and mentally abusive mother.  Golden admitted to using a hairbrush to ""spank"" Harding at a competition, but denied she was habitually abusive toward Harding. Golden also denied she ever threw a steak knife that struck Harding in the arm during an argument.  “Take a lie detector (expletive),"" Harding said in response to her mother's denials.  MORE: 5 things we learned on the set of the crazy Tonya Harding biopic 'I, Tonya'  Kerrigan bristled during her short segment on the special when asked if her popularity is owed to the attack in Detroit.  ""I have two Olympics medals,"" Kerrigan said. ""They didn’t just give them to me. I worked hard for it. Who in their right mind would ask to be attacked? I would never wish that anyone. If I could change that, would I? Of course I would.”  Harding didn't deny the incident helped create more of a buzz around U.S. women's figure skating.  ""Sure. Why not?"" Harding said. ""I mean, I was there. I skated.”  Harding was convicted of hindering the prosecution in the aftermath of the attack on Kerrigan. She was spared prison time, unlike Gillooly, Eckardt and two men who carried out the attack (Shane Stant and getaway driver Derrick Smith).  ""Enough apologizing,"" Harding said. ""She has her life.

Kristen Bell began her career on Broadway in ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"". She has gone on to play leading or supporting roles in many film and TV projects including ""When in Rome"", ""Veronica Mars"", and the movie musical, ""Burlesque"". Born Kristen Anne Bell on July 18, 1980, in Huntington Woods, Michigan, she rose to prominence playing the title character in cable TV's ""Veronica Mars"". Those who were won over by her breakthrough turn as feisty, teen detective-in-training Veronica Mars on the eponymous series (UPN, 2004-07) might have missed out the fact that she had already put down her roots in acting as a performer in musical theater. Bell appeared on Broadway twice before she was cast in the lead of the critically acclaimed TV series that generated a small, but loyal following over its three year run. In the meantime, she also had the chance to prove further her versatility in an outrageous tongue-in-cheek musical comedy adaptation of the cult 1936 anti-marijuana propaganda movie, ""Reefer Madness: The Musical"" (2005). Kristen Bell's looks and charisma could be again enjoyed with another regular primetime role of hers, this time playing an unusually talented but mentally unstable woman on the sci-fi phenomenon, ""Heroes"" (NBC, 2006-2010). Even though she has been pursuing a fledgling film career, the actress also made some brief dips into horror and little-seen indie comedy. While Bell's leading role in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008), on the other hand, launched her into romantic comedy career and bumped up her status to big league Hollywood productions. Later on, she took on roles in a such films as ""You Again"" (2010), ""Burlesque"" (2010) and Safety Not Guaranteed (2012), before getting back to the small screen playing the lead character, Jeannie van der Hooven, on ""House of Lies"" (Showtime, 2012- ).

95a2f092-47e8-4445-a418-a17246dd31f7,"Late night TV was slammed by social media and news outlets for not addressing the sexual harassment allegations against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein last week, but late night let loose on Monday.  ABC's Jimmy Kimmel opened his Monday night show explaining how he got into a Twitter spat with Donald Trump Jr., who asked him on Twitter about his thoughts on Weinstein.  ""He's speaking, I don't know if you know about this, but there was an expose in the New York Times about decades of sexual harassment accusations made against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, who is not the President, and isn't particularly well-known outside of L.A. and New York,"" Kimmel said. ""But the insinuation was that we, as part of the biased left-wing media propaganda machine, wouldn't say anything about him because he's a Democrat. Never mind the thousands of jokes about Bill Cosby and Bill Clinton and all the other Bills of that ilk.""  The host also said that people pointed out that Weinstein was a Hillary Clinton supporter.  ""I'm not defending Hillary Clinton. The fact is, her campaign did take money from what turned out to be a high-profile man who has been accused of sexual harassment multiple times, and not just one of them, by the way. She took money from two of them!"" Kimmel said. ""Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump, who donated to Hillary's campaign in 2008.""  Hillary Clinton has, so far, not spoken publicly about the controversy.  Kimmel then ended his story with a joke about the producer, which he said he promised he would do.  ""What's the difference between Harvey Weinstein and the Pillsbury Doughboy?"" he said. ""When the Pillsbury Doughboy offers you a roll, he doesn't ask you to watch him take a shower for it.""  Stephen Colbert commented on the scandal during Monday night's episode of CBS' ""The Late Show,"" explaining that the producer was fired from his own production company -- The Weinstein Company. This, Colbert joked, forced them to change their name to something more positive: ""Asbestos Child Slappers, Inc.""  Colbert then rattled off a few jokes about the reported allegations against Weinstein, calling the producer's alleged behavior ""monstrous"" and ""indefensible.""  ""Weinstein's lawyers called him 'a dinosaur learning new ways,'"" Colbert said. ""Okay, A) that's no excuse, B) dinosaurs did not touch themselves in front of the employees. The T-Rex's arms were way too short.""  Related: Late night TV slammed for overlooking Harvey Weinstein scandal  Jimmy Fallon also made a joke about the subject during his opening monologue on Monday's ""Tonight Show.""

697c9de1-c7aa-4524-804f-04a8c8ae33a5,"This story contains spoilers for the “Outlander” season 2 finale and vague plot details from the third book in Diana Gabaldon’s series of novels, “Voyager,” on which season 3 will be based. If you want to go into season 3 with no knowledge of what might come, turn back now.  Season 2 of “Outlander” began with a disoriented Claire Fraser (Caitriona Balfe) returning through the standing stones at Craigh na Dun, alone and pregnant, to reluctantly reunite with her first husband, Frank (Tobias Menzies) in 1948. In the premiere, we saw Claire and Frank negotiating how they might raise a child together, with their relationship irrevocably strained by the events of Claire’s absence and the man she fell in love with during that time away.  Sunday’s finale, titled “Dragonfly in Amber,” showed us the harrowing moments leading up to that reunion, as Claire’s second husband, Jamie (Sam Heughan) convinced her to return to her own time in order to protect her and their unborn child, since he believed that he was destined to die with his men at the Battle of Culloden.  That seemed like the end of Claire and Jamie’s story (although fans of Diana Gabaldon’s novels already knew that there’s plenty more of this tale to be told, with eight books currently published and more to come — not to mention the fact that the show was already renewed for season 3 and season 4), until Claire discovered that Jamie survived both Culloden and the execution of Jacobite soldiers that followed the battle, meaning that there was a chance they could still reunite if she went back through the stones — albeit after 20 years apart.  Related 'Outlander' Producer on Dealing With 'Different Sensitivities' in Depicting Sexual Assault 'Outlander' Recap: Brianna Is Brutally Attacked in 'Wilmington'  Given the number of books in Gabaldon’s series (and the fact that viewers would probably riot if Sam Heughan suddenly disappeared from the show), it’s not much of a spoiler to say that Claire and Jamie will someday find each other again. “There’s a lot of challenges to season 3 — there’s a period of time where Jamie and Claire are apart; he thinks that he’s lost her, or at least that she’s alive and well but in the future, so what is he living for? What sort of man is he now?” Heughan observes. “She will eventually return, but they’re both older, so what is Jamie, who is the man he’s become” in the time since they last saw each other?  Those questions — “who is Jamie without Claire, why is he still surviving, what has he got to live for when he’s lost the woman that he loves” — will be central to the character in season 3, according to Heughan.  And therein lies both the tragedy and romance at the heart of the “Outlander” series, which, despite its genre-bending sensibilities, incisively explores the sometimes harsh realities of a lasting relationship, with all the triumphs, complications, joys and heartbreaks that go along with it. When they find their way back together after decades spent separated, Claire and Jamie will have to relearn what it means to be a couple, something that Balfe admits she’s eagerly anticipating in season 3.  “I think what’s going to be most exciting is the reunion between Claire and Jamie and them discovering each other again and falling in love all over again,” she tells Variety. “I think both of them have probably held each other up on a pedestal for 20 years, so in many ways, they’re going to have to destroy that image first before they can fall in love with the person right in front of them, and that’s going to be really interesting. I love the complexity of that, because you can’t be in love with a ghost, and Claire is in many ways in love with Jamie’s ghost, as Jamie is in love with her ghost, and that’s not the people they are when they see each other again.”  The season 2 finale may have jumped ahead in time to introduce us to Claire and Jamie’s daughter, Brianna, on the cusp of adulthood, but we still have 20 years of lost time to revisit, and the show isn’t likely to skip over all of it, especially since those life experiences will inevitably have shaped who Claire and Jamie are now that they’re middle-aged.  “What I’m so excited about as well next season is we’ll see, hopefully, some of her progression as a mother,” Balfe says. “So even though we’ve jumped forward in episode 13 [to see Claire] at 50, hopefully we’ll see some of that journey between late 20s and 50.”  While the actors had yet to read scripts for season 3 when they spoke to Variety before the finale aired, Gabaldon’s “Voyager” gives us some hints as to what we might see in the new season, including a final showdown between Jamie and Menzies’ Black Jack Randall, who was destined to die on Culloden Moor.  “If you’ve read the books you will know that Randall will appear again,” Heughan teases. “I know that Diana has written the scene of how they ended up [back together], so hopefully – and who knows, I haven’t read the script yet, but hopefully, we’ll get to see Jamie and Randall in the Battle of Culloden.”  We’re also likely to see Frank again, to give viewers a sense of the realities of his relationship with Claire. We know from some of Brianna’s comments in the finale that her parents’ marriage wasn’t particularly idyllic in its later years, and Menzies confirms that the tentative plan is for season 3 to explore the couple’s dynamic following the move to Boston, including “the disintegration of their marriage out there… it’s slightly ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf’ in Boston, which hopefully will be really exciting stuff to dig into.”  Balfe agrees, “The relationship between Claire and Frank is so rich and complex, I’m really looking forward to that.”  After the political intrigue of this season, Heughan says season 3 “feels like a very new chapter,” with trips to tropical climates that are far removed from the chill of Scotland. “There’s a lot of travel involved, and I think that’s the joy of the show — it’s never the same thing, it’s constantly moving, so next season should be quite an adventure.”  What are you most looking forward to seeing in “Outlander” season 3?

393d6ca7-1344-4f2d-a588-0f5146691034,"(Spoilers ahead for the Nov. 18 episode of “The Walking Dead” on AMC)  Maggie (Lauren Cohan) is gone, but she’s not dead. Last week’s episode of “The Walking Dead” revealed that she left the Hilltop with the mysterious Georgie during the big time jump that came at the end of Rick Grimes’ final episode.  And it turns out that may have also been Maggie’s final episode ever. Clearly, the creatives on the show and the folks at AMC are hedging their bets by not killing her off. But it’s entirely possible she’ll never appear on “The Walking Dead” ever again.  We had heard rumblings of Cohan’s exit from the series all year, following stories of a contentious contract dispute in which Cohan wanted equal pay with other longtime series regulars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus. After signing on to ABC’s “Whiskey Cavalier,” which will debut mid-season, Cohan did say she would be able to come back to “The Walking Dead” for at least part of Season 9.  Also Read: 'Walking Dead': Everything We Know, and Think We Know, About Georgie  But it looks like that part of the season is now over, as “TWD” showrunner Angela Kang has confirmed that they don’t have plans for her to appear again in Season 9. And on the episode of “Talking Dead” after the season 9 mid-season finale, Chris Hardwicke read a statement from the producers which re-confirmed that Cohan won’t be back this season but that “Maggie’s story is not done” and that they “hope to have her back” at some point in the future.  This all probably feels like it’s coming totally out of left field, considering how Maggie did not get any kind of real sendoff. Her final (as far as we know) episode also being Rick’s last didn’t help, since the episode basically functioned as Rick’s death episode.  But what AMC is doing with Rick may also be the path for wrapping up Maggie’s story. Two weeks ago, at the end of their final episode, Rick ended up being airlifted by helicopter away from Virginia, and what happens to him wherever he ends up will be the subject of a series of movies.  Also Read: Here's What You Need to Know About That Talking Zombie on 'The Walking Dead'  Meanwhile, it’s long been theorized that the helicopter belongs to the same group that Georgie hails from — the Commonwealth, an actual large city of people in Ohio. If that theory pans out, and Georgie’s people are also the helicopter’s people, then there’s plenty of reason for Rick and Maggie to cross paths in this new corner of the “Walking Dead” universe.  But everything remains shrouded in mystery, and it sounds like nobody involved actually knows at this time what Maggie’s fate will end up being. If Georgie actually is with the Commonwealth, then the subject of Maggie is going to have to come up again sooner or later — the Commonwealth is the next big storyline in the comics after the Whisperer War that is about to begin on the show.  Also Read: Apocalypse Not Yet? First 'Walking Dead' Without Andrew Lincoln Sees Steady Ratings  So, at least, you probably shouldn’t expect a Heath (Corey Hawkins) situation — remember how he went out scavenging with Tara and then just never came back, his fate still undetermined? Maggie is so important that her fate will have to be dealt with at some point in the next couple seasons of “The Walking Dead,” even if Lauren Cohan never comes back.

The duo filed to end their 10-year marriage on April 13, 2016, nearly two years after they originally announced their split. The divorce isn’t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.  Since then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.  “They’re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,” a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. “They continue to remain cordial to one another.

The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.”  During the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. “Jen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn’t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,” added the source.  “The kids love when they all spend time together,” said a second source.  When filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. “He’s found a really good routine,” an insider said. “He’s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.”  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus.

On Wednesday night, Garner was spotted out in N.Y.C. looking relaxed and happy. The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladurée.  Garner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who’s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. “As long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,” another insider said. “She will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.”  RELATED: Jennifer Garner and Kids Visit Ben Affleck in Hawaii for Easter Weekend  The actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles.

4dcd4934-6b41-4566-afb4-8ea31be2dc86,"James Franco Denies Sexual Misconduct Claims, Saying They're 'Not Accurate'  James Franco addressed the sexual misconduct claims circulating about him on social media Tuesday night, telling late-night host Stephen Colbert that ""the things I heard on Twitter are not accurate."" Colbert had mentioned the criticisms raised Sunday by actress Ally Sheedy in a series of since-deleted tweets — claims that were then followed by separate allegations by multiple women.  ""I have no idea why [Sheedy] was upset. She took the tweet down. I don't know, I can't speak for her,"" he told Colbert toward the end of their interview promoting Franco's film The Disaster Artist. ""The others — look, in my life I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I've done. I have to do that to maintain my well-being. I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong or needs to be changed.""  ""The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,"" he added, ""but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn't have a voice for so long. So, I don't want to shut them down in any way.""  YouTube  Franco's comments come several days after the Golden Globes award ceremony, where he won for best actor in a comedy or musical. During the broadcast, his evident support for ""Time's Up,"" an initiative seeking to end sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, prompted disgust from Sheedy and others.  ""James Franco just won,"" Sheedy, whom Franco directed in a 2014 off-Broadway show, said on Twitter. ""Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business.""  In an earlier tweet, Sheedy had asked: ""Why is James Franco allowed in?""  Both tweets, which lodged no specific allegations, have since been deleted, but at least two other women posted claims against the actor and director.  Filmmaker Sarah Tither-Kaplan alleged a contract she signed with Franco regarding nudity in two of his films was exploitative, and actress Violet Paley addressed a tweet to Franco, saying, ""Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17?""  ""A couple weeks ago, James offered me & a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone 'apology,' "" Paley later tweeted, adding: ""I don't accept.""  Neither allegation has been independently confirmed by NPR.  Still, the simmering controversy was enough to dissuade The New York Times from holding an event featuring Franco. The paper canceled that event, which had been scheduled for Wednesday.  ""The event was intended to be a discussion of the making of the film, 'The Disaster Artist.' Given the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we're no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein,"" the Times explained in a statement to The New York Daily News.  Franco remains scheduled to make another late-night appearance Wednesday, on Late Night with Seth Meyers on NBC.  In Tuesday night's conversation with Colbert, Franco reiterated his support for ""Time's Up,"" saying he backs the drive for pay equity in the workplace, ""which just means people that are underrepresented — women and people of color, people in the LGBT community — get leadership positions, that they fill all positions that they've been deprived of.""

75d4849f-21f9-446a-9b5a-ea49401c2f43,"Selena Gomez has created such a huge name for herself as a singer, big-screen actress, and style star that it's easy to forget that she got her start on the Disney Channel, playing the lead role of Alex Russo on Wizards of Waverly Place from 2008 to 2012. The young songstress turns 24 on July 22 and like any child star trying to navigate their way through adulthood in the public eye, Selena's life hasn't been without pitfalls; she spent time in a treatment center for two weeks back in January 2014, a stay that her rep said was ""not for substance abuse,"" and has been at the center of rumors concerning her famous friendships with Taylor Swift, Kendall Jenner, and Demi Lovato, as well as her on-again, off-again romance with Justin Bieber (and let's not even get started on his recent career setbacks).  While Selena's journey has included its fair share of ups and downs, it's worth noting that the actress and singer seems to be experiencing a lot of the same things that many women in their early 20s go through; friends coming and going, relationships falling apart (and rekindling), doing a little partying, and even getting tattoos.

a2734381-e1a5-432a-8287-e21e719f53dc,"Either You're the Fastest or Not: Michael Fassbender on His Car-Racing Obsession  The two-time Academy Award nominee is part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers and is fresh off a first-place finish in the first of six series at the Daytona Ferrari Challenge, with another race on June 9.  ""What have I learned?"" With the din of race cars screaming around the Laguna Seca racetrack outside Monterey, California, Michael Fassbender — wearing a racing suit, hair mussed from the Nomex balaclava and helmet he's had on his head all morning — leans in as a big grin spreads over his face. ""I've learned that I'm always two seconds off where I need to be.""  Two seconds in a line reading might not mean much, but on this 2.2-mile track with 11 turns (on the corkscrew, ""head for the tree,"" he advises), it's an awful lot of time. Part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers, from Paul Newman and Steve McQueen to Patrick Dempsey, Fassbender — who spent his childhood in Ireland glued to the TV watching Michael Schumacher win one F1 title after another — is the real deal.  The 41-year-old star, who picked up the sport in 2016, possesses an encyclopedic, arcane knowledge of 1980s Group B rally racing and has logged more than 120 hours behind the wheel of his 488 Ferrari Challenge car — valued at $330,000, featuring a 670-horsepower, 3.9-liter turbocharged V-8 engine. It's numbered 133, because, as he says, ""three is my lucky number.""  Luck, though, had little to do with Fassbender winning the first of six series (his next race is in Montreal on June 9) in the Ferrari Challenge 2018 season, which opened at Florida's Daytona Speedway in January, where speeds exceed 190 miles per hour. Says Ferrari Challenge head instructor Didier Theys: ""From the start, Michael has shown a great deal of dedication and talent as a competitor.""  Racing is the reward that rounds out a career marked (so far) by two Oscar nominations, for his work in 2013's 12 Years a Slave and 2015's Steve Jobs.  ""It's one of the things about the job that I do that's a huge perk, just an absolute dream come true,"" says Fassbender, who lives in Lisbon, Portugal, with Alicia Vikander, whom he married in October. ""It was always a goal to do some sort of racing at 40, but I didn't imagine that I'd be in a series like this with very powerful, very fast 660-odd horsepower machines."" Fassbender adds with a laugh, ""It's a lot more fun prepping for this than learning lines at home,"" the downside being, ""if you miss an apex or mess up a corner, you don't get a 'take two.'""  He points out the other contrast between his two chosen vocations — the type of risk involved: ""It's a different kind of butterflies. For a film, I've usually been putting together this character, but haven't really shown it to anybody. That first day of shooting, it's like, 'God, I hope this works.' But racing, once you start doing it, focusing on what you have to do, you can't think of anything else. When you're driving, literally, if your mind wanders, you're going to go off the track.""  There's a process to maintaining composure while white-knuckling it for four 30-minute races over weekends that begin with Thursday practice laps and end Sunday. Says Fassbender, ""When it comes to the first practice day, your brain and body have to assimilate to these high speeds. You get into the car and think, 'Oh, God, I can't do this,' but it's incredible how the body and mind adapt — it's just about focusing and trying to get in a rhythm. Racing is something that really does bring that level of forced meditation — it's very rare in life.""  Over time, the actor, who plays Magneto in February's X-Men: Dark Phoenix, has reached an understanding about anxiety: ""Before my first race here last year, I literally thought I was going to vomit. I was in the toilet beforehand, breathing. I was nervous, but that feeling is pretty special, that first race feeling.""  With Fassbender, winning really does seem to matter. ""Like many of his fellow drivers, he's something of a perfectionist and determined to win,"" says Theys.  Notes the star, making a nod to a perspective that many a fellow Oscar nominee might share: ""You race to win, for sure, that's the goal. Either you're fastest or you're not — that's the allure for me. It's always great to be on the podium.""  This story first appeared in the June 6 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

7ec9616c-25e1-4b3f-ae4b-f577ecbfdb71,"The rumor mill is churning out some fake news about Barbados' own Rihanna.  In a video being circulated, which is entitled - Rihanna: ‘If Jesus Hasn’t Answered Your Prayers, Try Satan’, published December 2, 2017, on the World News Today YouTube Channel, a scripted voice says that Rihanna told the audience that growing up in Bridgetown was not easy and that you have to work twice as hard to make it. And the British anonymous voice went on to say that she said:  ""You have to hustle. I’m still hustling, but I am living proof that you can do anything... If you came here for tips I can give y’all the biggest one straight off...  ""If y'all have prayed to Jesus for years, prayed with all your hearts and got nothing back from him? ... Jesus doesn't care about you. Do you really even think he even listening? Hot tip y'all because you are my people, be efficient, go to satan.""  Then it went on to claim that the Prime Minister of Barbados the Rt. Hon. Freundel Stuart intervened hastily and shocked parents removed their children. On the night in question, the Prime Minister conferred the title of Cultural Ambassador on Robyn 'Rihanna' Fenty.  The only thing the video got right in that blurb was the name of Barbados' Prime Minister.  There was also an article on YourNewsWire.com with the same title and the same quotes written by Baxter Dmitry and posted December 1, 2017.  Loop News was there on site and recorded Rihanna's speech. Honoured, the young Grammy-award winner encouraged children and persons to believe in their dreams and have faith in God.  Rihanna told the crowd which included her friends and family, and numerous dignitaries, that she had no idea how she would get discovered on this little Rock but her dreams started on Westbury New Road, now named Rihanna Drive and she believed in her dreams, so ""believe in your dreams"", as cliche as it may sound.  Rihanna added:  ""I always knew it would happen, I always focused on the result, and that kind of faith, it really was just faith that childlike faith, that even now when I get a little bit discouraged or doubtful, it’s the thing that I go back to, having faith in God, like that even as a child.”  (Photo caption: Rihanna with her head bowed during the opening prayer at the renaming ceremony. (PHOTO: Richard Grimes))  On the fake YouTube video many people in the comments said that the video was a hoax and a lie. People called for the voice clip and video showing Rihanna making that fabricated speech and they asked why the video was missing from all other news agencies.  The ceremony was also broadcast live on TV in Barbados so tens of thousands of Bajans can refute the lies in the video and article aforementioned as well.

5735e9a9-8d57-48e7-95ab-3359064f18cb,"THE joke was a quick one. It showed Family Guy’s infant Stewie running naked screaming, “Help! I’ve escaped from Kevin Spacey’s basement!”  But that 2005 animated clip went viral when Spacey was accused of assaulting several young men in a November 2017 bombshell that lost the 58-year-old actor his House Of Cards gig and led him to “seek evaluation and treatment”.  Family Guy creator, and star, Seth MacFarlane said on Thursday at the Television Critics Association’s Winter Press Tour he wasn’t the one who pitched the controversial joke that made its way into the years-old episode and left many fans wondering what MacFarlane knew about Spacey ahead of the public revelations.  “I don’t remember who pitched the joke,” he told reporters on Thursday. “I remember when it was pitched that was a rumour that I had actually not heard, and other writers in the writers’ room had. It had to be explained to me.”  Showrunner Alec Sulkin said he too wasn’t the one who came up with it, but he remembered a bit more about its genesis. He said the timing of the quip came because Spacey initially said he had been attacked by a young person in London one night in 2004. Later, he changed his story and said he tripped over his dog after the young person mugged him.  “I think he had sort of been beaten up in a London park and he claimed he was walking his dog and fell and I think that sort of raised a lot of eyebrows,” Sulkin recalled.  MacFarlane insisted the show doesn’t have a sixth sense running the writers’ room.  “The idea that Family Guy is this cartoon Ouija board that predicts things … I was just watching things happen from afar,” he told the room full of journalists on Thursday. “I think it’s sort of modern media. The idea that it’s more important to be first than to be right. It’s a strange thing to observe. We write our show the same way as everyone else. We make the same kind of topical jokes that The Simpsons does, [that] South Park does. And you work with what you have whether that be swirling rumours or political [material].”  The show previously made headlines for a 2009 quip in which Stewie called then Bruce Jenner “an elegant, beautiful Dutch woman”. In 2015, the former Olympian opened up about being transgender and began using the name Caitlyn Jenner.  “The myth that Family Guy is this Kreskin-like prognosticator of this kind of stuff is a little bit sensationalised,” MacFarlane insisted.  The show is currently celebrating its upcoming 300th episode.  “I don’t know that anyone ever really expected this show to go this long,” he added.  He said the show has evolved “with the times” which has enabled it to succeed.

She’s this wonderful, elegant person,” Anna Kendrick (as Stephanie) says of Lively’s character in the preview, which the latter debuted Wednesday morning via her Twitter account. Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Golding, who plays Emily’s husband, Sean, continues: “She is an enigma, my wife. You can get close to her, but never quite reach her.”  As quick flashes of police sirens, a violent car crash, and deliciously smirky glances flash onscreen, Emily reminds us: “Everybody has a dark side. Some of us are better at hiding it than others.”  The biggest reveal the trailer presents, however, is Emily grinning in a crimson wig after Stephanie explains: “Five days ago, Emily went missing. I’m realizing I don’t know her as well as I thought I did. Emily, if you’re out there, we’re all really worried!”  In anticipation of the trailer’s release, Lively sent fans into a tizzy Monday by deleting all of her Instagram posts save for a single photo of a hangman-style game which spelled out the question, “What happened to Emily?” As of Wednesday, Lively unfollowed most of the accounts she previously tracked, and is now following only women named Emily Nelson — 37 of them, to be exact.  A Simple Favor — also starring Rupert Friend, Jean Smart, Linda Cardellini, Andrew Rannells, and Sarah Baker — is set for release on Sept. 14.

71a3ae77-a99b-440d-b9de-66f3e7c38ada,"The scandal surrounding Bachelor in Paradise isn't over yet.  The lawyer for contestant Corinne Olympios, who was at the center of the alleged misconduct that led to production being suspended on the ABC reality series, is speaking out hours after producer Warner Bros. announced that it had closed its internal investigation into the claim and that production on the current fourth season would resume.  ""It needs to be made crystal clear that production of Bachelor in Paradise was shut down because of multiple complaints received from BIP producers and crewmembers on the set. It was not shut down due to any complaint filed by Corinne against anyone,"" Olympios' lawyer, Martin Singer, said in a statement. ""It comes as no surprise that Warner Bros., as a result of its own internal investigation, would state that no wrongdoing had occurred. Our own investigation will continue based on multiple new witnesses coming forward revealing what they saw and heard.""  Early Tuesday, Warner Bros. TV announced that production would resume on the current fourth season of the spinoff after an internal investigation found no evidence of the alleged misconduct that was first reported on June 11. ""We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a castmember. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any castmember was ever in jeopardy,"" Warner Bros. said in a statement.  Despite the delay in production, ABC confirmed that Bachelor in Paradise would air this summer as planned. ""We appreciate the swift and complete investigation by Warner Bros. into allegations of misconduct on the set of Bachelor in Paradise,"" a network spokesperson said in a statement. ""Given their results, the series will resume production, and will air this summer on ABC.""  Shortly after announcing the cast for this summer's season on June 6, Warner Bros. halted production to investigate a misconduct incident on the Sayulita, Mexico, set. A producer filed a complaint over an alleged sexual encounter between two contestants who had been drinking, Olympios and DeMario Jackson. It remains unclear if the producer witnessed the incident or had seen the footage, though sources tell The Hollywood Reporter Olympios was ""lucid"" and ""conversational"" on the tape. Still, since alcohol was involved, there was a question of whether one or both parties may have been too intoxicated to give consent.  The season four castmates were sent back to the U.S. the same day Warner Bros. announced the investigation, with most arriving home by June 12. When the cast was told to pack their bags, they were informed that they ""might"" return. It remains unclear if either Jackson or Olympios will return to continue filming.  Both Olympios and Jackson lawyered up in the days following the production suspension, with Olympios retaining top Hollywood litigator Singer and Jackson hiring L.A.-based attorney Walter Mosley.  Olympios issued her first and so far only statement about the matter on June 14. ""I am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4,"" she said at the time. ""Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production.  ""As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.""  While many of those associated with the show, including series creator Mike Fleiss, host Chris Harrison and several of the contestants from the current season celebrated Warner Bros.' decision to resume filming, other insiders are questioning the move after Bachelor in Paradise appeared all but destined for cancellation in recent days following fallout from the scandal.  As part of its lengthy statement Tuesday, Warner Bros. said it plans to ""implement changes to the show's policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.""  It also remains unclear what will happen to the tape of the alleged incident at the center of the investigation, which Warner Bros. said Tuesday it does not plan to release ""out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved."" That videotape could be a key piece of evidence in Singer's ongoing investigation into what transpired.  Before being selected for Bachelor in Paradise, Olympios appeared on season 21 of The Bachelor, where she competed for Nick Viall's affections. She placed fourth.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,904

In 2012, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection against a debt of $49.5 million.  Chrisley is very conscious about disclosing his financial details. The chapter 7 bankruptcy papers revealed that he only had $4.2 million in assets, $55 in a bank account and $100 in cash when he filed the bankruptcy in 2012. According to his lawyers, he had to file bankruptcy because of a single hefty investment that went bad. On the other hand, numerous market experts have claimed that the 2008's housing market collapse triggered his bankruptcy.  Being untouched by the negative net worth, he still lives extravagantly. The reality star still lives in $2 million worth mansion. Previously, he lived in a lavish 30,000-sq.-ft. comfy Atlanta mansion with his wife and five children worth of $2.4 million. The bankruptcy papers also disclosed that he had outstanding mortgages of around $12 million plus a $4.4 million unpaid loan from his wife, Julie. Moreover, he was once spending over $300,000 annually just on clothing.  Ultimately, Chrisley came out unscathed from his bankruptcy and negative net-worth. He is an actor and producer renowned for ""Chrisley Knows Best"" (2014), Steve Harvey""(2012) and 52nd Annual Academy of Country Music Awards""(2017). He has been maintained a positive financial image at present, thanks to his reality show called 'Chrisley Knows Best,' which features Todd's life and his family.

1ae88da5-a88b-46fe-8860-2bd0b7e5c98e,"Wednesday afternoon, Olympic gold medalist and gymnastics phenom Simone Biles tweeted this:  there is a gavin meme for everything — Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 10, 2016  Ah, yes, Gavin. The guy we all know and love. Gavin!  Still confused? Biles’s teammate Laurie Hernandez replied with a reaction meme featuring Gavin.  when you win a gold medal at the Olympics: pic.twitter.com/tyhs9gD0ya — Laurie Hernandez (@LaurieHernandez) August 10, 2016  There he is! Gavin.  At a time when the eyes of the world are upon Biles and Hernandez performing miraculous athletic feats, the eyes of Biles and Hernandez are on some kid named Gavin.  Well, “some kid” is underselling it: Gavin is the 5-year-old nephew of Vine star Nick Mastodon, a 30-year-old from Minnesota who was one of Vine’s earliest stars thanks to his videos combining Disney movies with Top 40 hits. In November of 2013, he made the viral “Suck a Dick” vine (22 million loops and counting) with his friend Dustin Hatzenbuhler.  “Not the most family-friendly thing we’ve ever made,” Mastodon admitted when I spoke to him on the phone, “but most people seem to enjoy it. And throughout that time in 2013, I started putting my nephew Gavin, who was 2 at the time — he would appear in my videos. And people thought he was cute, but they didn’t really take notice of him a whole lot.”  In the spring of 2014, Mastodon posted an innocuous video of Gavin with a crested gecko on his forehead. He wasn’t expecting much of a response, but it blew up.  “People started to comment about his reaction and how great it was,” he recalls. “And I was like, Let’s find other ways to capture him in funny situations and see if he can make that face some more. He just made a whole lot of different faces; it’s just something he seems to be good at without even trying.”  Gavin kept appearing on Nick’s Vine account over the next two years, and then, all of a sudden, Gavin started blowing up. “It wasn’t up until, like, this past June that he really blew up, and I think it was because more and more big meme accounts were posting pictures of him.” Meme accounts like @chanelpuke and @tinatbh and the like, which trade and copy memes from each other like playing cards. (Know Your Meme credits the account @wedecideit with blowing up Gavin’s spot.) Once they had drawn attention to Gavin, he was everywhere.  With dozens of Vines to choose from, it was easy to find a Gavin reaction face for any situation. I went from not knowing who Gavin was to seeing 20 different pictures of him in the span of a few days. On Instagram, his mom, Katie, has roughly ten times more followers than she did two months ago.  In addition to the Team USA shout-out, Gavin has drawn the attention of stars like Katy Perry and Skai Jackson. Shawn Mendes invited Gavin to his show when he was in town.  The attention of celebrities in tweets like Biles’s are a good indication of just how megaviral Gavin is. “Those types of things are just fun,” Mastodon says, “because they were just talking about him and just addressing him, referring to him on a first-name basis. And I think that that’s really powerful, to show how popular he is or how recognizable his name is.”  “I think the word phenomenon is a good word for it,” he said. “There was definitely a buildup to it, but the fact that all of a sudden so many people are using his pictures and his videos, and there’s Twitter feeds or streams of our old Vines and some of the newer stuff, and just the rate at which this stuff is getting shared is pretty incredible.”  When you send a risky text and 5 mins later you open up messages and see the three little dots pic.twitter.com/5tgXnVDlIu — Gavin Reactions (@GavinReacts) August 1, 2016  Exactly how aware Gavin is of his internet fame is up for debate. Fans ask to take pictures with him, and he knows that they know him from Vine, but the sheer scale is lost on him. “The only thing I worry about, really, is that he would ever resent any of us for making these videos and posting these pictures,” Mastodon admitted. Some of the money Mastodon makes from doing sponsored Vines goes toward Gavin’s college fund. “I think that it will definitely come down to how we explain what’s happening or how it happens. I’m hoping that he thinks it’s cool. I’m hoping that it’s not something that he gets teased about. I think his parents feel the same way.”  For the foreseeable future, though, Gavin will continue to grace our screens with his presence.

The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place.The Syrian Red Crescent said their hospital in Douma received six patients complaining of respiratory problems, but said they didn’t seem to have any physical problems at all, nor was there any trace of any chemical agents they might’ve been exposed to.(This has been retracted, it is incorrect.)Chemical attack or no, it wouldn’t be surprising for some people to complain of symptoms without actually having any problems. That the Red Crescent operates a hospital in a city supposedly inundated with wounded and didn’t get a single patient with confirmed exposure, however, is very noteworthy.The Russian Defense Ministry also reported that their own medics had examined some patients in Douma, and had the same result, that none showed signs of chemical poisoning.

By Mark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty Images.  Each week in April, Vanity Fair will flash back to a different British royal wedding in the lead-up to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s May 19 nuptials.  When Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, he presented her with his mother’s own engagement ring—a 12-carat Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 14 round diamonds that Princess Diana had picked out from court jeweler Garrard before her own fairy-tale wedding to Prince Charles.  “It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement and the fact that we’re going to spend the rest of our lives together,” William told press afterward.  Even though Princess Diana was represented, from that point forward, by the iconic ring sitting on Middleton’s finger, Kate made sure in the following six months to pay tribute to “the inspirational woman” who would have been her mother-in-law. A week before the wedding, as worldwide anticipation reached a fever pitch, Kate reportedly made a special trip with William to Diana’s burial site—venturing 90 minutes’ northwest of London to the 13,000-acre Althorp Estate that has belonged to the Spencer family since the 16th century. The pair reportedly took a boat to lay flowers at Diana’s Oval Island resting place; wandered the princess’s ancestral estate; and walked through the arboretum where William and Harry planted trees as children.  “It was very important for William to take Kate to visit his mum just before their wedding day,” a source told The Mirror at the time. “Diana is still a huge part of her boy’s everyday life and always will be. Even though Kate never met Diana she knows what an incredible woman she was and it is very important to her she can share and understand William’s love and grief for his mum. . . . It is tragic that she won’t be there to see the wedding and that she never got to meet his bride.”  The tributes continued. Though William and Kate married at a different site than Charles and Diana—Charles, an architecture and music buff, had opted for the more handsome, acoustically sound St. Paul’s Cathedral—the bride and groom incorporated other homages. Like Diana, Kate had a small blue bow sewn into her wedding dress for good luck, and antique lace repurposed in the design as her “something old.” (Aside from those touches—plus the white color, long sleeves, and gauzy veil—there were few other similarities between Kate and Diana’s wedding dresses. Kate’s gown—a Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen design, rumored to cost $434,000, was an elegant A-line, with an elaborate bodice appliqué woven with shamrock, roses, and lilies, and a nine-foot train.)  Top, from Bettmann/Getty Images; bottom, by Odd Andersen/AFP/Getty Images.  Both Diana and Kate wore drop earrings from their parents—Diana’s earrings featured 50 small diamonds around pear-shaped pearls, which had belonged to her mother, while Kate’s were commissioned by her parents to include elements from the Middleton coat of arms. Both brides also wore a tiara, though Diana wore the Spencer tiara—a diamond floral diadem dating back to the Tudor period. (It has been rumored that Meghan Markle might wear the tiara as a nod to Princess Diana on her wedding day.) Kate, meanwhile, borrowed Queen Elizabeth II’s Cartier Halo Scroll Tiara—which had been gifted to the monarch on her 18th birthday.  Inside Westminster Abbey on the morning of April 29, 2011, there were more nods to Diana. When Prince William arrived at the Abbey, with best man Prince Harry in tow, the first person the groom greeted was Diana’s eldest sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale—“clutching her hands affectionately” in the minutes before the ceremony, according to The Telegraph. The Spencer family—including Diana’s brother Earl Spencer—had been given a front-row pew at the Abbey, and William welcomed them all warmly. Time additionally reported that McCorquodale was wearing the very earrings that Diana wore during her 1981 vows—which had been flown in from a museum where they were on display specifically for the occasion.  The wedding address was delivered by Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London who had served as a trustee of Princess Diana’s will and presided over the princess’s funeral. William and Kate chose the hymn “Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer”—which was the final selection sung at Diana’s funeral. As for the guest list, William made sure to invite Elton John, his late mother’s friend who famously performed at Diana’s funeral—which also took place at Westminster Abbey.  Top, by Anwar Hussein/Getty Images; bottom, by Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images.  Speaking about the uncanniness of being present at Westminster Abbey for both Diana’s funeral and William’s wedding, Elton John told press, “I can’t imagine at that young age having to walk in the public, following your mother’s coffin. . . . And the next time we’re in the Abbey it’s to see him walking up the aisle with a beautiful woman, the love of his life. I think it’s the most joyous result and I’m sure Diana would be very, very happy about it.”  Elton conceded that he had only met William and Harry twice, but was touched by the symbolic invitation: “I think it’s going to be a very joyous day and I think [Diana] would be very happy with his choice, [Kate] seems such a great girl and they seem so much in love.”  In a nod to Diana’s charitable spirit, William also invited representatives from organizations Diana championed—like Centrepoint, a homelessness charity, and the Royal Marsden Hospital—and asked that, in lieu of gifts, well-wishers make donations to a fund that would be divided between 26 organizations.  Top, from Princess Diana Archive/Getty Images; bottom, by Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images.  The newlyweds departed Westminster Abbey to the sounds of William Walton’s orchestral march “Crown Imperial”—which was similarly played at Charles and Diana’s wedding. As the bells rang a full peal, William and Kate boarded the open-top 1902 State Landau carriage—the same vehicle that transported Charles and Diana back to Buckingham Palace after their own wedding—and took a similar route, waving their way through London’s adoring crowds. Once back at Buckingham Palace, bride and groom made an appearance on the balcony. When the crowd urged William to kiss his bride—just as Charles had done in 1981, in a rare break from royal-wedding tradition—William happily obliged.  Later that evening, when Prince Harry gave his best-man speech at an intimate Buckingham Palace reception, he reportedly told his older brother, “Our mother would be so proud of you.”  Wedding Breakfast  After the wedding, Queen Elizabeth hosted approximately 650 people for a luncheon reception at Buckingham Palace—where she served miniature Yorkshire puddings with beef, Cornish-crab salad on lemon blini bites, and Scottish smoked salmon. In addition to a traditional fruitcake, Prince William had specially requested a chocolate biscuit cake, made from a royal-family recipe. When the couple left, they did so in Prince Charles’s Aston Martin—which Prince Harry had customized with balloons and a “JU5T WED” license plate.  Wedding Gifts  Though Kate and William asked well-wishers for charitable donations, the couple still received traditional gifts—including their cocker spaniel Lupo (a gift from Kate’s brother James Middleton); a tandem bike (from London mayor Boris Johnson); and a cover of Stevie Wonder’s 1972 ballad “You and I” specifically recorded by George Michael for the occasion.  Reception Revelry  The day was capped with an intimate reception at Buckingham Palace, with a three-course meal prepared by Prince Charles’s favorite chef Anton Mosimann: crab layered with fresh langouistine, followed by herb-stuffed Welsh lamb, and a dessert of chocolate mousse, honeycomb ice cream and traditional sherry trifle. Kate had changed into a strapless evening dress with a diamanté sash, and angora-wool bolero, while William had swapped his Irish Guards dress for a tuxedo. Each table was reportedly named after a town or city special to the couple—like St. Andrews, where the couple met.  “Just before midnight,” according to Vanity Fair’s report from Katie Nicholl, “Harry announced, ‘We have a little surprise,’ and led guests through to the Throne Room, which had been transformed into a nightclub complete with mirrored balls, sofas, and cocktails. The bride and groom were the first to take to the dance floor, to a rendition of Elton John’s ‘Your Song’ by Ellie Goulding, whom they had specifically requested for the evening. . . . Then it was time for the real fun to begin. The disco kicked into full swing, and [Kate’s mother] Carole [Middleton], dazzling in a floor-length black chiffon gown, was one of the last ones dancing to her requested song, Jermaine Stewart’s ‘We Don’t Have to Take Our Clothes Off.’ Around 2:30 a.m., guests were asked to make their way to the courtyard for a fireworks display.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1897

8f972c21-141a-4a08-b16e-a0341741c757,"Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.  / Updated By Kalhan Rosenblatt and Rima Abdelkader  Wall Street is going to the dogs — or at least it did for a few hours on Monday.  That’s when artist Alex Gardega installed a pug statue called “Sketchy Dog,” which appeared to be urinating on the “Fearless Girl” statue’s leg.  ""Most people were amused or perplexed by it,"" Gardega told NBC News. ""Kids petted it, people were taking pictures with it. A few were upset and kicked it.""  Gardega said he created his clay and faux bronze “Sketchy Dog” as an act of solidarity with guerilla artist Arturo Di Modica, who created Wall Street’s iconic “Charging Bull” statue.  “I have a lot of empathy for the creator of the bull, Arturo. He is very upset,” Gardega said.  Artist Alex Gardega placed his ""sketchy dog"" statue next to ""Fearless Girl."" Alex Gardega  Di Modica finished “Charging Bull” after the 1987 stock market collapse, and placed it in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a symbol of American resilience. The city initially removed it, but later re-installed it in its current location near Wall Street in the Financial District.  Conversely, the “Fearless Girl” statue, was commissioned by one of the world’s largest banks — State Street Global Advisors — as a way to call attention to the gender pay gap and a lack of women on corporate financial sector boards, according to the company.  State Street is also the creator of the Gender Diversity Index SHE, which tracks gender diversity in companies. An inscription at the feet of “Fearless Girl” reads, “Know the Power of Leadership, SHE makes a difference.""  “That piece, [‘Fearless Girl’] was not made by some individual artist making a statement,” Gardega said. “It was made by a billion dollar financial firm trying to promote an index fund. It is advertising/promotion in the guise of art. That was my only point.”  But Gardega said there is some value in the “Fearless Girl” sculpture. He said it’s clear that it makes children happy, and “art is supposed to make kids happy.”  After approximately three hours, Gardega took his “Sketchy Dog” down.  ""I didn't want to leave it to be taken and certainly had no rights [sic] to bolt it to the ground,"" he said.  In response to the ""Sketchy Dog"" statue, State Street Global Advisors said it was proud of what ""Fearless Girl"" represented.  ""We continue to be grateful to the countless people around the world who continue to responded so enthusiastically to what the Fearless Girl represents — the power and potential of having more women in leadership,"" a State Street spokeswoman wrote in an email to NBC News. ""Fearless Girl was created to stand as a reminder that having more women in leadership positions positively contributes to overall performance and strengthens our economy.""  Gardega said that there’s nothing inherently wrong with the “Fearless Girl,” and he created “Sketchy Dog” with a sense of humor, but he said neither piece should interfere with Di Modica’s work.  “I'm a pretty happy person, not seething or angry and certainly not anti-feminist. My piece is not without a sense of humor but I do feel for Arturo and the integrity of his art,” Gardega said. “There is plenty of room for ‘Fearless Girl.’ It just interferes with another artist's work/vision.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,703

6154d00f-c187-4163-9330-2a4b61227b7f,"Michelle Obama and Barack Obama might be two of the most-missed former residents of the White House. Even though Obama's presidency ended over a year-and-a-half ago, the couple known for being #relationshipgoals has recently come back into the spotlight. With Obama's 57th birthday on Saturday, Aug. 4, Michelle took to social media to wish her husband a happy birthday with a sweet post about him. Michelle Obama wished Barack Obama happy birthday with a thoughtful photo and message to Obama on Instagram.  Like any good significant other in the age of technology, Michelle made sure that she wished Obama a happy birthday on social media. The photo of Obama on Instagram and Twitter is accompanied by a short caption, but Michelle did anything but phone it in on this one. She posted what looks like a personal picture of Obama looking deep in thought as he overlooks a desert, and she wrote,  Happy birthday @BarackObama! The view is always better with you.  OK, you can now add ""expert at writing captions"" to Michelle's resume. I mean, c'mon, that post is sure to bring a smile to Obama's face when he sees it. Would you really expect anything less from this couple, though?  These two have proven time and again that they know how to keep their relationship going strong. Just look at their date night on the weekend of July 28, when the couple attended Beyoncé and JAY-Z's OTR II tour in Maryland. Not only did they make time to spend together at the show, but they spent that time doing what you should be doing at a Beyoncé concert: dancing! Seriously, the Obamas showed that they know how to move to the music, and the lucky concertgoers around them caught it all on video — but beware to get all the FOMO when you watch it.  When it comes to birthdays, though, it really isn't shocking that Michelle knocked it out of the park with this post. Her short and sweet caption about how ""the view is always better"" with Obama is such a thoughtful message to her husband. The swoon-worthy birthday posts must be a hallmark of their relationship, because Obama also shared an IG post to his better half on Jan. 17 to celebrate Michelle's big day. He wrote,  You're not only my wife and the mother of my children, you're my best friend. I love your strength, your grace, and your determination. And I love you more each day. Happy Birthday, @MichelleObama  It's not only birthdays that bring out the sweet messages from this couple, though. Obama also wrote Michelle a Valentine's Day post on Feb. 14 that said she makes ""every day and every place better."" I'm inclined to agree with the former POTUS on that one.  Really, there is no shortage of examples of how these two celebrate and lift each other up on the most special days in their lives. I would like to imagine that they are also they kind of couple that leaves little love notes for each other around the house on a daily basis.  Of course, I don't know if that's how the Obamas roll, but I do know they've perfected the art of the social media birthday post. Hopefully Obama is brainstorming Michelle's post for January!",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,629

And on one July afternoon, Taylor Swift was so eager to prevent pictures of her and boyfriend Joe Alwyn that she instructed her security team to set up in front of the building, says a source, “then had a car pull to the back so they could run in wearing matching hoodies.” As another insider explains in the new issue of Us Weekly, “She’s been going the distance to keep things private.”  Now she’s strategizing her return to omnipresence. It started months ahead of her sixth album’s hotly anticipated November 10 release, as the 27-year-old, who took a months-long social media hiatus this spring, teased her 104 million Instagram followers with song lyrics and video clips.  And come November 11, the 10-time Grammy winner will officially “come out of hiding,” says a source, performing two tracks off Reputation on Saturday Night Live. After her self-induced seclusion — save for a pre-Super Bowl performance in February and court testimony in the August trial of a DJ who groped her, she’s avoided the public eye for nearly all of 2017 — “she’s happy to be back in public,” says a Swift insider.  And ready to show off just how happy she is. Though she’s kept her nearly yearlong romance with Alwyn, 26, firmly under wraps, the insider says she’s considering having him join her at the November 12 Europe Music Awards in London. “He might attend,” says the insider, noting Swift is giving their debut a lot of thought. “She wants to reveal their relationship when the time is right.”  She’s already fairly confident Alwyn is Mr. Right. The family-oriented Brit (he still loves in London with his psychotherapist mom Elizabeth and documentarian dad Richard) and Swift enjoy a “boring relationship,” says the Swift insider. At the singer’s NYC spread she and the actor — he filmed the 2018 biopic The Favourite with her pal Emma Stone — hang on her private roof deck, work out together, watch movies and enjoy an easy domesticity. Says the insider, “Taylor loves to cook and bake for him.”  One day, she envisions preparing meals for a whole brood. “She’s always said she wants a big family and she sees herself having kids with Joe down the line,” says the insider. “Taylor really believes he’s the one for her.”  For more on Swift’s romance — and her post-album release plans — pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

The Grammy-winning singer held a private screening of the film “Despicable Me 3” for some of the tragedy’s younger survivors and their families just before the weekend.  According to a source with The Sun, Adele sees aiding her community as a full-time job now that Adele Live 2017 is over.  “Being a local Londoner, she’s made no secret about how personally affected she was by the Grenfell Tower blaze and wants to help in every way she can,” claims the source. “While she’s working hard behind the scenes to raise cash, she wanted to treat residents to a night of fun and help take their minds off what happened and organised a private viewing of the brand new ‘Despicable Me 3’ movie.”  Dozens of residents joined Adele for the animated movie on Thursday.  At least 80 people were killed when a fire broke out in the 24-story West London building on June 14. Firefighters originally warned occupants to remain in their apartments, but improper cladding caused the fourth floor fridge-freezer fire to alarmingly accelerate. A final death toll is not expected to be released until at least 2018, but around 255 people are said to have survived.  Adele previously implored her fans to donate to her Grenfell Tower fund while performing at Wembley Stadium back in June.  “It’s been two weeks since the fire, and still the people who were affected by it are homeless,” she said in a pre-show video message. “I promise that the money we raise together will go directly to the people who are living in that block.”  Adele’s act of charity just so happens to coincide with the news that “Despicable Me” is officially the highest-grossing animated franchise of all time.

Hold it right there, don’t be disappointed because what if we told you it is possible!! You can get paid a huge sum of money just staying in bed for two whole months and by you know who?? NASA no less!!!Yes the American space agency NASA is paying $100,000 to stay in bed for 60 days. Find out why and if it is really too good to be true.Most of us dream about hanging out in bed, all day, every day, and getting paid for it! Well, it turns out NASA are making our dreams a reality. A few lucky candidates are getting paid an obscene amount of money just to chill in bed all day.NASA is currently on the lookout for people to participate in their “Bed Rest Studies”, in which participants will have to stay in bed for 60 days straight.It does sound like the dream job, right? But how long do you think you could last without going insane.I would definitely treat the 60 days like a job, and whenever I felt like I’d had enough, I’d just think of all the things I could buy with the money.You wouldn’t just be sleeping you can keep yourself occupied with books, TV, video games, and they can also use their phones as they please!As long as they remain laying down.

While non-exercising groups must stay completely at rest the entire time.During the entirety of the study, bone, muscle and heart tests, will be done.As well as tests of the circulatory and nervous systems, nutritional condition, and the body’s capacity to fight off infections are conducted.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,496

True has made me sweeter and more gentle. God gives you what you need.

9987f585-50bb-46f3-a325-55f624550217,"It's a good time to be a '90s television fan, if only because the world has finally realized how much we miss our long-dead sitcoms. Full House is getting a spinoff series, Boy Meets World has a reincarnation in Disney Channel's Girl Meets World, and even the Magic School Bus is chugging back onto TV. So why not bring back Clarissa Explains It All? After all, the series launched Melissa Joan Hart's career AND provided us with endless hours of family-friendly entertainment, all told through the perspective of a savvy, colorfully dressed tween. We know where Hart is today — she's back polishing off yet another sitcom with Melissa & Joey and will probably make a plethora of ABC Family TV movies in the near future — but she's not the only person I want to keep track of post- Clarissa Explains It All . Whatever happened to Sam, aka actor Sean O'Neal?  I always wanted a BFF like Sam, if only because his mode of transportation (a ladder into Clarissa's bedroom window) always seemed pretty rad. The actor who played him, O'Neal, was in his early teens while on the show, and now is a full-fledged adult. So what has O'Neal been up to in his post-Clarissa years? There's not much out there about O'Neal's later years, but here's what I could find.  Noir  In 2001, O'Neal provided additional voices for an English dub of this anime series, as well as portraying the character Vint.  RahXephon  O'Neal also provided character voices for this anime series, which he worked on in 2002.  Development Hell  O'Neal appeared as a background actor on this 2013 web series about a production company.  Today  That's unfortunately all we know about O'Neal's post-Clarissa ventures in acting, but there are certain other things we do know about him. For example, we know that he is NOT the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club, though I'm sure it's been a struggle for the other Sean O'Neal to constantly explain to people that he was never on Clarissa Explains It All.  (You can see why we'd all believe it, though.)  Screencrush reported that when it was active, O'Neal's website said that after Clarissa Explains It All, ""he was approached to be the lead of a new boy band in Orlando in the vein of the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync."" It would appear that such a band never happened, because I'm pretty sure all of Sam's many fans would've gladly bought his album — and there's no record of it ever existing. Here's what appears to a recent photo of O'Neal, or at least, more recent than old Clarissa episodes.  So where'd you go, O'Neal? Are you secretly lying to the world and really ARE the Senior Editor of The A.V. Club? Have you gone into hiding because too many '90s girls want you to climb into their windows? Or are you just leading a perfectly happy, normal life somewhere out of the public eye? If you want to talk, feel free to drop me a line — or better yet, just climb in through the window.

efae1d10-e390-4dbf-83de-fe80eb5841ec,"Incensed over Donna Karan’s defense of Harvey Weinstein, Megyn Kelly laid into the fashion designer on Tuesday’s episode of Megyn Kelly TODAY, declaring that she’s “done with Donna Karan” while also inviting her on the program.  “Donna Karan, in the wake of the disturbing allegations about famed movie producer Harvey Weinstein allegedly harassing several women, used the power of her voice to attack women,” said Kelly, 46, who famously leveled sexual harassment claims against her former Fox News boss, the late Roger Ailes, in her 2016 book, Settle for More. “In an interview with the DailyMail.com on the red carpet Sunday night, Karan was asked about Harvey Weinstein, who she described as a wonderful person. And then she went on to raise what she apparently considers to be the burning question here: Are women who are getting harassed ‘asking for it’?”  After playing a clip of the comments — for which Karan has since apologized, telling the Associated Press they are “not representative of how I feel or what I believe” — Kelly turned the focus to her interview with one of Weinstein’s accusers, TV journalist Lauren Sivan, who on Monday’s episode told Kelly about her “disgusting” experience with Weinstein. “Weirdly, I never thought to ask Lauren whether her skirt brought on that [restuarant] vestibule incident because her outfit is totally irrelevant — and most rational people know that,” said Kelly.  Questioning Karan’s statement, Kelly challenged her “wrong” thinking: “There are laws in this country. Laws. I don’t give a damn if a woman shows up in a bikini to the office. That doesn’t invite or make it okay for her superior to harass her. It makes it okay for her boss to say, ‘Go home and change.’ That’s it. The truth is sexual harassment has nothing to do with wardrobe; it has to do with power and control and sexual proclivities that a superior chooses not to reign in. How insulting, by the way, to men, as well? Like they are a bunch of animals who cannot behave themselves if a woman shows part of her thigh, right? This attitude of blaming women for their own harassment is actually one of the reasons women choose not to come forward after they get harassed because they fear victim shaming.”  Kelly continued: “How about we not pile on, Donna? How about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices, despite the risks and to stand up for themselves — which is hard enough, without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their fashion choices.”  Then came Kelly’s kicker: “And speaking of fashion choices, here’s one for you: I’m done with Donna Karan.”  Despite her dismissive message, Kelly invited Karan on the show for “an honest discussion about how [Karan] really feels,” adding, “If she’s really sorry, if she really was taken out of context, if she really doesn’t believe that way, explain those comments.”  With her comments Tuesday, Kelly joined a growing list of celebrities speaking out against Weinstein, whose scandal erupted following an Oct. 5 New York Times exposé alleging the movie mogul has been sexually harassing women for three decades. Weinstein has since been fired by The Weinstein Company and apologized for “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past” in a statement to the Times. On Tuesday, a report posted by the New Yorker alleged more sexual misconduct claims, including assault, against Weinstein, which he also denied.  Watch Kelly’s segment in the video above.

2b67fc7e-31a5-4995-9967-6d7502303446,"President Trump and his administration just voted against a United Nations ban on the death penalty for being gay, making the United States of America (it’s hard to think this is actually really happening) just one of 13 other countries in the world to oppose such a historic vote.A few other notable countries who voted against the ban were China, Iraq and Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.The resolution wasn’t sought to ban the death penalty entirely, but instead to keep it from being imposed in a ‘discriminatory manner,’ particularly in six countries where the death penalty is used for people known to be in same-sex relationships: Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Yemen, Nigeria, and Somalia.While some are saying that a ‘no’ vote might imply a rejection of the death penalty in general, The Human Rights Council resolution specifically stated that it condemned the “imposition of the death penalty as a sanction for specific forms of conduct, such as apostasy, blasphemy, adultery and consensual same-sex relations.”To have a ‘no’ vote puts the United States in a very select group of countries. Not exactly the best group to be in agreement with on an issue like this.Renato Sabbadini, the executive director of The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, said:“It is unconscionable to think that there are hundreds of millions of people living in states where somebody may be executed simply because of whom they love.” “This is a monumental moment where the international community has publicly highlighted that these horrific laws simply must end.”Since taking office, Trump has made a number of political appointments and policy moves against the LGBT community, including:Having The Department of Justice and Department of Education rescind guidance that defended the rights of transgender students to safety use bathrooms at schools that correspond to their gender identity.Saying publicly that transgenders could no longer serve in the military, and then issuing a directive to the Department of Defense to implement such an order.Signing an executive order in March that rescinded an Obama-era rule that companies have to prove they treat LGBT employees fairly.Fortunately, the measure passed with 27 countries voting for it, but it still sends a chilling message about a new United States agenda on human rights.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,421

80451a67-6355-4001-a221-a3c072f50292,"Flavor Flav needs money. So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.  Flav — real name, William Drayton — contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.  Flavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts “to minimize his role in the Public Enemy business” over the years, while managers continued to exploit “his fame and persona to market the brand.”  In addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group’s business manager since 2008, and Clifton “Greg” Johnson, who was until recently Flav’s longtime personal manager.  Related Chuck D Joins Universal Hip Hop Museum as Chairman of the Celebrity Board LeBron James and Channing Tatum Pitch 'Public Enemy' Lands at New Line  Flav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy’s image without his permission.  The suit states that Rinaldo “entered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.” Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.  This summer, Public Enemy made a new album, “Nothing is Quick in the Desert,” available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.  The suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.  “Drayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,” the suit states.  Flav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.  “He had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,” the suit states.

39c797a7-0644-4ffb-b934-18ee3d6c71ff,"Matt Lauer may no longer be a part of the Today show family, but he still stays in touch with his former colleagues on the morning news program.  “Yeah, we keep in touch with him,” Hoda Kotb, who replaced Lauer as co-anchor alongside Savannah Guthrie, told The Hollywood Reporter for its 35 Most Powerful People in New York Media 2018 issue.  Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire/Getty  “I mean look, this is one of those complex situations,” admitted Kotb, 53, who received a congratulatory text from Lauer when she was named co-anchor in early January. “I’ve known him since I started working at NBC [in 1998]. When I was sick with breast cancer, he was the first to call. He helps and helped in ways that … you know, he was incredible in that way.”  Though Kotb has fond memories of Lauer, 60, she isn’t discounting the stories of the women who came forward and accused the previous NBC anchor of sexual misconduct.  “There is that Matt and then there’s the Matt that the accusers speak of. And those accusers’ voices matter and that story matters and it’s … (to Savannah Guthrie) It’s still tough, right?” Kotb said in the THR interview to Guthrie, who affirmed: “Yes.”  It’s been five months since Lauer parted ways with the show at the end of November after the network received a “detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior,” with reason to believe “this may not have been an isolated incident.” Women have also anonymously accused him of sexual harassment and assault in reports published by Variety and The New York Times.

Following his firing, which was announced live on Today by Guthrie and Kotb, Lauer addressed the original allegations in a statement.  “There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,” he said, in part. “To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.”  Speaking with PEOPLE following Lauer’s exit, Guthrie, 46, and Kotb opened up about sharing the sobering news with the world.  “I think you could see from the moment that the news happened that our hearts were broken, and in lots of ways, they still are,” Guthrie said. “That feeling was shared through our whole newsroom and our whole Today show staff, because it sounds like cliché or a promo line, but it happens to be true: We are family, and we do love each other, and families do go through hard times, and when that happens in good families, you just get closer. You pull together and you focus on the foundation and what keeps you together. I think that’s what we’ve all been trying to do. And for me, I just am trying to get comfortable with how complicated the feelings around all of it are, and it is complicated. And just trying to have love and compassion for everyone concerned.”  Tyler Essary/Getty  The duo also spoke about Lauer, whom they are continuing to support and only want the best for.  “We know he’s working on his family, we know that for sure. Of course our hearts go out to the brave women who have told their stories,” Guthrie said.  “What we are experiencing and processing now is how to honor and remain a true friend to someone even in spite of learning things that are deeply disturbing,” she added. “And we are trying to navigate that path with integrity.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,745

gossipcop-913861	0	Acrimony between Sex and the City co-stars surfaces, with Cattrall claiming her former colleague was ‘cruel’  'You are not my friend': Kim Cattrall lashes out at Sarah Jessica Parker after brother's death  An ongoing feud between the stars of Sex and the City has grown deeper, with Kim Cattrall accusing Sarah Jessica Parker of exploiting the death of her brother.  Cattrall’s brother Chris, 55, was found dead last week after going missing from his home in Alberta, Canada.  After announcing his death, Cattrall thanked both her fans and her Sex and the City colleagues for support.  #SexandtheCity A post shared by Kim Cattrall (@kimcattrall) on Feb 6, 2018 at 12:39pm PST  But four days after posting that message, the actor, who played Samantha on the hit HBO show, followed it up with a post directed at Parker, criticising her for “reaching out”, and saying she had been cruel.  In the caption, Cattrall said Parker’s “continual reaching out” was “a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now”.  She went on: “You are not my family. You are not my friend” and urged Parker to “stop exploiting our tragedy.”  Cattrall’s post linked to an article in the New York Post from October 2017. It described an ongoing feud between the stars which culminated with a dispute over whether to produce a third Sex and the City movie, which Cattrall said she did not want to do.  Parker has not publicly responded to the statement.

Angelina Jolie, 43, “really hasn’t come to terms with her heartbreak” over her split from Brad Pitt, 54, a source close to the Maleficent actress EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “She’s not in a place where she want to admit, it but the loss of their love is still haunting her. They had such a passionate love affair. It’s not something that’s easy for her to get over, not without a fight to match the size of their love. The fact is, Angelina’s deeply hurt that they couldn’t keep things together and have their happy Hollywood ending and she puts all the blame for that failure on Brad.”  Perhaps this explains the nasty turn Brad and Angelina’s custody battle has taken, with her lobbing allegations of unpaid child support at her ex. “Instead of facing her sadness and working through it,” the source tells HollywoodLife.com, “her coping mechanism is to go full ice queen. Sadly it is the only way she can get through this divorce. If she doesn’t focus on her anger and stay in that frame of mind, she would crumble and possibly even have a breakdown.”  “That’s just not an option” for Angie, the source added. “She has to stay strong for her kids and unfortunately for Brad, ‘staying strong’ means ‘staying angry.’ “ Angie’s anger, while helping her keep it together for her kids, but actually backfire and cost her the one thing she’s trying to protect. Angelina’s “carefully word-smithed” accusation – where she claimed Brad didn’t pay “meaningful” child support – might come off as insincere to the judge overseeing the case, California family law attorney David Pisarra EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “I wouldn’t be surprised if it backfires on her, as more and more judges are starting to see through these tactics quicker.”  Brad – who has denied the accusations by saying he’s paid more than $9 million to Angelina – can’t stand the fact that she’s taken the battle public again. Brad fears that the added spotlight to this battle’s bitterness is “hurting the kids,” and that nothing good can come from a nasty custody dispute. He was coping with the breakup when everything was sealed behind clothes doors, but now that it’s out in the open, Brad feels like she’s “taken off the gloves and is fighting dirty.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,523

acb36db1-9d2d-4ba2-b3f7-26e0b564909b,"ATLANTIC CITY, NJ — Trashed by emails sent by pageant officials, former Miss Americas may help choose the new leaders of the Miss America Organization.  The group told The Associated Press Wednesday night that it is seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  In emails that were published last week by the Huffington Post, pageant officials ridiculed the appearance, intellect and sex lives of former Miss Americas. The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.  The ensuing uproar led to the group’s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.  Dan Meyers, the group’s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization’s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.  “The board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,” he said. “Given the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.”  Some past winners reacted negatively to the board’s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders. Others said they wanted no involvement whatsoever by any current board members in seeking new leadership.  see also Miss America execs resign after disgusting emails surface There they go — a series of vulgar e-mails has...  “At this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,” Miss America 1977 Dorothy Benham told the AP. “They have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united.”  Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.  “The board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,” she told the AP late Wednesday. “They need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.”  Under the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members “will begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,” a statement from the board read.  There are currently two vacancies on the 14-member board, and there will be at least two more when the resignations of Randle and Weidner become effective in a matter of weeks.  The organization hopes to have the nominations in hand by Jan. 3. The board said it was notifying groups of its decision to seek their help late Wednesday night.  The emails already cost the pageant its television production partner and raised questions about the future of the nationally televised broadcast from Atlantic City’s Boardwalk Hall the week after Labor Day each year. Dick Clark Productions told the AP last Thursday that it cut ties with the Miss America Organization over the emails, calling them “appalling.”  Meyers said the group has spoken with ABC, the television network scheduled to broadcast the September 2018 pageant, as well as with pageant sponsors. None has ended its relationship with the Miss America Organization, he said. Independent messages sent by the AP over the past two days seeking comment from ABC and pageant sponsors have gone unanswered.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,725

dd3627a1-721e-4b5b-9dd7-52eee76b1cb9,"That’s right, everyone, the time is near—the week we have all been waiting for is upon us: Pippa Middleton is set to marry James Matthews this weekend in London. (It’s still not too late to book your ticket now to London—yeah, you won’t be able to attend the wedding itself, but you can still sort of camp out nearby and listen for sounds.)  There are no doubt scores of spreadsheets and multiple binders dedicated to making sure everything goes smoothly for Kate’s sister’s nuptials, and most of the plans remain under wraps. And there is a great number of questions about the wedding itself, including what Pippa will be wearing, and what Kate’s exact role will be, and whether or not we will be gifted with a shot of Meghan Markle and Prince George shaking hands. But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.  The outlet claims that Pippa has completed a “strict bridal body boot camp,” a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn’t sound too different from a (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include “a personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes” and “the club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.”  Oh, wait, there’s also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: “The club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.” E! notes, of course, that it is “unclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.”  Their source claims that Pippa has “met with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.” Per the source: “She feels amazing. Her diet is the healthiest ever—she hasn’t even had a glass of wine in months. She’s had facial treatments sometimes once a week or once a fortnight.”  This truly is an impressive feat, as, just over the course of writing this post, we have finished off two glasses of wine and did not complete a single facial treatment.

Born Melania Knavs, she began her modelling career at the age of sixteen and attended the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia where she studied architecture. However, she left her studies after a year to pursue a successful career in modelling. Melania has worked as a fashion model for agencies in Milan and Paris and she later moved to New York City in 1996.  In 2000, she appeared nude on the cover of British GQ, an achievement she is immensely proud of and is listed on her official biography on the White House website. The website states: “As a model, Melania has appeared in high profile ad campaigns and worked with some of the top photographer in the fashion industry. “She has graced the covers of Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, British GQ, Ocean Drive, Avenue, In Style and New York Magazine.” Melania also once appeared scantily clad aboard Donald Trump’s gold-encrusted Boeing 727.

0d18e4c2-ce2a-4bab-abfc-c5998c369381,"Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris (Getty Images for Yeezy Season 3)  The inconceivably long train wreck that is Kanye West’s Twitter account just hit a new level of messiness Thursday afternoon, when Yeezy shared a screenshot of an exchange between himself and longtime friend and collaborator John Legend.  In the screenshot of the text exchange, Legend sent a check-in text to Kanye at about 9:16 a.m. Thursday. In the text, Legend attempts to talk some sense into Ye after the rapper broke the internet with this “MAGA”-Donald Trump lovefest on Wednesday afternoon, reminding Kanye of the importance of his platform and the effect that aligning with Trump would have on his friends and fans.  “So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now becaues they know the harm that Trump’s policies cause, especially to people of color. Don’t let this be part of your legacy,” Legend pleaded.  In response, Kanye wrote: “I love you John and I appreciate your thoughts. You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.”  Advertisement  It’s unclear if the conversation went on longer than that, but Ye clearly felt it appropriate to then share the exchange with the world.  About a half hour later, Kanye offered some clarification on why he decided to post the exchange (it’s also unclear on whether he gave Legend a heads-up before posting either tweet).  Advertisement  “I tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion,” West wrote, perhaps alluding to allegations that he’s surrounded himself with “yes men.”  “I respect everyone’s opinion but I stand my ground,” he wrote.  Interestingly, minutes before Kanye posted his explanation, Legend’s wife, the undefeated Chrissy Teigen, also weighed in on Kanye for the first time since the whole “Make America Great Again” debacle.  Advertisement  “Everyone keeps asking me to comment on shit. Comment on psycho Tami Lasagna, whom I refuse to give the joy to, say something about RHOA, speak about Kanye. When it comes to people we know, we DO speak up. To THEM. Not on Twitter. And sometimes, I guess it makes it to Twitter,” Teigen wrote.  So there we have it. Yes, people have tried to talk to Kanye about the ramifications of his actions. And while he says he loves them and respects them, he prefers not to really listen to them, opting to “stand [his] ground” in the name of his free—if convoluted, nonsensical and, frankly, rather dull—thoughts.  Advertisement  Perhaps, if he read, Kanye would know the deeper implications of a phrase like “stand my ground”—but that would mean Kanye’s free thoughts involved actual thinking.  For what it’s worth, Yeezy also dropped this free-thought gem earlier: “People usually don’t agree with people who don’t agree with them.”  Advertisement  I suppose this is the new wave: Next time you want attention for a controversial and provocative opinion but don’t care for any scrutiny of or responsibility for the effects of said opinion (a line I’m paraphrasing from T.D. Williams’ incisive article on Kanye West), just call it a free thought.  In case there was any doubt it was all love—or whatever game is being played here—Legend also had a friendly request for Ye, since the latter was in a sharing mood.  Advertisement  “And since you’re posting texts, let me add that I have new single out,” Legend plugged—which Kanye happily obliged.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,702

Jordan.  “Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry,” Fanshen Cox DiGiovanni, head of strategic outreach at Pearl Street Films tweeted in response to Jordan on Monday night. “On behalf of Pearl Street Films, Matt Damon, @BenAffleck, Jennifer Todd, Drew Vinton, & I will be adopting the #InclusionRider for all of our projects moving forward.”  .@michaelb4jordan Thank you for always supporting broader representation in the industry.

An inclusion rider is a way for actors and actresses to guarantee projects they work on have a level of diversity, onscreen and off-camera, that matches the location setting of the project. Stacy L. Smith, the director of USC Annenberg’s Media, Diversity & Social Change Initiative, first discussed the idea of an “equity rider” in a 2014 column for The Hollywood Reporter as a way to reverse Hollywood’s profound gender imbalance.  In a statement to Variety, Smith and Kalpana Kotagal, one of the lawyers working on the inclusion riders, said of the Pearl Street Films announcement, “It’s great to see Matt Damon, Ben Affleck and the Pearl Street Films team using their influence to create opportunities for people from underrepresented groups to enter the industry. The Inclusion Rider is an important tool for Hollywood, and other industries, to create workplaces that truly reflect our diverse world.”  Under their Pearl Street Films banner, Affleck and Damon have produced films such as Manchester By the Sea, Jason Bourne, and Live By Night, among other features and television series, and are currently working on Matt Reeves’ The Batman (with Affleck still set to star as the Caped Crusader) and Affleck’s remake of Witness for the Prosecution.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,458

f67ffa84-e903-4d7c-8d18-57f76819f20d,"Beyonce is just one of many celebrities who has admitted to being demon possessed and worshipping Satan. Be aware of what your kids are being exposed to.  “Right before I performed for the BET awards, I raised my hands up and it was the first time I felt something else come into me. I knew that was going to be my coming out night at the award show,” explained Beyonce in a recent interview. Satan works overtime to deceive the masses through none other than the entertainment industry. Satanism is being promoted by hundreds of celebrities and we are blindly idolizing the very people who are Satan worshippers.  When speaking at a music festival in Wisconsin last week, a man standing in the back of the packed room, loudly confirmed my information regarding Beyonce and her demonic influence over our kids. I mean, who would just randomly YouTube search “celebrities who practice Satanism.” Well, I did and I was shocked. Check it out for yourself. At first, I just wanted to confirm what I had seen first hand while working in LA and verify some of the stories friends shared with me who had the 411 from the inside. What I discovered was shocking!  Back to Beyonce. This chick is one of the most powerful influencers of adults and children alike. However, many people don’t know that she has admitted countless times that she is possessed by a spirit guide she named Sasha Fierce. In Russian the meaning of Sasha is: defender of man. Deceptive, isn’t it? What she is promoting is deceiving man not defending man. Satan is the great deceiver. He twists the truth and she is one of his instruments.  What does possession mean? Possession is when a spirit or soul hijacks a body and takes over the function and control of that body. The person possessed is not consciously present and will usually have no memory of the actions that happened while possessed. Beyonce talks about how she’s a relatively reserved young woman but says, “When I see videos of myself on stage and on TV, I am like, ‘Who is that girl? That’s not me!’ I wouldn’t dare do that!” Beyonce is possessed.  Click here to see a photo that shows Beyonce wearing the emblem of a goat’s head during a photo shoot. This symbol is used exclusively for Satanic worship. Millions of fans are actually worshipping Satan when engaging in her music, watching her videos and trying to copy her “dance moves” without even knowing it! The reason this is so alarming is because music has been scientifically proven to be one of the most powerful medians for communicating a message. It bypasses the brain and goes straight to our emotions, thought-process, subconscious and the heart of the listener. Satan is using the music industry to lead many people astray. Here’s a clip that’s a must see to give you an in-depth look at Beyonce and how her demonic possession affects her millions of followers.  Sadly, Beyonce is just one of many celebrities who is working on behalf of Satan and encouraging us to follow and practice Luciferianism. It’s that serious. Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Fergie, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake, Kanye West and Jay-Z are some of the other more well known, professing Satanists. For example, Fergie states, “The Devil comes and soon my conscious and unconscious might start to brawl as this cunning Demon takes me as it’s voodoo doll.” Katy Perry explains, “I swear I wanted to be the Amy Grant of music, but it didn’t work out and so I sold my soul to the devil.” Nicki Minaj has said in the past that there’s a crazy boy named Roman who lives in her and says things she would never say. She has told him to leave but he resists and she said he’s in her for a reason. Justin Timberlake boastfully announced, “All you people out there, Satan is my master. He has always been.” As you can see, many stars tell their fans just who they follow. Are we listening?  Do we catch celeb’s words when they describe their involvement with the occult? We need to be educated on what role models we should follow so that we are not pulled into the devastating, deceitful destruction of demonic possession. Satan is attacking the masses with his lies and using the entertainment industry to carry out his plan. The word “industry’ means “production and construction.” What is Hollywood producing as a result of millions of fans idolizing celebrities who are promoting this message?

7cb450b4-1044-4ba2-a8ed-db99bbc249d7,"Just remember kid... it's all BS. - Robert Mitchum to Nick Nolte at the Academy Awards    I live out here in Hollywood and have had my share of celebrities and their situational ethics and pretentious beliefs. Not all of them, but many at the end of the day, they believe in one thing: Themselves and nothing else or no one else.    Years ago, Hollywood jumped on the Joseph Campbell bandwagon, especially screenwriters, because Campbell mentioned Star Wars and the cottage industry screenwriting gurus incorporated ""Hero's Journey..."" blah, blah, blah and other Joe Campbell lingo into all of their teachings. Robert Mitchum's quote applies.    Thank God! I discovered Joseph Campbell before I truly discovered Hollywood.    Ken Baker weaves an interesting spiritual quest for answers, antithetic to Bill Maher.  His catalyst, which is relatable to most of us, is losing his religion in a hedonistic place like Tinseltown. NBA player Lamar Odom's road to excess is the jumping off point, or ""leap of faith"" that Ken must perform a deep high-dive into his soul. He goes on to tell a stereotypical Catholic upbringing where the family of five attends church and the father goes through the motions to placate the mother, but never honestly embraces God...  An amazing spiritual story evolves from this tragedy.    Ken Baker's an excellent writer and entertaining to read. I burned through his book and enjoyed the spiritual quest alongside him as a reader. As a senior correspondent for E! his job ""is to report on the gamut of entertainment news..."", "" ...as well as the daily hookups, breakups, and screw-ups of the world's biggest stars."" Who better qualified? I ask. You will actually learn something from Ken's book, and it might even contradict what you think about some of the celebrities he interviewed. If you've seen  Thomas Peter ""Tom"" Shadyac's ""I Am"" documentary or most recently Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, then one could view Hollywood as a spiritual sinkhole.    Key takeaway is: Don't discover God on your deathbed. If you chose not to have faith, or find religion a fairly tale, Hey, ""whatever gets you through the night,"" as John Lennon once wrote. Maybe God is George Burns to some people in Hollywood. However, for me, I am personally comfortable with Camus' logic that:    ""I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,497

Brad lived there with Jennifer Aniston during their marriage - but will he give it up for Angelina Jolie and the kids?  The Jolie-Pitts have seven houses in various spots around the world, but the family home is a sprawling Craftsman style home in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, that Brad Pitt had previously lived in with jilted ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston.  While his prior ownership of the home might suggest Pitt will keep the home in this divorce too, it's been extensively remodelled for the kids and now includes a huge swimming pool, park land, and an area for dirtbike-riding – something his son Maddox enjoys.  Maybe Angie will want to keep things as normal as possible for her brood in the Los Feliz house, or perhaps she'll want to ship them out to France – her ancestral and spiritual home – where the couple owns the frankly enormous Chateau Miraval.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval, the US$60m estate which is owned by actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Costing about US$60m and boasting a 30-acre vineyard (famous for a rose called ""Pink Floyd"") and 35 bedrooms (just how many kids did these guys want?), Pitt and Jolie were married in the chateau's chapel in August, 2014.  So, maybe it won't be high on Jolie's list of places to lie low until the news cycle has rolled over them. Perhaps the beach then if it's privacy the divorcees are after?  That's doable, since the pair have what passes for a bach in Hollywood up the coast in Santa Barbara. It comes with 11 acres of land around it and a private beach in front of it, for max seclusion.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval.  Pitt bought it in 2000 for US$4m, in recent years the family has used it mainly as a holiday home. But maybe he'll head up there to lick his wounds?  Pitt's also the reluctant owner of a villa in New Orleans that he's been trying to offload since 2015.  The pair bought the five-bed-five-bath home to live in while Pitt was in Nola filming The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It's on the market now for the bargain basement price of US$5.5m.  Ray Tamarra Brad Pitt greets a friend from his New Orleans balcony on May 17, 2014 in New Orleans.  Then there's also Jolie's Laurel Canyon home, and an apartment in New York's Waldorf Astoria building.    THE FOUNDATION  The pair started the Jolie-Pitt Foundation together in 2006. However it seems most likely to be Jolie who'll take over the running of the charity.  The Foundation has donated to various causes including the Hurricane Katrina and Joplin tornado rebuilds; children's health centres in Ethiopia and Cambodia; the Na'an ku se Foundation in Namibia; GlobaL Action for Children; the HALO Trust and Doctors Without Borders.  But it's Jolie who puts her money (and her time) where her mouth is most often as a UN Goodwill ambassador, Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award winner and vocal crusader for children and women.    THE FILM COMPANY  Plan B Entertainment was the brainchild of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, that Brad took custody of in the divorce.  To date, it's been responsible for a huge range of films, from gritty horror World War Z to Oscar-winning marvels Selma and 12 Years a Slave.  Pitt is the sole owner of the company, but could Jolie angle for a piece of that cinematic pie in the settlement?    THE DOG  Jacques must be getting on in years.

5bb01955-a471-4a48-8822-90516babedbc,"It has been 20 years since NSYNC formed in Orlando, Florida, bringing together Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, Chris Kirkpatrick, Joey Fatone and JC Chasez to form one of the biggest boy bands in the world. The group was launched first in Europe and essentially became an overnight success with their singles “I Want You Back” and “Tearin’ Up My Heart” before they were signed to RCA, transferring their success to North America. While their first album did well, their second album, No Strings Attached, did even better, becoming both the best-selling album of the decade and the top-selling album of 2000. It all came to a halt after a whirlwind of domination in the music industry when the group went on hiatus in 2002 and never re-formed. Everyone is well aware of the success and celebrity Justin Timberlake has enjoyed in his solo career, but in case you ever wondered how everyone in the group fared since their money-making heyday, check out NSYNC: How Much Are They Worth Now?  5. Chris Kirkpatrick  Estimated Net Worth: $13 Million. Chris Kirkpatrick may unfortunately be one of the most easily forgotten NSYNC members, but he is still doing well for himself with a net worth of $13 million. Following his days with the band, Kirkpatrick worked as a voice over actor, most notably on The Fairly OddParents. He then surprised fans when he appeared on the show Gone Country 2, and although he didn’t win, he impressed many with country song writing and singing skills. Since then he has kept a low profile and in 2015 appeared in the cult classic Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!  ADVERTISEMENT  2  4. Joey Fatone  Estimated Net Worth: $14 Million.

Photo credit: Getty Images/InStar  The National ENQUIRER has learned Ellen left In a bombshell world exclusive,has learned Ellen left the couple’s love nest and has agreed to an off-listing sale of the marital estate they bought together just eight months ago! Photo credit: Mega  “It’s all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their close friends to avoid being asked questions,” an insider claimed. “She and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty .” Photo credit: Mega  Ellen has publicly insisted the couple’s marriage is on solid ground. But sources have exclusively told The ENQUIRER the pair have been spending nights alone, and now they appear to be living completely apart. Photo credit: Mega  Property records show Ellen and Portia — who will be married for ten years on Aug. 16 — maintained two separate residences on the six-acre equestrian estate in exclusive Montecito, Calif., which recently sold for $11 million. Photo credit: Files  In yet another clue to their marital woes , just weeks after they paid $7.2 million for the sprawling property last September, Ellen quietly snapped up a place of her own nine miles away in Carpinteria! Photo credit: Files  Sources claimed the $77 million-a-year TV chatterbox is holed up at this $18.6 million beachfront mansion, which she secretly purchased in October 2017. “It didn’t bode well for the long term when Ellen bought that home,” a source claimed. Photo credit: Mega  The talk-show host is a notorious house-flipper — investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up. But according to sources, her recent spree is less about the money and more about having separate residences as she and Portia inch closer toward officially separating. Photo credit: Mega  “They spend less and less time together ,” said one source. “In fact, they’ve been living separate lives. It’s gotten so bad that they hardly say a word to each other all day.” Photo credit: Mega  “Portia feels neglected and mistreated,” another insider told The ENQUIRER. “She feels as if she supports Ellen in everything she does, while Ellen just gets aggravated and judgmental when it comes to her needs.” Photo credit: Mega  If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history! “With their combined fortune, future earnings and property totaling $400 million, it’ll be a good day to be their divorce lawyers!” claimed an insider. Photo credit: Mega  “The idea of going through that mess is probably the glue that’s kept them together this long!” A sour-faced Ellen was pictured without her wedding ring during a Beverly Hills shopping spree on April 20. At the time, talk heated up that her high-profile union was under pressure. Photo credit: Mega  But in the days that followed, she and Portia paraded their “happy” marriage in front of paparazzi at multiple Hollywood hot spots, usually arm in arm and sporting painful smiles. “Nobody is convinced,” a source said. “They aren’t intimate!” Photo credit: Mega  While a friend of Ellen’s brushed off talk of divorce, the couple’s marriage has exploded many times before, according to inside sources. But The ENQUIRER’s mole fears the worst as Portia continues to spend days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills. Photo credit: Mega  “It’s usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight,” the insider claimed. “Ellen has a great TV personality, but at home she’s a bore who goes to bed every night at nine.” “Arrested Development” star Portia has also complained Ellen cares more about her fur-shedding cats and dogs, said the source.

Now, less than one week after David filed the explosive docs, Radar exclusively learned Shannon isn’t buying any of his “lies” and is ready for war!  READ THE SHOCKING COURT DOCUMENTS  “Shanon is done being pushed around by him and is going to contest every single declaration David made,” a source close to the 53-year-old blonde beauty said.  “Things were going good between them until a few weeks ago, when David realized that the girls just didnt want to spend as much time with their father as they did their mother.”  Instead, David — who infamously cheated on Shannon in 2015 with family friend Nicole McMackin — blamed Shannon for turning their three teenage daughter’s against him!  “Since separation, the children, on several occasions have refused to talk or see me,” David wrote. “This behavior has been tolerated in Shannon’s home and is not in the best interests of the children…Shannon is not fostering or encouraging a healthy father child relationship.

On Saturday, the “Ex’s and Oh’s” singer was set to wed fiancé Andrew “Fergie” Ferguson but was actually at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Seattle instead.  “Skipped out on my wedding. I married Rock&Roll instead so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F–KING DEATH METAL,” King shared on Instagram.  The daughter of comedian Rob Schneider, King, 27, accepted Ferguson’s proposal last February after he popped the question on a sailboat under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. As King recalled on a March episode of “Say Yes to the Dress,” Ferguson proposed 12 days after they met.  “We met in London in the lobby of my hotel, and it was like we had known each other for 10 years,” she said. “We hung out all night, it was my last day in London, and he was like, ‘You can’t go home.’ And I didn’t get on my flight, and I stayed in London. Two days later, he quit his job and moved to America.”  While she found her dream dress, King hinted the pair had split following a cryptic Instagram post from March 28.  “Gotta say … no matter how heartbreaking one day may be, it’s hard to not smile in this California sunshine,” she wrote.  Earlier this month, King penned a lengthy note detailing the importance of self-worth.  “Been a really rough and insane start to this year,” King shared, along with a snapshot of her puppy. “Lately I don’t cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She’s my best friend and the only true loyalty I’ve ever known.  “Today someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself. But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don’t give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts,” she continued. “Always be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you’re beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness. Be safe. Be smart. Don’t let anyone make you feel fearful or small.

fdffce1e-ab9f-42e8-abe2-1fd2f8b8c526,"Netflix is set to bring Archie Horror's Chilling Adventures of Sabrina to the small screen, but it looks like one former teenage witch won't be a part of it.  During a recent interview on BBC's Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Selena Gomez was asked about the possibility of her starring in the series, which is currently being called Sabrina. But as she revealed, the role isn't in the cards, so much so that she hasn't even heard about the part.  ""I love that!"" Gomez revealed. ""That's new information for me. No, that's a rumor.""  While most know Gomez now for her music career, she actually got her start starring in Disney Channel's Wizards of Waverly Place. This, combined with her working relationship with Netflix on 13 Reasons Why, made many of her fans suggest that she should play the new Sabrina Spellman. But as Gomez explained, she doesn't plan to return to the realm of television witchcraft anytime soon.  ""I've done my magic enough,"" Gomez added.  The Sabrina reboot was first announced earlier this year, with many eagerly trying to predict who would land the title role. Early reports have suggested that the casting call for Sabrina is open ethnicity, and that her relationship with both Harvey Kinkle and her aunts will come into play.  The series will also serve as a spinoff of The CW's hit series Riverdale, leaving the door open for crossovers during the line. And as Riverdale and Sabrina showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa explained, there will be a bit of a shared supernatural aura between the two.  “There’s no secret that I love that character, and that that character is a huge part of the Archie universe,” Aguirre-Sacasa told ComicBook.com after Riverdale's season one finale. ""The show kind of has hints of the supernatural throughout it; there are visions of Jason as a ghost, as a zombie. Archie sees werewolves. There’s a lot of talk about angry, pagan gods and there’s a voodoo doll. We are going to continue exploring the idea of the supernatural being on the fringes of Riverdale, and that might be to lead up to Sabrina’s arrival or that might just be to make it more like Twin Peaks and the way they dealt with the supernatural.""

9d2e6644-dbe1-443f-ad2b-71a4becd09ad,"After more than a decade, actor Billy Bob Thornton shared what led to his divorce from actress Angelina Jolie in 2003.  Thornton has married six times, but his relationship with Jolie—who is 20 years younger than the Goliath actor—was among his most notable. Jolie was Thornton's fifth wife. The former spouses met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999. At the time, he was engaged to Big Little Lies star Laura Dern. Thornton and Jolie tied the knot in 2000, but they separated three years later.  ""I remember our time together as really being great,"" Thornton, 62, said on The HFPA in Conversation podcast Wednesday. ""We just had different lifestyles. Hers is a global lifestyle, and mine is an agoraphobic lifestyle, so that's really—that's the only reason we're probably not still together maybe, because of a different path in life we wanted to take.""  Thornton said he's maintained a friendship with Jolie since their divorce. ""Angie is still a friend of mine, and she's a great person, and she's done so much,"" he told The HFPA. ""She makes movies that are important to her whether they succeed or fail, she still does what she believes in, and I'll always respect her for that.""  When Thornton and Jolie were together, they were known for their seemingly eccentric ways. They had an immediate attraction, which ultimately led Thornton to allegedly part ways with live-in fiancée Dern without warning.  Dern learned of Jolie and Thornton's relationship after receiving calls from tabloids.  ""I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I've never heard from him again,"" Dern said in Talk magazine 2000. ""It's like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.""  Jolie notably had Thornton's name tattooed along her arm, and they both wore a vial of each other's blood around their necks. The former pair announced their plans to adopt a child—Maddox Jolie-Pitt—from Cambodia together in March 2002, but it was later disclosed that Jolie adopted her eldest kid as a single parent.  Since parting ways, the Bad Santa actor married puppeteer Connie Angland in 2014. Jolie is in the midst of a custody battle with former spouse Brad Pitt.  Representatives for Jolie did not immediately return Newsweek's request for comment regarding Thornton's remarks.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,466

075b9239-885d-4bf8-91ba-de2189ff5926,"Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Former “The Bachelor” star Chris Soules “acted reasonably” after he rear-ended a fellow Iowa farmer by calling 911 and trying to resuscitate the man, his new legal team said Thursday.  Soules is charged with leaving the scene of a deadly accident, a felony that carries up to five years in prison, in Monday night’s crash near his farm in northern Iowa that killed 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher.  Authorities say that Soules’ truck rear-ended Mosher’s tractor, throwing him into a ditch. Police audio shows that Soules called 911 to report that he had “rear-ended a guy on a tractor” and sought medical help for Mosher before he left the scene in another vehicle.  Authorities say that Soules was located at his home about 10 miles away but that he initially refused to answer his door for officers. He was arrested five hours after the crash after they obtained a warrant to enter the home. Soules was released on bond Tuesday after 10 hours in jail.  Investigators are looking into who drove Soules away and whether alcohol, speed or texting played a role in the crash. The sheriff says alcoholic beverages were found at the scene and police are trying to determine who had possessed them.  Soules had been represented by attorney Molly Spellman at his initial court appearance Tuesday. But on Thursday, high-profile Iowa defense lawyer Alfredo Parrish and two colleagues from his Des Moines law firm informed the court that they are now representing Soules in the case.  A statement issued Thursday from the firm and Soules’ publicist argued audio of the 911 call showed that initial portrayals of Soules having fled the scene were misleading.  The statement noted that Soules identified himself on the call and “explained his role in the terrible accident.” It added that he tried to perform CPR on the victim and stayed until emergency medical personnel arrived — two facts that aren’t clear on the call.  The call featured someone performing CPR but it wasn’t clear that it was Soules, who told the dispatcher that he didn’t know the technique. The call was abruptly ended by Soules, who police say then “took off” in a truck.  “His attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher,” the statement said, adding that everyone “in this close-knit farming community is mourning Mr. Mosher’s passing.”  Soules, who is required to wear an ankle bracelet for monitoring, is due in court next week for a preliminary hearing.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,497

Moreover, I love the process of making film and television. I appreciate and respect the work of everyone involved. It takes a village. I am incredibly sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts.”  “Furthermore, I apologize to all the crew and cast for any negative attention Lethal Weapon is receiving because of these incidents,” continued Crawford, who said that he takes “great pride in treating everyone in life with dignity and kindness.”  Wait, wait, wait……you can’t fire me on my day off! — Clayne Crawford (@ClayneCrawford) May 8, 2018  Last week, Entertainment Weekly confirmed a report from The Hollywood Reporter that stated Fox and its studio partner Warner Bros.

e0d134aa-ab0c-4bc4-af04-04f838df176b,"Most of the time, when a celebrity make a joke on Saturday Night Live , it'll make headlines the next day before promptly being forgotten. But when Tiffany Haddish said she wanted to get her money's worth out of the Alexander McQueen dress she bought for the premiere of Girl's Trip back when she hosted the show in November 2017, she really wasn’t kidding . Not only did she wear it to deliver her SNL monologue, but she brought it out again to present at the 2018 Oscars .  As Haddish explained on SNL (where she made history as the first black female comedian to ever host the show, by the way), the $4,000 gown, which she wore to the Girl's Trip red carpet in July 2017, cost more than her mortgage—it’s only right that she re-wear it for special occasions.  Pinterest PHOTO: NBC  So, she donned the Alexander McQueen number to appear on SNL . But if you thought that would be the last time you saw the dress, you'd be wrong: Haddish chose to wear the halter-top dress once again to hand out the Oscar for Best Animated/Live Action Short with Maya Rudolph at the 2018 Academy Awards.  Pinterest PHOTO: Jason LaVeris  Hey, what could be more special than Hollywood's biggest night? Oh, and this time around, she accessorized with Uggs. As Haddish said on SNL : “I feel like I should be able to wear what I want, when I want, however many times I want, as long as I Febreze it.” Preach.  Pinterest PHOTO: Kevin Winter  Aside from delivering a hilarious commentary on #OscarsSoWhite with Rudolph, Haddish also made headlines at the Oscars for curtseying before Meryl Streep, as one does, and asking the legendary actress to play her mother in the sequel to Girls Trip .

Now, the singer is reflecting on her time on the show, and the lasting impact her childhood stardom has had on her.  “I liked being in the Disney universe ’cause I didn’t know anything else,"" she tells correspondent Anthony Mason in a new interview with CBS Sunday Morning. ""I knew I was getting to live what I wanted to do. I think now that I’m older now, I realize that’s a lot to put on a kid.”  That pressure weighed on Cyrus, who felt like she struggled to balance being a young person and a professional all at once.  “It’s a lot to put on a kid to have them have to get their makeup done and then also balance school and then also have me dress up in a wig. It’s a little Toddlers and Tiaras,"" she says.  READ: Miley Cyrus Finally Feels Like She Has 'Respect': 'I Proved What I Wanted to Do'  But, her memories of her Hannah Montana days aren't all negative.  ""I definitely look back on it as a good time,"" she muses. ""I think what was hard for me was balancing everything. I think it got harder when I started touring as both -- I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself.”  She also jokes that juggling the dueling Hannah/Miley personalities may have impacted her as an adult.  ""I think that’s probably what’s a little bit wrong with me now!” she laughs. “I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.”  WATCH: Miley Cyrus Shine in Her Duet With Dad Billy Ray on Beautiful Tom Petty Cover!  Still, Hannah is a character that Cyrus still embraces and appreciates for the message it offered her young fans.  ""I loved being that character,"" she admits. ""And honestly, music is everything and all people wanna have is great music and for that audience, for what that was, that was great music for kids to listen to. There’s a song called ‘Life’s What You Make it, so Let’s Make it Rock.’ Never forget that -- wise words. That’s a good thing to tell kids.""  RELATED: Miley Cyrus Reveals How She Got in Trouble on 'The Voice' in New 'Carpool Karaoke'  The singer also acknowledges that moving on from her time as a child star was perhaps tougher for fans than it was for her.  ""America feels like my aunt. ‘You know, you’ve grown up so much and we don’t want to see you grow up,’” Cyrus explains.  The 24-year-old is all grown up now though, and has had a busy 2017, from spending time with her longtime love Liam Hemsworth, to releasing her new album, Younger Now, and appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and an epic Carpool Karaoke episode with James Corden.

488a7743-0089-411f-ba85-238c36127c29,"Actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini has launched another attack on the religion’s most famous member, Tom Cruise, declaring the movie star is “diabolical.”  Remini has been an outspoken critic of the church since leaving in 2013, receiving critical acclaim for her documentary series ""Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath.""  In a Reddit AMA to promote the second season of the show, Remini was asked if she thought Tom Cruise, a Scientologist since 1990, was a “good person."" Her response was blunt.  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Jun 28, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT  “No! Just going to get straight to it, no! There is a public persona of the guy who looks at you directly in the eye and shakes your hand and hugs you and is an attentive person to you and there’s the person behind the mask who is a completely different person,” she wrote.  “Someone could say we all have that — what we are to the public and who we are behind the scenes, but the people who are around Tom and work for Tom, not even people who are Scientologists, they will say he is diabolical,” she continued.  “People who’ve worked with me will say I can be an a-----e — all actors can be. That is different. He’s very similar to David Miscavige, they could be twins.”  This isn’t the first time Remini’s spoken publicly about the most famous Scientologist in the world — in an interview with Larry King late last year, she said she suspected Cruise thought she was “the devil” for leaving the religion.  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Apr 14, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT  “Tom and most Scientologists, all Scientologists, are taught to believe that people like me are literally the devil, that we mean them harm,” she said.  “Tom is very well-aware of what is Scientology, truthfully. He is very well-aware that it’s an organization that is defrauding people out of their lives.  “But in his heart, I believe he believes it.”  A post shared by Leah Remini (@leahremini) on Mar 3, 2017 at 7:38pm PST  Asked by another Reddit user how she’s now treated by Scientologists in Hollywood, Remini responded:  “They ignore me and walk out of rooms.”  This comes just days after ""Handmaid’s Tale"" actress and lifelong Scientologist Elisabeth Moss reportedly left the room at the Television Critics Association Awards when Remini took to the stage to accept an award.  “Elisabeth Moss believes that she can’t talk to me,” told Remini in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter published three days after the incident.  “There’s a thing in Scientology called ‘acceptable truth.’ It means you only say what’s acceptable to the public. But she believes that I’m an anti-social personality — because I’ve spoken out against Scientology. So she isn’t allowed to talk to me. And me knowing that, I wouldn’t put her in the awkward position.”  Moss does appear alongside Cruise’s ex-wife Nicole Kidman, who is believed to have left the church after their 2001 divorce, in the new season of drama ""Top Of The Lake.""The pair also appear together in an hour-long roundtable video interview with The Hollywood Reporter:  This article originally appeared in news.com.au.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,665

Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim. We’re told it’s “totally false.”“Brad Pitt Skips 2017 Oscars After Angelina Jolie Divorce: Couldn’t Bear To See Ex Jennifer Aniston Happy With Justin Theroux?” blares a new Celeb Dirty Laundry headline. Pitt produced Best Picture winner Moonlight, but the site purports that he didn’t attend the awards show because he “couldn’t bear the spotlight,” so he stayed home “skulking.”Without a single source to back up its claim, the repeatedly discredited website adds, “There’s also a high chance that he just wanted to avoid seeing Jennifer Aniston with her husband, Justin Theroux.” The unreliable webloid further claims, “Obviously, had Brad gone to the Oscars, he would have felt some regret when he saw his ex-wife happily married to another man when he was single and depressed.”Despite the outlet’s report being entirely baseless, Gossip Cop still checked in with a rep for Pitt, who exclusively assures us the story is “totally false.” The actor’s reason for not attending the Academy Awards had absolutely nothing to do with Aniston or Theroux, and the claim otherwise is ridiculous.Of course, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has had to call out CDL for concocting a nonexistent love triangle between the stars. We previously busted the webloid for falsely claiming Theroux warned Pitt to stay away from Aniston. Gossip Cop also debunked the site’s tall tale about Aniston trying to make Theroux look like Pitt.

Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. ""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.Donald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

0fd76f88-75fa-43b3-93d6-517f443bb3ad,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, along with their children, arrive at Los Angeles International Airport. When: 05 Feb 2014 Credit: WENN.com  Brad Pitt's attorney has slammed Angelina Jolie for trying to ""manipulate"" the media with her ""meaningful"" child support request, insisting the actor has given her more than $9 million in two years.    The ""Maleficent"" star's legal representative, Samantha Bley DeJean, filed papers in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, stating Jolie's intention to seek a court order forcing Pitt to cover a significant share of the costs of raising their six children, including retroactive payments.  In the documents, the 43-year-old actress/director claimed Pitt has ""paid no meaningful child support"" and failed to stick to the ""informal"" deal they had in place following their separation in September 2016 after two years of marriage.    However, the allegations have infuriated Pitt, and his attorney, Lance Spiegel, has now fired back at Jolie, suggesting she lied about the lack of child support funds.  In his response, filed on Wednesday, Spiegel dismisses Jolie's motion as ""unnecessary,"" branding it ""a thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage,"" reports TMZ.  He submitted paperwork detailing the funds Pitt has handed over to date, revealing he ""loaned"" his estranged wife $8 million to buy the house she and their kids are currently living in, and has paid in excess of $1.3 million ""in bills for the benefit of (Jolie) and the minor children.""  Spiegel goes on to criticize Jolie for urging the judge overseeing their case to issue a divorce decree by the end of the year, and allow them to settle other matters, including custody and child support, at a later date, arguing Pitt was the one who first suggested the idea, known as a bifurcation.    He alleges he approached Jolie's lead attorney, Laura Wasser, about the matter earlier this month and agreed not to file anything until she had time to discuss it with the actress, only for another of the star's legal officials, DeJean, to submit the motion the following day ""to create the impression that she, not (Pitt), wanted to bifurcate.""  According to People, Spiegel highlights the fact that since neither party is opposed to delaying the divorce process, the ""issue can now be resolved.""  Jolie was granted primary custody of 17-year-old Maddox, 14-year-old Pax, 13-year-old Zahara, 12-year-old Shiloh, and 10-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne as part of a December 2016 agreement.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,483

She died in a car crash in 1997. (Johnny Eggitt/AFP/Getty Images)  When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were married Saturday, there was one royal missing but not forgotten: Harry’s mother, Princess Diana.  Harry and his older brother, Prince William, have made sure to include their beloved late mother in their weddings.  [Listen on Retropod: Princess Diana’s final hours]  When William proposed to Kate Middleton in 2010, the engagement ring he gave her once belonged to Diana. And Harry proposed to Markle with an engagement ring containing diamonds from Diana’s jewelry collection. Markle is the same age as Diana when she died: 36.  Harry, Kensington Palace said in a statement this month, was “keen to involve his mother’s family in his wedding.”  Diana’s sister, Lady Jane Fellowes, gave a reading during the service at St. George’s Chapel inside Windsor Castle, which was decorated with white roses, Diana’s favorite flower. Diana’s two other siblings, Earl Spencer and Lady Sarah McCorquodale, also attended, with the Spencer family “helping to celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day.”  [Royal wedding 2018 live coverage]  Diana was devoted to her sons, and they were devoted to her. William was 15, and Harry was 12 when she was killed in a Paris car crash on Aug. 31, 1997. The boys were on vacation with their father, Prince Charles, at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and he delivered the news to them.  “One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died,” Harry said last year in a BBC documentary that marked the 20th anniversary of her death. “How you deal with that, I don’t know.”  Diana was renowned for her grace, beauty, philanthropic work — and for her struggles with life in the royal family. She had divorced Charles and was estranged from him, but before her death, things were looking up.  She had a new beau, Dodi Al Fayed, and a whirlwind romance — passionate, thrilling, scandalous.  The last day of Diana’s life began on the top deck of yacht, with croissants and fresh jams. She and Fayed sipped their coffee, marveling at the breathtaking Emerald Coast in Sardinia.  “They were in a good mood,” his butler remembered later. “They were always laughing, holding hands.”  Fayed, the son of Harrod’s department store owner Mohamed Al-Fayed, was a rich playboy. Diana was the mother of the future King of England and the most photographed woman in the world.  [Queen Charlotte and the wedding of Britain’s first mixed-race royal]    Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed in St. Tropez on Aug. 22, 1997. (Patrick Bar/AP)  The tabloid attention on them was intense.  That Saturday — Aug. 30, 1997 — promised to be a moment of change. The princess knew it. She sneaked a call to Richard Kay, a friend who covered the Royals for the Daily Mail, and told him, as he later wrote, “she had decided to radically change her life.”  Diana had decided that starting that weekend she would withdraw from public life and wrap up her obligations with charities.  Diana had not told Kay why, but he had a hunch: “They were, to use an old but priceless cliche, blissfully happy. I cannot say for certain that they would have married, but in my view it was likely.”  In the 20 years since she’s been gone, there have been countless revisions to this love story. Her friends and relatives: They were not in love! His friends and relatives: They were in love!  Fayed wanted to propose that night, even though they had been dating less than a month. He had a diamond ring waiting in Paris, where he planned to pop the question over dinner.  [Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle: When royal wedding traditions fall]  As soon as they landed in Paris, Fayed saw the paparazzi out his window.  The couple headed for Fayed’s apartment — trailed, of course, by photographers. More were waiting at the building’s front door when they arrived. Fayed was irate. There was an ugly shoving match.

Coroner)  They tried to go to a restaurant — Chez Benoit, a cozy, casual bistro not far from the city center — but it was quickly overrun by photographers. They split and headed for The Ritz, ducking into the dining room hoping to be left alone. But other diners were staring.  The couple left and had their food delivered to the Imperial Suite. Fayed’s proposal plan was in shambles. The only option left was to head back to his apartment.  The hotel was swarming with photographers, so Fayed devised a plan: The couple’s driver and bodyguards would make a big show out front, appearing to get their caravan of Mercedes sedans ready to leave. Meanwhile, the princess and Fayed would slip out the back door and take a borrowed car driven by a hotel security officer.  The couple did get away, but what happened next was the subject of lengthy investigations and conspiracy theories that live on today. As the couple sped off, the photographers out front got tipped off about the escape, quickly catching up on their motorcycles. Their driver darted in and out of traffic, finally crashing inside a tunnel near the Eiffel Tower. It turned out he had been drunk behind the wheel.  Fayed died instantly. Diana died at the hospital. Her death startled the world.    Prince William (left) and Prince Harry, bow their heads as their mother’s coffin is taken out of Westminster Abbey after her funeral. (Adam Butler/AFP/Getty Images)  An up-and-coming anchor named Brian Williams broke into regular coverage on MSNBC to announce the news to Americans in the early morning hours of Aug. 31.  “I’ve just been handed from the Reuters news service what has been marked ‘bulletin,’ ” Williams said, speaking slowly. “It says, ‘Princess Diana has died.’ ”  In the BBC documentary, Prince William recounts “feeling completely numb, disorientated, dizzy — and you feel very, very confused. And you keep asking yourself, ‘Why me?’ the whole time. Why? What have I done, why has this happened to us?”  Harry remembers his initial reaction as “disbelief, refused to accept it. There was no sudden outpour of grief. I don’t think anybody in that position at that age would be able to understand the concept of what that actually means going forward.”  What it means: On Saturday, Harry married the woman he loves without the mother he loves.

643e6829-0b43-49d5-a967-4fbab57571aa,"Gwen Stefani has reportedly suffered a miscarriage after conceiving her fourth child, which also would have been the first child of her boyfriend, country singer Blake Shelton.  Over two years into the musical couple's relationship, a new report claims that 48-year-old Stefani has been left heartbroken at the alleged loss, especial considering she and her boyfriend had reportedly been trying to get pregnant for over a year.  “It was very hard for her,” a source close to the singer told Radar Online on Feb. 8.  According to the report, Stefani learned that she had allegedly suffered a miscarriage during a recent visit to her obstetrician where an ultrasound technician was said to have been unable to find her baby's heartbeat. However, she has kept the rumored news on the down-low.  During the process of trying to get pregnant, Stefani resorted to in-vitro fertilization and after being forced to take a number of fertility drugs, she was reportedly left exhausted, both physically and emotionally.  “Gwen is 48 and was very insecure about not being able to give Blake a baby,” a friend claimed. “She knows that would never be a problem for his ex Miranda Lambert because she’s only 34!""  Although Stefani is said to be understandably disappointed by the news of her alleged miscarriage, she hasn't given up on getting pregnant, according to the report, and is up to take on the in-vitro fertilization process in the future.  In addition to the heartbreak they reportedly suffered to due Stefani's alleged miscarriage, Shelton has reportedly faced even more heartbreak after Stefani reportedly decided to put their wedding plans on hold.  News of Stefani's alleged miscarriage and plans to put her wedding to Shelton on hold come just months after a source told Hollywood Life that the couple, who often stars alongside one another on The Voice, was considering eloping.  “They know that is going to be a big deal when they finally get themselves married,” a source told the outlet in November. “So much so that they are considering just eloping and then having a big party to celebrate with friends and family.""  The insider said that Stefani and Shelton are completely in love and will continue to be in love whether they have a big wedding or not. In addition, they have both already been married before and didn't feel that an elaborate ceremony was necessary.

72bedabc-a3a9-4884-988e-54b46f1886ec,"Move over Tayor Swift and Selena Gomez, because there’s a different duo in Hollywood giving us some serious #BFFGoals.  Samuel L. Jackson and Judge Judy stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend, reminding us just how much we love this friendship. The ”Captain Marvel” star shared a candid photo with his pal — aka Judith Sheindlin — on Instagram.  Many users commented about the seemingly unlikely friendship, dying to know what the actor and daytime TV boss could be talking about. Well, these two actually go way back. “The Kong: Skull Island” star was asked about the origin of their bond last year on “Watch What Happens Live.”  Jackson, 69, and Sheindlin, 75, had mutual friends, meeting through the actor’s agent, Toni Howard. The pair also know each other through Jackson’s lawyer — “my lawyer’s husband is the guy who makes her deals,” he said.  As Jackson recalled, they met at Howard’s house, and they used to smoke cigarettes together. “So we would sit in Toni’s backyard and smoke, and when Judy stopped smoking, she made me stop smoking. She sent me to her doctor in White Plains, who actually treats you with sodium pentothal, and I quit smoking. But Judy used to get up in the middle of the night to smoke. She’s like, ‘I used to wake up to smoke.’”  “WWHL” host Andy Cohen asked Jackson if Judge Judy was intimidating, to which he replied, “No! Judy’s awesome. She’s great. … I’ve had tea with Judy at the Dorchester in London, and hang out and fly back and forth cross-country with her on planes. Judy’s awesome.”  Photo: Getty Images Judge Judy and Samuel L. Jackson sharing a laugh.  Jackson added, “She’s straight up clocking dollars.”  It’s true — last year, Forbes ranked Judge Judy No. 8 on its list of America’s Richest Female Entertainers. Her CBS show has been on the air since 1996, and she’s estimated to be worth around $300 million.  In 2017, “Judge Judy” wrapped its fourth consecutive year as the most-watched syndicated TV show, and it continues to break records left and right. She counts her pal as one of her regular viewers.  Jackson revealed on the “Today” show that he includes in his contracts that his trailer on set must have a satellite television so “I can watch judge shows all day when I’m at work … all of them.”  Yes, “Judge Judy” would be one of those “judge shows,” in case you were wondering. He also praised his BFF on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” saying he loves watching “Judge Judy” “all the time,” adding they get together “at least four or five times a year.”  Hey, by Hollywood standards, that’s a lot.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,581

Harden and Khloé dated for about 8 months in 2015 but broke it off. In the interview, Harden doesn’t say much about his relationship, but he does explain why living that tabloid life wasn’t for him.  “I didn’t like all the attention,” said Harden, “I feel like it was for no reason.

42817896-cc50-4ce4-b407-cc52139b2ed8,"(CNN) Taylor Swift has used her latest video to throw some shade and let the world know she's heard everything people have been saying about her.  Swift premiered the video for ""Look What You Made Me Do"" Sunday night at MTV's Video Music Awards and it was a lot to take in.  The singer, who had been keeping such a low profile for so long that fans had started to worry, posted in an Instagram caption over the weekend saying ""There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation.""  It was a clever tease, given that "" Reputation "" is the name of her new album set to drop on November 10.  There will be no further explanation. There will just be reputation. A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 25, 2017 at 4:54am PDT  Since Tay has yet to give the low down on what it all means, we'll attempt to break it down for you:  The death of her rep  The singer gets right down to it, opening up her video with a tombstone that reads ""Here lies Taylor Swift's reputation"" before a zombie version of Swift climbs out of the grave.  And how did her reputation die?  The viewers don't get a cause of death, so one is left to assume Swift is making a statement about all the bad press she's gotten in the last year or so with everything from her break up and spat with producer and DJ Calvin Harris, to her highly-publicized falling out with rapper Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian.  Swift and the couple have had competing narratives as to whether Swift signed off on West calling her a ""b***h"" in a song lyric.  Some fans think Swift took a shot at West with the lyrics ""I don't like your little games, don't like your tilted stage/The role you made me play of the fool, no, I don't like you."" The rapper's last concert tour featured a floating and tilted stage.  The moment at the end of the video when Swift said ""Getting receipts, gonna edit this later"" as she pointed her camera phone and mimicked the act of recording a video was interpreted by some fans as a swipe at Kim Kardashian, who was said to have ""brought receipts"" to her husband's spat with the pop star.  Said ""receipts""-- an internet catchphrase used to call for proof or evidence -- was a video of a phone conversation between the rapper and Swift, which Kardashian said proved the singer knew about the song lyric she later complained about. Swift shot back at the time that no where did the video show her approving being called a ""b***h.""  Shading an old frenemy?  The internet also has some theories about a scene in which Swift dressed up to look like Katy Perry.  One fan tweeted a screen grab of the scene writing ""#TaylorSwift personates #KatyPerry holding a #Grammy because Taylor has plenty & Katy doesn't have one.""  The two have had a long-standing feud and interestingly enough Perry was the host of the VMAs this year.  Remember the Tay-shirt controversy?  Swift gave a nod to last year's hoopla over then-boyfriend actor Tom Hiddleston, who wore a white ""I Heart T.S."" tank while the pair frolicked with friends at the beach for Fourth of July weekend.  She cheekily had a group of male backup dancers wear crop tops with the same message, though in black, possibly to match the stilettos they rocked.

There's earnest, nerdy Swift from the ""You Belong With Me"" video who was scolded by zombie Swift saying, ""Stop making that surprise face, it's so annoying.""  ""You can't possibly be that surprised all the time,"" said ballerina Swift, who appeared in the ""Shake It Off"" music video.  The just starting out, acoustic guitar version of Swift from her teen years was told to ""Stop acting like you're so nice, you are so fake"" by circus ringleader Swift from the 2012 MTV European Music Awards.  When baby Swift starts to cry, a nearby Swift says ""There she goes playing the victim, again.""  The video ends with the version of Swift who was famously interrupted by West during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.  Wearing that same off the shoulder gown and clutching her VMA award, Swift utters her now infamous line ""I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative"" which was part of her official statement to the whole West-Kardashian kerfuffle, to which the rest of the Swifts respond with a resounding ""Shut up!""  On Tuesday, YouTube announced that ""Look What You Made Me Do"" had the biggest debut of any video in its history with 43.2 million views in 24 hours.  The previous record holder was Psy's ""Gentleman"" with 36 million views in the first 24 hours.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1231

She isn’t even dating at the moment,” the insider reveals. “Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it’s extremely low-key.”  The Salt actress, 42, and estranged husband Brad Pitt officially called it quits in September 2016 after more than 10 years together and two years of marriage. They are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.  “The divorce talks between Brad and Angie are ongoing,” the source adds, noting that Pitt, 54, is lonesome for their children, who live with their mom. “Brad wishes the kids would spend overnights at his house, but he is hopeful that over time, that will organically happen.”  The Tomb Raider star and Pitt much of their marriage on the move, raising their family in various cities. But since their split, Jolie and the kids have remained in L.A. “Angie is frustrated that Los Angeles has become the home base for the family,” the source says. “Yes, she does travel, but she misses the nomadic lifestyle of moving around every three or four months. It’s best for the kids that they aren’t moving around all the time. Angie has a restless spirit and would have continued to roam around the world with the kids if the divorce hadn’t occurred. Brad insisted that the kids have stability and wanted them to stop moving around.”  Jolie opened up about raising her kids as a single mother in a September 2017 interview with the Sunday Telegraph. “It’s been difficult. I don’t enjoy being single,” the First They Killed My Father director admitted. “It’s not something I wanted. There’s nothing nice about it. It’s just hard.”  Although Jolie puts on a brave face for the cameras, she quietly battles her emotions. “Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it together, but really, I am just trying to get through my days,” she disclosed. “Emotionally, it’s been a very difficult year.”  Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,473

Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward saying he confided in them that he was unsure of the paternity of the now-27-year-old.  Jan Ashley, who married the businessman after Khloe's mother Kris Jenner, said: 'Khloe is not his kid -- he told me that after we got married.'  And Ellen Pierson, 63, who married Robert in 2003 just two months before his death, has also come forward after eight years of silence to 'tell the truth' about the Kardashian family.  Claims: Two of Robert Kardashian's ex-wives have come forward claiming the lawyer told them Khloe Kardashian, left, was not his real daughter, like older sisters Kim and Kourtney  The reality star has hit back at the claims, calling them 'really low'.  In an explosive interview with Star magazine, Ashley said: 'He just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said ""Well, you know that Khloe's not really a Kardashian, don't you?""    'And I said… ""OK"" and that was it.'  She claims Khloe, who is married to Dallas Mavericks basketballer Lamar Odom, knew she had a different father to her sisters and younger brother Rob.  'Khloe brought it up all the time. She looked nothing like the rest. She was tall, had a different shape, light hair, curly hair. Didn't look anything like the other three children.'  Different: Khloe has often pointed out that she looks nothing like her older sisters and their mother Kris, far right, said once people asked whether she was 'the milkman's child'  Fighting back: Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter She said Robert, who is of Armenian descent, had told her that he and Kris were not sleeping together at the time Khloe was conceived. '[But] he never would have considered a DNA test. He loved her very much. Robert did question the fact that Khloe was his,' Ellen said. 'Any normal man would if they knew their wife had cheated on him.' Khloe has responded to the claims today on Twitter.  Daddy's little girl: Robert Kardashian, pictured with Khloe as a child, referred to having four biological children in court documents filed in 1999 She wrote: 'The audacity you have to mention my father’s name like this! Should be ashamed of urself! I let a lot of things slide but this one is really low… YOU ARE DISGUSTING! (yes you know who YOU are).'    High-profile: Robert represented O.J. Simpson in his murder trial in 1994  Kris, 56, recently admitted in her new book that she cheated on Robert during their marriage.  Since Robert's death, Ellen had experienced financial difficulties, filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010.  The home she and Robert shared in Indian Wells, California, was sold after going into foreclosure in October.  Kris remarried Olympian Bruce Jenner in 1991 and the couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie.  Bruce already had four children from two previous marriages: Burt, Casey, Brody, and Brandon.    Khloe is often talking about how she looks nothing like her sisters, and Kris has been quoted as saying people asked her whether she was 'the milkman's daughter' when she was born.    On Khloe's blog in June 2010, she shared a number of pictures of her and the attorney.  She wrote: 'Father’s Day is two days away, so in preparation I wanted to post this photo album (mostly old school pics) dedicated to my dad and to Bruce.  'I was seriously the luckiest girl in the world growing up because I had two amazing dads who not only loved us kids more than anything, but adored each other as well.

dfd6bdeb-3e0d-4008-b92b-b5f6903e1c33,"Michelle Obama has been mostly laying low on one vacation after another since leaving the White House, only to emerge when she sees an opportunity to publicly slam President Donald Trump. A lot of questions have come up about the former first lady, starting when Barack Obama was still the president and continuing on now as the two live very separate lives. Although she’s desperately tried to hide the truth for months, a doctor has recently revealed what she has diagnosed her with which confirms our suspicions as well as our fears.Many have felt that Michelle’s behavior in the final months of being the first lady was strange, even for her, and has only gotten more alarming since the arrogant woman left the White House, but perpetually tries to remain as the center of everyone’s attention. Much of the country is happy to have her and her husband out of politics and wish that she’d slip into obscurity, but she refuses. Now we know why.Michelle’s hate for America seemed to become more obvious as the grip of power she had while her husband was president started to slip away at the end of his second term as their eviction dated neared. Every chance she got to make disparaging remarks about the country, she took, which has been a habit that’s only gotten worse in her post-presidential life. Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, shed some light on why Michelle did this as result of what she unofficially diagnosed her with.Biz Pac Review reported on the issue at the end of Obama’s administration before Trump took office:Why is First Lady Michelle Obama suddenly appearing so many places disparaging the country in the last days of her husband’s presidency?Dr. Lauren A. Wright, PhD, who is director of investor relations at NV5 Global, Inc. and a member of the White House Transition Project, recently wrote a book entitled, “On Behalf of the President: Presidential Spouses and White House Communications Strategy Today.”Wright diagnosed Mrs. Obama’s recent behavior. She has become an attack dog in an effort to help Obama build his legacy as the last days of his presidency slip away.“She’s in legacy building mode. She doesn’t have to worry about the implications [of her remarks] for months to come,” Wright said. “This is the time she’s most free to say what she feels, what she believes, and what she wants the message to be for the public.”As First Lady, Obama has given more public speeches and indulged more appearances than any First Lady in history, Wright reported in her book.“I think what surprises and upsets people most often is that first ladies give more public remarks than vice presidents, and that’s been true over the last three administrations,” she wrote.Of her biggest, and most disturbing claims she made in her campaign of hate against the country was that America is a racist nation who needed her husband in office and that she’s now suffering a feeling of “hopelessness” with Trump in office. Doubling down on that disrespectful sentiment is that she said she was never proud of America until her husband got elected to the White House. It’s ironic how Michelle says Barrack was successful in inspiring hope in the nation after everyone overwhelmingly voted Trump in, desperate for the hope his predecessor promised and failed to deliver on.The best case of revenge was how miserably she failed at building her legacy and trying to save it in the final days, especially now, that Trump just took the final sledgehammer to her most beloved project. After her disastrous lunch program crumbled around her and even her biggest supporters were critical of the changes she made to school meals, her nemesis, Trump, came in and reversed all she had done. He then topped it off by giving kids back their chocolate milk that she had ridiculously robbed them of.Dean James from America’s Freedom Fighters let loose on Michelle and her nasty claims about our country she’s more than profited off of:So, Michelle is out there claiming that we are all racists and with Trump taking the White House the nation is in a state of hopelessness… This coming from someone who said she was never proud of America until her Muslim, racist pathetic husband was elected.Hey lady, I hate to break it to you but your ‘husband’ has destroyed America and has left the entire planet in a complete state of chaos. The only reason he was elected is because he is black.The truth of her desperate attempt to make America and President Trump look bad before she left was nothing more than a temper-tantrum by this entitled woman who knew that Trump was actually about to bring real hope back and in doing so prove what a failure his predecessor really was.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,927

USA TODAY  A former girlfriend of Ryan Phillippe has accused him of throwing her down a staircase. (Photo: Jordan Strauss, Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)  Actor Ryan Phillippe will not face criminal charges in the domestic violence case that resulted in a lawsuit being filed by a former girlfriend.  Frank Mateljan, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY that his office will not be pursuing the matter further.  ""The City Attorney's Office was referred this matter following an investigation by the LAPD,"" he said in a statement. ""After a thorough review, the matter was set for a City Attorney office hearing, during which both parties were present, detailed the incident, were advised on the law and given guidance as to how to avoid similar incidents in the future.  ""Separate hearings were held in August and September. No further action has been scheduled following our office hearing, though we do reserve the right to file charges up to one year after the incident.""  On Monday, model Elsie Hewitt, 21, sued the actor for $1 million, alleging assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Phillippe denies the accusations.  ""The claims are false,"" Phillippe's rep, Nicole Perna, said to USA TODAY in a statement.  Later in the evening, he expanded on his thoughts in a tweet confirmed by Perna.  ""I am saddened and disgusted by these false allegations being circulated about me,"" he wrote. ""At the time these allegations were initially made, I fully cooperated with law enforcement and a thorough investigation was conducted.""  He continued, ""As a man, raised by women, in a household where women's right's, feminism and advocacy were very much at the forefront, I am sickened that my name can be found in any article where domestic violence of any kind is being alleged.""  Hewitt's lawsuit, obtained by USA TODAY, says Phillippe, who is 22 years her senior, became increasingly possessive and violent towards her (often while under the influence) during their three-month relationship.  The document states that during their relationship, she observed Phillippe, 43, ""repeatedly abusing a panoply of legal and illegal drugs, including without limitation: cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms and steroids.""  Things reached a boiling point over the July 4th holiday, according to the suit, when Hewitt and a friend came to his house to pick up personal items she would need for an upcoming modeling job.  Phillippe, she describes, was ""discernibly drunk and high"" at the time, and became increasingly ""agitated and hostile."" In an effort to diffuse the situation, Hewitt asked to speak with him privately upstairs.  When that plan failed, she called her friend to come upstairs while she cleared out her belongings from his bedroom.  At that point, the lawsuit says, Phillippe grabbed Hewitt by the arm (""so tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm hours later"") and ""violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.""  She made a second trip up the stairs only to be cornered, kicked and thrown down the stairs again. As and her friend fled, he cursed and screamed ""get the (expletive) out of my house, you crazy (expletive)!""  Soon afterward, she sought treatment at the emergency room at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where police filed a report, noting ""visible injuries to (Hewitt's) legs, back, arms, shoulder and face"" and granted her a week-long emergency protective order, which was served at Phillippe's home on July 6.  The day beforehand, Hewitt says he texted her saying he was ""so sad"" and contacted her friends via private message on social media that he was ""heartbroken"" and ""in disbelief"" that police had come to his home.  ""I can't believe she'd do this to me,"" he allegedly wrote, adding he ""would never hurt her like she's claiming. I didn't hit or punch or kick her.""  The friend who witnessed the encounter replied, ""I saw the whole thing Ryan, you literally were grabbing her and threw her down the stairs.""  Hewitt is seeking $1 million in punitive damages, citing emotional distress and the impact physical attack had on her ability to work as a model since her ""income and career (are) largely contingent upon her physical features.""  Phillippe's publicist released a statement flatly denying the account.  In his tweet, Phillippe noted, ""I have been a public figure for almost 25 years and many untrue things have been said or written about me in the past. That is something you learn to accept if you choose a profession like mine. This time is different.""  He also took offense at the notion of using this type of accusation for personal gain: ""Domestic violence is a very real and tragic issue for many women the world over and should never be used to vengefully slander or as a ploy for monetary gain. This is wrong. This is not who I am. Every one of my accuser's allegations (is) false.""  Phillippe was previously married to Reese Witherspoon, who filed separation papers in 2006 after seven years of marriage. Their divorce was finalized in 2008.  They have two children together: 18-year-old daughter Ava and 13-year-old son Deacon.

Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was “blindsided” by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a “hush-hush annulment.”  Subscribe To Our Newsletters — And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox  The smell test: For the love of Liverpool — this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It’s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she’s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn’t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we’re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what’s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even “hush-hush annulments” are a matter of public record. The Enquirer’s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty’s Secret Service) probably “scrubbed the records” to conceal Markle’s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.  The rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie  Where you heard it: Vanity Fair  The report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple’s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It’s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. “What I’ve heard is that they’re seriously worried about the sex scene,” the movie’s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his “wife’s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.”  The smell test: What really reeks here is Huda’s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife’s connection, you can be sure he won’t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude — it’s called protecting your source.) Is the palace “seriously worried” about this movie? It’s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it’s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they’d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan’s premarital sex-fest wasn’t coming soon to a TV near you, but it’s not like it’s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal — a 1 being Kate Middleton’s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles’s tampon ambitions — this is a 2.  The rumour: Meghan’s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah  Where you heard it: The Mirror  The report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle’s mom visited Winfrey’s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O’s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed “US TV source,” who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: “It’s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,” quoth The Mirror’s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.  Rumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton ‘Hate Each Other’s Guts.’ Is That Really The Case?  The smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a “tell-all” if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a “tell-none” approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it’s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.  The rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring  Where you heard it: E! News  The report: This will-he-or-won’t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap “does want to wear a wedding band.” Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen’s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.  The smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that’s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan’s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1351

After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.  Speaking with Australian radio show Smallzy's Surgery, Azalea called Halsey's comments to The Guardian last week ""strange"" since they were seemingly totally unprovoked.  ""It's a bit weird to bring someone up in an interview that you weren't asked about,"" said Azalea, likening it to if she suddenly decided to diss Janet Jackson during that conversation without reason.  ""To me, because I'm a famous person and I know a lot of the time people have opinions and they're not always accurate, I really try very hard not to give my personal opinions about people that I don't know,"" Azalea continued. ""And I don't know her, I've never met her.""  In an interview published last week, Halsey targeted Azalea as someone she would never put on one of her records. Of Azalea, the singer said, ""She had a complete disregard for black culture. F---king moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.""  In response, Azalea told Smallzy, ""I thought it was a bit of a strange thing to throw that out there, but she's young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental when she's kind of in the same shoes. I'm sure she's getting judged all the time as well by people who don't really know her.

After her marriage with Justin Theroux ended, she has been constantly in the limelight being scrutinized for her reactions on how her ex is moving on after the split. A while ago it was Selena Gomez and now it is another actress who has been drawn into the picture. The Friends actress is fed up with hearing news of Emma Stone and Justin's budding romance.  The actress is reportedly furious seeing how things are unfolding for Emma and Justin. According to Radar Online, Jennifer is filled with 'furious rage' looking at both of them get close and taking various trips together. “It bugs the hell out of Jen that Justin got close to Emma during their marriage and she isn’t taking this lying down,” a source told the website.  Jennifer is not taking news about Emma and Justin well (Photo by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images)  It seems like Jennifer is taking every bit of help she can from her pals in order to get back at Emma. “She’s dragging Emma every chance she gets and warning pals like Jason Bateman and Jimmy Kimmel to avoid her,"" the source added. The website further added that Jennifer is ""fuming"" over their now public romance. “Jen and her squad take issue with the fact that Emma never met a role she couldn’t steal from another actress [most famously ‘La La Land’ from Emma Watson],” the source revealed.  “I don’t think she realizes who she messed with and how far Jen’s reach is,"" the source added. The website claims that the rage Jennifer has towards Emma is a lot like she had over Angelina Jolie after Brad Pitt broke up with her to be with the Maleficent actress. “This is a pattern for Jen, never directing the rage or gossip at the guy who left her but instead at the next woman he hooks up with,"" the source revealed.

The rumors about Emma and Justin dating emerged after the two were spotted dining together in NYC. The pair was all smiles as they were photographed heading into Blue Ribbon Sushi in Soho for a night out.  At the same time, nearly a month after Justin announced his split from Jennifer Aniston, he made his first public appearance at the Louis Vuitton fashion show during Paris Fashion Week on March 6. The actor was seen sitting next to Michelle Williams and Emma. The following month, Justin shared some pictures on his Instagram where it was seen that the actor was hanging out with the Queer Eye's Jonathan Van Ness and Emma. Knowing how one photo is enough to raise speculation, Justin was careful of the words he used and made sure that he made their relationship status clear in the caption.  ""Save lives! Save lives! Saving lives! Doing the most! Bffffffs. And yes. JUST bfffffs,"" he wrote. The pair was also spotted leaving Met Gala together even though they arrived separately at the event.

0ac2cd73-f2a5-474d-a4cd-21a318580af9,"Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.  When the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, ""wow. i can’t believe I’m posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I’m so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn’t have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics."" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.  It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).  This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.  And here's what Twitter had to say about it.  Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.  Dictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.  The account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, ""Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman."" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of ""self-made"" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.  One person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.  Kardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, ""CONGRATS @KylieJenner"" with three flame emojis. The second said ""Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY"" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)  One fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.  The tweet said, ""The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident."" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.  Whether you think Kylie Jenner is ""self-made"" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner.

35356862-9136-4353-9d52-ab6395b693de,"[This story contains spoilers from the March 14 episode of The X-Files.]    When first-time The X-Files scribe Karen Nielsen wrote Wednesday’s episode, “Nothing Lasts Forever,” she set out to tell a character-based piece.  “I wanted to have some character moments with Mulder and Scully — that was super important to me,” says Nielsen. “I thought it would be interesting to have Scully reflecting on her religion. My sister is very Catholic, and I’m not. So I liked the dynamic of Scully being very Catholic and Mulder not; I related to that.”    What Nielsen didn’t know at the time was that her episode would shift back one to become the penultimate episode of the season and potentially the series as a whole. Wednesday's episode revolved around a cult led by a former actress (Fiona Vroom) who was obsessed with maintaining their youth and the woman (Carlena Britch) trying to save her sister from them. The installment also could be the last “monster of the week” episode the iconic series does with its core team intact as star Gillian Anderson has said this will be her final year playing Scully.  “The pressure that society puts on women to be perfect, to be beautiful is intense, because we’re such a consumerism society that we have to prey off of women’s insecurity to sell, sell, sell,” Nielsen says. The writer, who doubles as the show's script coordinator, also made sure the female characters were well-rounded and the episode also featured an inclusive cast. “Especially in Hollywood, you’re a write-off after 30. That pressure is quadrupled as an actress. That was a horrible and wonderful rabbit hole to go down [in writing]: having an actress try to hold on to her youth and obtaining that.”  Nielsen credits longtime X-Files writers James Wong (who directed the hour) and Glen Morgan with being the genesis of Scully’s (Gillian Anderson) religious origin story in the episode. When Scully was younger, her brother was sick, and her mother asked the family to pray for him. The first few days, a young Scully asked for a puppy … which she got shortly after her brother recovered. “It was the architecture of Jim and Glen knowing this character for so long, and seeing the things that she should be coming from,” she says, calling the duo her “dream team” collaborators. Morgan was also the one to suggest they have a visual callback to the mysterious coin Scully’s mother had on her when she died last season.    The hour ended up being pivotal for Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully, whose relationship has grown increasingly murky. The dynamic duo’s partnership was always complicated during the original run of the series: after years of closeness, they slept together in season seven — a move that appeared to be responsible for the conception of Scully’s son, William — but due to outside forces (and Duchovny’s increased absence from the franchise) they were never properly a couple. The second feature film, The X-Files: I Want to Believe, found the two living together, away from the FBI life, but there was obvious tension in the relationship as they worked the movie’s case; they were broken up by the 2016 television revival.    However, they appeared to potentially reconcile early in season 11, when they slept together and arranged a couple of dates. But in true Mulder and Scully fashion, they simply seemed to be existing together (they still reside in separate homes, for instance) versus actively engaging the shift in their relationship and what it could mean. But Scully took a step forward to break them out of their standstill in the final scene of the episode: when Mulder mentioned they were good together, she simply asked, “Are we together?”  “To me it was about having a honest moment,” Nielsen says, acknowledging the open conversation between the two was part of why the episode moved directly pre-finale. “We need to be real, we need to be honest, we need to start saying something. They’ve gone through so many emotional things with their son, coming back to the X-Files and things not going so smoothly. And [also] coming back to the relationship, because they were away from it for so long; to see where that relationship sits now. It’s exhausting not being honest when you get to that stage. To be true to these characters, you had to have a true moment. It’s what those characters needed.”    But what was it that Scully needs? ""I don’t know if any God is listening, but I am standing right here,” Mulder told his partner. “And I am listening. Right besides you, all ears. That’s my choice.” She paused, looked around at the empty church, before whispering her hope for her future in his ear. “That’s not my 4-year-old self looking for a miracle,” she said. “That’s my leap of faith forward. And I’d like to do it together.”    The audience is in the dark about Scully’s request during the hour, intentionally. “That’s between Mulder and Scully,” Nielsen notes. “Having those private moments, it’s important for any couple.” And it won’t be revealed going forward, either: “It’ll always be between Mulder and Scully,” she says with a laugh. “It’s not for anyone else. That was their moment.” (Chalk it up to another unsolved mystery, a la the duo’s Christmas gifts to each other.)  With that exact sentiment remaining unspoken, it was essential the tone be handled correctly while filming the scene. “It’s just [them] being honest with each other,” Nielsen notes. “When you’re used to having that playful banter with someone, when they’re suddenly honest, it takes you aback. It’s, ‘Oh, we’re actually going to have a real conversation about this.’ Sometimes those things can be scary. It was something from the heart, which can be terrifying for her to do, especially given how much she’s been through and how much her heart has been broken, especially this season. That’s where I wanted it to come from: her vulnerability.”    And, yes, in Nielsen’s mind, Mulder and Scully are meant to be together. “I feel like they’re each other’s soulmates and they know it,” she says. “They get in each other’s way, they’re complicated, they both have reasons why they hold back. They both have reasons they need each other. That’s why they’ve had such an up and down relationship: it’s not as easy as saying, ‘I like you, let’s make this work.’ The world they live in just doesn’t allow for that. Their love for each other, mind and body, makes them go, ‘There’s nobody else.’ There are so many moments you see them, they look at each other, and just from a look, [it’s] no one will get me like you do. That’s my personal take on it: they’re soulmates.”    What do you think Scully whispered to Mulder?",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1450
ddaba07d-a6db-47e5-8527-3692b15219d6,"Viewers of the 2017 American Music Awards witnessed history.  Introduced by The Chainsmokers, BTS made their U.S. television debut at the 2017 American Music Awards on Sunday, November 19th. BTS is taking the U.S over a landslide by being the first Korean Pop Boy Band to perform on a major American awards show.  BTS delivered their latest hit “DNA” with flashy choreography and enormous support from their A.R.M.Y. (a name given to their international fanbase) who accompanied them with chants throughout their performance. Tweets during and after their epic performance took over social media with the hashtag #BTSxAMAs. Fans, attendees and those new to the K-pop boy band fanbase obsessed over their amazing dance moves, voice control, red carpet fashion and physical aspect of the members of the boy band.  BTS (currently standing for ‘Behind the Scenes’) is a seven-member South Korean Pop Band formed by Big Hit Entertainment. While most boy bands in the U.S. have from three to five members in their groups, South Korean bands are internationally known for having more than 10 members in the band.  Jin, J-Hope, RM (known as Rap Monster), Suga, Jimin, V and Jungkook are taking over the world as BTS with their latest album “Love Yourself: Her” which has helped them become the highest charting K-pop group on the Billboard Hot 100.  Their performance at the 2017 AMA’s was highly anticipated by fans of the band when they announced it on social media. ’To call this guys International superstars honestly seems like an understatement’ said Drew Taggart from The Chainsmokers before the boys bounded on stage  During their performance, fans were not the only ones freaking out. Almost everyone, including celebrity guests like Ansel Elgort, was on their feet cheering and singing along with the band. Ansel even appeared to be recording the performance on his phone. “I need a moment to recover from that performance. That was incredible” said Jared Leto who joined the BTS mania and who was also left speechless after BTS’s performance.  It is safe to say that BTS has officially introduced K-pop to the U.S with their mind-blowing AMA’s performance which has left fans and those new to the concept of K-Pop wishing for more. Luckily this will not be the last time we see BTS on our television sets since shows like Jimmy Kimmel and Ellen DeGeneres have already booked BTS for a special performance on their shows which you won’t want to miss.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,467
1bb84415-eb23-4479-bfa7-1521662c789a,"Trumpism and Brexit are often said to have failed to bring people together, and now the twin votes are being blamed for shattering one celebrity couple’s love affair.  The British actor Michael Sheen has claimed that he and the comedian Sarah Silverman broke up because of their passion for politics, and it wasn’t that they disagreed.  Both, in fact hold similarly anti-populist views, but, in a new interview, Sheen says that he and Silverman parted ways because she wanted to spend more time in America engaged in her I Love You, America project, which challenges Trumpism, and he wanted to be engaged in anti-Brexit campaigns in the U.K.  Sheen, who has previously compared the rise of populism to the rise of Nazism in Germany in the ’30s, told the Daily Telegraph that he was inspired to become more politically active by the Brexit referendum.  At the time, he and Silverman were living together in the U.S., but the votes signaled the end of their four-year relationship.  “We both had very similar drives, and yet to act on those drives pulled us in different directions—because she is American and I’m Welsh.  “After the Brexit vote, and the election where Trump became president, we both felt in different ways we wanted to get more involved. That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.  “I felt a responsibility to do something, but it did mean coming back here—which was difficult for us, because we were very important to each other. But we both acknowledge that each of us had to do what we needed to do.”  Sheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.  As the Telegraph says, Sheen “sounds a little wistful” about politics coming before love.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,395

On June 6, the country crooner celebrated the opening of his new restaurant and bar Ole Red Nashville, which joins his existing location in Tishomingo, Oklahoma. And though girlfriend Gwen Stefani wasn’t able to make it out to the festivities, she’s yet another reason he’s pinching himself these days.  “I wouldn’t change one thing about my life right now,” he tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue, on newsstands Friday.  “I’m happy,” he adds. “Sometimes happiness can seem like fleeting moments, but this one has been staying in the same lane for a long time. It’s just amazing.”  Blake Shelton poses for a photo behind the bar at Ole Red Nashville on June 6, 2018 in Nashville, Tennessee.

Though the pair spends most of their time in Los Angeles, they make it a point to jet off to his waterfront home in Oklahoma with Stefani’s three sons, Kingston, 12, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4.  “We love to go out on the lake,” says Shelton. “My family, Gwen and her family, we all get together and go out and float around.

Remember the video footage of Tom and Taylor dancing together at the Met Gala 2016? Well that would explain the ""ties were black"" bit.

This week, the internet is up in arms over the new Snapchat update. And it seems like everyone — Kylie Jenner included — wants the old Snapchat back.  ICYMI, the new Snapchat update more clearly separates your friend content from celebrity and media brand content. Meanwhile, it moves stories to the interface that holds your most-snapped friends. This could potentially be a good thing, except for the fact that people hate change. And this is one of the biggest changes to the app since it added media content in the first place. But never fear! Even if your Snapchat auto-updated, there’s a way to fix it. Yes, it’s possible to get rid of the new Snapchat and revert back to the old Snapchat.  Here’s how to get the old Snapchat back: First, you have to delete the app. Just make sure to back up your memories first! Then, change your settings to turn off automatic updates, and re-download the app. When you type in your email, click “Forgot Password.” Reset your password “Via Your Phone.” Then log back in, and voilà, you’re back to the old Snapchat. Phew.  Sure, it’s a little irritating to have to do go through those steps. But if you want the old Snapchat you know and love back, and you want it now, that’s what you’ve gotta do.  Some helpful Twitter users are spreading the word.  PSA: how to reverse the Snapchat update ‼️ pic.twitter.com/EN2wY3Xo5S — clare james (@clarejamess9) February 9, 2018  Snapchat itself has also weighed in on the hack.  Before reinstalling Snapchat or logging out, make sure Memories are backed up or you could lose them 😔    Settings > Memories > Backup Progress ‘Complete’ means you’re all set. If not, tap to see which Snaps need backing up.    You'll also need your password so you can log back in! — Snapchat Support (@snapchatsupport) February 10, 2018  But with this much public outcry, it’s hard to imagine there won’t be a more permanent fix for the old Snapchat sometime soon. If the app hopes to survive in this social media climate (with Instagram quickly encroaching on its territory), it’s got to pay more attention to its users.  In fact, change could already be on the horizon.  One Twitter user reached out to Snapchat directly and got this reply back:  false  Guess we’ll have to wait and see how long the teens’ outrage will last — and if it’ll be long enough to make Snapchat change its mind.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,539

But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court.

dc0de241-17aa-4969-a9fb-fa0ee3fdd2e0,"As hype around Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders grows, political opponents and media reporters are once again suggesting the socialist Vermont senator is a gun nut.""One issue your Democratic rivals are starting to hit you with is the fact that you have, in the past, sided with the NRA on some gun issues,"" CNN’s Jake Tapper said in a July 5 interview with Sanders, alluding to an attack ad paid for by a pro-Martin O’Malley group.""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods,"" said the attack, which first aired June 25. ""Bernie Sanders is no progressive when it comes to guns.""Sanders’ record on guns has been the subject of liberal ire (""Bernie Sanders, gun nut"") as well as conservative glee (""Sorry liberals, Bernie Sanders is a gun nut""). So we wanted to take a look at his vote on the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a landmark piece of gun control legislation.The Brady Act mandated that everyone who wanted to buy a handgun had to wait five days while local law enforcement ran criminal background checks. (After 1998, the firearm dealers became responsible for conducting the checks.)But before Brady became law, it underwent many transformations. Sanders, elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, voted on it numerous times, virtually almost always in opposition:• In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period for background checks, but the bill passed in the House.• The Senate decreased the waiting period to five days and the bill returned to the House. In Nov. 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Though it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes. The Brady bill and its gun control stance remained in limbo during 1992.• After some back and forth, a version of the bill resurfaced that reinstated the five day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version but for an amendment imposing an instant background check instead (seen by some as pointless, as the technology for instant checks didn’t exist at the time).• He also voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why.• The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it.According to Sanders' campaign manager Jeff Weaver, Sanders’ reason for opposing the Brady bill was two-fold. First, he believed implementing a national waiting period was federal overreach. And second, he was doing his job.""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Weaver said. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont.""In April 1991, Sanders’ then-chief of staff Anthony Pollina echoed the idea that Sanders was simply representing the will of his constituents.""Bernie’s response is that he doesn’t just represent liberals and progressives. He was sent to Washington to present all of Vermont,"" Pollina said. ""It’s not inappropriate for a congressman to support a majority position, particularly on something Vermonters have been very clear about.""The Green Mountain State, though left-leaning, has a high gun ownership rate and lax gun control laws (as well as a low homicide rate). That and Sanders’ own personal views are reflected in his overall voting record, experts told us.""As a rural state with a large number of hunters and other gun owners, Vermont has been less liberal on guns than on most other issues, historically,"" explained Bertram Johnson, a professor of political science at Middlebury College in Vermont. ""He seems to support more regulation of guns than the U.S. presently has, but he recognizes his constituents’ preferences so does not make gun control a priority.""""I think he has disappointed many progressives in Vermont with his gun positions, which sort of walk a middle line – and angering both sides through the years,"" said Chris Graff, the former Vermont Associated Press bureau chief. ""Gun control is a tough issue in Vermont for all politicians.""Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, whose 2004 presidential bid is often compared to Sanders’ 2016 run, received high marks from the National Rifle Association. Vermont Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy also voted against the Brady bill. For his part, Sanders has voted to tighten gun control about half the time, and to protect Second Amendment rights the other half.Here are his votes on key gun bills in his 25 years in Congress (bold reflects a pro-gun control position):Sanders’ moderate stance is noted by firearm enthusiasts and gun control advocates alike. Former NRA research coordinator Paul Blackman says the group doesn’t consider Sanders ""an anti-gunner,"" and he’s received mixed marks from NRA ranging from a C- to F. Brady Campaign president Dan Gross says Sanders has shown suppleness and evolution since those first Brady votes and added he isn’t a ""gun lobby lapdog.""Experts agreed that on guns, Sanders’ views are to the right of his Democratic rivals.""When it comes to guns, he’s not Ted Cruz, but he believes federal policy should be less intrusive than Martin O’Malley or Hillary Clinton,"" said Eric Davis, who studies Vermont politics at Middlebury College. ""Guns are not an important issue for him, because they don’t fit into the class-based framework that Bernie looks at politics through.""Our rulingAn attack ad said, ""Bernie Sanders voted against the Brady Bill -- background checks and waiting periods.""The Brady bill imposed a five-day waiting period for would-be purchasers of handguns. Between 1991 and 1993, Sanders voted against it five times. He did, however, vote for a version of the bill that imposed instant background checks, and against an amendment that repealed state background checks.Experts noted Sanders’ votes were representative of Vermont’s gun owners and gun laws.

Forget Kanye 2020, Kim Kardashian is ready for a younger West to assume the presidency and she’s convinced that that administration could begin now. In a cover story for Harper’s Bazaar Arabia, Kardashian has offered her assessment of Donald Trump’s first months in office and found that a different child could prove superior. “Not the president now,” she said when asked who should have the power that comes with being commander-in-chief. “Anyone can run the U.S. better. My daughter would be better.”  “We’ve worked so hard to get to where we were and to have so many things that we were so proud of in our country, to just literally revert backwards is the most frustrating thing,” she continued. “Every single day when you can’t really believe what’s going on, the next day it’s something else even more crazy and tragic. It’s really scary, the world that we’re living in now. And when you did feel safe at home, now with Trump in presidency you just don’t feel safe any more.”  Now, though North West may be but little (she’s 4), she is fierce and seemingly fit for the job. She’s already media trained, having given her first presidential interview in which we learned she has impeccable music taste, loves cheese, and has LGBTQ pride even if she doesn’t know it yet (her favorite color is “rainbow,” folks). And, unlike certain heads of state, we know she isn’t interested in photo ops or nepotism. One could argue she’s already the first daughter. If her father really runs in 2020 — who knows which party or which policies he’d support — he’s going to need proper counsel.

Khloé Kardashian says she has lost 33 lbs in the three months since she gave birth to daughter True, her first child, on April 12.  In a post on her official app, the 34-year-old reality star credited a “combination of breastfeeding and being very active” for the impressive weight loss.  Mommy’s Little Love A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 26, 2018 at 2:13pm PDT  “After I had True, I didn’t put any pressure on myself to lose the baby weight,” Kardashian wrote. “I just wanted to get back to my regular routine from before I got pregnant, which was working out five to six times a week.”  Then Kardashian got down to specifics: “Here is where I am at currently. True turned 3 months old on July 12. I honestly didn’t give myself a number that I wanted to lose by this time, especially since I wasn’t able to work out for the first six weeks. But, since then, I’ve lost 33 pounds! I’m shocked that I lost that much weight that quickly. I’m chalking this up to the combination of breastfeeding and being very active during and after my pregnancy.”  Shortly after she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson welcomed True, the Good American founder resumed workouts with her trainer, Joel “Coach Joe” Bouraïma, and she recently slammed speculation she was on a “ridiculous” post-baby diet.  And in her latest post, Kardashian emphasized the role of exercise in her life while asserting that not all mothers need to be such gym devotees. “I never compare myself to other women as every woman has their own journey. We also all have different priorities in our day-to-day lives.

Perry was even asked by Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Friday whether this song, off her upcoming Witness album, was about “anyone we know.” While the pop diva remained cryptic, she explained the meaning of “Swish Swish” is “liberation” from bullies.  “I think it’s a great anthem for people to use whenever someone’s trying to hold you down or bully you,” she said. “That’s kind of what this record is about, it’s just like [a] 360-degree liberation.” If “Chained to the Rhythm” was about “political liberation” and “Bon Appétit” was a “sexual liberation,” then Perry calls “Swish Swish” “the liberation from all the negative that doesn’t serve you.”  Perry directed her fans to the segment on social media Saturday morning. “Here’s some of the tea and a biscuit,” she tweeted.

Here's some of the tea and a biscuit ☕️https://t.co/7I50PYq66Z — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 20, 2017  Since “Swish Swish” dropped on Thursday, listeners, including Swift pal Ruby Rose, pointed to the lyrics as a diss track. “I’ve always stood up for the people I love and against things I think are cheap or mean spirited. That’s not new. You have to follow your [heart emoji],” Rose wrote in a series of tweets.  RELATED: Celebrity Feuds: A look at famous Hollywood fights  Perry and Swift have reportedly been feuding since an alleged spat over backup dancers a couple of years ago. Swift’s 1989 hit “Bad Blood” has long been rumored to be a strike against Perry, and when asked by Entertainment Weekly if Witness included a response to the Swift song, Perry said it was “not my question to answer — if it’s about me.”  She further explained, “I think [my new album is] a very empowered record. There is no one thing that’s calling out any one person. One thing to note is: You can’t mistake kindness for weakness and don’t come for me. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that’s not to any one person and don’t quote me that it is, because it’s not. It’s not about that.”  Watch her latest explanation of “Swish Swish” on The Tonight Show above.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,508

In an interview with The Daily Mail, Ramsay shared how his wife, Tana, was his biggest source of motivation for losing weight because she has always been a fitness enthusiast and let him know she wasn't pleased with his weight gain, according to People.

I look at the pictures and think, 'How did Tana stay around?' Because Tana has got better-looking and more gorgeous. And there she is, getting in bed with a fat f--k.""  Getty Images  Gordon and Tana have been married for over 20 years and have four children together, and at the time of his weight gain, he had just won his third Michelin star. But despite those accomplishments, Ramsay said he still suffered from low self-esteem.  ""It was painful,"" he said. ""I used to look at myself in the mirror and think, 'Holy s--t!' So it was a big wake-up call.""  The chef attributed his weight gain to not eating properly when working long hours and during vacation trips with David and Victoria Beckham and their respective families. ""I didn't have a figure,"" Ramsay said. ""I didn't feel that good. After working my a-- off and achieving a lot, I wanted to get in serious shape.""  Gordon Ramsay in June 2011.

It's lethal: from obesity to heart attacks to cocaine habits.""  Around 2012, Ramsay began to make life change. ""I started focusing on getting super-fit five or six years ago when my life got super-busy,"" he told The Daily Mail. ""You get consumed by the work. You get sucked up. You get drawn in. All of a sudden your 'me time' is zero. There was no breathing space, no down time, no time to even think straight. It all started hitting me hard. I didn't panic, but my head was not in the game.""

The 51-year-old said he stays inspired to lead a healthy lifestyle, because he does not want to die at a young age like his dad, who passed away at 53.  ""That's only a couple of years' time,"" he said. ""I've got this reminder to get fit, it's scary. I get the fear on a daily basis. I may have not got on with him, but I still miss him. I miss everything I could have had from him if he was still alive in his 70s.""

The singer said on Monday that she still loves ex-fiancé Taylor Kinney and joked she won’t be celebrating when he starts to date again. But Page Six is told that the “Chicago Fire” actor — who was engaged to Gaga for 18 months until their July split — has already moved on.  Insiders say that Kinney has been quietly dating a 26-year-old girl from South Philadelphia, Alanna DiGiovanni, and unlike his ex’s alter ego, we’re told she’s not a Fame Monster: DiGiovanni is a former Atlantic City bottle-service waitress who now works in radiology at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.  Kinney and DiGiovanni recently visited Austin, Texas, together to attend the Formula One race and Taylor Swift concert, and we’re told DiGiovanni has visited him in Chicago, where he shoots the NBC show.  “Alanna is head over heels,” we’re told. “He’s told her he’s planning to visit her in Philly; maybe as soon as this weekend.”  Gaga — whose new album, “Joanne” was released on Friday — said on Howard Stern’s Sirius XM show on Monday, “I’m actually very close to Taylor. He’s been my lover and my friend for a really long time,” adding that there’s “a lot on this record inspired by our relationship.” But asked if she would be happy if Kinney started dating again, she said, “I’m not going to f - - king throw a party!”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,305
9abd1ef9-341e-4194-bce2-d9ef6c01a070,"CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photos or video on a mobile device  With Angelina Jolie finally moving on from her nasty, splashy split from Brad Pitt, you would expect her to shy away from dating someone else super-famous.  But you would think her next romantic interest would still be someone whose profession matched her preferences for prestige artistry or international do-gooding: a documentary filmmaker, a human rights crusader, an Ebola doctor.  But no, Jolie’s choice reportedly is far more home-grown and, well, mundane in a L.A. way.  Jolie, the Oscar winning actress, UNHCR special envoy and occasional New York Times op-ed columnist, is dating a real estate agent. That’s according to a new report in “Entertainment Tonight.”  Of course, at this stage, things are still pretty new, which means “it’s not serious,” a source told ET.  But the so-called real estate agent, who has not been identified, reportedly has a few things going for him that would make him appealing to the glamorous 42-year-old actress and mother of six, ET said.  He’s handsome, a source close to the actress told ET. He’s also “older-looking” and isn’t “a celebrity or high-profile” in any way, the source added. These are qualities that would probably make him relatively down-to-earth — by Jolie standards — and confer on him a maturity and stability that could be comforting to her.  After all, she was “in a very bad place” after her acrimonious split from Pitt in September 2016, “ET” reported. Their breakup included allegations of drinking and anger management problems — on his part — and led to investigations by child welfare authorities until the couple quietly worked out visitation and other issues. The estranged couple share children Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  “Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful,” the source added to ET.  But not so fast, sources have told both Us Weekly and People. Both outlets reported Tuesday, citing their own Jolie sources, that Jolie isn’t dating a real estate agent — or anyone for that matter at the moment.  “Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it’s extremely low-key,” a source told Us.  Unfortunately, things are still difficult between her and Pitt, added The Daily Mail. “Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they’ve attempted therapy with the children, they can barely be in the same room together,” a source said.

Because the breakup has forced Jolie to curtail her globe-trotting ways and base herself in Los Angeles — close to Pitt for the sake of the children — there is speculation that if Jolie were seeing a real estate agent — or anyone else — the man would be based in Los Angeles, the Daily Mail said.  And if there is a real estate agent with whom she has become friendly, he could be someone with celebrity clientele.  Perhaps he could have been someone involved in settling Jolie into her new house — the $25 million estate in Los Feliz she bought last year, which once belonged to legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Incidentally, Jolie’s mansion is “just down the street” from Pitt’s estate in Los Feliz — for the sake of the kids, of course.  Whether or not there is a real estate agent boyfriend in Jolie’s life, or she’s just single and focusing on her kids, her friends are relieved to see her happy for a change, ET reported.  She also seems to have settled into enjoying her day-to-day life. She is often spotted out and about in Los Angeles, usually with one of her six kids in tow, doing ordinary-people things like shopping at a neighborhood Whole Foods or going to the movies — including, reportedly, the new “Tomb Raider” reboot, starring Alicia Vikander in the iconic role that Jolie made famous in 2001’s “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider” and the 2003 sequel.  But fans should get over the idea that Jolie and Pitt will reunite. “It will never happen,” a source told ET. The 54-year-old Pitt is quietly and casually going out on dates, but mostly getting out to spend time with friends, “ET” added.

c747fd90-ab66-4efb-b8a9-18514d11112d,"Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel has been fired for covering-up the truth about what happened during the Parkland shooting.According to reports, following a criminal investigation by Florida Governor Rick Scott, Sheriff Israel will be replaced as early as next week.From Big League Politics: Sheriff Israel is being removed from office for criminal issues, not malfeasance, following an investigation conducted by the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott. The source exclusively revealed to Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is also allegedly being investigated by the IRS.The high-level police source within the Sheriff’s Office disclosed that over the last several months, four candidates have been interviewed to refill the position of Broward County Sheriff. One of the candidates who were interviewed is Emery Giany, a Republican Florida law enforcement official who is closely associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.During the IG’s testimony last week, FBI director Christopher Wray was asked about the Parkland school shooting. When asked, Wray declined to answer any questions about the shooting and Sheriff Israel, citing that it was an active FBI investigation. Following the Parkland shooting, Governor Scott called for Director Wray to resign over the FBI’s failure to properly investigate Nikolas Cruz, 19, the school shooter whose plans to carry out a school shooting were reported to the FBI twice prior to the shooting on Valentine’s Day.“We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI Director needs to resign,” Governor Scott said.According to the source in the Broward Sheriffs office, Sheriff Israel’s removal revolves around a criminal matter that the FBI is aware of. Although his failures surrounding the Parkland shooting initially sparked the investigation, it isn’t the sole reason why he is being removed.The high-level source who wished to remain anonymous told Big League Politics that Sheriff Israel is already aware of the fact that he is being removed from office next week.Sheriff Israel has been under heavy criticism for his handling of the of the Parkland school shooting, which left 17 people dead. Following the Valentine’s Day school massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, it was revealed that police officers under Sheriff Israel’s order were called to the home of the Parkland shooter 45 times prior to the school shooting.It is unclear why law enforcement officials law enforcement at the Broward County Sheriff’s office and FBI failed to properly investigate Cruz, but their massive failure has been directly attributed to the loss of 17 lives in Parkland, FL.Since the Parkland shooting, a lot of unflattering information has come out regarding Sheriff Israel. Along with being a mouthpiece for Democratic politicians and gun control advocates, like Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz who he has been photographed with, Sheriff Israel and his department have recently made headlines for more controversy.In May, it was revealed that Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school and the Broward County Sheriff’s office were keeping quiet the fact that Sheriff Israel’s son, Brett, had allegedly assaulted a 14 year old student on campus in an act of bullying.Shortly after the Parkland shooting, cell phone video filmed by Cruz himself revealed that he himself felt bullied, which lead him to carry out a massacre on February 14, 2018 in a targeted attack against his former classmates.Most recently, Sheriff Israel received a massive amount of backlash after the Broward County Sheriff’s office tweeted a picture of a new custom made Broward sheriff’s car that read, “Our new #dodge #charger. Do you like the paint job?”The tweet sparked outrage online from Republicans and Democrats alike who quipped that the Broward Sheriff’s office should use the funds to pay for better officer training, not new cars. Leaders on both sides of the aisle have called for Sheriff Israel to resign or be removed by the Governor for his extreme dereliction of duty and failure to prevent one of the worst schools shootings in US history.During the Florida GOP Primary debate in Florida last week, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam and Rep. Ron DeSantis were asked about the Parkland school shooting. Both Putnam and DeSantis called for the removal of Scott Israel while asserting their support of the Second Amendment.“I would have removed that sheriff from Broward County. He failed his citizens and he should have been removed,” DeSantis said.“Sheriff Israel is under investigation and he needs to go,” Putnam said.Governor Scott is expected to release a statement in the coming week when Sheriff Israel is removed from office. Scott is currently running for US Senate in Florida, and news of Sheriff Israel’s removal is sure to boost his approval rating in what is gearing up to be one of the most important Senate races in the country.In the days following the Parkland shooting, Sheriff Scott Israel was confronted and asked about his support of and affiliation with the Democratic Party and why he chose to blame guns instead of holding his department and the FBI accountable. Unable to withstand tough questioning, Sheriff Israel became flustered and ended the interview after saying, “the only person accountable for this killing is the detestable, cowardly, murderer. He is solely responsible for this horrific act.” However, as the investigation into Parkland has shown, both Sheriff Israel and the FBI dropped the ball and are to blame for their failure to prevent the shooting despite receiving multiple warning signs.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,1033

The fashion world is gearing up for the biggest fashion event of the year – Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show. The lingerie brand have shortlisted the models who will walk the ramp this year and have handed out their wings. While model-sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid have reclaimed their wings and are preparing to return to the stage, the organisers have dropped Kendall Jenner from this year’s line up.  The 21-year-old, who has been a part of the prestigious fashion event for two years now, will not return this year and the news has left the Kardashian family member disappointed. Reports suggest that Jenner is so mad with the brand that she is going about dissing and name-calling them.  A website named News Punch claimed that Jenner was overheard telling friends that she was not added to this year’s show because she told the brand’s bosses that she doesn’t worship Satan, indirectly hinting them as illuminati.  The website in question also quotes the model saying that Victoria’s Secret’s models are “Illuminati prostitutes” who are “degraded on a daily basis by the worst kind of guys – followers of Satan.”  Apparently Jenner added, “You wouldn’t believe what these girls are forced to go through. They tried to lure me into the cult but I had to take a step back to hold onto my soul. [Victoria’s Secret’s models have] made a pact with Satan to get where they are. These girls have really bad mental health issues. They are beaten and sexually tortured, and regularly drugged so that they fall unconscious and their owners can do what they like with them.”  While these statements are shocking, Gossip Cop’s sources claim that they aren’t true. The website also reveals that Jenner’s absence from 2017 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show is due to a deal she signed with lingerie giant La Perla.  Though fans of the famous brand will feel Jenner’s absence, they have a lot more to look forward to. This year’s line up features not only the Hadid sisters, Supermodels Lily Aldridge, Alessandra Ambrosio, Taylor Hill, Elsa Hosk, Martha Hunt, Adriana Lima, Stella Maxwell, Behati Prinsloo, Lais Ribeiro, Sara Sampaio, Josephine Skriver, Romee Strijd, Candice Swanepoel and Jasmine Tookes will flaunt their wings on the ramp.

""For those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast,"" Obama said during a reception for the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children Monday in Delaware.  ""I dropped off Malia at college, and I was saying to Joe and Jill (Biden) that it was a little bit like open-heart surgery, and I was proud that I did not cry in front of her,"" he continued. ""But on the way back, the Secret Service was off, looking straight ahead, pretending they weren't hearing me as I sniffled and blew my nose. It was rough.""  ""And it's a reminder that at the end of our lives, whatever else we've accomplished, the thing that we'll remember are the joys that our children, and hopefully way later, our grandchildren bring.""

On January 6, 2016, the show was renewed for a fifth season.[5] In August 2016, there was speculation that the show had ultimately been cancelled, despite the earlier announcement of renewal.

c279576f-8fa4-4963-ad78-b00aec0123f0,"Is morning television on the brink of a major change? NBC chairman Andy Lack just signed Megyn Kelly to a major deal, and now the New York Post reports that there are rumors at the Peacock Network that the former Fox News star could take over for Savannah Guthrie on the Today show.  Though Kelly had taken pitches from ABC and CNN after leaving FOX, the promise of a daytime slot and a Sunday night show at NBC was too much for her to pass up. However, there may not be much to the Today rumors -- NBC insists that Guthrie, who is currently on maternity leave and recently signed a five-year deal with Today, isn't going anywhere.  ""We just signed Savannah to a massive deal that is longer than Megyn's,"" a high-level NBC source told Page Six. ""A lead anchor role at Today isn't part of the conversation for Megyn. The goal was simply to get someone of Megyn's talent and caliber through the door at NBC. We have not made a decision on her daytime slot. It is being discussed.""  It was rumored that Kelly was in deep talks with ABC to replace Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, though network officials have denied any such reports.  Kelly, who was FOX's No. 2 anchor for some time behind Bill O'Reilly, announced earlier this month that she would be leaving the network for NBC News. Her decision comes after Greta Van Susteren also departed FOX last fall in favor of MSNBC, leaving the network without its top two female anchors. Mediaite claimed that FOX had offered Kelly as much as $100 million to remain, though it seems money did not sway her final decision. She will be replaced by The Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson.  Also on FORBES:  ""I have grown up here and been given every chance a young reporter could ever ask for,"" she said while praising Rupert Murdoch and the FOX family.  Kelly spent 12 years with FOX, quickly climbing up the ranks and becoming a nationally recognized brand. President-elect Trump's attacks on her during the election cycle helped raise her profile even more. However, a possible Today gig is a far different animal than the 9 p.m. slot Kelly is used to, with audiences typically favoring entertainment stories and lighter subject matter as opposed to her traditional hard news.  Will Carlson, who has had an up-and-down career in front of the cameras, be an effective replacement at FOX? Will NBC push Guthrie out on Today in favor of Kelly? The answers to both questions will have far reaching impacts for their respective networks.  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,497
67988bc1-d473-4cd2-b113-c41fb5784bbf,"Brad Pitt smells bad. That’s the alarming claim being made in a recent article in The National Inquirer. According to the Enquirer, Brad has been living the “hippy” lifestyle, refusing to take showers and change his clothes as he continues to get over his divorce from Angelina Jolie and the separation from his children. He has also allegedly been sleeping on friends’ couches because he’s afraid that if he remains home alone, he will relapse into addiction.  But Gossip Cop, a site that’s become known for debunking celebrity rumors has said the report smells just as fishy as they claim Brad Pitt smells.  “Brad’s gone days, if not weeks, at a time without taking a shower, so of course he stinks of body odor a lot of the time,” an alleged close friend of the War Machine actor reportedly told The National Enquirer, as reported by Gossip Cop.  But Gossip Cop has a different story that they claim they received from someone who is actually in Pitt’s inner circle.  “We’re told Pitt isn’t living the lifestyle of a smelly drifter, and the claim otherwise is completely bogus,” Gossip Cop states.  The latest report in the ongoing Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie saga is that Brad Pitt was “allowed” to see his children to celebrate Father’s Day.

On Monday, Miller revealed that he’s leaving the Arrow-verse. “Currently shooting some of my final episodes as ‘Captain Cold/Leonard Snart’ on the CW’s Legends of Tomorrow and The Flash…” he said in a message posted on Instagram. “Grateful — now and in advance — to a pair of talented casts and hardworking crews…Thank you…”  He continued, “I’ve had a tremendous time playing this character… It’s been an opportunity, an education, and a f–king blast…”  Miller made his scene-stealing debut as the icy rogue on The Flash in season 1’s “Going Rogue.” This role would eventually reunite him with his Prison Break costar Dominic Purcell, who plays Mick Rory, a.k.a. Heat Wave. After recurring on The Flash, both men transitioned to DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. Even though Snart was killed off in the Legends’ season 1 finale, Miller became a series regular across all of the Arrow-verse shows and recurred on Legends and guest-starred on The Flash.  At San Diego Comic-Con in July, the Legends EPs revealed that Miller would return in season 3. “Mick Rory needs his pal, but unfortunately he’s not going to get the version of his pal that he remembers,” EP Phil Klemmer said during the show’s panel. EP Marc Guggenheim added, “We’re obviously really excited to bring Wentworth back on the show for a few episodes, but a different iteration of Mr. Snart. Chaos and merriment will ensue.”  Furthermore, the poster for this year’s four-way crossover “Crisis on Earth-X” confirmed that Miller would appear in that, too; Captain Cold’s face can be seen right above Barry’s right shoulder.

768fa085-54e7-46b2-9b5f-24fd7c399dac,"Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.  But, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.  Emerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.  Associates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.  Several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.  One old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""  She certainly takes vigorous exercise.  Exercising more than is healthy  As well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.  Recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.  Although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.  Currently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.  The healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.  She is, then, clinically underweight.  Because she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.  Her agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.  Catherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don't know what the fuss is about.""  Those protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.  But Valentino says her figure is perfect  Miss Kidman looks stunning, posing in clothes by a string of designers.  (""She has the most perfect figure,"" coos Valentino.)  Her influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of Chanel No 5 perfume.  In media terms, she has blossomed since splitting from Cruise; it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand.  But the question many are asking is why Nicole, who has relocated to New York with her two adopted children, Conor and Isabella, is looking so tired and nervy?  And why, they are wondering in Italy, has she pulled out of the Venice film festival?  And why, they wonder in Hollywood, has she turned down a £10million payday - the biggest of her career - to star in a film opposite Brad Pitt?  There are signs that Nicole - who said in the spring that she feared a ""burnout"" - is under a considerable amount of pressure, both emotional and professional.  She is still alone, despite a fling with rap star Q-Tip and a flirtation with rock star Lenny Kravitz, from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated.  Her romantic friendship with Russell Crowe has foundered, and he has now married his on-off girlfriend Danielle, who is expecting a baby.  How painful this must be for Nicole, who longs to have a baby herself.  Overwhelmed with grief after miscarriage  She was, by her own admission, almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to Cruise ended.  Those who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted.  ""I don't think two people could have been happier than Tom and I,"" she mused.  I was desperate to have a baby with Tom  ""He swept me off my feet and I fell madly, passionately in love. I was consumed by it. And I was desperate to have a baby with him. That's what I wish I'd done.""  Her vulnerable state of mind is not helped by a recurrence of the insomnia which has plagued her for much of her adult life.  Furthermore, she has been driven to the brink by film roles about rejected, depressed and oppressed women - with whom she identifies to a remarkable extent.  In an interview she said that she hesitated to play the suicidal Virginia Woolf in The Hours, because she feared the effect on her own state of mind.  ""I wasn't sure I could go through with it. Virginia Woolf's unhappiness was just too similar to my own.  Hesitated to play suicidal Virginia Woolf  ""I was afraid to do it because I thought it would be too painful,"" she said.  ""But I think characters come into your life sometimes because they're meant to ... I was able to use her and her knowledge.""  There are signs that she is no less troubled currently on the set of Stepford Wives in New York.  The crew are said to be muttering about delays because she does not want to film outside in strong sunshine.  Her representatives say this is utter nonsense. ""No one is more professional than Nicole,"" they aver, sternly.  But whatever the truth of those reports, one does wonder whether the film - a remake of the Seventies classic, about a town where wives are replaced by compliant domestic robots - has uncomfortable resonances for Nicole, whose Catholic beliefs were put aside by her Scientologist husband, and who, during her marriage, lost her identity in his.  What she yearns for is love - the love she gave to Cruise and which she still feels for him.  She yearns for love  ""I've said to Tom, I will be there for him for the rest of his life, always,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Tom and I had 11 years together. Your heart has to stay loving.""  She surprised everyone by admitting at the Cannes Film Festival that she would give up her career for love.  ""I won't do this for the rest of my life, there's other things that interest me,' she said.  ""I think when I fall in love, I'll stop doing as much of this because I want to settle down again.""  What she has experienced since then, though, are little more than dangerous flirtations.  Q-Tip, her escort at the premiere of The Hours, appeared to have been chosen because he is as unlike her former husband as it is possible to be.  Kravitz, meanwhile, took her to Puff Daddy's birthday party - again an event which would be anathema to strait-laced Cruise. In private, Nicole talks a great deal about concentrating on her children and trying to ""make it up to them"" - she feels immensely guilty about the divorce.  She also complains that she would like to find a man with whom she could have an intelligent conversation.  She is unhappily single  The Jude Law episode - when she was falsely accused of breaking up his marriage - was bruising and she felt humiliated that anyone would think she would steal another woman's husband.  Their meetings on both sides of the Atlantic were professional. In short, she remains steadfastly but unhappily single.  What a pity, for this is surely the golden period in Nicole's professional life. She took the Best Actress Oscar this spring for The Hours.  Later this year Cold Mountain, the Civil War epic directed by Anthony Minghella, will be released, and there is already an Oscar buzz forming about this bleak film.  Also later this year she will be seen in The Human Stain, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Then there is Birth, a film about a grieving widow, which she made early this year, and after that Stepford Wives, scheduled for release next year.  Because of delays in filming Stepford Wives, she has had to pull out of the Venice Film Festival, and because of the promotional schedule of Cold Mountain she has had to pull out of Mr and Mrs Smith, opposite Pitt.  Her diary is indeed creaking at the seams. And she is determined to make the most of her status while she can, despite the insecurity which leads her sometimes to fear taking on projects in case she is not good enough.  ""There was a time when part of me didn't really want to take on too many projects because I had other priorities like my marriage and my family,"" she said earlier this year.  ""Now I feel more confident. Also I find with two children that are older, that allows me a bit more time to devote to making films.  ""They don't need you every five minutes and they spend time with their father.  ""In any case I'm a pragmatist, and I won't always be offered these opportunities. Work while you can, I say.""  She is living very much the burnout life which she described in Cannes this year, travelling constantly and working hard.  Burnout lifestyle  ""You give so much of yourself and you've got to step away at some stage. You can't do it for ever,"" she said.  Could it be that the worryingly slight figure that emerged this week is evidence she is reaching the point of no return?",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1806

564e6d35-32ea-41d7-a01d-b3c947daec18,"[Spoilers: This story contains full spoilers for season two of Netflix's Stranger Things.]  Goonies never say die ... except when they do.  In the penultimate installment of the second season of Stranger Things, the life-threatening stakes facing the denizens of Hawkins, Indiana, finally make their full impact known, by killing off one of the beloved main characters — a newbie, sure, but beloved all the same: Bob Newby (Sean Astin). Newby is, in fact, the goodhearted and ultimately ill-fated boyfriend of Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), and was savagely killed by a pack of demodogs in full view of Joyce, Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) and even the young party of friends once again caught in the thick of battle against the Upside Down.  ""That was a tough one,"" says Caleb McLaughlin, who plays Lucas Sinclair, on the subject of losing Astin from the show. ""He was so desperate to survive. And when Winona [as Joyce] watches it happen and she's crying? It was a really good scene. I cried.""  ""We all loved him,"" adds Noah Schnapp, who worked closely with Astin, thanks to Bob's role as a hopeful father figure to Will. ""He was like a kid. He was hilarious. I remember we were all with Winona, protesting to keep him on set and not have him get killed off. He was the best! He did get a really good kill scene, so that's pretty good. When I was watching it, I liked those scenes where you don't expect it. When I was watching, as an audience, you really don't expect it. It comes out of nowhere.""  According to creators the Duffer Brothers, it was always part of the plan to kill off Bob, even if some of the circumstances changed along the way — including the fact that Bob wasn't always the most likable character.  ""He wasn't supposed to be that big of a character, and he was supposed to die a lot earlier,"" says Matt Duffer. ""Then we found Sean Astin and met him and fell in love with this guy as a person and as an actor. We really started to fall in love with his character.""  According to executive producer Shawn Levy, there was initially some reluctance in hiring Astin as Bob, since The Goonies was already such an influence on season two: ""When Sean Astin read this role, it was so immediately compelling. He got the part because he's a rad actor, not because he's the guy from Goonies. If anything, that gave us pause because we knew people would assume it was due to that linkage, but it's just because he gave an incredible audition.""  During the course of the season, the Duffers started falling for Astin's performance as the hapless Bob Newby, once the head of the Hawkins Middle School audio/visual club when he was a kid, known by Hopper and others behind his back as ""Bob the Brain."" In his scenes with Joyce, Bob was frequently tickled with surprise over ending up with her all these years later, considering the different lives they led when they were kids. That star-crossed backstory only makes it more upsetting when the Radio Shack employee is ripped into by demodogs, defenseless due to having left one of Hopper's firearms behind elsewhere in Hawkins Lab.  ""Bob wasn't designed to be the likable character who perishes; he was designed to be kind of just an out-of-it dork,"" says Matt Duffer, in terms of how Bob was written. ""Sean Astin really transformed that role, to the point where we kept kicking his death down the road. We kept pushing it and pushing it until we could push it no further — when we got to episode eight and we realized narratively we still had to do it. It was the hardest scene to write all year, just because it was hard to lose that character and lose Sean. We had such a great time working with him.""  Describing Bob's death as season two's ""central heartbreaker,"" Levy thinks the fatal moment serves to fuel the stakes heading into the finale: ""It's an example of really what I hope season two succeeds at — a big emotional idea, told in a really ambitious and cinematic way. That's really what we're going with always for this series. Both seasons have a slower burn from everyday life and a desire for normalcy devolving into crazy-ass stuff, forcing heroism among our characters. That was the arc of season one and that was the arc of season two. Bob's death in the last third of season two was always a big pivot point to be our ramp into the finale action.""  Ironically enough, Bob dies shortly before justice for Barb (Shannon Purser) is finally achieved, thanks to Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton).

3fba7801-4e02-45ed-a719-d24e6026757e,"Recognizing The Potential And Perils Of A 'Limitless' Mind  Enlarge this image istockphoto istockphoto  Imagine a pill that would give you tremendous intellectual power, triggering an avalanche of neuronal activity, igniting your brain into unparalleled awareness. You take the little thing and, for a few hours, you are a god-like creature. This is the premise of Limitless, the movie directed by Neil Burger, based on the novel by Alan Glynn and starring Bradley Cooper as the loser-writer who is turned into a genius by the powers of a psychotropic drug.  What if we had tremendous amounts of brainpower that remain untapped, powers that the dullness of our everyday routine dims into mere occasional insights, little flashes of awareness of a deeper reality that enfolds all that is? Could we really step into this different realm of being, freeing ourselves from the ""triviality"" that comes from using only a small percentage of our cortical mass?  There is a widespread myth out there, that we use only about 10 percent of our brain. We actually use all of it; every part of the brain has a known function. Otherwise, we would have certainly evolved smaller brains, or brains that are less costly metabolically.  So, the point is not that we need to activate large parts of our dormant brain, but that we need to trigger more efficient neuronal connections between the many parts: the secret is in increasing the pathways, making them resonate together in more creative ways.  Could a pill do such a thing?  We don't know, certainly not now. But look at where we are now: millions of people, including children, are taking Adderall and Vyvanse, psychostimulants composed of different kinds of amphetamine. The drugs increase the amount of dopamine in the brain, raising focus, libido and overall cognitive alertness. They are, in a very real sense, the baby versions of NZT 48, the magic pill in Limitless. No wonder those who take these medications must hide them so that they don't get stolen. (Especially in college dorms.)  The movie echoes precisely this reality, amplifying it with the help of fiction: if there is a magic pill that makes you into a genius, or at least more focused and intellectually productive, everyone, or at least many people, will want it.  It's another version of the Faustian bargain, where now the Devil wears the clothes of a pharmaceutical company salesperson; or a drug dealer.  I won't tell you how the movie ends. But I'd like to point out an interesting parallel with a remarkable sci-fi novel by the British writer Colin Wilson, The Philosopher's Stone, published in 1969.  In the novel, it wasn't a pill that gave the protagonist unprecedented brain power but the targeted electric stimulation of certain areas of the prefrontal cortex, which was described as ""some kind of extra storage area ... the centre of poetry and intelligence."" The premise of the novel is that the brain contains in it all of our past and future, if only we knew how to tap into its amazing reservoirs of timeless power. The ""freed man"" becomes a seer, a prophet, a genius, a god.  There are all sorts of hidden meanings in the universe, but we are blind to most of them. Occasionally, someone of genius, a great poet, a musician, a scientist, peers into the fog, even if only momentarily. What the protagonists of Limitless and The Philosopher's Stone are after is the ability to keep the light shining permanently.  Can we turn all the lights on without burning a central fuse? Is there a real advantage to pursuing a limitless mind? The movie makes it clear that the advantages we already have will remain even after taking the drug, that is, if you are smarter without it you will be smarter after taking it; the differentials between different IQs remain.  Perhaps here we can extract the true lesson of the movie and the novel: hard as it is, we must learn to accept our limitations while trying to constantly transcend them. To me, what makes life interesting is the search for the right balance between these two trends.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,794
fde49184-0250-49b6-8410-eb7b2c4cb1f5,"UPDATE, WRITETHRU with more detail: Shortly before he was due to appear on ITV’s Good Morning Britain today, Ewan McGregor pulled out of the interview, citing comments made about this weekend’s Women’s March by host Piers Morgan. A supporter of President Donald Trump, Morgan yesterday on the program described some of the women who marched as “rabid feminists” and said he didn’t “see the point of the march(es)” which he called “generic” and “vacuous.”  On Twitter this morning, McGregor, who is out promoting Trainspotting sequel T2: Trainspotting, wrote, “Was going on Good Morning Britain, didn’t realise Piers Morgan was host. Won’t go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch.”  Was going on Good Morning Britain, didn’t realise @piersmorgan was host. Won’t go on with him after his comments about #WomensMarch — Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 24, 2017  On his Twitter account (whose timeline photo is of he and Trump), Morgan responded by saying McGregor is “just an actor after all.”  Sorry to hear that @mcgregor_ewan – you should be big enough to allow people different political opinions. You’re just an actor after all. — Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 24, 2017  Morgan also tweeted he expected McGregor was reacting to his Monday column in the Daily Mail in which he called himself “a feminist,” but decried comments made by Madonna on Saturday saying, “I can’t abide the feminazis, the radical, extreme feminists like Madonna.”  On Tuesday, Morgan took to the middle-market UK tabloid to launch a vicious attack on McGregor where he referred to the actor as “unprofessional” and “disingenuous.”  “An actor who had contractually agreed to appear on a TV show to promote his new film pulls out at the last minute because he doesn’t like the political opinion of one of the presenters,” said Morgan.  Morgan said that after scrolling through McGregor’s Twitter feed, it “revealed a man absolutely enraged by both Donald Trump’s ascent to the presidency, and by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.” He added: “His fury at the latter may strike some as slightly disingenuous given that McGregor himself quit the EU years ago to go and live the life of a pampered millionaire movie star in Hollywood. But I’ll leave others to decide whether that is hypocritical or not.”  The presenter continued his tirade by taking a swipe at celebrities who take the podium to make “political statements that remain unchallenged,” which he says was “typified by Meryl Streep’s extraordinarily pompous and elitist anti-Trump speech at the recent Golden Globes.”  Morgan even suggested that those who voted for Trump or for Brexit to “now boycott his movies” before criticizing McGregor for being “paedophile-loving” due to the fact he worked on Roman Polanski’s film The Ghostwriter.  A spokesperson for Good Morning Britain told the BBC today that McGregor “came into GMB this morning to be interviewed about his new film but decided not to go ahead with it.”  Per the Guardian, Morgan said on the telecast this morning, “Sorry that Ewan McGregor’s not here. He couldn’t bear the thought of being on the sofa with me because he doesn’t agree with me about the women’s march… I have to agree with what an actor thinks about a particular issue because they’re actors. And as we know actors’ views are more important than anybody else’s.”  McGregor’s daughters had marched on Saturday.  I’m with you in spirit today women of the world. My daughters are marching. I’m so proud to see this extraordinary power. — Ewan McGregor (@mcgregor_ewan) January 21, 2017  The long-awaited Trainspotting sequel reunites director Danny Boyle with McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Ewen Bremner.

Emily Gerson Saines said in a statement, “Nelsan has passed away after complications with heart failure. He was a great talent, and his words and presence will be forever missed.”  On “True Blood,” Ellis starred as Lafayette Reynolds. He held the regular role for the duration of the seven-season series, earning two Satellite Awards, an Entertainment Weekly honor, and a NewNowNext Award.

19e1add7-b587-4cfa-a352-6190e2ff4614,"Angelina Jolie is feeling vindicated by Jennifer Aniston’s split from husband Justin Theroux. We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE details why she’s not shocked by their separation.    Jennifer Aniston, 49, and Justin Theroux‘s sudden split shocked the world, with the exception of her arch-enemy Angelina Jolie. While the 42-year-old humanitarian has long been blamed for the former Friends star’s 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, 54, she’s now feeling a sense of vindication that she had nothing to do with America’s Sweetheart’s latest heartbreak. “Angelina makes a point to not read or follow any celebrity gossip, but it was inevitable she would hear about Jennifer and Justin’s break-up at some point. Angelina has never cared for Jen, even before she started dating Brad. She’s always thought of her as very vanilla and shallow, and not on her level intellectually. Whereas Justin is quirky and edgy and super smart, so Angelina wasn’t surprised at all to learn they had split,” a source close to the Maleficent star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  While the now former couple vowed to remain close friends despite the breakup, numerous sources out of his NYC circle seem to be feeding the media that artsy Justin felt stifled by Jen’s easy, breezy California lifestyle and longed to be back home full-time in the Big Apple. He always did seem like a somewhat strange fit for Jennifer, as the actor constantly wore nothing but black motorcycle jackets and had a gold gun pendant around his neck at all times. Everything about him seemed to exude dark, edgy rebel while the actress is a sunny yoga loving Cali-gal.  Angelina has long been blamed for Jen’s heartbreaking split from Brad after they allegedly fell in love while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while the actor was still very married. Even though Brangelina was together for 11 years, married in 2014 and has six children together, the United Nations humanitarian is reveling in the fact that she had nothing to do with Jennifer’s current marriage demise.  “Angelina can’t help feeling a degree of vindication, after all, she was painted as this evil home wrecker who lured Brad away from Jen, who was portrayed as this sweet and nice, poor helpless victim. But nobody can point the finger at Angelina this time, or any other ‘wicked’ third party, as by all accounts neither Justin or Jen were cheating. So this time around Jennifer can’t blame somebody else for the failure of her marriage. It’s all on her and Justin,” our insider adds. Well, at least there won’t be any more “Team Aniston” and Team Jolie” t-shirts being sold after Jen’s latest heartbreak.

One in particular: the introduction of new character Toni Topaz, who reportedly gets close to Jughead while he's at Southside High — and causes a rift between him and Betty Cooper, AKA Bughead.  Bughead fandom was already intense, even before fans learned that actors Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart were dating in real life too. Vanessa Morgan, the actress who's playing Toni (and who's also on The Shannara Chronicles), hasn't even appeared on the show yet but is already feeling the Bughead backlash, which sometimes even comes in the form of death threats. Over a fictional couple in a fiction show.  If that seems a little much, Morgan's like, yeah me too. In an interview with Glamour, she shared:  ""I’ve already had some death threats.

That is a pretty damn chill response to death threats, but Morgan shares that this hasn't affected her relationships with her actual cast members:  ""Lili and Cole are awesome, and they have been nothing but welcoming to me. It’s great doing scenes with them. I feel lucky that everyone has been so nice. And Madelaine Petsch [who plays Cheryl Blossom] is my best friend in real life!""

fbf025fc-b701-4ca2-8527-43424acf4b43,"HBO has closed deals with four different writers to explore multiple possible spinoffs of “Game of Thrones.”  The premium cable channel says that there is no timeline for development of the projects. “We’ll take as much or as little time as the writers need and, as with all our development, we will evaluate what we have when the scripts are in,” a spokesperson said.  The four writers are Max Borenstein (“Kong: Skull Island”), Jane Goldman (“Kingsman: The Golden Circle”), Brian Helgeland (“Legend”), and Carly Wray (“Mad Men,” “The Leftovers”). Goldman and Wray will each be working individually with novelist and “Game of Thrones” creator George R. R. Martin.  “Game of Thrones” executive producers and showrunners Dan Weiss and David Benioff will be attached to the four projects, as will Martin, but will not write on any of them.  A spinoff to “Game of Thrones” — the most watched series in HBO history — has been a source of speculation for years. In recent months, HBO executive began to privately acknowledge that the network was searching for writers to develop ideas based on the series and Martin’s best-selling fantasy novels from which it is adapted.  Related ‘Game of Thrones’ Season 7: First Photos  Asked about a possible spinoff last year at the Television Critics Association summer press tour, HBO programming president Casey Bloys said, “We’ve talked about it. It’s something I’m not opposed to. But, of course, it has to make sense creatively. I am not sure that the guys [Weiss and Benioff] can really wrap their heads around it when they’re just about to start production. It’s a pretty intense production. They’re about to start production soon, but I’m open to it. The guys weren’t opposed to it, but there is no concrete plans, or anything like that at this point.”  Season 7 of “Game of Thrones” is set to premiere July 16. Production on the show pushed the premiere of the new season past its usual April start date, in order to capture the weather the producers wanted. The new season will consist of seven episodes. The eighth and final season, which Weiss and Benioff have already begun writing, will be between six and eight episodes.  The Season 6 finale of “Game of Thrones” drew a series-high 8.9 million viewers in overnight numbers —an especially high number given premium HBO’s much smaller viewer base than broadcast and basic-cable nets.

4bda5c38-8fc7-47df-9457-4a4f171b44f4,"Last week, Slate ran a story about a recently ousted White House aide and this was the headline: “Rob Porter’s History of Domestic Abuse Wasn’t a Secret. It’s Just That No One Cared.”  My mind immediately went back to a year ago, when the HBO series “Big Little Lies” premiered. I remember the preponderance of reviews — written by male critics — dismissing the show as soapy melodrama dressed up as prestige TV. And I wanted to go back and remind myself of the ways these cultural arbiters, with their influential platforms, engaged with the show’s portrayal of domestic violence.  Because the way we talk about fiction can influence how we view these same types of stories in real life. How we talk about movies and TV shows says something about what we value as a society — and whose stories we believe.  So let’s scroll back and refresh our memories. Among the many story threads in “Big Little Lies,” which is set amid a very white and very wealthy beachside community, is that of a glamorous woman (Nicole Kidman) married to an equally charming and attractive man (Alexander Skarsgard) who has a volatile, hair-trigger temper. He attacks her physically and mentally. Sometimes the violence involves sex. All of it happens in private, where their seemingly perfect marriage disintegrates, becoming increasingly dangerous as the season progresses.  Reviewing the show in the New York Times, Mike Hale listed the various characters and their traits, noting that Kidman plays “the abuse victim who’s reluctant to leave her husband, a subplot that’s more disturbing (than the others) but also strays into ‘Fifty Shades’ territory.” He calls the storyline “unoriginal.”  Or here’s Robert Rorke, writing about the show for the New York Post: “We’re subjected to scenes of S&M sex games … which feel like the Sunset magazine version of Kidman’s other sex game movie, ‘Eyes Wide Shut.’”  What a strange and cavalier way to write about the narrative of a woman raped and beaten by her husband.  Sarah Seltzer is a feminist writer and critic and — frustrated by those “Fifty Shades”/S&M references — told me, “That is just a profound misunderstanding of what’s happening on screen. And I don’t think many women viewers misunderstood what was going on. At all.”  I think that’s right.  “Shows that flirt with genre can be a vehicle for exploring serious issues,” she said, “and women viewers are very comfortable going back and forth between soap opera-y tropes and serious issues. How is that any different than the way ‘The Sopranos’ uses mob tropes as a vehicle to talk about American masculinity and existential despair?”  I think we need to ask ourselves why there are prominent critics who don’t see domestic violence as a subject worthy of serious TV. When Hale tweeted out a link to his review, he noted that for him, watching the show “was like watching three Lifetime movies at once.”  That’s an interesting thing to say. Because on some level it’s true — Lifetime has been among the only consistent producers of TV movies willing to examine these stories. And maybe somewhere along the way we started believing that domestic abuse was tawdry fodder best suited for basic cable. What I want to know is, why aren’t critics questioning that? Why aren’t we all?  “When people think, ‘Oh, it’s just a Lifetime thing,’ they’re thinking that only women care about domestic violence,” said Feminista Jones, a writer and activist. “They think it’s distasteful and depressing and who really wants to deal with that? But let’s get real, we’ve been talking about this since ‘The Burning Bed,’ since ‘The Color Purple,’ since ‘What’s Love Got to Do With It.’ We’ve been talking about this, that’s what frustrates me.  “But as someone who looks at the cultural impact of TV and film,” she said, “what’s promising for me is that it seems like this stuff is no longer avoidable. So if anybody tries to continue to pretend that these aren’t the real and lived experiences of women, then they’re going to find resistance.”  You can count on one hand the number of studio films that address intimate partner violence. When you look at how underrepresented women — especially women of color — are in Hollywood decision-making roles, this isn’t a surprise. “Whose voices are we hearing?” as Jones put it.  When “The Burning Bed” aired on NBC in 1984 it was a huge hit for the network. Seventy-five million viewers tuned in to watch that broadcast (it’s one of the most-watched TV movies ever made), and there was a palpable shock in seeing Farrah Fawcett playing against her fizzy “Charlie’s Angels” persona as a visibly battered wife who is ultimately pushed over the edge.  “There were shelters that were flooded with calls after it aired and it was partially because of the incredible audience response,” said Diane Shoos, who is an associate professor at Michigan Technological University.  Shoos also is the author of “Domestic Violence in Hollywood Film: Gaslighting,” which is a close read on movies such as 1991’s “Sleeping With the Enemy” starring Julia Roberts, 1995’s “Dolores Claiborne” starring Kathy Bates and 2002’s “Enough” starring Jennifer Lopez.  “Films about domestic violence rely very heavily on pretty standard Hollywood genres,” she said. The suspense thriller, especially. “In order for these stories to even be produced in the first place, they have to rely on this formulaic approach where we absolutely anticipate there will be a confrontation between the victim and the abuser. So the work of the narrative is to completely isolate her and make it — ironically — totally her problem that she has to solve. In a strange way these movies are seen as empowering to women but they’re not, because everything is put back on women’s shoulders.  “What’s astounding,” said Shoos, “is that the prototypical narrative is for the woman to kill the abuser. And as any kind of real-life solution, this is totally fantastical and in fact dangerous; women who confront their abusers typically are attacked and killed themselves.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1254

6c239bbc-711d-4c25-ac8b-6756700bcc7d,"A lawsuit Kendall and Kylie Jenner were facing for a line of “vintage” tees featuring rapper Tupac Shakur’s image released by their eponymous clothing line, Kendall + Kylie, was dropped by the photographer who was suing the stars.  According to a document filed in federal court Wednesday, both parties are requesting to dismiss the suit brought forward by photographer Michael Miller last summer.  Miller was suing the Jenners for using his photos of Tupac Shakur without his permission, TMZ first reported. The shirts were part of a limited-edition Kendall + Kylie capsule collection that were on sale for $125 a piece, but immediately pulled from the site following the controversy.  Shutterstock; courtesy Kendall + Kylie  The sisters faced quite the backlash after the shirt’s design — which featured the sisters’ faces superimposed over images of famous deceased musicians including Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G. and Jim Morrison of The Doors — first hit the internet.  RELATED PHOTOS: All of the KarJenner Fashion and Beauty Controversies  Paris Jackson and Kelly and Sharon Osbourne spoke out, The Doors issued a cease and desist letter and Notorious B.I.G.’s mom, Voletta Wallace shared her disappointment on Instagram.  The sisters issued an apology for their designs on Twitter soon after. “These designs were not well thought out and we deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists. We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in any way. The tee shirts have been pulled from retail and all images have been removed. We will use this as an opportunity to learn from these mistakes and again, we are very sorry,” they wrote.  Looking for more style content?

The brand released a statement to PEOPLE addressing the controversy over the summer. “The Kendall + Kylie brand apologizes for any insensitivity. When deciding to work with one-of-a-kind repurposed vintage tees, it was not the brand’s intent to offend anyone. These designs were randomly selected and not well thought out. The brand would like to apologize, especially to the artists that have been featured in the series. We did not mean to disrespect these icons and understand that we missed the mark completely. The designs have been removed. We sincerely apologize to the artists, their families and estates and anyone who may have been offended.”  RELATED VIDEO: Kendall and Kylie Jenner’s Apology Is Not Enough for Notorious B.I.G.’s Estate: ‘This Matter Has Yet to Be Resolved  The representative for the brand also added that the allegations on behalf of the photographer were “completely false,” calling the lawsuit “baseless.”  “Canada Inc., the licensee manufacturer of the K + K brand, purchased a very small quantity of vintage t-shirts with performer images already on them. Only two Tupac t shirts were sold before being pulled from distribution. Canada Inc. did not copy anyone’s image, remove any copyright notice from any image, or attempt to exploit Mr. Miller’s claimed right of publicity. There has been no infringement or violation of anyone’s rights. “",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,610
952ced92-207e-4fa8-8fb2-6a5a134154cf,"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are putting in a pool, according to TMZ , which says it obtained copies of building permits for the in-progress pool at the couple's Hidden Hills estate. Aerial photos published by TMZ indicate the pool—reportedly clocking in at 20-by-60 feet—is already well in development, although it's unclear when it will be complete. TMZ also reported that the Wests spent another $12,000 on building a new guard shack. Whether this is specifically to deter would-be skinny-dippers, or if it's just another add-on to their already tight security team, is unclear.  There's no word on who designed the pool, but it would not be surprising if it turned out to be Kanye West himself. In May , the multihyphenate added another hyphen when he announced he was starting a new architecture firm called Yeezy Home. ""We’re looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better,"" he wrote on Twitter. As Architectural Digest reported, this wasn't just a ploy to expand his résumé—he worked with Axel Vervoordt on the Hidden Hills home, sharing photos of its Zen Brutalist aesthetic on Twitter.  It would also not be surprising if West got pretty hands-on in the construction of his new pool. In a previous interview with Architectural Digest , Kim Kardashian West revealed that her husband is quite the builder. ""My husband makes all of his own furniture in his office,"" she said. ""My office is all Vincent Van Duysen, but Kanye is so good at it, he loves to draw out pieces.

According to an insider, Chris and Sofia had a great time in each other’s company and were together the whole night. The two reportedly arrived sometime around midnight and stayed at the party for about an hour and a half.  “They were super cute. Chris kept stepping back to let her have the spotlight and wouldn’t take photos but kept watching her when she would pose,” the eyewitness stated. “They were together the entire time and kept walking with his hand around her waist.”  Aww… Can we smell love in the air?  Furthermore, it looks like their buddies also encouraged them to interact and were there to make sure everybody was having fun.  “Troian was so cute. She kept pushing Sofia to do photos and checking in on her,” the insider shared. “You can tell they were all really good friends and having a great double date.”  We should mention first before the speculations go out of control, that Chris and Sofia have been great friends for a while but indeed, their relationship has always had the potential for more.  Sofia took to Instagram to gush over Chris’ acting skills and promoted his movie, saying that he is a “special human” and very dear to her and a very talented actor as well, of course.

Heading to Indio, California to take in Coachella this weekend, she left the flower crowns and body paint at home, showing up in looks direct from the catwalk. While the star has always had fun pushing the limits of festival dressing—who can forget last year’s epic Gucci bodysuit or the Matthew Adams Dolan deconstructed denim?—this go round proved her most daring. Pulling out transparent Y/Project, custom Chrome Hearts, and a face-covering balaclava that rendered her almost incognito, she took style risks few others would attempt—exactly what she and Fenty creative director Jahleel Weaver were going for. “Coachella should always be fun and disruptive,” shared Weaver via email. “We had such a moment last year with the Gucci crystal bodysuit and mask, so how do we top that?”  when u finna run outta hangers.

Though they started to officially brainstorm a month in advance, when Weaver and Rihanna saw a great piece during February’s fashion month, they made a mental note. Case in point: the moment the balaclava turned up at Alessandro Michele’s autumn/winter 2018 Gucci show, it was destined to be worn. “Ri and I both instantly loved it when it came down the runway,” says Weaver. “So we started to think of what’s the next opportunity to wear this? The Gucci team is so great to us and such a pleasure to work with and they made it happen.” The love at first sight rule also applied to the gauzy Y/Project creation, which came with extreme UGGs that made it an outside the box choice: “It was just so NOT Coachella that it made us love the idea even more.”  Advertisement  extra af. #chella18 A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) on Apr 15, 2018 at 11:38am PDT  Making these unique pieces work requires styling magic and foresight, and Weaver gives credit where it’s due. “I have an amazing assistant Amir that really helps me stay organised and calm which allows me to just focus on all these crazy ideas,” he says. Though he’s mum on when we’ll see the next jaw-dropping Rihanna outfit, their partnership ensures plenty of great fashion on the horizon. “What I love about Ri is that she’s such a non-conformist, which pushes your boundaries of creativity,” says Weaver. “Nothing is off limits.”  This article was originally published on Vogue.com.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,498

Angelina, who is said to be staying at a top secret location with the family, is said to be stopping the 52-year-old from visiting their six children allegedly until the FBI investigation has been completed.  It was alleged that Brad had an altercation with 15-year-old son Maddox on a private jet last Wednesday.  But Pitt could soon be vindicated after footage from Minnesota’s International Falls Airport shows the dad-of-six screaming at Maddox - but there is no physical altercation.  (Image: INF)  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  As stories emerged about the couple's split, Brad has reportedly been crying after being left devastated by Angelina's surprise decision to file for divorce.  It is said the actor - who will fight for joint physical custody of the couple's six children - was shocked by his wife's decision to end their relationship of more than a decade.  ""He is beside himself and has been crying. He was completely caught off guard and blindsided and had no idea she would do this,"" a source told Us Weekly.  ""Angelina filed the court papers a minute before the courts closed on Monday night. He didn’t have a lawyer or anything.

4b32ba5f-f02e-48ea-9b9f-90280186e8ad,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom has earned $715 million worldwide, including $204m in China and a $148m domestic Fri-Sun debut weekend. It has already outgrossed (sans inflation) every Planet of the Apes movie, every King Kong or Godzilla movie and two out of the four previous Jurassic Park/Jurassic World flicks. The Legendary and Universal/Comcast Corp. flick is a big hit and likely headed for the $1 billion+ grossers club. So, yes, there will be a third Jurassic World movie, already dated for June 11, 2021. That’s a good thing too since Fallen Kingdom is essentially a feature-length set-up for what comes next.  No spoilers, but if you’ve seen Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom you’ll know that the movie takes the franchise to a new status quo. Some of the excitement as that familiar John Williams tune (“Journey to the Island”) plays over the end credits is in wondering just how the next sequel will play out after this latest film’s game-changing finale. Then you realize that much of what you’ve seen has been a feature-length prologue for the next sequel. Jurassic World 2 spends two hours to get the chess pieces into position before promising that you’ll get the payoff in Jurassic World 3.  This kind of franchise filmmaking usually bugs the hell out of me. One of the things I appreciated about Jurassic World was that it was both a sequel to the Jurassic Park trilogy and a self-contained action-adventure movie that offered few clues about where the sequel might go. Whether or not Colin Trevorrow and friends had the long game mapped out or not, that first $1.672 billion-grossing summer sequel worked as a newbie-friendly popcorn entertainment first and as a world-building franchise installment second. To their credit, neither the filmmakers nor the studio dropped any sequel hints before or after Jurassic World opened.  J.A. Bayona’s Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, again written by Trevorrow and Derek Connelly, tries to have it both ways. It is a stand-alone adventure for folks who haven’t seen any of the Jurassic Park movies and for those who at least saw Jurassic Park and Jurassic World. But, as revealed in the third act, it is also feature-length set-up for the real game, a game that presumably begins in summer 2021. Jurassic World 3 is seemingly the movie that Trevorrow has been waiting to make from the beginning, and that Jurassic World and Fallen Kingdom were partially about getting the pieces into place.  That it gets away with this “don’t worry folks, you’ll get the movie you came to see next time” gambit is due to two particular factors.  First, it works as a singular movie featuring Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt dealing with deadly dinos and duplicitous humans in a way that improves Jurassic World. If you thought that Clare and Owen were villains the last time, or that the dinosaurs should be left to die, this movie’s got your back. Even once it’s revealed as a feature-length prologue, it still offers plenty of in-the-moment thrills, chills and spills, along with some gorgeous widescreen cinematography that looks great in IMAX and Cinemark XD. It may be set up, but it’s a solid, three-star blockbuster in its own right.  Second, most importantly, we’re actually getting a sequel. The movie doesn’t spend its entire running time to set up a sequel that will never actually happen, since we all know there will be a “next time, on Jurassic World.” To be fair, this is a problem more common with origin story reboots or franchise-starters. Think Universal's Jem and the Holograms, WB's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword and Fox's Fantastic Four, where the entire “first” film is a pure set-up before we see the iconic characters as we wanted to see them, all ready to kick butt in a sequel that will never actually happen.  Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom isn’t so different from “part two” sequels like Fox's Independence Day: Resurgence or Universal and Legendary's Pacific Rim: Uprising. They both end on a quasi-cliffhanger which promises a rather exciting and unique sequel that won’t actually happen since they bombed. Instead of making the ""neat new idea"" movie, they spent an entire sequel doing a poorly-received rehash of the first film to set up that third flick. It’s not quite the same, but imagine how much better Warner Bros./Time Warner Inc.'s Justice League would have performed if it was a “Justice League versus the Legion of Doom” movie teased by its post-credits sequence as opposed to a soft remake of The Avengers.  Fallen Kingdom still tells a story that is unique unto itself compared to its franchise predecessors. It starts off as an island adventure, shifts into an Indiana Jones-like second act and finally goes shockingly intimate and plays like a glorified haunted house movie in the finale. Oh, and since Jurassic World earned $1.672 billion three years ago, the filmmakers correctly had faith that enough moviegoers would show up to this one to justify at least a third installment. Unlike so many “you’ll get what you want next time” sequels and reboots, Trevorrow, Bayona and friends wrote a check that they’ll be able to cash.  I have no idea where the third film will go with this story and these characters, and that's pretty exciting. Unlike so many movies that promised a fantastic sequel fully aware that they might not get to make that movie, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a feature-length prologue to a film that will actually get made. It commits one of the gravest sins in franchise filmmaking but gets away with it just the same. That’s at least partially because they gave us a crowd-pleasing and standalone Jurassic World before getting into the long-term world-building. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom changed the game, but not before Jurassic World made sure that moviegoers wanted to play.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1137

6df83cff-df4a-4145-bf53-53d54d7ff981,"The stature of “Twin Peaks,” David Lynch’s two-season surreal murder mystery that ran on ABC in the early ‘90s, is such that its modern-day reboot almost defies interpretation. Showtime’s “Twin Peaks: The Return” picks up the story of Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) and Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) 25 years later, and attempts to be an homage, a sequel, and a standalone story. The unique nature of this revival is overshadowed by the fact that the show itself was always a surprising, weird gem in the otherwise predictable stable of broadcast television programming. It’s hard to know whether it is more surprising that “Twin Peaks” ever existed or caught in the first place, or that 27 years after its cancellation, it has returned on premium cable with so much of the original cast and crew preserved. Lynch brought auteur-ish filmmaking to television, which elevated the medium for many viewers. Now its most prestigious, high-minded arm has brought him back. And it has the marketing blitz to prove it.  This is a long way of saying that it is difficult to know where to begin with Showtime’s “Twin Peaks,” which premiered its first two parts Sunday night. Fans of Lynch — and fans of the series, who have mythologized its idiosyncratic details over the last two decades — will take in the director’s vision with open arms, savoring its bizarre iconography and nonlinear storytelling. They will undoubtedly find a lot to be happy with in this two-hour premiere, which is parts 1 and 2 of “Twin Peaks: The Return” (though there is no clear delineation between parts). Lynch, who directed the episode and co-wrote it with Mark Frost, begins with the Black Lodge, which he explored extensively in the second-season finale and in “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,” the prequel film. The new “Twin Peaks” uses grounding footage from the old “Twin Peaks” to establish some of the basics of the mythology: Cooper is stuck in the Lodge while his doppelgänger — inhabited by Bob (Frank Silva), an evil spirit — is in the world. Lynch, throughout “Twin Peaks,” is at his absolute best in Black Lodge scenes, and there is a bit of relief in seeing that even in this Showtime interpretation, the Black Lodge is still eerie and destabilizing.  Related Emmys: Limited Series Makeup Artisans Honor History on the Small Screen Emmys: The Shows With the Most Nominations in Creative Arts Categories  At the same time, the Black Lodge is also where one of the first obvious differences between the old and new “Twin Peaks” emerges: the simple fact of production values. Much of the odd, creepy charm of the original “Twin Peaks” was that Lynch was shoehorning his bizarre vision into a murder arc of a soap opera — with its interminable pacing, melodramatic music, and small-town archetypal characters. Part of that mood was a low-budget sensibility, which translated to artfully deliberate poor quality. It’s one of the reasons “Twin Peaks” is so aesthetically unique. But Showtime gave David Lynch nearly carte blanche for this new production, and as a result, it really doesn’t have that low-budget patina. The production values make for immersive, textured shots of the woods around the town of Twin Peaks — sometimes, the trees seem like more fleshed-out characters than the minor characters they are partially obscuring, and Lynch sometimes films unfolding scenes as if the viewer is just another character in a video game. But for every moment that feels fascinating in a new way, there is self-indulgence. The bankable popularity of “Twin Peaks” also makes for an inexplicably stupid scene at the Bang Bang where the indie-electronic band Chromatics performs to a room of middle-aged townies taking tequila shots. Nothing says rural, small-town, faded glory like an impossibly cool synthpop band. Could it be possible that sometimes, network notes are a good thing?  The finest scenes of the new “Twin Peaks” occur nowhere near Twin Peaks at all. In New York City — introduced in a swooping series of shots that feel like how an animated comic-book show would take us to the villain’s “HQ” — a man is watching, and filming, a glass box. It has a circular aperture that looks out onto the city from its high perch at the top of a skyscraper. And opposite the glass box is a couch, with two tasteful lamps and an end table. Sam’s job is to see if anything appears inside the box. If you watched “Twin Peaks” while sitting on a couch, you may have noticed that just as you watched a glass box waiting for something to happen, the box — and the man on it — watched you in return. That the box then erupts with something unnameably evil — just at the moment, of course, when Sam (Ben Rosenfield) is distracted by the charms of Tracey (Madeline Zima). Their violent, brutal death is not quite the type of gore that “Twin Peaks” is known for, but that’s what made it so interesting. The show’s aesthetic is typically fuzzy. But the glossy box gleams in its careful lighting, and in the middle the aperture is a perfect circle, an eye unto the world. The unnameable evil, when it emerges, is like a creature constructed of white noise, a blurry bit of static. It is terrifying.  A little less terrifying is what has become of Cooper’s doppelgänger — let’s just call him Evil Cooper. He is in Buckhorn, South Dakota, and he looks like a washed-up rocker from the ‘80s who never realized the party ended. MacLachlan is doused in spray tan and wearing snakeskin; Lynch’s manifestation of evil appears to be a guy wearing leather with a half-ponytail. The effect is kind of ludicrously seedy, and MacLachlan is a little uncomfortable there; he’s better in the moments where he is called on to emote silently while trapped in the Black Lodge. At the same time, Evil Cooper isn’t just a joke: In the back half of the episode, he kills Darya (Nicole LaLiberte) with close-range, heartless violence. Evil Cooper is creating mayhem for Bill Hastings (Matthew Lillard), who is beginning to have an arc that looks like Leland Palmer’s (Ray Wise) — he dreamed committing an awful murder that turns out to have been real. Evil Cooper follows his wife home, and then kills her with her lover’s gun, saying: “You did good. You followed human nature perfectly.”  Human nature sometimes seems like it is the furthest thing from Lynch’s mind. “Twin Peaks: The Return” contains several long shots that reduce its characters to just tiny figures in a vast landscape. And yet even amidst the new surrealities of the Black Lodge (the Arm is now a tree with a brain!?) its most meaningless stretches continue to delight him. “Twin Peaks” attention to the most bathetic moments of human existence is strangely comforting, even as a comedy of manners in an apartment complex’s anonymous hallway gives way, with one twisted doorknob, into a ritualistic horror show. Lynch and Frost have doubled their cast in “Twin Peaks: The Return,” out of apparent curiosity for how all of these people live. It’s at times a confounding amount of detail; late in the two-hour episode, when Jennifer Jason Leigh turns out to have been next door the whole time, the scale of what this reboot is trying to accomplish is both daunting and a little maddening.  “Twin Peaks: The Return” is weird and creepy and slow. But it is interesting. The show is very stubbornly itself — not quite film and not quite TV, rejecting both standard storytelling and standard forms. It’s not especially fun to watch and it can be quite disturbing. But there is never a sense that you are watching something devoid of vision or intention. Lynch’s vision is so total and absolute that he can get away with what wouldn’t be otherwise acceptable .",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1568
75c95254-4eb4-4c65-92bf-9e8d10becf10,"If Republicans capture control of the U.S. Senate, there will be many explanations for their victory: President Obama’s poor numbers, a great Senate map filled with attractive opportunities, a generally strong slate of candidates, the success of establishment-backed Republicans in primaries and others.But one of the biggest factors will have hardly anything to do with the national political climate or, really, the campaign as a whole. Five Democrats, all of whom are old enough to be eligible for Medicare, decided not to run for another term in the Senate. Their decisions, all announced before May 2013, are a huge but largely forgotten boon to GOP hopes.Story Continued BelowThe five retirements were: Max Baucus of Montana, Tom Harkin of Iowa, Tim Johnson of South Dakota, Carl Levin of Michigan and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia. (A sixth, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, had announced his retirement, but he later died: Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat, now holds the seat after a special election last year.)Retirements present a challenge for the incumbent party because it’s easier for a party to hold a Senate seat when an incumbent runs for reelection. Significantly easier.Over the past half-century, about 85 percent of incumbent senators running in the general election were reelected. In open seats, during the same time period, the incumbent party held the seat just about 60 percent of the time. So not having an incumbent in a Senate race substantially reduces the odds of victory.The importance of open seats to GOP Senate hopes is particularly pronounced because of the party’s recent inability to defeat Democratic incumbents.In 1980, Republicans beat an eye-popping nine Democratic incumbents on Election Day to capture control of the Senate for the first time in a quarter-century. Since then, the GOP has not defeated more than two Democratic Senate incumbents in any general election. The party’s best recent Senate years, 1994 and 2010, were built largely on winning open seats (six in 1994, and four in 2010). Democrats, meanwhile, have had more success: They beat seven and six incumbent Republicans, respectively, in recapturing the upper chamber in 1986 and 2006. The latter year, 2006, was notable in that Democrats did not capture a single open seat in netting the six seats they needed to eke out a narrow 51-49 Senate edge.Republicans seem likely to beat more than two Democratic Senate incumbents this November for the first time in almost 35 years: Sens. Mark Begich of Alaska, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas all have less than 50-50 odds of winning, according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics’ Crystal Ball ratings, which I help formulate. Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado is right at 50-50, and Sens. Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire are both in tough races too.But in all likelihood, the foundation for this year’s GOP gains will be built on winning open seats. That’s why the Democratic exits loom so large in the upcoming election.An election where these five senators chose to run for another term would look significantly different: There would probably be more competitive races, and Democrats would have a greater number of redoubts to hold off the Republican advance.Let’s assume, for the purposes of this “what if” exercise, that all five retirees were healthy enough and eager enough to have run for reelection, which is of course a big assumption for a group whose average age is 74 years old:West Virginia: Rockefeller might still be an underdog to Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (R), who entered the race before the incumbent retired. But that race would have been much closer, presumably, than Capito’s largely sleepy contest against West Virginia Secretary of State Natalie Tennant, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee would not have been able to just take a pass on the race, as it has this cycle. Capito’s strong performance as a candidate is an often overlooked bright spot for Republicans this cycle – she’s done so well, in a state where the GOP hasn’t won a Senate seat in more than a half century, that the race never became obviously competitive – but running in an open seat has made her job easier. The Crystal Ball rating here is Safe Republican; with Rockefeller in the race, we’d probably rate it just Leans Republican or maybe Toss-up. A few polls before Rockefeller retired suggested Capito would have started the race with a narrow lead, and Rockefeller did himself no favors by not being 100 percent pro-coal in recent years, a political problem in a state where coal is still king.Montana: Baucus, like Rockefeller, would have been in for a very tough race in 2014 if he had run. The Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling found him trailing 49 percent to 44 percent in early 2013 against Rep. Steve Daines, who eventually became the GOP nominee. Baucus announced his retirement in April 2013, and then later resigned to become ambassador to China. Gov. Steve Bullock appointed then-Lt. Gov. John Walsh, a fellow Democrat, to fill the vacancy. Walsh’s campaign, of course, fell apart over the summer under the weight of plagiarism. Now Democrats are stuck with little-known nominee Amanda Curtis, a state representative, and Daines is a huge favorite.Kyle Kondik is managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political newsletter produced by the University of Virginia Center for Politics.

04f8fbc0-33ca-4e26-9142-db62e4dc7de7,"Well, this is a nice surprise. Halle Berry just dropped word via Instagram that the actress will be joining the cast of the third John Wick flick. Penned by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, the (presumably) final chapter in the Keanu Reeves action franchise is set to open on May 17, 2019. I have no idea if Berry is playing a villain or a fellow anti-hero, but A) it's cool that the (presumed) female lead will be about as old the male lead (she is 51 and he is 53, neither of them looks a day over 27) and B) I'm a huge fan of Berry's recent pulp fiction endeavors (The Call and Kidnap), so this is pretty cool casting.  Lionsgate also just announced that Angelica Houston, Asia Kate Dillon (TVs Billions and Orange is the New Black), Mark Dacascos (Lucky Day, Hawaii 5-0, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), and Jason Mantzoukas (The Long Dumb Road, The House) will join the cast of John Wick: Chapter 3. Yes, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick will return as well. I'm not sure if Ruby Rose survived her encounters with Mr. Wick in part two, but I kinda hope she comes back too. What this arguably means is that Lionsgate may end up emphasizing an ensemble cast this time out, as opposed to the first two films which were (understandably) the Keanu Reeves Show.  That's no shade on Mr. Wick or the actor who plays him, but as I noted in the last post about the Mission: Impossible franchise, there is perhaps a greater value, at least for overseas box office, in ensemble action flicks as opposed to solo/lone-wolf movies. Think Deadpool 2, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Fate of the Furious and Avengers: Infinity War. Even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was sold as a four-person adventure, highlighting Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan.  So, if Lionsgate feels that they can get more overseas bucks the third-go around (John Wick: Chapter 2 made $92 million domestic and $79m overseas) by offering something resembling an ensemble cast, well, that's one option on the table. That doesn't mean that John Wick will go about recruit a super-assassin squad to deal with that pesky ""everyone wants to kill me now"" status quo from the end of the last John Wick, but I will be interested to see how these new cast members are integrated into the new movie. And yeah, bringing Halle Berry onboard is a nice touch.  Come what may, John Wick: Chapter 3 opens next year. Even as someone who thought that John Wick: Chapter 2 ended on a pretty definitive note (not unlike The Dark Knight or The Last Jedi), I'm still curious to see what the Wick crew has up their sleeve for a threequel.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,560

42afc2ab-a515-497b-bae6-2e7dc57e2c9a,"After his breakup with Kristen Stewart, Twilight movie hunk, Robert Pattinson, got engaged with French singer FKA Twigs. Like any other celebrity affairs, even their relationship was constantly under media’s radar. Kristen’s fans even stated that Robert made a hasty decision when he decided to marry Tahliah Barnett. Things started to go awry when it was recently reported that Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs are no longer a couple and it is Katy Perry who is mentally supporting the actor during this tough time.  Robert Pattinson’s personal life has remained the talk of tinsel town ever since it was first reported that he had feelings for his Twilight movie co-star Kristen Stewart. The couple dated for several years, but when the reports of Kristen’s alleged affair with Rupert Sanders surfaced, the Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire movie actor decided to end his affair with her.  Even after Kristen issued a public apology, Robert did not come back to her and decided to move on with FKA Twigs.  As earlier reported by the Inquisitr, Robert Pattinson and FKA Twigs have reportedly ended their two-year long engagement. During this tough time, Robert is leaning on his good friend Katy Perry.  “As far as Katy goes, they have been good friends for a while. They have many mutual friends and have always kept in touch. They aren’t serious as of now, but Rob has always had an interest in Katy,” says E!’s source.  Another source confirmed that ever since Robert’s split with FKA Twigs, he has been “leaning a lot on Katy.”  “They talk on the phone regularly and make sure to see each other when they both aren’t away working. Katy has always been a good friend to Rob over the years and has been there for him emotionally,” the source added.  Katy is currently busy with her world tour, so according to the reports, she FaceTimes Robert whenever possible.  [Image by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images]  “She wants to make sure he is doing OK. Rob knows how good of a friend she is and he was also there for her when she was going through her divorce. They lean on each other.”  Apparently, this is not the first time that Robert Pattinson’s name has been linked with Katy Perry. Back in 2013, when the Twilight actor walked away from Kristen, many media outlets speculated that the “Chained To The Rhythm” singer was reportedly thinking about getting romantically involved with the actor.  The award-winner singer had to message Kristen explaining that she was simply being a good friend to Pattinson in the wake of his split and there was nothing romantically going on between the two of them.  “I sent her a text message saying: ‘I know you’ve seen all this stuff but you know I would never disrespect you. I’m not that person,'” Katy told Elle UK. “I’m just trying to be a friend to him but it is unfortunate that I do have a set of t*ts.”  Robert was also spotted with Katy Perry in early August during a dinner outing in Hollywood and many fans speculated that Robert has reportedly decided to end his engagement with FKA Twigs and will soon announce his inclination for Orlando Bloom’s ex-girlfriend.  As of this writing, there are multiple reports confirming Robert Pattinson, FKA Twigs’ split. However, an official statement from the stars or their respective representatives is still awaited. On the other hand, as reported above, Katy Perry is extremely busy with her ongoing world tour.  [Featured Image by Mark Davis/Getty Images]",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,693

Created by Julie Plec, “The Originals” is a spinoff of “The Vampire Diaries,” which premiered in 2013. The flagship “Vampire” series signed off this spring, ending its eight season run, so renewing “Originals” keeps the franchise at the network for at least another season.  “Originals” follows Joseph Morgan’s Klaus Mikaelson and his family in New Orleans. Morgan stars alongside Daniel Gillies, Phoebe Tonkin, Charles Michael Davis, Yusuf Gatewood and Riley Voelkel. Plec serves as executive producer with Leslie Morgenstein. The series hails from Bonanza Productions Inc., My So-Called Company, Alloy Entertainment, Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios.  The show has remained relatively stable in its fourth season, which is currently averaging a 0.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 972,000 viewers per episode. That represents a decrease of just 11% in the key demo and a slight increase in total viewers compared to Season 3.  Related ‘No Tomorrow,’ ‘Frequency’ Canceled After 1 Season at the CW  “iZombie” is based on the characters from DC Entertainment’s Vertigo imprint. Rose McIver toplines the series, and stars alongside Malcolm Goodwin, Rahul Kohli, Robert Buckley, David Anders and Aly Michalka. The show hails from “Veronica Mars” creator Rob Thomas, who executive produces with Diane Ruggiero-Wright, Danielle Stokdyk and Dan Etheridge. Bonanza Productions Inc., Spondoolie Productions and Warner Bros. Television produce the series.  Now in its third season, this supernatural procedural has dipped quite a bit in ratings. Midway through Season 3, it is averaging a 0.3 rating and 905,000 viewers per episode, down over 30% in both measures from Season 2.  With both renewals, the CW has officially made decisions for every returning show for the 2017-2018 season. “Originals” and “iZombie” join already-renewed series “Arrow,” “D.C.’s Legends of Tomorrow,” “The Flash,” “Supergirl,” “Jane the Virgin,” “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” and “Supernatural.” The network cancelled freshman series “No Tomorrow” and “Frequency.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,442

Their breakup comes about a year after they started dating on Paradise, and 10 months after Peth proposed with a stunning Neil Lane sparkler on the reunion show last August.  ""It is with much sadness that we have decided to end our engagement. We put everything we could into our relationship and are heartbroken to go forward separately, but we know this is the best decision for the both of us,"" Peth and Nolan said in a joint statement to ET. ""We will still be present in each other's lives with support, admiration and respect for each other.""  Before meeting Nolan on Paradise, Peth appeared on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Nolan, meanwhile, gained notoriety for her ""emotional intelligence"" argument with Corinne Olympios on Nick Viall's season of The Bachelor. Peth and Nolan were pretty much inseparable when they hit the beach for season four of Bachelor in Paradise last summer, and two months later, Peth put a ring on it.  Managing a long-distance relationship -- Peth lives in New York and Nolan resides in Seattle -- was always a concern for the pair.  ""Originally we were like, ‘This is fun, but we're in different states,’” Peth told ET during a joint interview with Nolan last September. “We tried to be realistic and then it turned out I couldn't stay away from her.”  “We had a couple of really amazing days together before filming [the finale] -- we came out [to L.A.] early and did our own thing and I was like, 'I freaking love this girl, let's do something crazy,'” Peth shared of his decision to get down on one knee. “We don't really believe in having 'the one' or that one person; it's really about choosing each other, [but] there's something magnetically that has always attracted me to Taylor. We tried not to like each other, but that's what made it so genuine. We tried as hard as possible to not like each other, every step of the way!”  “I was very resistant, but part of what I love him about it, is that he is so patient with me,” Nolan added. “He allows me to go through my process and is very supportive in that -- he's a very good teammate.”  Season four of Paradise ended with three couples: Lacey Mark and Daniel Maguire (who revealed their breakup at the reunion), Nolan and Peth (who just split), and Raven Gates and Adam Gottschalk (who are still together).

7f0ee15d-5a50-4e06-a56f-7707438f3978,"Jamie Foxx did not “betray” Katie Holmes by supposedly “getting flirty” with a mystery blonde at a New York City hotspot, despite a bogus report. Gossip Cop can debunk this narrative. It’s simply a non-issue.  According to In Touch, just a few days after the actor had dinner with Holmes at Tao in NYC, he got cozy with another woman while having lunch at the trendy seafood restaurant Catch. An alleged insider tells the magazine, “When Jamie arrived to the rooftop area with friends, an attractive young blonde went and sat with them. She hugged Jamie and sat next to him.”  The outlet’s questionable source further contends that Foxx “would reach over and touch the woman’s leg or hold her hand” throughout the lunch. The magazine then baselessly theorizes that Holmes is “headed for heartbreak,” quoting its supposed insider as saying, “She needs to watch out. Jamie loves her, but he also loves to flirt.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  It should be noted, the tabloid doesn’t have any real proof that Foxx got “flirty” with a mystery blonde at Catch. The outlet provides two photos, one of the actor giving a friendly hug to an unidentified woman, and another of him touching the woman’s arm during a conversation. That’s as intimate as the two get in the images and there’s no evidence to suggest they’re anything more than friends.  Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that Holmes doesn’t feel “betrayed” when the actor socializes with other woman. The actor and actress have a somewhat unconventional dynamic, which People also noted in a recent article about Holmes and Foxx’s secretive relationship. The publication explained that the two “don’t see themselves as a couple in the traditional sense and they don’t want to be labeled as a couple.” It was further stressed that neither “want to have expectations placed on them about how they should be acting in public.”  Meanwhile, the unreliable magazine is trying to make it seem as if Foxx was caught acting inappropriately by talking to another woman, but he has nothing to hide. A mutual pal of ours and the movie star recently told us “he knows he’s in a public forum” when he chats with other women. As we’ve repeatedly noted, Foxx and Holmes enjoy spending time together, but their dynamic is relaxed and both have their own separate lives.  Additionally, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has called out In Touch for coming up with a variation of this phony premise. Back in March, we busted the tabloid for falsely claiming that Foxx “betrayed” Holmes by “getting cozy” with a mystery woman at an Oscar party. However, the actor and actress have been spotted together several times since March, so she obviously didn’t feel “betrayed.” That remains the case.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,565

In April 2016, he filed for divorce from his wife of 20 years and seven months citing irreconcilable differences.  Now that the couple’s divorce has been finalized, Tyler will pay her ex-husband $2 million in spousal support.  “In order to equalize the foregoing division of the parties’ community property, [Tyler] shall pay [Tietjens] $500,000 in cash,” the documents state.  In addition, Tyler will pay Tietjens $31,250 for 48 months, which totals $1.5 million over the next four years.  “Commencing January 5, 2017, and continuing each month thereafter until the death of either party, petitioner’s remarriage, January 5, 2021 (for 48 months and 48 payments with the last payment made on December 5, 2010), or further order of Court, whichever occurs first, [Tyler] shall pay [Tietjens] the amount of $31, 250 per month as spousal support, payable in full on the fifth day of each month,” the documents state.  Tyler will keep her companies — BTDO Media and Hot Machine — and the 2013 Tesla S, while Tietjens will keep the 2012 Lexus 450h, according to the documents. The couple will split a large majority of everything else, including the earnings from the sale of their former family residence.  “This was not a court-ordered settlement, as reported, but a mutual agreement reached amicably by two people who intend to remain lifelong friends. I wish nothing but happiness and fulfillment for Jeff in his life going forward,” Tyler said in a statement obtained by PEOPLE. “He is not a public figure, and I pray the media will allow him the privacy and respect he is entitled to and very much deserves.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,409

Archaeologists associated with Niagara University of and master divers from the U.S Coast Guard were mobilized on site to determine what it was, and they soon realized that they were dealing with a German submarine that sank during World War II.A wreck recovery vessel of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society was mandated to refloat the ship and bring it back to Niagara Falls, where it must be restored before becoming a museum ship. The delicate recovery operation took nearly 30 hours to complete, but the submarine was finally brought down on the bank with relative ease.The divers of the U.S. Coast guard braved the frigid water temperature to go attach cables to the wreck for the recovery operation.The submarine was identified as the UX-791, a unique experimental German submarine, based on the U-1200 model, and known to have participated in the “Battle of the St. Lawrence”. It was reported missing in 1943 and was believed to have been sunk near the Canadian coastProfessor Mark Carpenter, who leads the team of archaeologists, believes that the U-boat could have traveled up the St-Lawrence River, all the way to the Great Lakes, where it intended to disturb the American economy.A report from the dated from February 1943 suggests, that the ship could have attacked and destroyed three cargo ships and two fishing vessels, even damaging the USS Sable (IX-81), an aircraft carrier of the U.S. navy that was used for training in the Great Lakes, before finally being sunk by anti-sub grenades launched by a Canadian frigate.“We have known for a long time that the Nazis had sent some of their U-boats in the St-Lawrence River, but this is the first proof that they actually reached the Great Lakes,” Professor Carpenter told reporters. “This could explain the mysterious ship disappearances that took place in the region in 1943, and the reported “Battle of Niagara Falls” which had always been dismissed as a collective hallucination caused by fear.”The restoration of the submarine could take more than two years, but once completed, the museum ship is expected to become one of the major tourist attractions of the region.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,444

The development is the latest twist in the entrepreneur’s turbulent summer on Twitter and comes one day after Musk questioned why the diver hadn’t sued him if his claims were untrue.  “You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services,” asked Musk in reply to @Yoda on Twitter.  Also Read: Elon Musk Needled for Tearful NY Times Interview About Having to Work Through His Birthday  Attorney L. Lin Wood, who is representing diver Vernon Unsworth, replied to the thread on Wednesday, saying that Musk “should check his mail before tweeting.”  Musk originally called Unsworth — a diver that criticized Musk’s attempts to help the Thai soccer team trapped in a cave as a “PR stunt” — a “pedo guy” in July. Musk later apologized for his comment, saying it was “spoken in anger.”  Also Read: Elon Musk Says He Won't Take Tesla Private After All  “You published three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr. Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children,” Wood said in his letter, dated August 6, to Musk. “You did so without any basis.”  Wood added that he’s prepping a civil libel complaint against Musk.  A representative for Musk did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.  Even without a potential civil suit on his hands, it’s already been a controversial month for 47-year-old entrepreneur.

West celebrated his 41st birthday on Saturday with friends, family, music, a mind-bending mentalist and lattes that had the foam made into an image of his face because, of course.  West's wife, Kim Kardashian, shared videos and pictures from inside the amazing soiree on social media. They show a fun, festive affair, with West looking relaxed and having fun as world-class mentalist Lior Suchard completely destroyed some minds in the room with some spectacular visual illusions, suggestive powers and what looks suspiciously like some legit mind reading and telekinesis.  Suchard bent a spoon rubbing his finger on it and flipped a pair of glasses with what looked like a simple wave of his hand, delighting the ever-living heck out of West and his friends.  The party appeared to have had a cave theme, with moss hanging from the ceiling, low light and a mountain-themed birthday cake. Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner were also in attendance. West looked comfortable holding court, at one point, sitting on a couch and just taking everything in as his music played.  And then, there were those lattes with Kanye's face made into the foam.  Kim Kardashian/Instagram  Here are just a few photos from the epic event.  Kim Kardashian/Instagram  Kim Kardashian/Instagram  Kim Kardashian/Instagram  Kim Kardashian/Instagram  It's been an eventful time for the controversial rapper. On Thursday, West debuted a fresh album collaboration with Kid Cudi, Kids See Ghosts. His new solo album Ye, also just obliterated music charts. On the flipside, West is still dealing with the fallout of his controversial statements on slavery and in support of Donald Trump. And he helped stoke more family drama on his new album by rapping about the cheating scandal involving Tristan Thompson. And Donda's House, a charity he co-founded in honor of his late mother, Donda West, to help the youth in Chicago, formally dropped her name because of a dispute over his alleged lack of involvement and interest.  Still, it was good to see West relaxed, comfortable and having a little family fun at his birthday party.  For more on Kanye's Ye take on family drama, watch the video below.

Kim begged the Cleveland Cavaliers player to unblock her on Instagram while attending Khloé’s party on Wednesday, June 27.  “All right, guys. So, what do you think? It’s Khloé’s birthday. Do you think I should ask this guy to unblock me?” the KKW Beauty founder, 37, said in a series of hilarious videos shared on her Instagram Story while sitting next to Thompson, 27, who blocked her on the social media app after she spoke out about his cheating scandal.  “For Khloé’s birthday, I think it’s only right. I got you,” the athlete replied with a laugh. The birthday girl then implored her boyfriend of nearly two years to “do it right now.”  When Thompson pulled out his iPhone, Kim jokingly asked for his passcode. “[Khloé] knows it,” he responded before opening Instagram and going to Kim’s profile. The Selfish author zoomed in on the NBA star as he counted down and then tapped the “Unblock” button. He quipped, “There’s no going back now,” to which Kim replied, “Now the question is, should I follow you again?”  The social media mogul was shocked to find out that Thompson also blocked Khloé’s best friends Malika and Khadijah Haqq. “Wait, you guys! Did you know he blocked you also?” she asked the 35-year-old twins, who were sitting nearby. As all of the guests collectively freaked out, Kim demanded silence and shouted, “This is a birthday party!”  As previously reported, Thompson blocked Kim in late April after she said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that it was “so f–ked up” that he cheated on Khloé while she was pregnant with the couple’s daughter, True. “Last time I went on TV and answered some questions about [Khloé], I got blocked on social media. And not from Khloé,” Kim revealed on Live With Kelly and Ryan on May 11.  True, now 2 months, was born just days after the basketball pro (who is also the father of son Prince, 18 months, with ex Jordan Craig) was caught making out and getting cozy with other women.  A source recently told Us Weekly exclusively that the Good American designer and her beau are still working out their issues. “Tristan is a part of Khloé’s life,” the insider said. “They are together. … They’re continuing to work on their relationship.”  For the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast Watch With Us below!

Though Menzel said boys usually tell her they don’t like “Let It Go” and prefer Justin Timberlake’s track from the movie Trolls, Luke couldn’t have been more in opposition.  “Heck to the no,” he replied, shaking his head in disbelief. “I’m offended.”  When it came time to sing the song, it only took a few bars for Menzel and the crowd to realize that he wasn’t just a fan but a full-fledged musician himself.      Menzel offered to let Luke sing a different song since the crowd cheered through his first performance, but he chose to sing through the chorus again, adding in extra frills that even the most shameless of shower singers would be embarrassed to try aloud. Luke even got to wrap up the segment with Menzel, all by himself.  “I can’t sing it like that,” Menzel told the girls on the stage. “I’m gonna try tomorrow, I’m so inspired.”  Luke told news station WFAA 8 that he’d never received a standing ovation before, but he’s already ready for his next performance.  “I know boys don’t like ‘Let It Go’ because it’s a ‘girls’ song,’” Luke said, rolling his eyes. “But I mean, songs are for everyone.

NYFW A post shared by c/s ∴jon✞boy∴ p/v (@jonboytattoo) on Feb 15, 2018 at 6:55pm PST  On Instagram Stories, Kaia wrote “best big bro ever” along with the same photo Presley shared, so she clearly likes the piece in her honor. While we’re not sure what the number “23” could stand for, we do know one thing: fans have mixed feelings about the piece.  Honestly, it’s a sweet gesture for Presley to recognize his love for his sister in such a permanent way, but not everyone feels this way. In the comments, some fans expressed their opinion, writing, “weird af but ok” and “omg wtf” while others quickly came to his defense, explaining that they too have tattoos of their siblings’ names.  RELATED: Quiz—How Well Do You Know Celebrity Tattoos?  “Don't judge him because he decided to do something for her sister, you can make an opinion but that opinion doesn't have to hurt; so if you say ""How can anyone tattoo their sister's name"" you are kind of laughing at them, I don't know I would do that for my brother, but if he did, I look up to him for the great capacity of love he has,” one user wrote.  Tattooing the names of close family members isn’t really all that bizarre. Drew Barrymore, for instance, has the names of her daughters Olive and Frankie on her wrist (below), while Angelina Jolie has seven geographical coordinates on her left bicep (they represent the location where each of her children was born). Sisters Tia and Tamerya Mowry have a tattoo of the word “Jumelles” on their wrists, which means twins in French.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,515

Last week, the Teen Mom 2 star reached a happy resolution in a long-fought custody battle with her mother, Barbara Evans. Jenelle’s attorney, Heather D. Kaemmer, told PEOPLE that the reality star and her mother had settled on a custody schedule that allows them to share time with 7-year-old Jace.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  And this past weekend, the mother and son had an “amazing” reunion when they were reunited after five weeks spent apart.  Source: Jenelle Evans/Instagram  “It felt amazing to finally be reunited,” Jenelle told E! News about spending time with her oldest child. “He was so happy he didn’t even know what to do first when he got home. I was nervous a little bit because I didn’t want Jace thinking it was me that didn’t want to visit with him, but when he arrived everything was back to the way it used to be.”  Although the mother of three — she is mom to Jace, son Kaiser, 2, and newborn daughter Ensley Jolie — did she some tears, it was a happy reunion.  “I did cry but not around anyone except for David,” said Jenelle, who is engaged to fiancé David Eason. “I didn’t want any of the kids thinking I was upset. Lots of hugs and kisses we’re going around all weekend!”  To celebrate the three-day weekend, the MTV personality and her children, along with Eason’s daughter Maryssa, rode bikes and enjoyed some time hiking and at the beach. “Couldn’t have asked for a better weekend,” she said.  “My next visit with him is this upcoming weekend since his summer school break will begin,” said Jenelle, who will reportedly have Jace for his entire summer break. “We are planning on taking the kids on vacation so that should be lots of fun!”  FROM PEN: What’s Next for Princess Charlotte  Although the Evans v. Evans case between Jenelle and her mother was scheduled for two days of trial beginning May 24, “the parties re-opened settlement negotiations and were able to come to an agreement before the trial started” on May 24, Kaemmer said. (Barbara, with whom Jenelle has long had a tense relationship, maintains primary custody of Jace.)  According to Kaemmer, “Barbara and Jenelle settled on a custody schedule that allows them to share time with Jace,” Kaemmer told PEOPLE. “The new Order grants Jenelle specific periods of time with Jace so that Barbara no longer has the authority to determine if and when Jenelle can spend time with her son.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,532

Yeah, well that’s the whole thing about not s**tting where you eat. #JustSaying  “Cory and Murray have one thing in common, they both love Murray,” Kyle says.  Murray tries to talk to Cory over the bar in the middle of their shift.  “How can you be angry at me?” Murray asks.  “You were being a drunk slut,” Cory says.  Murray denies flirting with anyone, and Cory tells him he’s delusional.  Then they have this little girl b***h fight that only lacks some slapping.  “I can’t stand you, just get away from me,” Cory says.  “You’re disgusting,” Murray snipes.  “You’re disgusting,” Cory yells. “Chicken leg bitch!”  Murray says Cory could get jealous of him standing too close to a plant.  A few days later, Lawrence and Murray go out partying without Cory.  It’s a recipe for disaster. Murray gets really drunk, really fast.  “Once again, hurricane Murray is passing through,” Brandi says.  His “straight” friend Giancarlo is there to dance with him and act anything but straight.  “Giancarlo swears that he’s straight, but I don’t know how many straight dude tells other guys they smell good,” Elizabeth says.  Cory walks in while Murray is being too cozy with Giancarlo. Actually, he has shirt pulled up and his “straight” friend is feeling his abs.  “He’s straight,” Elizabeth tells Cory, as they watch together.  “Yeah, and I believe in unicorns,” Cory says.  “Straight my ass,” Cory says.  “I feel like telling Cory, Spoiler Alert! Your boyfriend is a slut,” Elizabeth says.  Cory and Murray have another argument in public.  But Murray’s too drunk to have a conversation.  “Can you not throw a drink at me?” Murray asks, kinda politely. It’s hilarious.  Marissa’s mom Debbie is in town to visit and convince her daughter to move back to New York.  “I’m from an Italian family – moving out of the house is harder than quitting the mafia,” Marissa says.  Fulfilling all Italian mother stereotypes, Debbie’s worried Marissa isn’t eating.  “The same thing that you’re doing here, you can do in New York,” her mom says.  Marissa says she’s following her dream. Is it her dream to be a cocktail waitress?  She tells her mother that she’s invited to The Abbey that night.  “Right, before we even go there, am I allowed to talk to people?” mom asks.  Yes, she may, but only if the people approach her.  She also tells her mom about Kyle.  “Sometimes you’re a little quick,” her mom says.  Yes, Marissa, your mom did just imply that you’re a slut.  Turns out, Marissa left a man back in New York. And he still thinks they’re a couple. #Oops  When her mom gets to The Abbey, Marissa has Billy come take a pic with mom because mom loves Nick-the-Gardner.  But Mom Debbie doesn’t seem excited when she first meets Kyle.  “OMG my mom is totally icing Kyle right now,” Marissa says.  The whole thing is so uncomfortable, I don’t even want to watch. #Awkward  But then she warms up. She does like getting her hands on the younger men.  “Clearly, Kyle passed the mom test. A little too well,” Marissa says.  Heidi Montage and her entourage hit The Abbey for drinks, and owner David Cooley greets them.  Heidi is a regular.  Marissa’s mom is bird-dogging Heidi Montag from across the bar.  Then she goes for it.  “Oh my God, I’m such a big fan,” Debbie squeals.  Then she proceeds to tell Heidi her daughter’s whole story.  “Marissa, come take a picture of me. Isn’t she cute?” she asks Heidi.  “I told her all about you, Marissa,” Debbie says.  Heidi is actually pretty gracious about the whole thing.  “Heidi Montag is literally everything,” Marissa says.  Oh, jeez.  Girl has some really inspirational role models. Bahaha!  At the end of the trip, her mom cries all the way to the airport.  “Marissa, I love you, and you can always come home anytime,” she says.  After she drops off Debbie at LAX, Marissa goes over the Kyle’s house to show him some headshots.  And Marissa mentions that the laptop was a gift from her boyfriend back home.  “Technically, I have a boyfriend back home,” Marissa’s a little sleazy. Poor guy back in New York is going to be humiliated when the show airs.  Kyle’s turned off. Don’t blame him.  Lawrence and Brandi go to see a fertility doc about having a baby together, and everything looks good.  “It’s time to let the family in on the plan,” Lawrence says.  Lawrence and Brandi invite Lawrence’s dad to lunch at The Abbey to tell him they’re going to have a baby.  Dad’s concerned about what happens if they want to take their lives different directions.  “Kid comes first,” Lawrence says.  “We call this the house,” Lawrence gives his father a picture of Brandi’s uterus.  “You couldn’t have done anything more to honor me as your father,” he says.  I want to laugh really hard, but I think the guy is sincere.  Glad it went smoothly for Lawrence and Brandi.  It’s not going smoothly for besties Kim and Elizabeth the day after the big party where they hooked up, with an audience, in their boss’s swimming pool.  “Me and Elizabeth had our special moment,” Kim says.  “This is classic straight girl oops,” Elizabeth says. Her feelings are hurt.  “A few harmless kisses in a pool and she’s already renting a U-Haul for us,” Kim says.  “I made out with you because I was drunk and having a good time,” Kim says.  “If I was straight you would not have done what you did,” Elizabeth says.  “I’m officially liking Kim romantically,” Elizabeth says in interview  Ashlee invites Daniel over to her house to make truffles. He thinks “truffles” are a code word for sex.  Turns out Ashlee is a Beverly Hills trust fund baby. But she’s trying to start her own truffle business to prove she can make it on her own.  Daniel thinks her truffles “taste like dirt.”  “At first, I thought Daniel might be little bit nervous. But then I realize that Daniel is dumb as a brick,” Ashlee says.  Daniel thinks he’s got it all going on.  “I’d be a little intimidated by me too,” Daniel says. What? ROFL  “You were a lot nicer at the pool,” Daniel says.  Ashlee says it’s more like doing charity work than having a date.  “I’m not going to lie Ashlee. I think you struck out with me. But we can still be friends,” Daniel doesn’t take social clues very well as he’s ushered out the door as quickly as possible.  Next week it appears they’re doing naked yoga. And now I don’t really ever want to see naked yoga.  Things we’re left wondering  Why is Daniel’s ego so big? What am I missing here? I’m so not impressed by him.  Will Elizabeth and Kim be able to stay friends after the hookup?  Will Kyle totally give up on Marissa after her boyfriend revelation? Or is she cute enough to survive that?

Getty; AP (2)  Press Association via AP Images  The 28-year-old royal cousin of Prince William and Prince Harry chose a long-sleeve, low-back design from the London-based label, which was founded in 2007 by Peter Pilotto and Christopher De Vos.  YUI MOK/AFP/Getty Images  The dress features a neckline that folds around the shoulders to a low back that drapes into a flowing full length train. The low back feature on the dress was at the request of Eugenie, who had surgery at 12 years old to correct her scoliosis.  Press Association via AP Images  “I think you can change the way beauty is, and you can show people your scars and I think it’s really special to stand up for that,” she told the U.K.’s This Morning.  Pilotto and De Vos worked with Eugenie to research previous dresses worn by members of the royal family to identify the right silhouette for her wedding.  James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock  The fabric of her gown features a number of motifs that hold particularly special meaning to Eugenie. The symbols include a thistle for Scotland, to acknowledge her and Jack’s fondness for Balmoral, a shamrock for Ireland as a reflection of her maternal family, the York rose and ivy to represent the couple’s home.  The only bit of information she revealed before her big day was that she wanted to pick a designer from her home country. “[The dress] is the one thing that I was really decisive about,” she told British Vogue. “As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away. I never thought I’d be the one who knew exactly what I like, but I’ve been pretty on top of it.”  RELATED VIDEO: Celebrity Guests Arrive at Princess Eugenie’s Wedding  Unlike Kate and Meghan, however, Princes Eugenie chose not to wear a veil.

2a6861ff-cba4-4e4e-aebb-53f82e792108,"Good news, DC Comics fans. The first look at Aquaman super-villain Black Manta is a pretty faithful adaptation of the comics.  The upcoming blockbuster, which Warner Bros bosses are already promising will set the DCEU back on the right path, has unveiled three new images ahead of the film's launch later this year.  The first of which is The Greatest Showman and The Handmaid's Tale actor Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane, a bounty and treasure hunter who uses the alias Black Manta.  Director James Wan describes the live-action version of Black Manta as ""part mercenary but full-time pirate"", which is a pretty spot-on description of the comics version of the character.  Wan also clarifies that although Black Manta has a key role to play in Aquaman, the key conflict will be between Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) and his brother Orm (Patrick Wilson).  ""Black Manta is a really interesting character who is somehow factored into this story but our main story is about Jason and Patrick,"" he teased.  EW also premiered alternate covers for its upcoming issue that include the first glimpse of Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, the former Queen of Atlantis and mother of Aquaman's bride Mera (Amber Heard), before sharing three stills from the film too.  In this magazine profile, James Wan teases that his underwater world will include a gritty recreation of the infamous Super Friends scene of Aquaman riding a seahorse, juxtaposed with cannibal trench-dwellers, sea dragons and a giant octopus.  ""The water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it's like I'm making my own sci-fi fantasy film,"" Wan said. ""This is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.""  Aquaman is released in cinemas on December 14.  Want up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?

4d65d9d3-7a76-4306-85cd-7691e01302c7,"Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston.  Welcome to You Know What I Heard, the Cut’s weekly celebrity gossip column about the peregrinations of the rich and famous. Have gossip? Email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal (ask for the number).  When Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their breakup last Thursday evening, they did so with a joint statement issued by Aniston’s longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane. It had Jen written all over it: The statement called out the malicious “gossip industry” and insisted that “whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative.”  Since Thursday, a lot has been printed about the split, and a lot of it seems to be coming from Theroux’s friends. So who’s really running this breakup?  Sources close to Theroux in New York have been telling “Page Six” that Theroux was “really bored by [Aniston’s] whole Hollywood crowd” and that he “initiated” the separation. Unfortunately for Aniston, Official Hollywood Bible People has more or less backed up those “Page Six” reports, citing sources who say that Theroux was done with the marriage and wanted to take the breakup public ASAP.  In one report, published Sunday, a source close to Aniston told People that “Jen didn’t want to announce [the split] for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention.” But Theroux didn’t play ball. Instead, he walked around getting photographed in New York throughout Aniston’s birthday weekend, while Aniston celebrated at home with girlfriends in L.A. (We definitely noticed that last week.)  “Jen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren’t wondering why he wasn’t with her, but that’s not Justin’s style,” People’s source said. “He wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.” Theroux apparently flew to L.A. to talk to Aniston three days after her birthday (on Valentine’s Day!), and Aniston agreed to release a statement the next day.  So: Theroux initiated the breakup and took it public before Aniston was ready because … why? What life does he want to live? The Sun reported this weekend that one source of contention in his marriage to Aniston was his desire to “party” with the “New York art scene.” Specifically, Sun sources claimed that Aniston was upset over Theroux’s desire to hang out with 25-year-old photographer and “art beauty” Petra Collins.  👽👶🏼🌝🔪 A post shared by Petra Collins (@petrafcollins) on Jan 26, 2018 at 10:02am PST  The Sun tends to be more accurate when reporting on British stars (like Taylor Swift’s boyfriends), so who knows where its reporters are getting this information, but Theroux and Collins do know each other. Collins shot Theroux for a spread in L’uomo Vogue last year. The shoot took place at Paul’s Baby Grand in Tribeca; you can see it on Collins’s website.  Hypothetically, what would a Collins-Theroux romance mean for gossip? Collins isn’t just an indie darling; she’s also a collaborator and close friend of Selena Gomez. Gomez has publicly gushed, many times, about how much she loves Aniston. (They met a few years ago through their management.) Will Gomez have to pick a side?  Selena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston.  Another curious element in all of this: Aniston and Theroux may not be legally married at all. Though they had a surprise wedding in the back yard of Aniston’s Bel Air mansion in 2015, TMZ reported this weekend that the couple never filed for a marriage license, confidentially or otherwise, in L.A. County. And neither Aniston nor Theroux has hired a divorce lawyer.  Theroux’s friends may be talking to the tabloids, but Theroux himself is not ready to address the rumors: He backed out of a scheduled appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert tonight.  Selena Gomez, meanwhile, is reportedly in Jamaica with Justin Bieber for Bieber’s dad’s wedding. Jeremy Bieber, 42, is marrying his “longtime girlfriend” Chelsey Rebelo, 29. Here’s a photo of Gomez posing with some of Rebelo’s friends and relatives:  So Gomez and Bieber are going strong, despite her family’s disapproval. According to People, the on-again couple spent Valentine’s Day with a visit to Hillsong and a makeout at the Montage in Beverly Hills.  We haven’t heard much from Ben Affleck and his SNL-producer girlfriend Lindsay Shookus so far this year, but you’ll be happy to know they are still together and still color-coordinating their outfits.  Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus.  According to E! News, the couple spent Valentine’s Day house-hunting in L.A. “They visited two homes in the $8 million–$10 million range with a broker who gave them tours,” a source told the site. Those homes were in the tony neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, where Affleck’s ex-wife Jennifer Garner lives with their three kids. The house tours were very romantic, apparently.  “While Ben and Lindsay were waiting for the first house to be opened, Ben grabbed Lindsay on the doorstep and pulled her in close for a hug,” E!’s source said. “They were swaying back and forth hugging and laughing. He kissed her on the forehead. He walked with his arm around her and put his hand on her lower back. They seemed very happy and close.”  Shookus can’t be planning to move to L.A. full-time, though, can she? Her daughter and ex-husband live in New York. And she has SNL. Currently, she’s living in Affleck’s $28,000-a-month rental on the Upper West Side.  One small blessing from this week:  Here is a photo of Rooney Mara and her boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix going to a mall in Sherman Oaks.  Joaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.  Jennifer Lawrence.  Finally, I’ll leave you with this TimesTalk Jennifer Lawrence did last week to promote her new spy thriller Red Sparrow. During the talk, she said she’d like to use her character’s skills to figure out “what’s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift.”  “That’s the God’s honest truth,” she added. “[It’s] keeping me up at night.”  Love or hate J.Law, she is a great gossip. Most celebrities pretend not to pay attention to the tabloids, but she regularly brings up feuds and rumors in public conversations. (See this appearance on Andy Cohen’s Watch What Happens Live! or her interview with Kim Kardashian West on Jimmy Kimmel’s show.) I, too, would love to know why Kloss and Swift broke up. This past weekend, Kloss attended the NBA All-Star Game with her boyfriend Josh Kushner. Before that, she was spotted hanging out with sworn-Swift-enemy Katy Perry. Swift has been hanging out with herself. Will J.Law’s comment prompt Swift to make a statement?  Thanks so much for gossiping this week.

2c319583-fc01-46a5-ba03-def677c3f494,"This week, in the midst of rising panic and gathering storms, some lucky paparazzi spotted the tabloid equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster.  In an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, these fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu immediately made waves. To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx’s PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they’re just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors “one hundred percent not true.” Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, “What I’ve learned about society today is that they’re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they’re so thirsty to find any story… Sometimes when you read the stuff you’re like, ‘Wow! That’s so not true!’” Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, “That’s not something I want to answer.”  Despite JamKat’s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they’ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx’s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx “is very happy with [Holmes].” Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, “I have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,” adding, “I’ve never seen them together. He’s never told me he’s dating her.”  Still, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie’s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston’s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That’s because Foxx and Holmes’ intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes’ 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.  Long before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior—the alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.  One of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney’s 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise’s second marriage: “I was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.”  According to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige—a good friend of Cruise’s—became suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney’s film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige’s calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, “auditing” Cruise, and “re-educating” the couple’s adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.  A 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, “The organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: ‘What do you think of Tom Cruise?’” The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: “In a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.”  When Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement “specifically about Cruise,” claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: “By the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology’s Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise ‘wants someone with her own power—like Nicole.’ When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.” (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment prior to publication.)  By April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey’s couch.  According to journalist Tony Ortega, who’s covered the church since 1995, “Katie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.” Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress’ Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, “Jessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.” Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples’ six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise’s best man at his and Holmes’ 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that “his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,” in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard’s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.  As The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise’s young daughter, Suri: “When Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org—an elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a ‘billion-year contract.’” Cruise and Holmes’ hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri’s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn’t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in “more than 1,381 days.” This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church’s practice of “disconnecting” congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.  A RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx’s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, “Katie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.  “She’s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she’s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,” the source continued. “Katie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms—and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.”  And the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes’ bizarre ex.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1607
915075e2-a170-415c-bf9c-13584933191a,"Thousands are taking the streets to protest President Donald Trump on Tax Day.  The so-called Tax March is smaller in scale than the Women’s March that drew an estimated 5+ million protesters worldwide following Trump’s inauguration in January, but still drawing vocal crowds across the country.  Those protesting today are primarily calling for Trump to disclose his tax returns. During his candidacy, Trump promised he would release his taxes after the IRS completed their audit of them. He has not. (Note, Trump’s 2016 taxes will immediately be under audit this year.)  Critics believe that Trump’s tax returns may disclose personal or financial ties that influenced the presidential campaign and/or the current administration. This comes as a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation is underway looking at ties between top Trump aides and Russia.  As with the Women’s March, some celebrities are protesting via social media. Here are some of their responses.  At a rally in New York City, Sarah Silverman addressed Trump directly. “Show us your f–king taxes, you emotional child.”  13 director Ava Duvernay shared photos of various signs, including one that echoed Silverman’s expletive and another with a “Game of Thrones” reference.

Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.

The entertainers — who got engaged last December — exchanged custom vows in front of 75 of their closest family and friends at a boutique venue in Santa Ynez Valley on Thursday, PEOPLE can exclusively reveal.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “She is the love of my life,” Geyer said before the wedding. “She is gorgeous, strong, hardworking and always the life of the party.”  “Having my husband write me the most beautiful vows to me and then sing to me later in the evening was the highlight of my entire event,”says Murray. Adds Geyer: “I thought I’d already seen Jillian at her most gorgeous, but her in that dress walking down the aisle took the meaning of hot to the next level!”  Jana Williams Photography  The Glee and Australian Idol alum, 31, and the Code Black actress, 33, met on the set of their film Never Back Down 2 seven years ago. “From the beginning, I knew I liked her,” says Geyer. Now after nearly a decade together, “we share the same beliefs, countless interests and passions.”  Murray and Geyer are self-proclaimed “foodies” and splurged on fresh ingredients and a decadent menu by Field to Table catering. “We’re taking things from the garden we’re getting married in and actually cooking it for the guests,” says Murray, who kicked off the cocktail hour with bacon-wrapped dates, truffle mac ‘n’ cheese and grilled cheese dippers with tomato soup.  Jillian Murray  For dessert, the couple are serving chocolate chip cookies and three different wedding cakes (including butterscotch, cookie dough and brownie) by Enjoy Cupcakes.  The pair’s reception featured designs by Rrivre Davies of Rrivre Works, and the overall theme was “super glamorous in nature,” says Murray. “The vision I had on my Pinterest, he found a way to blend it. He’s literally the reason I have the wedding of my dreams.”  Decor for the big day (planned by Lindsay Longacre of LVL Weddings) featured a custom-made structure with chandeliers, all-white flowers and greenery (by Precious & Blooming) and a custom-furnished lounge section for their guests to relax. The couple served cocktails by On the Rocks and hired Bella Vista for lighting.  “We wanted it to be open so you can see the stars and appreciate where you are out in the middle of nowhere,” says Geyer.  FROM PEN: All about Drew Scott and Linda Phan’s destination wedding – guess where they’re tying the knot?  Geyer (in a Hugo Boss tuxedo and bowtie) did not see his new bride until she walked down the aisle to live music by the Santa Barbara String Quartet. “She wants the waterworks!” joked the actor before the ceremony. Murray kept her gown — which was her “biggest splurge” for the wedding — under wraps for months.  “I saw the dress and I started crying. It wasn’t even on me yet,” she said of picking it out. “This was obviously the one.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,606

ea0739ad-9b42-4f7a-a551-f044802db94e,"A look at the state of the Marvel television, which continues to rapidly expand with both hits and misses.  Marvel has planted its seeds far and wide over the past few years in the television landscape, but that volume has so far yielded mixed results.  While rival DC has found success by focusing on familiar franchises like “The Flash,” “Arrow,” “Supergirl,” and the Batman origins tale on “Gotham,” Marvel has been a bit more stingy with its marquee characters. For example, ABC’s “Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.” lives in the world of the Avengers, yet never became a hit partly because it focused on lesser-known characters.  But that’s not always a hindrance. Many of Marvel’s Netflix series, especially “Jessica Jones,” have been critically acclaimed partly because they felt like they hadn’t been overly mined previously. It takes a visionary showrunner, in this age of so many superhero tales, to bring a fresher take to the genre and keep interest high.  Quality control and maintaining narrative vigor are the biggest obstacles in this adaptation game, as Marvel’s TV titles have ranged from auteur-driven gems to cartoonish duds. Right now, ABC and Fox have two new Marvel series, “Inhumans” and “The Gifted,” premiering this weekend, while cable and streaming outlets also have new projects on deck.  Here’s a look at the current state of Marvel TV, and what’s on the horizon that could change the climate:  ABC  ”Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”: The series had a rough early start, until its connection to the Marvel Cinematic Universe was confirmed — which later even included a crossover from Sif (Jaimie Alexander) of “Thor” fame. But as the series began to hit its stride, “S.H.I.E.L.D.” didn’t need to rely on its cinematic cousins to bolster its storytelling and cred anymore. Season 4 was one of the show’s strongest in storytelling but lowest in ratings, and Variety reported that ABC wanted to end the series — but that Disney demanded more. “S.H.I.E.L.D.” will return for a fifth season, shifting from Tuesdays to Fridays, after “Inhumans” (see below) vacates its slot.  ABC  ”Inhumans”: As the title indicates, this show is about the descendants of alien beings who look humanoid (but aren’t!) and live on the moon. Despite a big push, including a limited IMAX premiere ahead of its actual debut on Friday (8 p.m. ET, ABC), the series earned low critical marks — perhaps the worst yet of any Marvel show. It’s perhaps no coincidence that “Inhumans” was created by Scott Buck, who was also behind the equally panned “Iron Fist.” In “Inhumans,” Buck came up wiht a show that IndieWire deemed “legitimately the worst Marvel adaptation of the year.” ABC canceled “Agent Carter,” and instead we got this?!  Netflix  ”Daredevil”: As the elder statesman of the Netflix bunch, “Daredevil” set the bar high for Marvel on the streaming service, thanks to a stellar first season kickstarted by Drew Goddard and finished by “Spartacus” mastermind Steven S. DeKnight. While its second season, showrun by Marco Ramirez and Douglas Petrie, lost some of the show’s narrative oomph, “Daredevil” still introduced viewers to the intriguing Frank Castle. The blind lawyer-by-day, vigilante-by-night still has meaning for fans, and already has a Season 3 in the works.  ”Jessica Jones”: Melissa Rosenberg brought this series to life, a show some would argue is perhaps the strongest Marvel series so far, thanks to its confident voice and storytelling. The show’s intensely feminist story involves Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) dealing with trauma from her time with the fiendish and yet charismatic Kilgrave (David Tennant), making for nuanced and compelling viewing. All episodes of Season 2 of will be directed by women.  ”Luke Cage”: Cheo Hodari Coker was the showrunner with vision who gave this series its unique flavor, setting the action and heart in Harlem. Lots of action, tons of Easter eggs, a killer soundtrack, and plenty of humor made this a joy to watch, although it did slip in later episodes as storytelling had to stretch in order to fill all 13 episodes. A second season will premiere in 2018.  ”Iron Fist”: This is the first of the Netflix Marvel series to really falter and draw significant criticism. Although Asian communities had hoped that the series would race-bend the original story to make the protagonist Asian, Danny Rand remained a white dude who would outdo Asians at their own game — whether it was through martial arts, speaking Mandarin or walking barefoot through the city. Scott Buck ultimately subjected “Iron Fist” to cliched and cartoonish storytelling.  ”The Defenders”: The miniseries brought all four previously introduced Netflix Marvel heroes together, but according to Variety, it was Netflix’s least-viewed Marvel series in its debut month. Filled with the heroes and supporting characters from each of their respective shows, the eight-episode series was perhaps a bit too bloated with players. Viewers may have also faced superhero fatigue, as the disappointing “Iron Fist” had debuted only a few months before.  ”The Punisher”: After blasting his way into “Daredevil” Season 2, Frank Castle made such an impression that he earned himself his very own spinoff series. “Hannibal” executive producer and writer Steve Lightfoot was named showrunner, which bodes well for the series that should delve deeper into The Punisher’s dark psyche. “The Punisher” will be released sometime in Fall 2017.  FX  FX  ”Legion”: Although this isn’t supposed to necessarily be a part of the bigger MCU, it’s worth pointing to as an example of how to do a Marvel series that doesn’t feel like everything else out there. This is owed to Noah Hawley, who was able to do justice to the Coen Bros. with his take on “Fargo.” Translating the trippy interior of a man’s chaotic psyche is ambitious and daunting, but against all odds, it worked. Dan Stevens led a criminally under-recognized cast which embodied plenty of kookiness while not skimping on depth and heart. The critics have been on board, but it’s about time the rest of the world tuned in. “Legion” will return for a second season in 2018.  ”Deadpool”: Can Donald Glover do it all? So far, the answer has been “yes.” The “Atlanta” Emmy winner and hip-hop superstar, a.k.a. Childish Gambino, will adapt the foul-mouthed superhero property as an animated project for FXX along with his brother Stephen Glover, who had also nabbed an Emmy nom for writing on “Atlanta.” It’s still too early to get any sort of idea how this will turn out, but judging by Glover’s track record and how well this sensibility fits his brand, there’s reason to be optimistic.  Hulu  Hulu  ”Runaways”: Hot off of winning Emmys for “The Handmaid’s Tale,” Hulu is hoping to take some of that must-see magic to its latest adaptation, based on this complex yet young-skewing Marvel franchise. “Runaways,” about a bunch of teens who discover that their parents are supervillains, comes from “The O.C.’s” Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who know a thing or two about finding young and compelling ensemble casts. Early buzz is looking pretty good for what promises to be one of the most diverse series in the MCU.  Fox  ”The Gifted”: Connected to “X-Men,” the Fox series premiering Monday (9 p.m. ET) takes an outsider’s perspective by slowly entering the world where mutants are being hunted down. Stephen Moyer and Amy Acker play parents who discover that their two kids are mutants, and therefore must join the Mutant Underground to evade the government, while Jamie Chung, Emma Dumont, Sean Teale, and Blair Redford are just a few of the stars who will portray the mutants on the run. Early critical reaction for the show, from creator Matt Nix, has been encouraging.  Fox  Freeform  Cloak and Dagger: Based on the Bill Mantlo and Ed Hannigan comics, the Joe Pokaski-led series will focus on two runaways who gain powers when a criminal chemist tests a drug on them. Gina Prince-Bythewood directs the pilot. It’s still too early to know what to expect, but comics fans are speculating that this may cross over with Hulu’s “Runaways.” “Cloak and Dagger,” expected to air in 2018, has actually been in development since 2011, back when Freeform was still known as ABC Family.  ”New Warriors”: ”Cougar Town’s” Kevin Biegel is showrunner on this series, which should stand out from the pack because it’s a superhero comedy. Young people make up this Avengers-style team that consists of Squirrel Girl, Mister Immortal, Night Thrasher, Speedball, Microbe, and Debrii. The series will be released in 2018.  Passed Over/in Development Purgatory  ”Most Wanted”: This “S.H.I.E.L.D.” spinoff featuring Morse and Hunter was passed over twice by ABC.  ”Damage Control”: This comedy about an overworked, underpaid clean-up crew who deals with the aftermath of superhero conflicts was supposed to come out sometime during the 2016-2017 season, but never did.  ”Untitled John Ridley Project”: ”American Crime’s” John Ridley had been developing a super-secret Marvel project, but at the Television Critics Association press tour, ABC president Channing Dungey couldn’t confirm where he was in the process.  “Untitled Hellfire Club”: Before Fox had settled on “The Gifted,” a project based on the “Hellfire Club” had been in development but did not move forward.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1889

It also stated Nance had a history of opiate abuse and anxiety. His death has been ruled an accident.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  Nance — who competed on Emily Maynard‘s season 8 of The Bachelorette in 2012 — was found unresponsive in Austin, Texas, on May 28. He was rushed to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Officials at the time said they did not expect foul play. He was 31.  The report revealed that the man was found with lacerations on his right forearm and neck.  Nance appeared on the ABC reality series when he was 26, working as a rehab counselor, and revealed in his Bachelorette introduction package that he had previously struggled with prescription painkillers abuse.  “I was addicted to prescription pain medicine. It all starts out fun and then somewhere along the road, it just turned into something else. It’s a vicious cycle and it ate away at me for a long time,” he said at the time. “I’m almost two years sober, now, and it’s not that easy — you have to completely change your way of living.”  In the wake of his death, many franchise alums shared kind words about the man, with Sean Lowe calling him “a sweet man with a kind soul,” and Chris Bukowski commemorating him as “a gentle man with a huge heart.”  So sad waking up to the news about Michael Nance.

Of the troubled reality star, a Bachelorette source previously told PEOPLE that the spotlight of the show had weighed heavily on Nance.  “He was the type of guy who felt things very deeply,” the source said. “Such a sensitive guy. You’ve got to remember that I met him when he was in his mid 20s, so he was pretty directionless. I don’t know that being on TV gave him any further direction.

Trump met with Prince Harry, a former soldier and son of Princess Diana, who started the games in 2014. (Sept. 23) AP  Prince Harry met with first lady Melania Trump, who's on her maiden solo foreign trip as first lady, ahead of Saturday evening's Invictus Games opening ceremony. (Photo: Chris Jackson, Getty Images)  TORONTO — Britain’s Prince Harry and U.S. First Lady Melania Trump met Saturday ahead of the opening ceremony of the royal's Invictus Games for wounded veterans, set for 7 p.m. ET.  “Nice to meet you,” Harry said as he was introduced to Mrs. Trump and they shook hands. They stood together and smiled for the British and American news media before sitting in adjoining club chairs placed in front of their countries’ respective flags.  The first lady sported a gray Dior pantsuit with a cropped hem, a look she has favored on many occasions.  Mrs. Trump’s decision to lead the U.S. delegation, whose members include Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, professional golfer Nancy Lopez and entertainer Wayne Newton, reflects the first lady’s “utmost respect” for the hard work, courage and sacrifice of the U.S. military, said Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Trump.  “She feels strongly that they — and their families — should be honored every day,” Grisham said.  Grisham said Mrs. Trump also has “great admiration for the role the games have played in empowering those who have been injured while serving.”  At a recent event marking the 70th anniversary of the U.S. Air Force, the first lady thanked the many military members who assisted thousands of people in Texas, Louisiana, Florida and the Caribbean whose lives were upended by recent hurricanes.  A native of Slovenia who became a U.S. citizen in 2006, Mrs. Trump also thanked service members’ families.  “You endure time apart, are expected to move when new orders come in, and face the uncertainty that can come in times of need,” she said at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, before introducing her husband. “This kind of lifestyle requires its own kind of courage and your sacrifices do not go unnoticed or unappreciated.”  Mrs. Trump has been slowly warming up to her new role, waiting to move to the White House until her 11-year-old son finished the school year in New York and holding few public events of her own. She accompanied the president on his three overseas trips so far this year.  Prince Harry, a military veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, established the Invictus Games in 2014 for sick and wounded service members and veterans from around the globe. More than 550 people from 17 countries are expected to participate in 12 sports during the coming week, ranging from cycling to wheelchair tennis to sitting volleyball.  London was the setting for the inaugural event in 2015, followed by Orlando, Florida, last year.  Mrs. Trump’s participation continues White House involvement with the games, which Harry launched during President Barack Obama’s tenure.  Jill Biden, wife of then-Vice President Joe Biden, led the U.S. delegation to London as part of a military initiative undertaken with then-first lady Michelle Obama. Mrs. Obama helped open last year’s competition in Orlando.  Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2yk4sPM",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,644

082a50ee-ddb4-4383-9c6e-c4819a4bdfdc,"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s custody arrangement was put in place with the best interest of their kids in mind. However, it appears the “Fury” actor is more thrilled about the perks that will come along with the new agreement.  Pitt, who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9, with Jolie, is reportedly excited about being able to spend more time with his children following the previous arrangement, which damaged their relationship.  “Brad was always an amazing dad. The kids have always been his life. He has flaws like most people, but so does Angie,” a source told People.  “Brad must be so relieved that the court is now helping him,” the insider added.  Photo: Jeff Spicer/Getty Images  In Pitt and Jolie’s previous custody agreement, there wasn’t “a set schedule” and the arrangement was “unorganized,” according to those close to the stars.  However, the court has since ordered Jolie to allow the actor to repair his relationship with his children and has implemented a detailed schedule that divides custody between the parents.  While the younger children are required to abide by the current arrangement in place, the courts consider Jolie and Pitt’s 16-year-old son old enough to decide how much time he wants to spend with his father. Even if Maddox opts not to spend much time with Pitt, seeing the other kids will be a relief for the actor.  “It’s been obvious that he has been missing his kids like crazy,” a source said. “To live so close to them, but not seeing them often, has definitely been painful for him.”  In the summer months, Pitt is expected to divide his time between Los Angeles, where he will film “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” and London, where Jolie is filming “Maleficent 2.”  Almost two years after Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, Pitt reportedly began “casually dating” and was most recently linked to MIT Professor Neri Oxman.  In May, sources told Us Weekly Pitt planned to cut down quality time with his rumored girlfriend in order to stay in Los Angeles and give his children his undivided attention.  “Their busy schedules are going to be a huge challenge because Neri isn’t going to give up her life in Cambridge or her job at MIT for anyone, even Brad Pitt,” the insider said.  While the actor hasn’t confirmed the romance, it appears he has decided to spend the majority of his free time with his children over the summer.  Photo: Tim P.

cf857bf9-c232-4a11-ba82-5a1bf76332bc,"Remember when Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their split, just a week after Architectural Digest published a story with photos of their gorgeous midcentury Los Angeles home? It wasn’t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.  In case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn’t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she’s doing just fine. She’s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an “industry creative,” whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.  But there’s no reason to believe we’ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she’s in love or having babies.  “For the record, I am not pregnant,” she wrote then. “What I am is fed up. I’m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of ‘journalism,’ the ‘First Amendment,’ and ‘celebrity news.’”  O.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She’s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.

a9b268ce-6a88-46bf-b2b6-27fd619de3ec,"The Emmys red carpet took a page from “The Handmaid’s Tale.”  While television’s brightest stars sashayed in a Technicolor parade on Sunday, red and white - a la the crimson cloaks and snowy bonnets worn by the enslaved women on the Hulu series based on Margaret Atwood’s book - emerged as the night’s biggest winners. (Which was fitting, considering ""The Handmaid's Tale"" won Best Drama, along with Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.) And everything shimmered with sequins and beading.  Nicole Kidman was among the best dressed of the night in a red halter Calvin Klein Calvin Klein by Appointment gown with a pleated bust. “Handmaid’s” Yvonne Strahovski also worked the red hot shade in a custom Julien MacDonald silk number, as did Sarah Hyland in a fiery cutout Zac Posen, Heidi Klum in plunging Peter Dundas, and Issa Rae in an asymmetrical Vera Wang. (""The Handmaid's Tale"" author Margaret Atwood was also notably in red.)  “A red dress is fiery, it’s sexy, it’s a universal power color,” celebrity stylist Robert Verdi told Moneyish. “And it also says ‘resistance’ in my opinion, so it makes a strong statement.”  Viola Davis wore Zac Posen. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  The white haute women included Evan Rachel Wood in a Moschino gown with cropped tuxedo jacket, Priyanka Chopra in long-sleeved Balmain, Sofia Vergara in a strapless figure-hugging Mark Zunino mermaid gown, and “Stranger Things’” adorable Millie Bobby Brown in a ballerina-inspired Calvin Klein gown with full tulle princess skirt.  Priyanka Chopra wore Balmain. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  “White always emerges when people are desperate for change in our culture,” mused Verdi, “because it’s a blank canvas for new beginnings.”  And the summer’s glitter trend was on full display, with sequins and beads dusted across almost everyone, including Lea Michele’s belted purple Elie Saab gown, Tracee Ellis Ross’s silver Chanel disco ball, Leslie Jones’ black sparkling Christian Siriano, and Ellie Kemper’s midnight blue capsleeve Jenny Packham gown.  “Glitter is so hot right now, and it was sparkle, sparkle, sparkle everywhere, and lots of sequin sand silver,” Tom Fitzgerald, co-creator of the fashion and pop culture blog TomandLorenzo.com with Lorenzo Marquez, told Moneyish.  Other standouts included Viola Davis in juicy orange Zac Posen, Jane Fonda in long-sleeved hot pink Brandon Maxwell (with long, sleek ponytail to match), and both Tessa Thompson and Zoe Kravitz chasing the rainbow; the former in a pleated metallic Rosie Assoulin, and the latter in a feathery cascading Dior.  Tessa Thompson wore Rosie Assoui. (Rich Polk/Getty Images)  “There were a lot of movie stars on the red carpet this year, so there was a heightened sense of glamour. If you know Nicole Kidman is going to be there, you’re gonna bring your A game,” said Fitzgerald. “And we are at peak TV with all of the incredible programming now, so it’s become more much competitive, and the Emmys are closer in tone to the Oscars than it used to be.”  While the Emmys ratings have dipped the past couple of years, more than 11 million people tuned into last year’s awards show - and the glamorous gowns worn by the nominees and presenters on any awards show red carpet influence what the $15.6 billion dress industry will put on the rack next spring. Remember when Amal Clooney wore white opera gloves to the 2015 Golden Globes? Long gloves appeared on the fall/winter runways of Marc Jacobs and Prada later that year.  Millie Bobby Brown wore Calvin Klein. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)  “You’ll see silhouettes shift now, thanks to the classic and demure 1950s and 60s looks on Nicole Kidman and Millie Bobby Brown, that kind of princess-style dress,” said Verdi. “You’ll see these popular colors (red, white, silver, the pops of orange and green) trickle down into ready-to-wear fashion. And you’ll see the fabrics - like the sparkle and lace we saw on the carpet - be used to embellish affordable versions of these gowns.”  And you may even be able to snap up at least one of Sunday’s red carpet looks yourself. While many movie and TV stories are loaned their designer gowns for these award shows - or are sometimes paid between $100,000 and $250,000 to wear a label for all of the free publicity it will bring the brand - singer and presenter Rachel Bloom revealed to E! that she had to pay for her $3,500 Gucci gown out of pocket.  “A lot of fashion houses are reluctant to lend clothes that aren’t in the sample sizes of 0 and 2, so it’s getting harder and harder for me to find clothes without buying them,” she said. “That’s the whole problem with the fashion industry: My body size is literally normal and healthy but when you put me next to a model I look obese.”  Rachel Bloom bought her Gucci gown. ""It's hard to get places to lend me dresses b/c I'm not a size 0, but I can afford it so it's OK"" #Emmys pic.twitter.com/pevV8HgfWj — Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) September 17, 2017  Verdi noted this is an issue because the competition for these couture gowns is fierce.  “There’s only a few great dresses in any given collection every season, and every stylist is trying to pull them for the celebrities that they are dressing,” he said. “So when the fashion houses are assessing who these should go to, they want it to go to a nominee over a presenter; to a global star versus a national star; to someone younger over someone older - those are what the ‘rules’ would be.”  And, often, to someone slimmer over someone curvier, as stars like Melissa McCarthy and Leslie Jones (both nominated Sunday night) have been public about their struggles to find designers to dress them.  But Bloom noted that she’s fortunate to be in a financial position where she can buy her dress. And she might get some money back for the gently-used gown, anyway.  “I can always resell it,” she said. “I do have an account on [the resell/consignment site] The RealReal. My writing partner sells all of her clothes there. Take a look on The Real Real for this dress tomorrow.”  See the world with cash-color glasses.

Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this claim.    Carey and Tanaka had split in April, but they're seemingly back together after recently being spotted on multiple dinner dates in Los Angeles. A photo even emerged of the two sharing an intimate kiss while cozying up in a booth. But the National Enquirer is now alleging that the singer is also seeing her ex-spouse. A supposed ""source"" tells the magazine, ""She can't seem to make up her mind which man she wants. She loves Nick, but she's got the hots for Bryan.""    The outlet's dubious insider goes on to purport that Cannon ""came to the rescue"" when Carey initially broke up with Tanaka, and she then ""hooked up with Nick partly to make Bryan jealous"". The seemingly phony source further claims that Tanaka is ""eating out of her hands again"", but ""when things got rocky with Bryan, Mariah runs to Nick"".    But despite the magazine's attempt at complicating the singer's love life, a source close to Carey exclusively assures Gossip Cop she's simply ""not dating multiple people"". The tabloid's assertion that she's juggling both Cannon and Tanaka is entirely false. Unfortunately, publishing phony stories about Carey isn't exactly breaking new ground for the Enquirer.    Gossip Cop previously debunked the magazine's fabricated tale about Carey and Tanaka having sex in a restaurant bathroom.

e5165e59-a37c-4180-a8c5-d328450b0ee6,"With hits such as ""Vision of Love"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry,"" pop diva Mariah Carey holds the record for most No. 1 debuts in Billboard Hot 100 history.  Who Is Mariah Carey? Mariah Carey was born March 27, 1970, in Huntington, Long Island, New York, and began taking voice lessons at age four. At 18 she signed with Columbia Records, and her first album had four No. 1 singles, including ""Vision of Love"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry."" She went on to produce several more albums (later with other studios) and top singles, becoming one of the most commercially successful female artists of all time with more than 200 million records sold.  Early Life Singer Mariah Carey was born March 27, 1970, in Huntington, Long Island, New York, to Alfred Roy Carey, a Venezuelan aeronautical engineer; and Patricia Carey, a voice coach and opera singer. She has two older siblings: a brother, Morgan, and a sister, Alison. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website Carey's parents divorced when she was three years old. She stunned her mother by imitating her operatic singing as early as age two, and was given singing lessons starting at age four. Eventually, Carey would develop a voice that spanned five octaves. After graduating in 1987 from Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, Carey moved to Manhattan where she worked as a waitress, a coat check girl, and studied cosmetology while writing songs and actively pursuing a music career at night. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website Early Music Career When she was 18 years old, Carey and her friend, singer Brenda K. Starr, went to a party hosted by CBS Records. Starr convinced Carey to bring along one of her demo tapes. She intended to give the tape to Columbia's Jerry Greenberg, but Tommy Mottola, the president of Columbia Records (later Sony), intercepted it before she could hand it to Greenberg. After listening to the tape on the way home from the party, Mottola signed Carey immediately and set her to work on her first album, Mariah Carey (1990) which included four No. 1 singles: ""Vision of Love,"" ""Love Takes Time,"" ""Some Day,"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry."" Her second album Emotions was released in 1992; the title track became her fifth No. 1 single, and included hits ""Can't Let Go"" and ""Make it Happen."" Success on the Pop Charts In March 1992, Carey appeared on MTV's Unplugged. This performance was released as an album and a home video, resulting in another No. 1 single (a cover of The Jacksons' ""I'll Be There""). Her next album, Music Box (1993), cut back a bit on the lavish studio production techniques heard in her previous albums, and included the No. 1 singles, ""Dreamlover"" and ""Hero."" Her November 1994 release Merry Christmas combined traditional Christian hymns with new songs. In 1995 she released Daydream; the first single ""Fantasy"" debuted at No. 1. It also included collaborations with R&B and hip-hop artists, such as Wu-Tang Clan and Boyz II Men (""One Sweet Day""). Her 1997 album, Butterfly, included 11 compositions written by Carey, and demonstrated her continued interest in hip-hop and R&B, including the Sean ""Puffy"" Combs-produced ""Honey,"" her 12th No. 1 hit. Carey's 1998 album, #1's, featured her 13 previous chart-topping singles as well as the Academy Award-nominated ""The Prince of Egypt (When You Believe),"" a duet with fellow pop diva Whitney Houston.  Overcoming Obstacles In July 2001, Carey was admitted into a New York-area hospital and put under psychiatric care after suffering what her publicists called a ""physical and emotional collapse."" Carey had been preparing to promote her upcoming feature film debut, Glitter, and its accompanying soundtrack album, but cancelled all public appearances. The release of Glitter was subsequently pushed back from late August to late September 2001. Carey was released from the hospital after two weeks. In January 2002, Carey and EMI (the corporate owner of Virgin Records, with whom Carey had signed a reported $80 million contract in April 2001) severed their relationship. Though the film and soundtrack for Glitter failed to generate the desired box office and sales totals, Carey reportedly walked away from Virgin with nearly $50 million as part of her severance agreement. In May 2002, she signed a deal with Universal Music Group's Island/Def Jam Records. In December 2002, Carey released her eighth album, Charmbracelet, which debuted in third place on the charts. The record's accompanying tour, her first in more than three years, launched in June 2003. She followed up with her tenth studio album The Emancipation of Mimi, which became the best-selling album in the U.S. in 2005. With 2008’s Touch My Body (from her eleventh studio album E=MC²), Carey surpassed Elvis Presley to become second only to the Beatles for the most No. 1 hit singles in the United States. Other albums include Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel (2009), Merry Christmas II You (2010), her second holiday album, and Me. I Am Mariah . . .The Elusive Chanteuse (2014) Carey has sold more than 200 million albums worldwide. She is the third best-selling female artist of all time, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.

9f839736-e624-4f72-bf05-aa3a7cf06d77,"Justin Theroux and Selena Gomez have not been exchanging flirty texts with each other following his split from Jennifer Aniston, despite a made-up report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this story. A rep for the actor tells us there's no truth to it.  John Lamparski / Getty Images for New York Fashion Week: The Shows  An alleged insider, however, tells RadarOnline that Theroux ""was sweet on Selena when he and Jen hung out with her,"" and now the newly-single actor is pursuing the singer via text. The questionable source adds, ""He's asking for major trouble by trying to hang out with her so soon after his and Jen's split.""  The supposed tipster goes on to say that Gomez has been receptive to the actor's advances, before further speculating that Aniston will be infuriated when she finds out. The seemingly phony insider says the actress believed the pop star was ""very much her friend, not Justin's,"" so she'll likely see their communications as a betrayal.  None of this is remotely true. While the blog hides behind an anonymous and untraceable source, Theroux's rep tells Gossip Cop on the record that he hasn't been exchanging flirty texts with Gomez. Although the actor and singer became friendly after meeting through Aniston, there's nothing ""flirty"" about their dynamic.  It's possible this scenario was created because Theroux gave Gomez a shoutout on Instagram last month while visiting a animal shelter in the singer's hometown of Texas. However, the actor simple suggested she adopt a rescue dog. He certainly wasn't flirting.  Unfortunately, this phony narrative has cropped up before. Gossip Cop called out NW last month for making up a similar story about Theroux hitting on Gomez in the wake of his separation. The pop star was also dragged into the exes' marriage back when they were still together. Last April, Gossip Cop busted a bogus In Touch story alleging that Aniston was jealous of Gomez and her so-called ""flirty friendship"" with Theroux.  It's worth noting, Gomez has revealed in interviews that she looks up to Aniston, who gives her ""maternal advice."" The pop star further noted that she's been a lifelong fan of the actress, so she's particularly grateful that they now ""have real conversations with such a real heart."" The idea that Gomez would start flirting with her close friend and mentor's estranged husband is simply absurd. Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm there's no truth to the blog's account of events.

Prince William and Duchess Kate celebrated their seventh wedding anniversary on Sunday, April 29, and Kensington Palace commemorated the occasion with an adorable photo of the couple from their wedding day.  “Seven years ago today – thank you for all the lovely messages on The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding anniversary!,” the Palace captioned an Instagram pic, which shows the then-newlyweds driving away from Buckingham Palace in a convertible.  The royal couple, who tied the knot in 2011, left their wedding reception in a blue vintage Aston Martin Volante, which belongs to the groom’s father, Prince Charles. The car was decorated by William’s best man, his brother Prince Harry and it was adorned with red heart balloons, balloons with their initials and a license plate with the words “JU5T WED.”  The pair received quite the anniversary present this year — they welcomed their third child less than a week ago. The Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to Prince Louis Arthur Charles in London on Monday, April 23. The baby, who is fifth in line to the British throne, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces. They are also the parents of Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2.  As previously reported, William, 35, will act as his little brother’s best man when Harry, 33, weds Meghan Markle at Windsor Castle on May 19.

It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.But this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.A Mexican mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she’s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.When she came back from work, she came into her baby’s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.She rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.She was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn’t breathing.She carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.She never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.The thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.The label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.Sadly, in the case of the Mexican mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.We must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,404

The scorned ex-Mrs. Theroux is calling on every single member of Team Aniston to squash Emma Stone, after flying into a furious rage over her romance with her ex-husband Justin Theroux.  As Radar previously reported, Theroux and Stone have been jetting all over the world together, a relationship that is driving his ex-wife crazy.  PHOTOS: Sorry, Jen! Justin’s New Girl ‘Nothing Like’ Actress  “It bugs the hell out of Jen that Justin got close to Emma during their marriage and she isn’t taking this lying down,” a source close to the Friends star told Radar.  “She’s dragging Emma every chance she gets and warning pals like Jason Bateman and Jimmy Kimmel to avoid her.”  As Radar previously reported, Aniston is “fuming” over their now public romance.  PHOTOS: Ultimate Betrayal! Jennifer Aniston’s BFF Is Still Hanging With Justin Theroux  Aniston took digs at Stone’s Hollywood reputation too.  “Jen and her squad take issue with the fact that Emma never met a role she couldn’t steal from another actress [most famously ‘La La Land’ from Emma Watson],” the insider snitched and said Stone was in for a rude awakening.  “I don’t think she realizes who she messed with and how far Jen’s reach is.”  But the fury at Stone is not unlike her fury at Angelina Jolie, who famously stole her husband Brad Pitt away from her.  PHOTOS: Free Man! Justin Theroux Flees Nasty Split From Jennifer Aniston With Paris Boys’ Trip  “This is a pattern for Jen, never directing the rage or gossip at the guy who left her but instead at the next woman he hooks up with.”  And Stone should be warned, the source told Radar.  “Jen is in revenge mode and Emma needs to recognize that she’s messing with somebody with a lot of loyal Hollywood friends.”  We pay for juicy info!

65a7c77e-f4b2-4b59-9fa1-160d9aad0bc1,"She's the one who got away! It's hard to believe that it's only been one year since Kylie Jenner and Tyga split — especially because so much has changed for Kylie since then. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now a mom to an adorable little girl named Stormi Webster — whom she shares with her new boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — and even though she's already moved on and had a whole baby with another man, sources exclusively revealed to In Touch that Tyga isn't really over Kylie.  ""Even though they’re not together, Tyga misses Kylie. For real,"" the insider told In Touch. ""He misses her sexiness. Her body. The lavish life, connections, money and exposure she gave him. He misses all of that and kicks himself every day for letting their relationship die.""  Kylie and Tyga dated for about three years — which is an eternity in celeb time — but they broke up in 2017 shortly after Valentine's Day. Fans were shocked to learn that Kylie had moved on so quickly from Tyga when she started dating Travis in April 2017 — and it was even more shocking that she got pregnant less than two months into their relationship. Sources revealed that Kylie's pregnancy was especially hard for Tyga to accept, because he eventually hoped to start a family with the lip kit mogul — and even though Kylie seems to be happy and in love with Travis and their little family, Tyga is still holding on to hope that there might still be a chance for him to get back togegther with her.  ""What’s worse: she’s got a baby with Travis. That gnaws at him,"" the insider continued. ""He wanted to be the one who gave Kylie a baby. He wanted that so much but she was opposed. Tyga’s pissed about that. But even still, he forgives her because he loves her. And he knows he could still have a baby with her later down the line if they were ever to rekindle the passion they once had.""

18c0a9ca-7df7-49e8-8b7f-387bb3169e65,"Let's face it. The franchise just hasn't been the same since fan favorite NeNe Leakes departed The Real Housewives Of Atlanta after Season 7. But alas the OG peach is returning to the reality series for Season 10 with more fierceness and shadiness than ever before. But after two seasons have come and gone without her, you may be wondering: why is NeNe coming back to RHOA now?  The explanation for her return is quite simple. NeNe says that she's rejoining the cast for the benefit of her loyal fans. After the network made the official announcement in June 2017 that she was returning to the hit series, NeNe took to Bravo's The Daily Dish in praise of what all of the RHOA love has meant to her over the years. ""I just want to be the person to finally say to my fans who have supported me for so many years... I'm back and ready for Season 10. Let the shade begin, hunni!"" she said.  Fans first met the outspoken NeNe in the very first season of RHOA. With her blonde hair and dramatic personality she turned heads whenever she entered a room. From the beginning of the series she was a favorite, as she never hesitated to say exactly what was on her mind. She provided the utmost entertainment through her many witty quotes, comebacks, and side-eye before letting fans know that she sadly wouldn't return for season 8. Though, many fans have continued using her dramatic GIFS, memes, and one-liners in her absence. So she was gone, but not forgotten.  In 2015 she told People that leaving the show felt like a weight had ""been lifted off of [her] shoulders."" That's no surprise being that most of the drama and arguments centered around NeNe. But in her defense she didn't start all of them. Nonetheless, NeNe officially traded in her peach in 2015.  “This was definitely a hard decision for me,” Leakes told People at the time. “Me and my husband [Gregg Leakes] have been going back and forth on it for weeks now. But my contract is up and I just think this is the right time. This is my opportunity to spread my wings and do different things.” The announcement for her departure came on the heels of news that Leakes would be focusing on other projects. She had previously guest starred on the hit FOX series Glee and NBC's The New Normal. Soon after leaving RHOA she made her Broadway debut as the wicked stepmother in Cinderella, alongside actress Keke Palmer.  But regardless of why she originally left the reality series, longtime RHOA viewers are super excited to see NeNe back in the group. She'll be reuniting with fellow Housewives Kenya Moore, Cynthia Bailey, Kandi Burruss, Shereé Whitfield, and Porsha Williams. Also returning to the show, both in a part-time capacity, are Kim Zolciak-Biermann and newcomer model-actor Eva Marcille. Kim was an original Housewife along with NeNe, but unlike Kim, NeNe will resume her place as a full-time Housewife when the series returns on Sunday, Nov. 5.  NBC/Bravo  ""I am back and of course the haters know I'm here,"" NeNe says in Season 10 trailer, which means Atlanta (and particularly Porsha) better watch out. In an exclusive sneak peek on Entertainment Tonight, NeNe wastes no time inserting herself back into the drama when she candidly confronts Porsha over some nasty comments and bad blood at Cynthia's 50th birthday party. And anyone who remembers NeNe's previous seasons on the show knows that she's not one to back down from a (verbal) fight.  So how will this crew of Southern Belles get along with NeNe back in the building? Find out when RHOA returns for Season 10.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,716
79bd4a1b-dcd6-4f6d-9326-0d650546cca8,"On April 23, 2016, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band paid tribute to Prince , who died just two days earlier, by opening his show with a version of ""Purple Rain."" It was the third time in as many months that the group has honored a colleague who had recently died. On the first two nights of their 2016 tour, they covered songs by the late David Bowie and Glenn Frey .  It struck us that, since he's been doing this since the early '70s, Springsteen has often been on the road when a friend or influence has passed. We poured over set lists from previous tours and found several examples where Springsteen has referenced another musician's death from the stage, either at the beginning of the concert or the at the start of the encore. In addition to the three mentioned above, we discovered that Springsteen has performed post-mortem covers of two giants of 20th century American music -- country icon Johnny Cash and folk legend Pete Seeger -- as well songs by Joe Strummer, George Harrison , Brill Building songwriter Ellie Greenwich, Warren Zevon and, in the earliest clip we could find, John Lennon .  But the most poignant tributes came when two founding members of the E Street Band -- keyboardist Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons -- died. In both cases, Springsteen dedicated entire tours as an opportunity to allow himself, his band and the audience to come together and mourn the loss of friends and bandmates.  As one of the most bootlegged artists in rock history, Springsteen's acts of respect have made their way to YouTube. We've gathered them here, so take a look below at how he has musically eulogized some of those he loved and admired.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,323

10c10524-4d56-4b22-a81d-0e23f554be73,"Hey, Upper East Siders. Gossip Girl, here.  It’s been 10 years since the titular online menace from the CW’s teen drama first began wreaking havoc on the fictional teen members of Manhattan’s elite, and Vanity Fair is taking a look back on the beloved series.  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  In a lengthy new interview, the Gossip Girl creators and cast – including Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Ed Westwick, Chace Crawford and Penn Badgley – share behind-the-scenes secrets, reflect on the show’s meteoric rise and reveal if they’ll ever reunite on screen again.  Here are the 10 biggest revelations from Vanity Fair’s Gossip Girl 10th anniversary interview.  1. Meester and Lively were not exactly friends, but there was no drama.  Though they played frenemies Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively, onscreen, Meester and Lively kept their relationship professional.  “Blake and Leighton were not friends,” executive producer Joshua Safran said. “They were friendly, but they were not friends like Serena and Blair. Yet the second they’d be on set together, it’s as if they were.”  The divide was mostly because of the actresses’ differing personalities, said Safran, who described Lively as “very in the moment,” while Meester was “very removed and very quiet” on set.  Though the pair weren’t pals, castmate Michelle Trachtenberg – who played Gossip Girl baddie Georgina Sparks – insisted there was no drama between the women: “We were all chill. It was cool.”  2. Gossip Girl stopped Lively from quitting acting.  Lively, then 18, was eyeing an exit from Hollywood when first approached about the series. Best known at the time for her role in the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants films, Lively told showrunners she wanted to go to college.  “They said, ‘O.K., you can go to Columbia [University] one day a week. After the first year [of the show], it’ll quiet down. Your life will go back to normal and you can start going to school. We can’t put it in writing, but we promise you can go,’ ” explained Lively. “So that’s why I said, ‘O.K. You know what? I’ll do this.’ “  Of course, the arrangement didn’t work out as “the show didn’t slow down.” Said Lively, laughing, “This is advice to anyone: when they say, ‘We promise, but we can’t put it in writing,’ there’s a reason they can’t put it in writing.”  Giovanni Rufino/Landov  3. Badgley and Lively kept their breakup a secret from the cast and crew for months.  Lively and her on-screen love interest dated in the early years of Gossip Girl‘s run, going public with their relationship in 2008 before ultimately splitting in 2010.  When the romance ended, though, Lively and Badgley didn’t tell anyone.  “The shocking thing was, I found out on the set of the season two finale that Blake and Penn had broken up months before,” Safran told Vanity Fair. “They kept the breakup hidden from the crew, which you could never do now. I don’t even know how they did it. They kept it from everybody which is a testament to how good they are as actors. Because they did not want their personal drama to relate to the show.”  4. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner made a cameo.  Before they were firmly situated in their White House roles, First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner appeared on the popular series.  Joked series co-creator Josh Schwartz, “They did it for the money.”  5. Badgley had a lot in common with Dan.  Badgley – one of the few series regulars not to speak with Vanity Fair for the article – “didn’t like” being on the series as Dan Humphrey, Safran said.  “He was Dan. He may not have liked it, but [his character] was the closest to who he was,” he said.  Neilson Barnard/Getty Images  6. Westwick and Crawford were roommates when the show started.  The real-life Nate Archibald and Chuck Bass bunked up as rising stars, sharing a two-bedroom apartment together in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood.  Together, they first encountered the fame that was to come when they attended a concert. “We had these girls coming up to us, and they were kind of freaking out about it: ‘Oh, we love the books,’ ” Crawford recalled. “[Ed and I] kept looking at each other like, s—, man.”  RELATED VIDEO: Watch Blake Lively Remember the Night Ryan Reynolds Fell for Her  7. Fans were so crazed at one point that they tried to stroke the stars’ hair.  The show’s men weren’t the only ones to deal with Gossip Girl‘s fandom. Trachtenberg said she remembered viewers trying to “pet [her] hair” while she walked around the N.Y.C. set.  She added, “I opened up my trailer door to see, literally, on my first day, I think 40 paparazzi. That’s when I was like, ‘O.K., I need my own bodyguard.’ “  8. Westwick still doesn’t know who Gossip Girl was.  Though the identity of the show’s main character has long since been revealed (spoiler alert!) as Badgley’s Dan, Westwick told Vanity Fair over email, “I still am not sure who GG was lol.”  The show’s crew said that Lonely Boy wasn’t always the frontrunner for the mean-spirited blogger, noting that both Nate and Serena’s brother Eric were once considered.  As Badgley told PEOPLE in 2015, “It doesn’t make sense at all!”  The CW/KC Bailey  9. The cast still gets approached by fans about the show.  Though the finale aired in 2012, with today’s online streaming, the show has found a whole new audience.  “It’s so weird how the same demographic has been frozen in time,” Crawford said. “Fourteen- to 20-year-olds still come up to me freaking out and it’s because they binge [the show] on Netflix.”  10. The stars are open to a reunion.  The series neatly ended with a look at all the characters’ futures, but the stars aren’t opposed to revisiting their endings.  Kelly Rutherford, who played Lily van der Woodsen, Serena’s mother, said she would be “completely on board” for a reunion. “And I think they should do it soon,” she added.  “Of course. I’m open to anything that’s good, that’s interesting, and that sort of feels necessary,” Lively said. “I imagine we all would [consider it]. I can’t speak for everyone else, but we all owe so much to this show, and I think that it would be silly not to acknowledge that.”  As for Meester? “I don’t want to say, ‘No, never . . .’ ” she said.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1400

bc2032f4-2ee1-470c-aee7-3eaf9937b6cc,"Scarlett Johansson has exited the drama film “Rub and Tug” a little more than a week after her casting sparked backlash amid trans groups and activists, a source with knowledge of the situation confirms to Variety.  “In light of recent ethical questions raised surrounding my casting as Dante Tex Gill, I have decided to respectfully withdraw my participation in the project,” Johansson told Out Magazine, which first reported the news, in a statement. “Our cultural understanding of transgender people continues to advance, and I’ve learned a lot from the community since making my first statement about my casting and realize it was insensitive. I have great admiration and love for the trans community and am grateful that the conversation regarding inclusivity in Hollywood continues. According to GLAAD, LGBTQ+ characters dropped 40% in 2017 from the previous year, with no representation of trans characters in any major studio release.”  “While I would have loved the opportunity to bring Dante’s story and transition to life, I understand why many feel he should be portrayed by a transgender person, and I am thankful that this casting debate, albeit controversial, has sparked a larger conversation about diversity and representation in film,” the statement continues. “I believe that all artists should be considered equally and fairly. My production company, These Pictures, actively pursues projects that both entertain and push boundaries. We look forward to working with every community to bring these most poignant and important stories to audiences worldwide.”  Related Scarlett Johansson Snaps Up Secluded Home in New York State Celebrity Enclave Avengers, 'Community' Stars Assemble to Welcome Joe Russo's New Restaurant Simone  New Regency won an auction for the movie on July 2, and it was set to be directed by Rupert Sanders, who previously worked with Johansson on “Ghost in the Shell.”  “Rub and Tug” focused on Dante “Tex” Gill, a crime kingpin who used his massage parlor as a front for prostitution in the ’70s and ’80s. Gill lived his life as a trans man, which led many on social media to wonder why a trans actor wasn’t tapped for the role.  “Oh word?? So you can continue to play us but we can’t play y’all?” Trace Lysette, a transgender actress best known for appearing on Amazon’s “Transparent,” wrote on Twitter after the casting announcement. “Hollywood is so f—ed… I wouldn’t be as upset if I was getting in the same rooms as Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett for cis roles, but we know that’s not the case. A mess.”  “Actors who are trans never even get to audition FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN ROLES OF TRANS CHARACTERS,” tweeted Jamie Clayton, another transgender actress known for her role on “Sense8.” “THATS THE REAL ISSUE. WE CANT EVEN GET IN THE ROOM. Cast actors WHO ARE TRANS as NON TRANS CHARACTERS. I DARE YOU.”  Johansson’s rep previously sent a statement to several media outlets in response to the backlash, which didn’t help to quell the controversy: “Tell them that they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman’s reps for comment.”  GLAAD responded to the news with a statement on Friday, celebrating the decision as well as those who spoke out against the casting.  “Scarlett Johansson’s announcement, together with the transgender voices who spoke out about this film, are game changers for the future of transgender images in Hollywood,” said GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. “Hollywood changed how Americans understand gay and lesbian lives, and TV is starting to do the same for transgender people with authentic transgender portrayals being major hits with critics and audiences. The film industry has a real opportunity to do the same.”  It’s currently unclear where production stands on “Rub and Tug” after Johansson’s exit.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,744

That’s what I hope.”  The former Nickelodeon star also said that she’s been sober for three years. In 2014, Bynes was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence. She had previously been booked for hitting a police car in 2012, and entered rehab the following year.  “I’ve been going to school lately, fashion school-FIDM. And I love it,” she said. “I’ve learned how to sew, I’ve made patterns, and I want to start a clothing line in the future, so FIDM has been helping me with that. Other than that I hike, I go spinning — I take spinning classes — and I feed the homeless. And that’s been really interesting and fun.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,405

The RHOC stars have been at odds since Edmonds, 32, asked Dodd, 41, if it was true that she was cheating on Michael with her boyfriend — and Dodd responded by telling Edmonds that her husband Jim was having an affair while she was pregnant.  Dodd carried their feud over to her Bravo blog, where she commented on her costars’ marriages — and took a stab at the Edmonds’ relationship!  “How great are our guys?” she wrote before talking about Diko and Peggy Sulahian and Doug and Lydia McLaughlin.  “Michael too supports my decision to get a breast reduction, even though he thinks my boobs are ‘perfect,’” she continued. “He respects that it is my body and whatever makes me happy is his priority. Michael has always been there with me at every medical procedure. For example, when we were going through IVF, he attended every doctor visit, administered all of my shots, he was present when the embryos were implanted, as well as attending all my prenatal care appointments. Not all of our husbands are so supportive, right Meghan?”  Radar previously reported that Edmonds was forced to undergo her IVF treatments alone, as her husband was on the road for his baseball hosting gig. She later confessed that he was a distant dad who was “removed” from her pregnancy and insiders told Radar he was “pulling away” as well.  The former baseball pro even missed their daughter Aspen’s conception and his wife’s baby shower.  Edmonds also claimed via Twitter that Dodd made hurtful claims about her postpartum depression, but the comments have since been removed.

Rebecca Katz, a political operative who worked on Bill de Blasio’s 2013 campaign for mayor of New York, was traveling with Nixon and shared a photo of her getting off the stopped train.  “That thing when you’re headed to talk about fixing the subways and your train goes out of service #CuomosMTA,” Katz wrote.

Andrew Cuomo’s administration, calling it an “exercise in living with disappointment, dysfunction and dishonesty,” according to the Associated Press.  Nixon accused Cuomo of creating inequality via tax cuts that favor corporations and wealthy New Yorkers, and said the state should focus on issues like fully funding public schools, reforming campaign finance rules and — with the topic fresh on her mind — getting the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees the subway, to fix the system.  Nixon, best known for her role as Miranda Hobbes on the HBO series “Sex and the City,” announced her campaign in an ad released Monday.

Nixon’s candidacy has already drawn opposition from former City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who told the New York Post Tuesday, that “[Nixon]’s an accomplished actress, a supporter of political causes and that’s a good thing ...

Earlier this week, Tristan Thompson made headlines for all the wrong reasons when TMZ reported that the NBA star cheated on then-pregnant girlfriend Khloe Kardashian a handful of times ( Kardashian has since given birth ) — first, on April 7 during an outing in New York City, and before then, during an October 2017 encounter.  In one incriminating photo posted to The Shade Room 's Instagram account, Union mysteriously pops up behind one of Thompson's alleged flings. But the actress wasted no time immediately shutting down the idea that she had anything to do with any of it.  ""Don't know her. Didn't see her,"" Union wrote. ""I was enjoying my night with my mama and aunt. We ain't involved in this.""  Though it was reported that Kardashian was devastated upon hearing the news that Thompson may have been unfaithful, she has since been consumed by happiness upon the birth of her daughter , and People reports she is in the process of mending fences with her child's father.  “She’s basically already forgiven him,” a source said. “She is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now, and everything that happened with Tristan is less about ‘cheating’ and more like, it was just a random drunken hookup that meant nothing and was kissing at most and didn’t lead to anything else and was the fault of stupid groupies trying to trap him, and everybody just needs to move on.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,317

Now, Star Wars is honoring the legendary actress with a series of moving tributes created for the Star Wars Celebration event held in Orlando, Florida, in honor of the 40th anniversary of the release of A New Hope.  Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher's daughter, made a surprise appearance at the gala. Following George Lucas' comments on the indelible effect Carrie had on both Star Wars and the entertainment industry at large, Billie addressed the audience with some moving remarks.  ""That was why she loved you,"" Billie said to fans, ""because you accepted and embraced all of her: the strong soldier of a woman she was and also the vulnerable side of her who often openly fought her own dark side, knowing early on that we all have a dark side of our own . . . Nothing about her was a performance. She loved you, she loved these movies, she loved the people she got to make them with, and she loved this incredible character she got to create, this force called Leia.""

5b40e09f-bbb0-4b57-ad17-adf187c1adfa,"Shamed “Today” host Matt Lauer is “bending over backwards” to give his soon to be ex-wife Annette Roque everything she wants in their divorce — including a multimillion-dollar payout — because he feels so guilty for cheating with multiple women at work, according to friends.  Lauer — who was axed by NBC bosses in November for a string of inappropriate affairs — has already agreed to pay Roque, his wife of nearly 20 years, up to $20 million, Page Six can reveal.  The couple are now getting along amicably, the friends tell us — and are both spending time at their 12-bedroom Hamptons pile, Strongheart Manor, as they prepare to finalize their divorce.  A source says: “Things really have settled down. Matt and Annette are getting on and they’re both spending time with their kids. They hope to settle the divorce very soon.”  Lauer bought the estate from Richard Gere for $36.5 million in 2016 and used it as a bolthole immediately after he was sacked by NBC.  However, the question remains — who will get the estate in the divorce — as they both love it and it’s Lauer’s “dream home.” It is set on a massive 6.3 acres on the peninsula of North Haven near Sag Harbor.  As we revealed last month, the divorce is nearly official — and the process has been smoother because the couple had already signed a “postnup” after Lauer persuaded a furious Roque to drop her divorce filing in 2006.  At the time, Roque cited “mental abuse, extreme mental and emotional distress, humiliation, torment and anxiety,” after learning that Lauer had been unfaithful. But she withdrew the filing months later after signing the postnup.  A source said: “Matt agreed to pay Annette a lump sum of millions back in 2006 as an incentive to stay with him to help him maintain his squeaky clean image as ‘America’s Dad.’  “She also got an allowance every year, plus it was agreed that she would get a share of the value of all their homes if they did split.”  So far, Lauer has offloaded his Upper East Side apartment for more than its $7.35 million asking price.  The former anchor also has one of his Sag Harbor homes on the market for $12.75 million, a significant drop from the original asking price of $18 million. His New Zealand farm, which he purchased for a reported $9.2 million in February 2017, is currently also still in his possession despite the fact he was poised to lose it as part of the country’s “good character” test following his sexual misconduct allegations.  The source added: “Matt’s bending over backwards to give Annette everything she wants because he feels so guilty. But he would love the Hamptons home.”  Lauer and Roque are believed to have agreed to share custody of their three children, Jack, 17, Romy, 14, and Thijs, 11, in the divorce.  While Lauer has spent the past nine months working on his relationship with his kids, and friends say he is a “devoted dad,” he still feels resentment about his sacking.  The source said: “Matt still maintains the relationships he had in the workplace were consensual. He does feel like the poster boy of the #MeToo movement when he sees other high powered men hanging on to their jobs despite allegations.”  A lawyer for Lauer didn’t return calls.

a8d5d360-1dc0-47ff-a3cc-6ce14b707661,"It looks like the plastic straw may be going the way of the fax machine and fountain pen: Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee seller, announced plans to nix straws at all of its stores by 2020. The chain, with more than 28,000 locations, is officially the largest food company in the world to make this promise, and has the power and influence to spur other restaurants of all sizes to follow in its footsteps. Starbucks estimates that this move will eliminate the use of 1 billion plastic straws per year.  Starbucks says it will replace plastic straws with paper or compostable plastic straws for blended drinks like Frappuccinos. These alternative straws will be available by request for customers who need or wish to use a straw. Otherwise, for cold brew, nitro, and other iced drinks, the coffee company will offer strawless lids, which it designed and manufactures. Already in use at more than 8,000 Starbucks stores, these lids look exactly like the tops to adult sippy cups, and, curiously are also made of plastic. Still, environmentalists seem to be supporting Starbucks’ move.  Plastic straws are kind of like a gateway plastic for every day citizens. As the founder of strawfree.org told the New York Times: “I think a lot of people feel overwhelmed by the magnitude of the plastic problem … Giving up plastic straws is a small step, and an easy thing for people to get started on. From there, we can move on to larger projects.”  “For our partners and customers, this is a significant milestone to achieve our global aspiration of sustainable coffee, served to our customers in more sustainable ways,” Kevin Johnson, Starbucks president and CEO, said in a release.  Seattle and Vancouver-area Starbucks locations will be the first to go straw-free.  The now-ubiquitous straw-free movement seemed to come out of nowhere earlier this year. McDonald’s in the UK announced earlier this year that it would switch from plastic to paper straws by this fall, but its U.S. counterpart has yet to follow suit. Meanwhile, metropolitan areas across the country, from Malibu to Seattle, have already passed straw bans, and cities like Berkeley and New York are facing similar proposed legislation. Earlier this summer Lettuce Entertain You, a restaurant group out of Chicago, also said it would cease use of plastic straws at 120 of its locations.  Per a release, Starbucks also says it’s still working on a fully recyclable and compostable hot cup. The company is spending $10 million on the initiative, which is in partnership with Closed Loop Partners, through the NextGen Cup Consortium and Challenge.  • Starbucks to Eliminate Plastic Straws Globally by 2020 [Official]  Related The state of straws around the world",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,515

Ever since Gwen Stefani’s split from Tony Kanal in the 90s, we’ve always wanted her to find someone who could love her and have a healthy relationship. While we thought that was the case with Gavin Rossdale, he ended up breaking her heart and cheating on her after 14 years of marriage and three beautiful children later.  But in 2015, Stefani met Blake Shelton while filming The Voice, and the two have been dating ever since. He’s getting along well with her children and seems to treat her well.  A post shared by ExtraTV (@extratv) on Jul 30, 2018 at 9:00am PDT  Even though they’ve both said they aren’t rushing into marriage (since they each divorced their spouses not too long ago), are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton secretly married?  According to sources, the couple has been trying to conceive a child of their own. “Blake and Gwen have decided to put plans to have a baby on hold. Their feeling is if it happens naturally, great. But they’ve decided to not focus on it for the time being. Blake is extremely attentive, loving and doting towards Gwen and the boys. Blake has always wanted children. And he’s great with Gwen’s kids, which prompted them wanting their own,” an insider said.  A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jun 28, 2018 at 4:35pm PDT  It looks like they are putting their plans to have children on hold — so does that mean they want to get married beforehand? Because Stefani is so traditional, getting pregnant without being married is unlikely. If that’s the case, did they have a quickie wedding to move things along?  Back in April, she confirmed to Ellen Degeneres she is not married.  Degeneres asked her questions about Shelton, to which Stefani replied, “It's weird because I get nervous when you talk to me about him. I don't know why, but for some reason, the cameras are rolling and I shouldn't say something. So if I say, 'We are [getting married],' then we are, and if I say, 'No, we're not,' then that would be sad, too.”  The good news, however, is that her children are taken with him. “We love him,” Stefani commented. “Everybody loves him. He's lovable. I think about [marriage] all the time.”  Even Shelton himself thinks about marrying Stefani. In an interview with CMT’s Cody Alan, Shelton admitted, “I think about it. I don’t think it’s anytime soon or anything. The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you’d be getting to that.”  As for a secret marriage, you can put the rumors to rest.

Now, the New Zealand pop star has tweeted a statement clarifying that that’s not the case.  “Taylor is a dear friend,” she wrote. “I love her very much. … Really sh–ty to wake up to headlines about whether or not you’ve jumped ship on someone you deeply respect and ride for. I want to say one more time that Taylor has been there for me in all my dark and light moments these past five years. All of them.”  Lorde did, however, take the opportunity to elaborate on the initial quote she gave in her interview, where she seemed to say that she doesn’t hang out much with the famous friends she’s made in recent years and isn’t “calling [her] idols” for advice.  For one, Lorde noted that while some had thought she was referencing Swift as an “idol,” she was really just referring to David Bowie and Patti Smith, who she’d mentioned earlier in the interview.  She also expounded on the flaws of describing Swift’s group of friends as a “squad.” “I’ve always found people’s perception of this ‘squad’ idea frustrating in the past,” she wrote. “It was never some exclusive club or secret society, but a wide circle of people, some of whom I know, and some who I’ve never met, like most wide groups of friends. Forgive me for the mild eyeroll I popped when it was brought up as if we’re all blood members of a secret cult.”  Of course, Lorde — whose second album, Melodrama, debuted at the top of Billboard’s albums chart last month — brushed the whole thing off. “I f—ed up an interview question,” she concluded. “Now go sip a beverage and head out on a walk.” See her complete note below.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,392

Steve Martin, 72, and Martin Short, 68, revealed on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" Tuesday that they have ""colonoscopy parties"" every other year with Tom Hanks, 61, and fellow friend Walter Parks to have some fun ahead of the procedure.  ""We’re very excited,'' Short said. ""We go to Steve’s house around 5 p.m. the night before. We call it 'Colonoscopy Eve' in Canada.""  They go through the process of avoiding solid foods, consuming liquids and clearing their bowels to get ready.  ""And it’s catered,'' Martin said. ""There’s Jell-O, you know, there’s not much you can (eat). You have to purge all day and then we toast.""  ""We thought, everybody at our age ... at a certain age, you want to get a colonoscopy,"" Martin said. ""We all came over, we played poker and we watched some funny movie and you drink all this stuff.""  Walter Parks, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Tom Hanks. The group joked about throwing ""colonoscopy parties."" Jimmy Kimmel Live/YouTube  Short also joked about the portion of the party that isn't so fun.  ""What’s shocking is with Steve, you know, he’s a wealthy man,'' he said. ""Who would think he would have one bathroom? I mean, by 10 p.m., the bathroom looks like Day 14 of a Carnival cruise.""  ""I thought the bathroom ended up looking like a Jackson Pollock,"" Martin added.  The four friends share one car on the ride to get their colonoscopies the next day, playing cards to determine who has to go last for his exam, the duo said.  ""It was fun,'' Martin said about the party. ""It's a great way to do something that you should do.""  The colonoscopy crew: Martin, Hanks and Short. Jokes aside, men should start getting colonoscopies starting at age 45. Getty Images  Kimmel himself has also been an advocate for raising awareness of the importance of getting colonoscopies. Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cancer death for men and women combined.  He celebrated turning 50 this year by having former TODAY anchor Katie Couric walk him through the process and go through the results in a hilarious scene while also stressing the importance of the exam. Couric's first husband, Jay Monahan died at 42 of colon cancer in 1998.  The legendary comedians correctly noted to Kimmel on Tuesday that colon cancer screenings should start at 45 instead of 50 under new guidelines issued by the American Cancer Society last month.  Colonoscopy parties don't need to be as frequent as every other year like those of the four friends. People who are in good health with no increased risk should have a colonoscopy every 10 years, according to the American Cancer Society.  If you’re at increased or high risk of colorectal cancer (or think you might be), talk to your health care provider to learn more. Your provider can suggest the best screening option for you, as well as determine what type of screening schedule you should follow, based on your individual risk.

We don’t even have a TV in our bedroom; we’re that couple. And no computers in the bed.”  She added that she and her country crooner hubby are particularly strict about what projects they choose, now that they’re parents to daughters Sunday Rose, 10, and Faith, 7. “The thing you really learn when you have children and a career — and particularly when you’re an older mother — is the preciousness of time, and therefore trying to balance everything and be willing to say no to things,” she told the publication, before adding that she’s “not willing” to miss bedtime.  In a new interview, Keith admitted that he’s so head-over-heels for his wife that watching her character, Celeste Wright, be abused on the hit show Big Little Lies was difficult. “It’s hard because she really tells her story,” Keith admitted to The London Evening Standard. “I love how committed she is, though, in telling her stories. She had the bruises to prove it.”  Despite the agony he felt watching his wife, he’s very supportive of her craft. In fact, he even creates his schedule based around where she’s filming. “We have a tutor that travels with us, so if Nic’s shooting a film for any long period of time, even if I’m touring, we can almost always relocate to wherever she is.

We just make the rhythm work so we can be together.” boundaries  Back in 2016, Keith gushed about the life he’s built with his adorable family. “Meeting her and getting married wasn’t life-changing, it was life-beginning,” he told CBS News. “It was literally, like, ‘OK, life starts.’”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,414
670f4dd4-a5b4-4db2-bde6-3c05bf807c4a,"  George Clooney and his wife, Amal, attend the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. (Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images)  Once the ultimate bachelor — and two-time People’s Sexiest Man Alive cover model — George Clooney entered entirely new territory this week.  The Oscar-winning actor and his human-rights-lawyer wife of two years, Amal, announced Tuesday that they are the proud new parents of twins, Ella and Alexander.  Clooney has donned many hats in his life — actor, director, producer and activist, but fatherhood had always seemed far away. Was it the early-onset-salt-and-pepper hair? The coterie of models who found themselves on his arm for fleeting moments over the years? The insistence by tabloids and fellow co-stars that it was time for him to settle down? Maybe. Or perhaps it was the simple fact that Clooney himself said again and again that he would not reproduce. In several interviews. Many, many times. For many, many years.  A first-time father at 56, Clooney was often asked throughout his career whether the single life was his ultimate future. But after proposing marriage to Amal in April 2014 and marrying her that September (as well as sharing wedding photos with People magazine in the United States and Hello magazine in Britain), it seemed as if anything was possible for the man who once said, “I don’t see myself ever having kids.”  But it was a long road to get there. “I don’t have that gene that people have to replicate,” he told People in 2006.  When Esquire asked him why he wasn’t married with kids, he replied, “I haven’t had aspirations in that way, ever.” And as for people who thought it was weird that a man in his 50s was single and childless? “What do you do? Should I go, ‘I got to get me some kids right now!’ and rush out and impregnate someone?”  Clooney seemed to express frustration when asked how he could ever relate to the fathers he occasionally portrays onscreen. His answer: “Well, I’m also not running for president, but I played that role in ‘Ides of March.’ I wasn’t an actual lawyer when I did ‘Michael Clayton,’ and I don’t fire people for a living like I did in ‘Up in the Air.’ ”  “I keep saying I’ll never get married again or have children but people just don’t want to believe me,” Clooney told Britain’s Daily Express just three months before popping the question to his now-wife.  Of course, celebrities are people, too, and it shouldn’t surprise anyone that a man might change his mind around the midcentury mark. And Clooney is certainly not alone in choosing to wait till later in life to welcome a child into the family: Comedian Steve Martin became a father at age 67 in 2012; Elton John was 63 when he had a baby via a surrogate in 2010; and Chris Noth was 53 when he welcomed his only child in 2008.  Perhaps it’s the fact that Clooney always seemed so delightfully and devilishly Clooney-ish that made his bachelordom seem like the only constant in our ever-changing popular culture. But we can rest easy knowing that despite some hesitation about having a family over the years, his sense of humor has remained steady throughout.  “Ella, Alexander and Amal are all healthy, happy and doing fine,” the statement announcing the birth of the twins read. “George is sedated and should recover in a few days.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,683

bd66bb6b-9c31-4447-85b4-adeca5970377,"When members of the royal family tie the knot, there’s a lot at stake—including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  This is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.  “I don’t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,” says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. “It’s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it’s a royal marriage.” Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen’s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.  Yes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn’t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. “You wouldn’t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it’s not Harry’s,” says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.  Larcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.  If Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they’re not legally enforceable.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  And though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII’s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. “In the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,” Larcombe says, “and the person who is departing the royal family, they’re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they’re done behind closed doors.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,572

Photograph: Albemarle County Jail/AFP/Getty Images“He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,” Kumer said in an email.Donald Trump condemned the “violence on many sides”, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.State police said in a statement the helicopter was “assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation” when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – videoCharlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read moreThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.“I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.The US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: “The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.NBC News (@NBCNews) WATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGyThe car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city’s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the “alt-right” and the Ku Klux Klan.Riot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the “Unite the Right” event.One of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP“Never in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,” said Spencer. “We came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.”He said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: “Jew! Jew! Jew!”Around the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: “If you take my picture, I’ll cut you. I’m not even kidding.”Meanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.A group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: “We’re here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin.”Steve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: “I think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administration’s politics and rhetoric.”Statue controversyIn February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.It was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.In response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan’s departure, and made 23 arrests.Ben Jacobs and the Associated Press contributed to this report",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,1416

So it's not surprising that J-Law might have a bit of a thing for Kourtney Kardashian sperm donor and bold innovator in the use of facial hair to camouflage booze bloat, Scott Disick.  On second thought, it is surprising, but only in the sense that we're shocked Scott is still alive.  Anyway, Jen revealed her love for the Lord in a recent interview with Oprah, in which she revealed that Scott would be one of her three ideal dinner guests.  (The other two were Luann DeLesseps and Bethenny Frankel, both of Bravo's Real Housewives franchise. Jen ... we're concerned.)  Given that Jen chose Scott over any of the women in the Kardashian clan, it's not surprising that certain tabloids already have these two bedding down together.  It's also not surprising that some of these same publications are casting Kourtney in the role of the insane ex:  According to the Australian version of OK! magazine (because why wouldn't news about three American celebs reach Sydney first?), Kourtney is pissed about the possibility of Jen and Scott hooking up.  In fact, Kourt has reportedly warned Lawrence to keep her mitts off her boozy baby daddy.  The subtly-titled piece “Kourtney Warns J.

RODRIGUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)  Trouble continues to brew for Russell Simmons, who is now accused of more than a dozen sexual assault incidents.  A new lawsuit, filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, accuses the entrepreneur of rape, according to reports from The New York Times and Billboard. The plaintiff, identified as Jane Doe, is seeking $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the outlets. Simmons denies the charge as well as the other accusations of sexual assault and misconduct.  Per the lawsuit, the woman says she met Simmons, 60, at a concert she attended with her son. After dropping her son off and spending some time together, the lawsuit says Doe hesitantly joined Simmons in his hotel room where she was raped.

Stephens, whose parents were friends with the now disgraced doctor, said he repeatedly sexually abused her when she was a child. (Jan. 16) AP  Former U.S. gymnast McKayla Maroney (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas, USA TODAY Sports)  Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics team doctor who pleaded guilty in November to criminal sexual conduct, is being sentenced this week on seven sexual assault charges. The sentencing began Tuesday and is expected to conclude on Friday in Lansing, Mich. Nassar faces up to a life sentence, with a minimum of 25 to 40 years in prison.  Close to 90 women are slated to read victim impact statements at his hearing this week. But former gymnast and Nassar victim McKayla Maroney — who first shared her story of abuse over Twitter — faces a $100,000 fine if she speaks out. Maroney signed a nondisclosure agreement in December 2016, agreeing to stay quiet about the abuse she experienced as part of a $1.25 million settlement with USA Gymnastics.  Chrissy Teigen, a swimsuit model and TV host, does not want Maroney to remain silent. Teigen tweeted on Tuesday that she would ""be absolutely honored to pay"" the $100,000 fine for Maroney. Teigen called Nassar a ""serial monster"" in her tweet, while questioning the ""entire principle"" of the fine.  Maroney is suing USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State University, claiming the nondisclosure agreement she signed was illegal.  USA Gymnastics said last month that the settlement terms from the 2016 agreement were initially not drawn up by its lawyers but rather by Maroney's attorney.  The entire principle of this should be fought - an NDA to stay quiet about this serial monster with over 140 accusers, but I would be absolutely honored to pay this fine for you, McKayla. pic.twitter.com/lsBEgEqZpD — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) January 16, 2018  Later on Tuesday, Michael Schur and Kristen Bell — The creator and star of NBC's ""The Good Place,"" respectively — offered to pitch in as well.

In the lawsuit filed to Los Angeles Superior Court, Maroney alleges she was forced to sign a confidentiality agreement as part of the financial settlement she needed to pay for psychological treatment.  ""USA Gymnastics has not sought and will not seek any money from McKayla Maroney for her brave statements made in describing her victimization and abuse by Larry Nassar, nor for any victim impact statements she wants to make to Larry Nassar at this hearing or at any subsequent hearings related to his sentencing,"" USA Gymnastics said in a statement.  ""This has been her right and USA Gymnastics encourages McKayla and anyone who has been abused to speak out.

56ea4420-56fb-48ba-b372-204a3f00d280,"Kim Kardashian West‘s latest Instagram post has fans wondering whether she’s mending fences — or throwing shade — at stepdad Caitlyn Jenner.  On Friday, the KKW Beauty mogul posted a throwback photo of Caitlyn prior to her transition in 2015. In the picture, Caitlyn — dressed in a silk robe — holds a glass of champagne while sitting on the edge of a bathtub where former wife Kris Jenner is appears to be nude and covered in bubbles.  “TGIF,” Kardashian West captioned the shot.  It didn’t take long for social media to react, many questioning why the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was posting a picture of her estranged family member.  Caitlyn Jenner and Kim Kardashian West  RELATED: Where Caitlyn Jenner Stands with Every Woman in the Kardashian Family  “Petty at its finest,” commented one Instagram user on her post.  Others shared the shot on Twitter, asking, “Is this Kim throwing shade at Caitlyn or is it just me?”  Perhaps one tweeter put it best: “WHAT DOES THIS MEAN!?”  Kim Kardashian West and Caitlyn Jenner Source: Caitlyn Jenner/Instagram  It has, after all, been well over a year since Caitlyn and Kardashian West spoke.  “To be honest, I don’t talk to [the Kardashians] anymore. Kim, I haven’t talked to in a year,” Caitlyn said in November while discussing her memoir at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.  Although Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner’s transition, she cut ties after reading her book Secrets of My Life, which alleged Kris knew more about her gender identity crisis than she’s admitted — a claim Kris denies.  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.  In an episode of KUWTK, the KKW Beauty mogul also revealed that she had been hurt by a chapter in the memoir in which Jenner implied that her late father Robert Kardashian thought his friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman — despite having served as the NFL star’s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.  “My relationship with Caitlyn was strained,” the mother of three said during the episode, which aired in October. “I was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.”  Caitlyn Kenner and Kim Kardashian West Source: Kim Kardashian/Instagram  Things surely couldn’t have been helped by comments Caitlyn made in January when she admitted on ITV’s Piers Morgan’s Life Stories that she “didn’t trust” the Kardashians and chose to keep the last few pages of her memoir from them when sharing advanced copies.  “I didn’t want them to leak it to the press, okay?” Jenner said, adding that those pages were the ones in which she wrote about her decision to have gender confirmation surgery to transition from male to female. “There was no reason for them to know about it.”  “I didn’t tell anybody. Why? It’s none of their business,” Jenner continued. “It’s not that big a deal.”  RELATED VIDEO: Caitlyn Jenner Reveals She Had Skin Cancer Removed from Her Nose: ‘Always Wear Your Sunblock!’  Though her relationship with step-children Kourtney Kardashian and Khloé Kardashian remains rocky, Jenner is still in daughters Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner’s lives. The Olympic icon even attended Kendall’s 22nd birthday bash in November at Petit Taqueria restaurant in Los Angeles, along with Kris and Kardashian West.  “Kris and Caitlyn only had a brief interaction to say hello, but everyone seemed fine,” a source told PEOPLE. “They were all focused on making it a special birthday for Kendall.”  She was also quick to celebrate the arrival of Kylie’s baby girl Stormi in February, sharing a throwback photo of her 20-year-old daughter on Instagram. “My daughter just had a daughter,” Caitlyn wrote in the photo’s caption. “It’s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She’s SO beautiful already. Can’t wait to watch her grow. Throwback to my baby, as a baby @kyliejenner.”  And despite their estrangement, in April 2017, Kardashian West told Ellen Degeneres that she would “always love her” for helping raise her and her sisters.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,857

Unlike many Hollywood figures, the “Mad Men” alum does not have a social media presence — and he intends to keep it that way.  “The point of life is not to put dog ears on yourself and post it online for everyone to see,” Hamm said, referencing Snapchat’s popular filters. “It’s fun, it’s adorable, but it’s the visual equivalent of masturbating — there’s no point other than immediate gratification.”  The 46-year-old actor, who split in 2015 from Jennifer Westfeldt, his partner of 18 years, also said during the interview that he does not particularly enjoy being single.

Update, 4:46 p.m. One of the most eye-popping allegations in Jones’s viral interview has, apparently, been confirmed. Richard Pryor’s widow Jennifer Pryor first tweeted, and then confirmed to TMZ that her husband did, indeed, have a sexual relationship with Marlon Brando, as Jones claimed in his interview. Pryor’s tweet read, “Hey girl: It was the 70's: enough cocaine and good music-one could fuck a radiator and send it flowers in the morning! # noshame“  Ivanka Trump still has yet to comment. The original story continues below.  Quincy Jones used to date Ivanka Trump—or so he says. In a wide-ranging interview with New York magazine’s David Marchese, the music producer casually mentioned, as an aside, that he went on a date with the First Daughter about 12 years ago. Marchese didn’t let that one go.  “He’s a crazy motherfucker,” Jones, now 84, said of Donald Trump. “Limited mentally—a megalomaniac, narcissistic. I can’t stand him. I used to date Ivanka, you know.”  Marchese responded with apparent shock at the new information: “Wait, really?” Back to Jones, who said that 12 years ago, Tommy Hilfiger, who was working with his daughter Kidada, a former model and current designer, told Jones that Ivanka wanted to have dinner with him.  “I said, ‘No problem,’” Jones recalled. “‘She’s a fine motherfucker.’ She had the most beautiful legs I ever saw in my life. Wrong father, though.”  If Jones’s 12-year time stamp is right, that would put his date (he only references one) with Ivanka in 2006, the same year she turned 25 and celebrated alongside actor and then That 70s Show star Topher Grace. It was around this time that Ivanka was rumored to be going on dates with Lance Armstrong. She denied that there was any romance there.  “I have tremendous respect for Lance and all he has accomplished,” she told People. “That said, we are just friends.”  She has not publicly commented on any date with Jones, neither at the time nor since the New York interview was published.

Check it out.  Jennifer Aniston, 45, has finally found happiness with fiance Justin Theroux, 43, but her road to true love was definitely bumpy! After enduring a very public and painful split from ex-husband Brad Pitt, 50, who allegedly cheated on her with his Mr & Mrs. Smith co-star Angelina Jolie, 39, Jen has found a way to forgive the “unforgivable” and achieve inner peace. Here’s how she did it!  Jennifer Aniston Forgives Brad Pitt & Angelina Jolie For Cheating  Jennifer opens up like never before to Harper’s Bazaar about her marriage to Brad, her future with Justin, and learning to forgive.  I’m “a forgiving person,” she says. “I absolutely am. I think it’s extremely important to forgive. Otherwise it just builds up like toxic waste. There’s nothing worse than holding a grudge. Listen, people can do unforgivable things, but you have to let it go and say, ‘Look, we’re all human beings. We make mistakes.’ To hold any kind of resentment is like taking rat poison and waiting for the rat to die.”  Wow, Jen is a true inspiration! She has clearly grown and learned so much since the demise of her marriage to Brad and we couldn’t be prouder of her. No wonder she was finally ready for the man of her dreams to come along!  Jennifer Aniston: Brad Pitt’s Betrayal Prepared Her For Justin Theroux’s Love  Of course, Jen ended up getting her fairytale ending too — with fiance Justin Thereox! And she says everything she went through with Brad actually helped prepare her for her new life with Justin.  “[Taking time] really helped me get to a place where I was more comfortable with myself, truly ready for love and for a partner,” she explains. “The past wasn’t ‘less than.’ It was extremely important to my growth as a woman. But if you take the law of attraction, if you only love yourself 70 percent, that’s what’s going to come back to you. So you fill up that 30 percent, then all of a sudden there’s this pure, good love standing right in front of you. Then you realize, ‘Oh, this can be easy! It doesn’t have to be so hard.'”  Now Jen couldn’t be happier with Justin. “He’s one of the most humble, decent human beings. He’s not an a**,” she says.

77f4df27-6690-43d8-a400-d26571cfd911,"She split from husband of seven years, Michael Mosberg, last year.  And it appears that Girls star Jemima Kirke is moving on as the actress was spotted looking loved-up with Australian singer-songwriter Alex Cameron on Monday.  The 32-year-old star, who has two children with her ex, hung out in New York with the long-haired musician and appeared completely smitten.  His biggest fan: Jemima Kirke appears to be enjoying a new romance with singer Alex Cameron as the duo were spotted together in New York on Monday  Close: The Australian musician was seen embracing the Girls star on the sidewalk  The duo put on quite a tactile display as they embraced on the sidewalk.  It looked as though the mother-of-two was helping Alex with a project, sitting beside him on a subway bench as he promoted his music.  Jemima's ensemble consisted of a white tank top and denim jacket with matching jeans and heavy duty work boots.  Her blonde locks were swept back and she bizarrely appeared to have painted on a hairline to match her beau.  Handsy: The HBO star wrapped her leg around Alex as they stood kissing in the subway  Partner in crime: It looked as though the mother-of-two was helping Alex with a project, sitting beside him on a subway bench as he promoted his music  Smitten: Jemima split from her husband of seven years Michael Mosberg last summer  Quiet moment: The pair looked deep in thought as Alex hugged the British-born actress from behind  Hanging around: Jemima clambered up some scaffolding while clutching a photo of her beau  The Tiny Furniture star was spotted clambering up some scaffolding while holding a picture of the singer.  Jemima reportedly brought Alex as her date to her artist sister Domino's wedding to Gossip Girl alum Penn Badgely last month.  The two said 'I do' for the second time this year at an outdoor ceremony at Lake Waccabuc in upstate New York.  They first wed in a Brooklyn courthouse in February.  Jemima and estranged husband Michael tied the knot in 2009 and separated last summer but their split was only announced in January.  Going solo: The actress shares two daughter with her ex who she married in 2009  Interesting: Jemima appeared to have a bizarre painted-on hairline for the outing, which was likely a project for songwriter Alex  The star's denim jacket featured a cartoon bunny on the back  The duo share daughters Rafaella, six, and son Memphis, four, together.  In February 2016 Jemima revealed to The Telegraph that she met Michael during a rehab stint for 'everything … partying' in her 20s.  She also said that she had started drinking again, socially, a decision her husband was initially worried about.  'Mike was nervous at first. He said, ""Look, I would never tell you what to do; you are an adult — just don't f*** it up.""  'He had every right to be scared, he knew my story,' she told the newspaper.  'But I was a different person back then. I was in my early 20s. I didn’t have children.'

aa277bbc-fa42-423f-8fb6-34fec4a573d8,"CLOSE The former auto racer will be the serial dater for the 22nd season of the show. Wochit  Spoiler alert: This story contains substantial details from Monday's episode of The Bachelor.  Hoo boy, what an episode! The team goes to Paris this week for FOUR dates: two one-on-ones, a group date, and a two-on-one that finally wraps up what seemed like a never-ending hell-scape of a plot point. Krystal is eliminated, and on top of that, Jenna departs. But maybe most surprisingly, Chelsea doesn't receive a rose. Our sweet mama is excused. Let's review.  Arie Luyendyk Jr. continues to look for love. (Photo: PAUL HEBERT/ABC)  The Rundown!  You Like Cheese? Wow.  Lauren B is probably a great girl, but there's something about Laurens this season. Maybe it's that they have to carry the date for both Arie and herself. Maybe it's that they don't want to. Either way, when she and Arie end up at a street market, you can't help but notice that the date is painfully, awkwardly quiet. But this time, it's kind of hard to blame Lauren, because the conversation literally went:  ARIE: We see cheese like this at home.  LAUREN: Wow.  Lauren B is stunning but I may not be able to finish the rest of the episode because this date is putting me to sleeeeep #thebachelor — Christen Whitney (@Christen_mae_) February 6, 2018  That's not even a joke. But after all the painful silence, the date takes a turn when Arie talks about his previous girlfriend miscarrying their child and then immediately leaving him. Bachelor whiplash, y'all. In response, Lauren reveals she was engaged once, and if you're reading this and thinking ""those aren't similar stories,"" you're totally right. After mustering up some semblance of a personal anecdote, Lauren is gifted a rose anyway for simply managing to stay awake.  DATE PART ONE: *nothing*  DATE PART TWO: *nothing*  DATE PART THREE: My girlfriend got pregnant, then she lost the baby, and then she immediately left me.#TheBachelorpic.twitter.com/w4i7Biv4sH — Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) February 6, 2018  Moulin Rouge  The group date heads to the historic Moulin Rouge where they learn to dance. Seinne immediately shines and Bekah M loves the costume, because Bekah loves the drama of it all. But the costumes and dancing all leads to a challenge, and whoever wins gets to dance with Arie on stage, which sounds low-key terrifying.  I’m hiding in a hole now — Tia Booth (@tiarachel91) February 6, 2018  Tia locks in a real moment of connection with Arie, as does Seinne, who even drops a little bit of French on him because this is Paris, and Paris is sexy and romantic and vaguely exciting. It's Bekah M who lands the rose though and does a little dance number with Arie while the other girls contemplate ways to, you know, maybe kill her.  Krystal v Kindness  Krystal announces her and Kendall's two-on-one like an actual sociopath because intimidation is her game. They head to the French countryside and end up in a maze searching for him, like some twisted bougie white woman version of a horror movie. Krystal finds him, and honestly, I thank God because I wonder if Kendall would have survived if she had made it first.  Arie takes Krystal aside to talk about that little temper tantrum she had last week, which she totally flips around, eventually pivoting to how Kendall isn't emotionally available enough for a relationship. Arie immediately brings that up with Kendall, and girlfriend stays cool as a cucumber. When she gets back to Krystal, she very calmly tells her that she needs to let go of her hurt and insecurity because she's a good person who has just lost track of how to be good. It's either the most sympathetic gesture in history or a NEXT LEVEL DRAG.  Love love love Kendall moving towards and to Krystal in this setting and expressing empathy. So beautiful! Yes! #TheBachelor — Taylor Nolan (@taymocha) February 6, 2018  Arie decides that he doesn't have enough information, so he pushes his decision to dinner. Later, Krystal tries to explain her way out of the conversation, but Kendall maintains all composure. When the rose comes out, it doesn't go in the way of Krystal. Kendall stays and the reign of terror is over.  Jacqueline?  Every season there's a seemingly great girl who appears five weeks in, and you're like, ""Who's that? Jacqueline? Has she been here this whole time?"" She and Arie take off in a car and go shopping in Paris for her one-on-one, and the whole thing is unfortunate because she is well-spoken and pretty funny, and you know this can't last too long. But in the end, Arie gives her a rose and keeps her around, which is great... for now.  I'm super happy because I want good things for Jacqueline, but I also hope she loses because I want good things for Jacqueline. #TheBachelorpic.twitter.com/xI7oY6QT8N — Justin Kirkland (@justinkirkland4) February 6, 2018  Superlatives!  Most Likely to Succeed  Kendall, who was easy to write off with all her sweet taxidermy talk, rose to the occasion on the Paris two-on-one date. With Krystal playing mad mind games on her, she leaned on the most powerful weapon of all: sincere kindness. By telling Krystal she was beautiful, but she was also imperfect like everyone else, Krystal went into dinner completely shaken while Kendall stayed completely composed.  Least Likely to Become a Rockette  Tia is handily a frontrunner this season, but that dance session? Well, poor girl couldn't carry choreography out if you put it in a bucket for her. Through a couple curse words and irresistible charm, she skates through the challenge, but man. Give the girl her frog legs and let her turn in those dance shoes.  Best Place to Start Over and Realize You Don't Need a Man  Tuscany, which is where the gang is headed next week!

daabe33a-4b43-4c45-a4a9-6e587ccefae9,"On Friday, Mr. Scarborough said that he had text messages and emails to back up his account, but he declined to release them, citing the privacy of his sources.  For its part, the Enquirer — which endorsed Mr. Trump for president and often runs stories favorable to him and critical of his opponents — said it wanted nothing to do with the fight. “We have no knowledge of any discussions between the White House and Joe and Mika about our story, and absolutely no involvement in those discussions,” its editor, Dylan Howard, wrote in a statement.  The story in question was published in early June, under the headline “Joe & Mika: TV Couple’s Sleazy Cheating Scandal.’’ Ms. Brzezinski said in a phone interview that she was rattled when her children and friends received calls from Enquirer reporters before it ran. But she added, “We never once considered calling Donald, let’s just put it that way.”  The Enquirer incident came to light as the “Morning Joe” stars reacted to a furor that broke out on Thursday, when Mr. Trump tweeted that Mr. Scarborough was a “psycho” and claimed he had once seen Ms. Brzezinski “bleeding badly from a face-lift.”  His comments were met with a bipartisan backlash, including from Republican lawmakers crucial to his legislative agenda, and revived a broader discussion of the president’s habit of making insulting remarks about women’s appearances.  Ms. Brzezinski and Mr. Scarborough were once friendly with Mr. Trump, visiting him and his family at his Florida estate. But they are now blistering critics, a reversal that Mr. Trump took as an insulting and personal betrayal.  The controversy spilled into Friday, overshadowing the White House’s plans. The hosts wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post. A meeting between the president and his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, a sober discussion about North Korean aggression, shared coverage on cable news with segments about the Enquirer’s disreputable past and onscreen graphics including “TV Hosts: White House Used Tabloid Story to Threaten Us.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,392

Celebrities took to social media Friday morning to share their thoughts on the inauguration, and in some cases, suggested alternative viewing.  Trump, who has not been particularly popular among the celebrity circuit, inspired a #Brownout from George Lopez. The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988. Lopez encouraged his followers to change their avatar to a brown square in support.

5e8e783c-c7fc-40a1-a2db-1be63fbf9cac,"Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately — not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the “crazy and manipulative” estranged wife who has become increasingly “unpopular in Hollywood.” She’s “out for blood” in the divorce fight, or she “wants to embarrass and punish” the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed “an insane jealousy” jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes “Amal has stolen her identity” as the world’s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency’s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children — girls especially — whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can’t read or write and has been “robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.”  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university — while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  “There are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,” Jolie wrote. “There are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.”  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: “Not with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.”  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  “Hardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,” Jolie wrote. “It is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.”  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a “patient, long-term manner, guided by our values.” She concluded her piece by writing: “If we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and security is so important to our own. It is the wise as well as morally right course of action.”",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,769

The 89th Academy Awards on Sunday paid tribute to notable film industry figures who passed away over the past year with its annual ""In Memoriam"" tribute, which also featured a moving performance by singer Sara Bareilles.  The video tribute honored screen giants such as Carrie Fisher, Debbie Reynolds, John Hurt, Gene Wilder and Mary Tyler Moore, but several names were left out of the segment. Aliens and Twister star Bill Paxton, who died Saturday, one day before the ceremony, wasn't mentioned, though presenter Jennifer Aniston remembered the actor as she introduced Bareilles' performance.  Among those omitted from the tribute were Garry Shanding, Dan Ireland, Robert Vaughn and Doris Roberts.  GARRY SHANDLING  The standup comedian died March 24, 2016, at age 66 after suffering a blood clot. Shandling is best known for his comedic turns on TV's The Larry Sanders Show and It's Garry Shandling's Show and also had starring roles in Iron Man 2, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, What Planet Are You From? and more.  DAN IRELAND  The producer and director, who died April 14, 2016, at age 57, most notably helmed 1996's The Whole Wide World and Jolene. Jessica Chastain, who made her feature debut in Jolene, tweeted her disappointment about the omission after the ""In Memoriam"" segment aired.  ROBERT VAUGHN  Vaughn, who died Nov. 11, 2016, at age 83, played American spy Napoleon Solo on the 1960s NBC series The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor for his role in The Young Philadelphians. He was also seen in The Magnificent Seven, Bullitt and Superman III.  DORIS ROBERTS  Roberts died of natural causes on April 17, 2016, at age 90. The actress and five-time Emmy winner is best known for starring on the series Everybody Loves Raymond and in the films Something Wild (1961), The Honeymoon Killers (1969), The Heartbreak Kid (1972), The Rose (1979) and National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989).

34bc59a3-4790-4fe0-882e-0bc741d1a34a,"Will Smith is taking on the naysayers when it comes to his and wife Jada's longlasting marriage.  On Wednesday, the 49-year-old actor went back to his rapping roots, releasing a video teasing his upcoming new music. The video shows Will rapping his song ""To the Clique"" in the booth, in which he slams tabloid divorce rumors about him and Jada.  “Stop the divorce rumors and mind your damn business,” he raps passionately.  Aside from plenty of swagger, Smith's playful verse also includes shout-outs to Halle Berry and Rihanna.  ""Or I'm gonna become a Mormon/Marry Halle and Rihanna,"" he jokes at one point.  Smith's last studio album was Lost and Found, released in 2005. Since then, he's only officially released one single, ""Get Lit,"" which was released last year.  Of course, this isn't the first time Smith has shut down divorce rumors. In August 2015, he took to Facebook to address the tabloids.  ""Under normal circumstances, I don't usually respond to foolishness. (Because it's contagious),"" Smith wrote. ""But, so many people have extended me their 'deepest condolences' that I figured - 'What the hell... I can be foolish, too!' So, in the interest of redundant, repetitious, over & over-again-ness... Jada and I are... NOT GETTING A DIVORCE!!!!!!!!!!!!! I promise you all - if I ever decide to divorce my Queen - I SWEAR I'll tell you myself! ""Dumb‬ People Should Have to Wear Scarlet D's.""  In June of that year, Jada spoke to ET, and denied any trouble in their marriage.  ""You'd think people would be rooting for you to stay together not to break up, you know?"" she said at the time. ""It's actually good news and bad news. The good news is there's nothing else to talk about. This has been the only story. 'Let's round up the divorce story again!'""  ""Will and I love each other so much, and our family and our relationship is so important,"" she added.  Earlier this month, Jada made headlines when she had an uncomfortable conversation with Smith's first wife, Sheree Zampino, on her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk. The two women got candid about the rough start to their relationship with one another, and ended up shedding tears together at one point.

Speaking to Cohen, Zolciak-Biermann continued to deny claims that she is racist — and said racism is only something being magnified by social media.  “This whole racism thing in this day in age is b—.

Nobody bought into it then because the social media wasn’t there and racism wasn’t f— all that real. You know it.”  In an Instagram post on Thursday, Zolciak-Biermann backtracked, writing, “During the last RHOA Reunion episode, I made a comment that confused and offended people.

Let me be very clear, I do NOT support, tolerate or put up with any form of racism, hate or other discrimination. My love for ALL people runs deep – I am open to all and always have been.”  The 39-year-old said she “was heartbroken” when she watched the reunion episode and “saw how my words were taken out of context.”  “My comment that seemingly ‘racism didn’t exist 10 years ago’ was made as part of a larger, emotional 45-minute conversation about how, sadly, social media has become a hub for hate,” she said. “Immediately following my confusing comment, I also said that ‘it’s not as real as it is now’ referring to the power of social media. But those remarks didn’t make the show.”  Zolciak-Biermann reaffirmed her position that social media has amplified racism in the U.S., stating, “Before social media, the public simply observed the news. Now, the public actively participates and has an opportunity to take action – in real time.”  “But this is a double edged sword. Now, when false accusations are made, they are amplified by online platforms regardless of their merit,” she said. “This wasn’t the case 10 years ago when I started on RHOA.”  Want to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Although their successor has yet to be named, Star Wars fanboy and filmmaker Kyle Newman threw his hat into the ring and even offered to take a massive pay cut to bring the film to completion.  When people began suggesting he take over the reins on Twitter, Newman replied with a string of replies to various different accounts. His message on the matter is as follows:  ""I'm available. To be honest, I'd kill it. Was born for it. And know Solo inside out. And am free. As in I would cost zero dollars. I'm not shiny and new. But goddamn could I direct the f**k out of some Star Wars. I have my doctorate in it after all. No fear. Only adrenaline. If it's Star Wars, then I'm your guy. Period. I know Solo inside and out. You'd enjoy my Han Solo radio dramas recorded live at the past three domestic SW Celebrations. I truly feel like I'm wasting my life NOT working on Star Wars in some capacity. I would go supernova and blow people's minds."" The filmmaker then noted, ""It could be a great film and will be a great film.""

09c0cf0b-1a84-475d-8371-09e2fc3555dd,"James Van Der Beek and his wife, Kimberly, are now a family of seven!  The actor took to Instagram to announce that he and his wife had welcomed baby no. 5 -- daughter Gwendolyn -- on Friday, June 15. The couple are already parents to three daughters, Olivia, 7, Annabel Leah, 4, and Emilia, 2, as well as son Joshua, 6.  ""Thrilled to announce we welcomed a brand new baby girl into the world Friday morning, just in time for #FathersDay 😍"" Van Der Beek wrote. ""These last few days, as I’ve enjoyed the privilege of making smoothies I know my older kids will like, making my wife red raspberry leaf tea to ease her uterine contractions, spending 'boy time' with my son and getting my two year-old down for a nap in the way only I know how... I’ve been heart sick about something.""  The former Dawson's Creek star then went on to criticize the Donald Trump Administration's crack down on illegal immigration with a zero-tolerance policy of separating families at the border.  ""As I write this, kids are being ripped from the arms of their parents. By our government. For the kid’s benefit? No - the opposite - as a purposeful display of cruelty to deter would-be illegal border crossers AND legal asylum seekers (it’s happening to both). And it wouldn’t be honest to wax poetic about my new-baby bliss without speaking up against this atrocity,"" Van Der Beek wrote.  He concluded with a sweet message to his wife, Kimberly.    ""Oh, and @vanderkimberly -- you’re a f*cking earth goddess rock star and I’m as in awe of you as I am in love with you,"" he wrote. ""And our new baby’s name is Gwendolyn ❤️ #HappyFathersDay everybody.""  The couple announced that they were expanding their brood back in February, with a sweet shot of the family crowded around Kimberly's baby bump.  ""Thrilled beyond belief to announce that we are once again adding to our family 😍,"" James captioned the pic. ""And I say 'beyond belief' because some people are probably wondering if we’re out of our minds. Which we might very well be... but I couldn’t be more excited. Or grateful. Or in awe of @vanderkimberly.""  However, the couple were also realistic about being way outnumbered by their growing family. Prior to welcoming their fifth child, James posted a pic of their kids on a sweet farm outing, with the knowing caption, ""In a few weeks, we’ll look back on today and think, 'Boy, wasn’t that easy?'""

The actress has lost a drastic amount of weight following her split from Brad Pitt and now, a new rumour claims that the actress is also stopped eating and sleeping properly.  There are rumours doing the rounds claiming that Jolie is undergoing 'health crisis' and is ""on the verge of passing out.""

4474915e-f657-4f5d-be21-a8628fc3399e,"John Bernecker, the stuntman who suffered massive head injuries in a fall Wednesday on the set of The Walking Dead, has died at Atlanta Medical Center.  The death was confirmed to Deadline by Coweta County Coroner Richard Hawk, who said Bernecker died of blunt force trauma at 6:30 PM ET on Wednesday. A source at the hospital told Deadline earlier that Bernecker had been placed on a ventilator while his family made arrangements.  Bernecker’s family has agreed to donate Bernecker’s organs through LifeLink of Georgia, a nonprofit group dedicated to the recovery of organs and tissue for transplantation.  Federal workplace monitor OSHA and SAG-AFTRA, the union that represents stunt performers, have launched investigations into the accident.  It’s believed to be the first stunt-related death in the United States in more than 17 years. AMC said earlier today that it temporarily halted production on Season 8 of the zombie apocalypse series in the wake of the accident.  Sources say Bernecker and an actor were rehearsing a fight scene that was supposed to end with a routine fall from a balcony, but he lost his footing and fell 30 feet to a concrete floor. He was pronounced brain-dead at the hospital and was taken off life support today.  IMDb lists more than 90 stunt credits since 2009 for Bernecker, including the recent features Black Panther, Logan, Get Out, The Fate of the Furious and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2. He also was featured in a 2014 episode of the web series Behind the Stunts. Watch a 2016 reel of Bernecker’s stunt work below.  Stunt work has always been dangerous, but less so now than ever before, said veteran stuntman Conrad Palmisano, a member of the SAG-AFTRA stunt and safety committee. “Generally, it’s safer now that it was 20 years ago, and I anticipate it being safer 20 years from now than it was today,” he told Deadline. “But it’s still a dangerous business. The nature of stunts is inherently dangerous, and we work very hard to create stunts in the safest possible manner. However, it’s still dangerous and things can go wrong. It’s never one thing. Usually the planets have to align in all the wrong ways for something tragically to go wrong. When we as a stunt community examine what happened, we look to fix the problem, not to affix the blame.”  Although stunt deaths have become rare in the U.S., falls have proved particularly deadly in the past. In 2000, Brady Michaels was killed while filming the UPN reality show I Dare You when he fell from a stationary train during rehearsals in Arizona and struck his head on a rock.  In 1996, Paul Dallas died of head injuries in a fall on the set of the TV series L.A. Heat. He fell 57 feet from a power plant platform and landed on the airbag that was supposed to break his fall but was ejected backward and hit his head on a metal railing.  Two years earlier, stuntwoman Sonja Davis was killed in a high fall on the set of the film A Vampire in Brooklyn. Jumping from a rooftop, she partially missed the airbag below and struck her head on the pavement.  In 1990, a high fall also took the life of stuntman Jay C. Currin, who was killed in a 60-foot jump from a seaside cliff in Malibu on the first day of filming Bikini Island. Landing on the edge of the airbag, he was thrown into the rocks along the beach.  In 1981, Jack Tyree was killed when he jumped off an 80-foot cliff in Malibu and missed his airbag while filming The Sword and the Sorcerer.  Three years earlier, stuntman A.J. Bakunas was killed on the set of the movie Steel while attempting to set a world record by jumping without a parachute from the 22nd floor of a construction site in downtown Lexington, KY. A canvas and plastic airbag intended to cushion his fall split open upon impact. He’d set a world record for a 230-foot jump the year before on Hooper and was killed while attempting to retake the record from Dar Robinson, who’d made a 296-foot high-fall. Directed by stunt legend Hal Needham, Hooper starred Burt Reynolds as an aging Hollywood stuntman who tries to keep ahead of the new kid on the block (Jan-Michael Vincent).

Over the weekend, photos emerged of Johnny posing with fans at the Four Seasons hotel in St Petersburg, Russia. And he looked VERY different.  Looking at the snaps, Amber Heard's ex-husband cuts a pale and gaunt figure. Fans were also quick to point out just how much weight he appears to have lost, with many speculating it could be a result of potential illness or stress.

Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,” she added. “I didn’t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts.”  “The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,” she continued. “Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”  RELATED VIDEO: Meryl Streep Calls Out Harvey Weinstein in Statement About Sexual Harassment Allegations  Over 50 women have accused Weinstein, 65, of sexual assault and misconduct since The New York Times and The New Yorker documented decades of alleged sexual misconduct and sexual assault involving a number of women in detailed articles in October. McGowan was one of the first women to come forward — accusing the producer of rape.  In a statement to PEOPLE, Weinstein’s attorneys have denied any allegations of sexual assault.  “Mr. Weinstein has never at any time committed an act of sexual assault, and it is wrong and irresponsible to conflate claims of impolitic behavior or consensual sexual contact later regretted, with an untrue claim of criminal conduct,” his lawyers said. “There is a wide canyon between mere allegation and truth, and we are confident that any sober calculation of the facts will prove no legal wrongdoing occurred.  “Nonetheless, to those offended by Mr. Weinstein’s behavior, he remains deeply apologetic.”",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,727

He also stood next to Oxman in another picture with his hands behind his back as the larger group beamed at the camera. That photo has since been taken down.  Page Six first reported last week that the two had struck up a friendship based on their shared love of architecture. Pitt reportedly met Oxman, 42, through an architecture project at MIT, where she works as a professor of media arts and sciences at the school’s Media Lab.  The duo connected over their shared love of design and architecture, a source told Page Six TV, adding that their relationship “is best described as a professional friendship.” While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is “interested in spending more time” with Oxman.

But it’s not only true for architecture; it’s true in musical composition, for females working in theater, for film directors. This isn’t just a disease of the architecture profession; it’s a phenotype of human culture and how we develop stereotypes and perceptions.”  Last year, a source told PEOPLE that Pitt has been “casually dating,” adding, “He has been going out but there is nothing serious in the dating area at all, nothing to speak of at this point.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,479

While many Game of Thrones fans had different reactions to Ed Sheeran’s cameo in the Season 7 premiere, Game of Thrones director Jeremy Podeswa had nothing but good things to say about the singer.  The Thinking Out Loud singer made a cameo appearance as a Lannister soldier with his campfire singing catching the attention of Arya Stark (Maisie Williams) who was passing by but then cautiously joined their party for dinner.  “It was lovely working with Ed,” Podeswa told Variety. “He is one of the nicest guys in the world, and he really is one of the guys. He’s lovely, he’s a team player, he wants to do a good job, he takes direction, he’s very open.”  READ MORE: Ed Sheeran’s ‘Game of Thrones’ cameo receives mixed reviews from fans  The episode’s director continued: “He’s a big fan of the show and he was really excited to be a part of it. I think his lovely voice was used to great effect and he just has a really nice presence.”  Podeswa also said that Sheeran “blends into the world of the show in a nice way” and that if people didn’t know who the singer was, “nobody would even blink about his presence on the show.”  Sheeran’s appearance as a Lannister soldier drew a mix of criticism and praise from fans of the show, including some calling the show “less authentic” due to his cameo.  Podeswa told Newsweek that he was “quite surprised” about the reaction to Sheeran’s appearance.  “I know he’s very well known and a successful singer but you’re in the bubble of the show — the cast are well known too, everybody is really well known… none of them can walk down the street without being followed,” Podeswa said. “I think people interrogated it too much, they’re bringing so much of his [superstar] presence into the thing which is far beyond what anybody was thinking going into it. He is known to the producers of the show and some of the cast, and he’s a gigantic fan of the show.”  READ MORE: ‘Game Of Thrones’ actor Kit Harington speaks out about ‘a**holes’ who leak spoilers  The Castle on the Hill singer isn’t the first musician to make a cameo appearance on the HBO show.

The Twitter disappearance was short-lived because he is now back online but all of his tweets since April 2015 have been removed and the singer’s more than 19 million followers have been reduced to a few thousand.  The 26-year-old told Britain’s Sun tabloid this month that he was no longer using his Twitter account aside from posting his Instagram pictures to it. He called Twitter a platform for “saying mean things” and was trying to “work out why people dislike me so much.”  Sheeran took to Instagram on Wednesday to deny that his Twitter absence had anything to do with the backlash from his Game of Thrones appearance.  “I came off Twitter coz I was always intending to come off Twitter, had nothing to do with what people said about my Game of Thrones cameo,” the singer wrote. “Why the hell would I worry what people thought about that. It’s clearly f***in’ awesome.”  The HBO drama’s seventh-season premiere last weekend drew a record-setting 10.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen company figures released Tuesday.  —With files from the Associated Press",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,826

225c4498-2610-416e-8527-f2a530651f74,"The bombshell dropped on the Washington Post’s website just after 4 p.m.: a video of Donald Trump, in 2005, using extremely vulgar language to describe women, detailing his attempt to bed a married woman and bragging that he can grope women because he is a celebrity. Less than an hour later, Wikileaks published more than 2,000 emails from what appeared to be the personal account of the chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.But not even John Podesta’s private and largely inside-baseball notes to Clinton could save Trump the lashing that was coming his way.Republicans lined up to criticize Trump’s language and attitudes toward women. His advisers worried about what else might be out there to sink their chances with just over a month until Election Day. Trump Tower was in full meltdown mode again, with some advisers urging him to make another apology and others just trying to make him see that there was a serious problem. And Trump’s Sunday night’s debate against the first woman to lead a major-party presidential ticket just became that much more of a draw in a cycle that has already broken television records.Trump initially issued a brief statement that claimed Bill Clinton had said far worse things as the pair played golf. Republicans’ freak-out did not slow, and he dropped plans to campaign in Wisconsin with House Speaker Paul Ryan. Shortly after midnight, Trump tried the apology again. “These words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong. And I apologize,” Trump said in a straight-to-camera address that he released on social media. He likened the archived video to a distraction from the campaign he is fighting against Clinton.Then, against allies’ advice, he returned to Bill and Hillary Clinton’s marriage. “Bill Clinton has actually abused women. And Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days,” Trump said.It wasn’t exactly the advice many of his supporters were seeking. “Donald Trump needs to humble himself,” Trump adviser Kayleigh McEnany said on CNN, perhaps recognizing that Trump tends to listen to the talking heads on TV more than the people in his penthouse. Hearing someone who might be the next President of the United States say some of Trump’s words was too galling to notions of how one behaves in the Oval Office. “There have to be dozens of tapes like this when a candidate has diarrhea of the mouth,” Republican strategist and Trump critic Katie Packer said. Added veteran Republican Stuart Stevens: “How does any woman work for Donald Trump?”It made for a remarkable evening in an already remarkable campaign. The dueling releases came on the same day the U.S. government officially said what has been deeply suspected for a long while: Russia was looking to interfere with America’s election. In the midst of all this, the State Department’s release of more of Clinton’s own emails from her time as the nation’s top diplomat were largely an afterthought, as were Trump’s continued incorrect claims about the Central Park Five.As Trump’s candidacy appeared—yet again—to teeter on implosion, rabble-rouser hacktivist Julian Assange opened up Podesta’s Gmail account in an attempt to distract from the Trump fiasco. Trump made a feeble attempt at apologizing while his son tried to distract attention to Clinton’s emails, which he called an “October Surprise” on Twitter. All eyes stayed on Trump’s words, however. “Women have the power to stop Trump,” Clinton tweeted and posted a video of his worst statements about women.In an election that has already tested the norms of politics and the collective stomach of its voters, the distinct events—and the responses—would affect specific blocs of voters that each candidate is struggling to lock down. For Trump, his standing with female voters was at risk well before the video emerged that includes him bragging about getting away with groping women because he is a celebrity. Hearing him say “When you’re a star, they let you do it” hardly inspires the same feelings the country had for Barack Obama or Ronald Reagan.“He is talking about sexual assault. There’s no other way to frame this,” Republican strategist Amanda Carpenter told CNN, where she is a contributor.For Clinton, her top aide’s emails offered an embarrassing window into both her political calculations in private and highlights from paid speeches—a sore spot for younger voters who spent months being told by Clinton’s one-time rival Bernie Sanders that she couldn’t be trusted. In one email, sent just before Iowa’s lead-off caucuses this year, the top communications aides were brought up to speed on what Clinton had said behind closed doors. The worst possible headlines? “Clinton admits she is out of touch,” “Clinton suggests she is a moderate” and “Clinton says you need to have a private and public position on policy.”Another potential pickle is this headline: “Clinton is aware of security concerns around BlackBerries.” Republicans are obsessed with Clinton’s use of a private email server as Secretary of State, and anything involving email is likely to overshadow any of Trump’s woes in the echo chamber of conservative Twitter.Yet, as a whole, Trump’s video was more damning. Here was the candidate, on tape, engaging in what Trump himself would later call “locker-room banter” laughing about trying to bed a married woman, describing women’s appearance in crass terms and popping breath mints in case he could woo an actress, just months after his own wedding. There was no excuse for the behavior, and Republicans were not rushing to provide one.Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who has tried to guide Trump to more respectable ground, released a statement: “No woman should ever be described in these terms or talked about in this manner. Ever.” The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, tweeted that “such vile degradations demean our wives and daughters and corrupt America’s face to the world.” Sen. Mark Kirk or Illinois called Trump “a malignant clown.” Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire called the remarks”totally inappropriate and offensive.” Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona said “America deserves far better” than Trump. Trump’s vanquished rival for the GOP nomination Jeb Bush said “no apology can excuse away Donald Trump’s reprehensible comments degrading women.”Trump loyalists merely said Clinton was behind the release of Trump’s video. “They did their opposition research. This is what they had,” former Rep. Michele Bachmann told MSNBC. “She has to change the narrative.” Pressed by host Chris Matthews, Bachmann said she had no evidence to back up her claim. Faith and Freedom Coalition Chairman Ralph Reed told CNN that abortion and the economy would keep Trump’s supporters firmly in their camp. “A 10-year-old tape of a private conversation with a TV talk show host ranks pretty low on their hierarchy of their concerns,” he said.That thinking might help some of Trump’s backers to justify their continued support. After all, Hillary Clinton is hardly a beloved figure after decades in public life, and antipathy runs deep in conservative circles. The release of her campaign chairman’s stolen emails will give her critics yet more fodder.But there’s a fundamental difference between aides deliberating which joke to use in a speech and the candidate himself using foul language to talk about unwanted sexual advances. If Friday night’s competing and unexpected releases are a preview of what voters should anticipate for the next month, it will be a very long October.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,1448

Big Tippers: 10 Celebs Who’ve Left Generous Tips  Ellen DeGeneres Real Estate Portfolio  Ellen and wife de Rossi have made a name for themselves as real estate magnates. The couple has a knack for purchasing swanky properties and unloading them to fellow celebrities. For example, they became landlord to musician Nick Jonas in 2015, renting one of their many homes to the 24-year-old.  The couple purchased a mid-century modern Los Angeles mansion in January 2014 for nearly $40 million and promptly sold it to Sean Parker six months later for $55 million. Previously, in May 2012, they sold their 15,000 sq. ft. Beverly Hills compound to Ryan Seacrest for $36.5 million. Ellen and Portia also purchased Brad Pitt’s former Malibu bachelor pad in 2011 for $12 million and sold it to cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson in 2012 for $13 million.  In March 2006 — prior to her marriage to de Rossi — Ellen sold a home in Hollywood Hills, Calif. to Will Ferrell for $9 million.

Instead, it was the symbol of the Video Music Awards: the Moon Person.  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Getty Images Michael Loccisano  Moon Person might be a new term to people who have watched the VMAs for years, and that's because for many years it used to be the Moonman. The trophy got a gender-neutral makeover before last year's awards ceremony.  “Why should it be a man?” Chris McCarthy, president of MTV, told the New York Times in 2017. “It could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist.” The decision also came around the same time the MTV Movie and TV awards stopped separating their acting categories by gender.  The Moonman trophy has been around since the start of the VMAs. When the network started in 1981, it launched with footage of Apollo 11 blasting off into space, and an astronaut planting a flag with the MTV logo on the moon's surface. “Ladies and gentlemen, rock and roll,"" a voiceover noted, and the rest was history. That footage played every hour on MTV for the first five years of the network's history.  MTV's new gender neutrality reflects the music industry's push for LGBTQ representation and gender equality. And that was already seen in the early awards handed out Monday night. The winner for Push Artist of the Year, Hayley Kiyoko, shouted out women like her looking to make it in music.

While Demi recently revealed the personal experiences that inspired the track “Daddy Issues,” she remains tight-lipped on the meaning of “Ruin the Friendship.” During an appearance on The Ellen DeGenres Show , Ellen tried her best to get Demi to confirm fan speculation that the track is about Nick Jonas .  “Supposedly there’s a song about Nick Jonas in here and because you claim to be so honest, I feel like you should be honest with that answer,” Ellen said. Demi responded to the question with a laugh and then said, “you know, something that I always keep to myself is who I write my songs about.”  Questions from fans about the song’s subject date back earlier this year. Initially, with only the track’s title to go on, fans wondered whether the track could be about one of the Jonas Brothers or Selena Gomez. Only recently did we seem to get more in the way of answers. Following an interview with Demi, Noisey pointed out that the track contains a reference to cigar smoking, a habit notably loved by Nick.  Demi also shared in her interview with Noisey that the track was inspired by frustration with a certain situation.  ""And I was like, 'You know what, I'm just going to write about it.' And so I did, and sent [the songs] to that person, and that was... interesting,"" she continued. ""Any time you send a song about the person, to the person, it's ballsy. It's like, 'Hey! Here's my feelings for you!' … They knew [about my feelings], but neither of us had acknowledged [them] before. And then it turned out that person had written a song about me, and we exchanged songs.”  Fans may never know the true meaning behind the song, but with Demi’s upcoming YouTube documentary * Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated* set to debut on October 17, maybe we’ll get another clue.

Downey was joined by a former Russian spy (Scarlett Johansson), a God of Thunder (Chris Hemsworth), and one who “fought in World War II,” (Chris Evans).  In comes Chris Pratt, claiming Star-Lord as “the greatest to ever walk the Earth, by far.” Anthony Mackie and Benedict Cumberbatch sang their own introductions — a falcon and a magic doctor, respectively — while Chadwick Boseman kept it sweet and simple, singing, “Wakanda Forever.”  “So then one day all the heroes were assembled, to fight a villain who packed much more than a punch,” the cast chorused. “And this group was labeled the Avengers, that’s the way we all became the Marvel Bunch.”  The super crew got a last minute addition from the one and only Loki (Tom Hiddleston), who punctuated the song with a signature “Hello, brother,” thrown Hemsworth’s way. “Shut up!” Hemsworth pitched back from his own Brady Bunch box.

On Monday, the Dancing With the Stars pro — who missed last week’s show — put on his dancing shoes to compete with partner Vanessa Lachey in a routine commemorating her most memorable year.  When the celebrity and pro dancer couples were introduced at the top of the show, audiences saw Chmerkovskiy return with Lachey.  Last week, DWTS co-host Erin Andrews informed viewers that Chmerkovskiy’s absence was due to “a personal issue,” but sources told PEOPLE that the DWTS pro, 37, and Lachey, 36, had been “bickering” since the beginning of the competition and that he chose to sit out from rehearsals and the live show due to a clash between their “big personalities.”  But on Wednesday, Chmerkovskiy apologized to Lachey for his absence, which left his partner to perform with first-time pro Alan Bersten.  “As you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues. I take full responsibility for my absence. And want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!” the father of one wrote.

You invest so much time-wise, and you just want them to be the best and get the best results possible at the end of the day on the Monday night. But it is difficult to deal with life, stresses, rehearsals and then show time and everything that goes along with that,” she added.  Rob Latour/Variety/REX/Shutterstock  While this isn’t the first time Chmerkovskiy has been rumored to clash with his DWTS counterpart — in 2015 he told The Real that his season 13 partner, soccer star Hope Solo, is “literally the only person that I could dislike from my past, present or future” — an insider insisted that he and Lachey are a unified pair.

Actress and former Fox News commentator Stacey Dash will withdraw from her congressional race just one month after filing the necessary paperwork to run as a Republican in California's 44th District.  Insiders told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday that her decision was partially based on fear she had for the safety of her family.  ""There were too many threats against her and her family. It was overwhelming,"" said one person close to her campaign.  Dash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.  In 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to ""be masculine"" and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a ""tyranny by the minority.""  Dash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the ""new director"" of the Academy's ""minority outreach program.""  In a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her ""goal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.""  Dash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state's 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California's 43rd District.  ""After much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,"" Dash said in her statement. ""I believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.""  She added that she knows her ""political positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable.""",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,490

I don’t want to disrespect you, but I’ve known for almost ten years. What’s up?'” he recalls. “She started laughing and she said, ‘I’m always going to be Meg.

Martin says there were just five people around while prepping Meghan for her walk down the aisle: the bride, himself, hair stylist Serge Normant, dress designer Clare Waight Keller and Meghan’s mom Doria Ragland, who Martin said was “in good spirits.” The atmosphere was very relaxed, partly thanks to Meghan playing “1950s, chilled music” via Spotify.  “She didn’t seem nervous. She was very cool, she was regular Meghan,” the makeup artist shares. “I think we were nervous, but we didn’t want to make her nervous so it was very chilled. Of course, brides have nerves, but if we didn’t put so much expectation on it, it wouldn’t have made her nervous. It was very even, very easy.”  Martin added that the bride stayed off her phone as they caught up by talking about mutual friends.  Despite all their beauty work, putting on the wedding dress really made the moment feel real.  “It was all so easy. It didn’t hit us that she was getting married until she got the dress on,” Martin said.  He added, “It was so beautiful and so architectural, and when she put it on it was like a glove. It was so easy. The spectacle of the veil and the crown and it was, ‘Oh my goodness, this is really happening.’ ”  RELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan’s Love Story  That feeling intensified when they arrived at Windsor Castle.  “Nothing really hit any of us until we got there and we saw the people and the magnitude of everything,” he said. “The last thing we said to each other was, ‘We’ll see you on the other side.’ ”  Meghan Markle Brian Lawless - WPA Pool/Getty  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Mark R.

456f52e0-a46a-4eaf-aba1-c803bf839eda,"Ben Margot/Associated Press  Cleveland Cavaliers center Tristan Thompson has avoided a suspension for Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals following his actions near the end of Game 1 on Thursday night.  The league announced on Friday, via Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel, Thompson has been fined $25,000, while his flagrant-2 foul has been downgraded to a flagrant-1.  Thompson was ejected with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime of Golden State's 124-114 victory after the referee deemed he threw an elbow at Warriors guard Shaun Livingston. He was assessed a flagrant-2 on the play.  Instead of leaving the court and going to the locker room, however, Thompson was at the center of a scrum during which he shoved the basketball in the face of Warriors forward Draymond Green.  When asked what led tempers to flare, Thompson said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took an unnecessary shot (NSFW language):  That confrontation caught the eye of Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley:  Thompson had a quiet game to open the series. The 6'9"", 238-pound big man posted just two points on 1-of-4 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. He recorded a plus/minus of minus-nine in 20 minutes.  Although he did not make an impact in Game 1, Thompson may be a key to victory for Cleveland. When the Cavs won their first-ever championship in 2016, Thompson was a force in the paint, averaging 10.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in the Finals.  The on-court altercation could have led to the suspension of multiple Cavaliers. Like Thompson, Kevin Love also avoided a ban for his Game 1 actions. Love was not checked into the game at the time of the skirmish, but he found himself on the court at the time of the pushing and shoving, though he quickly made his way back to the sideline.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,339

A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Politifacts,357
812e918d-6ed4-4753-9d3d-c55a5fb17cb7,"Bell began a romantic relationship with fellow actor Dax Shepard in 2007. The pair announced in 2012 that they were expecting a child together. The coupled welcomed daughter, Lincoln Bell Shepard, in March 2013 and married in October of the same year. In December 2014, they welcomed a second daughter, Delta Bell Shepard.  Born in Michigan in 1980, Kristen Bell studied musical theater at New York University and made her Broadway debut while still a student. In 2002 she moved to Los Angeles and began appearing on TV. Film roles soon followed. In 2004 Bell landed her breakout role, the title character on the TV series Veronica Mars. This led to more roles in films, including the hit comedies Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Couples Retreat and Get Him to the Greek.  Movies, TV and Theatre Roles  'American Dreams,' 'Everwood,' 'Spartan,' 'Deadwood'  In 2002 Bell's career got a jolt when she was cast in a Broadway production of Arthur Miller's The Crucible, which starred Laura Linney and Liam Neeson. Soon after, she moved to Los Angeles from Michigan and immediately landed a guest role on the hard-hitting crime show The Shield as the girlfriend of a gang member. With her career starting to roll, Bell soon appeared on NBC's American Dreams and the WB Network's Everwood and in TV-movies. In 2004 Bell was in David Mamet's Spartan and had a recurring role on HBO's hugely popular drama Deadwood. But for another reason, 2004 would be the year that would change Bell's life: She landed the lead role on the new TV show Veronica Mars, which would run for 64 episodes and draw a rabid cult following.  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website  'Veronica Mars'  Over the course of the show's four seasons, Bell was nominated for several awards and took home the Saturn Award for Best Actress on Television in 2006. The success of Veronica Mars led Bell to film parts, and a year into the series she reprised her role in Reefer Madness: The Movie Musical in a Showtime adaptation, following that with roles in small films such as Deepwater (2005), Fifty Pills (2006) and Pulse (2006). (To boot, in 2006 PETA named Bell the World's Sexiest Vegetarian and Maxim added her to a plethora of ""sexiest"" lists as well.)  'Gossip Girl,' 'Heroes'  While keeping busy with films, Bell managed to find even more television success in 2007 (the year Veronica Mars came to an end) when she took on narration duties on Gossip Girl and joined the hit show Heroes.  'Forgetting Sarah Marshall,' 'Couples Retreat'  Set on doing it all, in 2008 Bell hit movie theaters with her first major box-office success: the romantic comedy Forgetting Sarah Marshall, in which she played the title role (a role she reprised in a 2010 sequel of sorts, Get Him to the Greek). She followed Sarah Marshall with Fan Boys (2009), a small, well-received comedy, and Couples Retreat (2009), another comedy, this one co-starring Vince Vaughn, Jon Favreau and Kristin Davis. Also in 2009, Bell took on voiceover work in the family film Astro Boy, and 2010 saw her appear in the romantic comedy When in Rome.  'House of Lies,' 'The Boss,' 'The Good Place,' 'Bad Moms'  Since 2010, Bell has appeared in more than a dozen films and on several TV shows, and has lent her voice to the Assassin's Creed video games. She was also the female lead on the Showtime series House of Lies, which began its run in 2012 and ended in 2016.  In April 2016, Bell starred opposite Melissa McCarthy in the big screen comedy The Boss. She also stars in NBC's The Good Place, opposite Ted Danson. On the big screen, she starred in the comedy Bad Moms, opposite Mila Kunis. The film, although not receiving the greatest enthusiasm from critics, was a box office hit, which led to the sequel A Bad Mom's Christmas (2017).  Other films Bell has starred in include: The Disaster Artist (2017), CHiPs (2017), How to Be a Latin Lover (2017), and Netflix's Like Father (2018).",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,820
7950229e-b48b-4df5-85cf-562c23df389d,"Amanda Knox has revealed she is still haunted by her Foxy Knoxy nickname years after her infamous murder trial as she launches a new show in which she interviews other 'vilified' women like Mischa Barton and Amber Rose.  Knox, the American exchange student convicted and later cleared of a murder in Italy, was dubbed 'Foxy Knoxy' when she became a global tabloid sensation during her 2009 trial.  Her sexuality came under heavy scrutiny during the trial with prosecutors alleging that Knox and her Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, killed her roommate Meredith Kercher in a drug-fueled sex game gone wrong.  Knox, now 30, was referred to at the time as a 'sex-mad American party girl' and an 'evil temptress'.  Amanda Knox is launching a new show for Vice in which she interviews women, including Mischa Barton, (pictured above) who have been vilified or shamed because of their sexuality  Knox has revealed she is still haunted by the Foxy Knoxy nickname and told GMA on Wednesday that it often makes her feel like she is living a double life  'I could have been the kinkiest person in the world it and it shouldn't have mattered because it has nothing to do with the evidence of the case,' Knox told Newsweek.  'The fact that I was accused of orchestrating a rape game - it was so absurd.  'The prosecutors and police looked at me and talked about me like I reeked of sex, that I was the weird, odd one out.  'They took that to mean I was somehow guilty of something, instead of checking their judgment and letting the evidence speak.'  In an interview with Good Morning America on Wednesday, Knox said her Foxy Knoxy nickname often made it feel like she was living a double life.  'I'm in a limbo space where Amanda Knox a real person exists and Foxy Knoxy an idea of a person exists,' she said.  'I'm constantly having to juggle how someone is interacting with me based on that two-dimensional version of me that has been in the public's imagination for so long.  Knox wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports. One of the women she interviews is model Amber Rose (above) who has publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'  Knox's show The Scarlet Letter Reports premiere's on Facebook Watch on Wednesday. Pictured above is a behind the scenes look at her interview with Mischa Barton  Knox (right on right) and Barton (left) filmed a segment of the show speaking about how the OC actress filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her  'I'm not alone in that. As soon as you've been labelled something, as soon as you've been given that catchy salacious nickname, the real you is gone and you are absorbed into this template character.'  Knox now wants to draw attention to other women who have been shamed or vilified because of their sexuality with her new show The Scarlet Letter Reports.  The show, which is for Vice's Broadly and will be broadcast on Facebook Watch, includes Knox's interviews with women including Mischa Barton, Amber Rose and Brett Rossi.  Barton filed a lawsuit against an ex-boyfriend who allegedly tried to leak a sex tape of her, while Rose has previously publicly shared her own experiences with 's**t-shaming'.  'In all cases of wrongful conviction, you see people who fall victim to our impulse to vilify, scapegoat and punish,' Knox said on GMA.  'In my case, my vilification came through the lens of our society's impulse to vilify women and female sexuality.  'Coming home from that, I've seen how that same vilification process happens towards other women and that's what this show is all about - bringing back compassion and context to journalism without somehow losing the objectivity or integrity of journalism.'  Knox, above in 2007, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her British roommate  Knox was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life. She has been dating her author boyfriend Christopher Robinson since 2015  Knox said she came up for the idea for her new show before the #MeToo movement started in October 2017 when scores of women came forward with accusations of sexual harassment and rape.  'It's an incredible time to be a woman. We're redefining what it means. I'm amazed and so grateful to be a part of it. I never thought I would be here,' Knox told Newsweek.  'Not too long ago, I thought I would be spending the best decades behind bars for something I didn't do.'  Knox, a student from Seattle, spent four years in an Italian prison after being convicted alongside her then-boyfriend in the 2007 stabbing death of her roommate, British student Meredith Kercher.  She was exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015 and then returned to Seattle to rebuild her life.  Knox started dating and then got engaged to musician Colin Sutherland in 2015.  The couple split sometime that year and Knox started dating Seattle poet and author Christopher Robinson in late 2015.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,990
0e5e5fa2-875d-439f-95ef-98b79d1d1cd6,"A Californian artist has accused Roman Polanski of sexually assaulting her when she was 10 years old, the fifth such allegation of abuse made against the director.  Marianne Barnard has told the Sun that she was molested by Polanski in 1975, two years before the director fled the US after pleading guilty to statutory rape. The artist claims that the incident took place at a beach in California following a photoshoot where the director asked her to pose naked.  “At first I had the understanding I was just going to the beach with my mom. We were there for a little while by ourselves and then he was there,” Barnard said. “And she explained that this man wanted to take pictures of me in this fur coat. I thought it was to go into a magazine or something.”  Barnard says that Polanski initially took photos of her wearing a fur coat and a bikini but later asked her to pose naked. “At some point I realised my mom had gone. I don’t know where she went and I didn’t really register her leaving but she was no longer there. Then he molested me,” she added.  Barnard, who says she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and claustrophobia as a result of her experiences, felt emboldened to come forward following the scandal surrounding disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein, who denies allegations of criminal sexual harassment, rape and sexual assault made against him by more than 50 women.    “I felt terribly conflicted that I have been silent all this time and all these women are bravely coming forward and I thought to myself I can’t in good conscience knowing what I know – and having gone through what I’ve gone through – not speak out,” Barnard said. “Even though it puts me in a very bad … position with my mom and Polanski and other people who are involved, I can’t be silent any more.”  Barnard has made an official report with the Los Angeles Police Department’s Robbery-Homicide Division (RHD) sex crimes unit about the incident and has also launched a petition calling on the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to revoke Polanski’s membership, as they have done with Weinstein.  Speaking via his agent, Polanski denied the claims. “I entirely reject the unfounded allegations of Mme. Barnard, of whom I have no knowledge,” the director said.  Polanski remains a fugitive from justice after leaving the US shortly before he was due to stand trial for the sexual assault of a minor in 1977. The director had admitted to unlawful sexual intercourse with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer in pre-trial custody, but fled the country, fearing that a plea bargain he had made with prosecutors would be overruled. In June, a superior court judge rejected a request to dismiss the case by Geimer, who says she has forgiven Polanski and wants the incident put to rest “as an act of mercy to myself and my family”.    Since Geimer’s allegations, the director has faced allegations of sexual assault by three additional women. In 2010, British actor Charlotte Lewis said that Polanski had “forced himself” on her while she was auditioning for a role in Paris in 1983, while this year, two more women have come forward with their own accounts of alleged assault at the hands of the director.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,630

e43b1773-f55f-4ac5-9e0f-7f7cc53d81be,"You've got baby or dog poop on your favorite couch, shirt, rug -- anything and everything. Is it ruined? No. Here's your poop cleaning guide.  This is one of those things you never expected to Google: ""How to remove poop from ____[fill in the blank]___."" That's because when you imagined having a baby or a pet in your life, you probably didn't envision the very real presence of bodily functions and their propensity to, um, stain things .    But, as any parent or babysitter or dog sitter can attest, diapers have a way of leaking and pets have a way of having accidents. So it's not far fetched to suppose that you may someday be confronted by the need to clean poop out of carpeting or off of your favorite work shirt. And you need to know how to clean these things properly. (Hence the frantic Googling.)    Getting rid of poop isn't fun, but it's not hard, either. (Unless the poop isn't hard ... then it's hard. Breastfed-baby poop, anyone?)    Here's what to do:    Start With the Basics  Removing poop usually involves a two-step process:    1. Cleaning  2. Sanitizing or disinfecting    Cleaning comes first because it's hard to disinfect something that hasn't been cleaned properly. This means getting rid of the bulk of the poop -- whatever you can scrape off or otherwise remove -- and washing the item or surface so that you can begin disinfecting (killing the germs).    But, should you wash the item with warm water or cold water? Depends. If it's a fabric that could potentially be stained, initially wash with cold water to avoid setting the stain. Warm water can be used if you're not worried about a permanent stain.    To quickly clean your basic fabric items (like a stained onesie that has those tell-tale yellow leaks streaking from the seams of the diaper area) follow these steps:    Remove as much of the poop as you can (and work as quickly as possible; cleaning immediately can minimize the potential for staining)  Rinse or soak with cold water (blotting helps)  Wash in the washing machine using hot water, an enzyme-based cleaner (if suitable for the fabric), and bleach or vinegar (if suitable for the fabric).    But What If It's Not Just a Stained Onesie?  Baby and pet poop can affect any manner of objects from upholstery and carpeting to bedding, silk items, wool sweaters, your baby's toys, your dog's bed and on and on and on...The precise methods of cleaning will depend on the object that's involved, so try these tricks for specific materials:  Cotton  Remember that onesie you washed in cold water and then laundered? Maybe it's still stained. (In fact, it probably is. That's just part of life.) But don't worry! You have one of the world's best stain-removing tools at your disposal: the sun. Never underestimate the power of sunshine. While its disinfectant properties are not as effective as bleach or other disinfectant products, sunshine does have an amazing ability to effectively remove poop stains from clothing or bedding.

08b84c5c-5926-4526-bb03-b76e0fc781b7,"Kylie Jenner was first spotted with rapper Travis Scott in April 2017 after splitting from her on-again, off-again boyfriend Tyga.  Since first linking up, the couple’s whirlwind romance has included low-key dates, flashy birthday presents and quality time with the KarJenner crew — Scott even got the famous family’s seal of approval. And now, the couple are parents to daughter Stormi.  In honor of the couple’s joint GQ cover, we’re taking a look back at the pair’s relationship.  FIRST SPOTTED TOGETHER AT COACHELLA — APRIL 2017  During an off phase of Jenner’s relationship with Tyga, the reality star was spotted getting cozy with Scott at a Coachella party. “Travis and Kylie have been friends for a while and they all hang out,” a source told PEOPLE at the time. “When she and Tyga are having drama, she tries to make him jealous by hanging out with other guys.”  But it turns out Scott has been close with the Jenner sisters for quite some time: He even performed at Kendall Jenner’s star-studded 21st birthday bash in November 2016.  PACKING ON PDA — APRIL 2017  Bob Levey/Getty  A few weeks after hanging out at Coachella together, the couple seemed to make their love official by getting cuddly at an NBA playoff game in Houston, Texas.  According to an onlooker at the Houston Rockets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder game — where Scott performed before tip-off — the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and the hip-hop artist were spotted holding hands and “definitely looked like a couple.”  “During his performance, Kylie was hiding in the Rockets’ courtside club anxiously waiting for him to come back to her. Once he got back, they definitely looked like a couple, cuddled up next to each other among her friends,” said the onlooker, who attended the game and spotted Jenner kissing Scott’s neck.  A SHOW OF SUPPORT — APRIL 2017  Jenner headed to Bentley University outside Boston to support her beau. Located just outside Boston in the town of Waltham, Bentley was celebrating their annual Spring Day, which always included a big a concert on campus featuring Scott.  Tonight, @KylieJenner was in Waltham with Travis Scott, who headlined Bentley University #SpringDay. pic.twitter.com/8BQvgwCWMP — Only In Boston (@OnlyInBOS) April 30, 2017  Later, the couple headed to Boston’s Theater District where Scott made an appearance at Bijou nightclub  “He was definitely looking for something intimate,” one club-goer told PEOPLE. “They also talked a lot. Like, actually having a conversation. They were dancing at the club. They were definitely super into each other. He didn’t really perform, he just showed up and partied. They left in the same car too.”  GETTING HANDSY — JUNE 2017  GAMR / BACKGRID  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star stopped by the rapper’s Los Angeles home, where the duo were spotted getting handsy with one another. Scott was spotted grabbing the bum of the then-19-year-old Kylie Cosmetics founder, who sported a black sweatshirt, with a red rose-embroidered hoodie, and fitted black leggings. At one point during their romantic embrace, Scott lifted up the reality star into the air as they snuggled up in front of the black Cadillac SUV outside of his residence.  MATCHING INK — JUNE 2017  Kylie Jenner Snapchat  Jenner and Scott attended Khloé Kardashian‘s 33rd birthday party at TAO in Los Angeles, where they were “all over each other,” said the source.  “They recently got matching butterfly tattoos on their ankles that they were showing off to their friends and family,” the insider added. “They were super affectionate and Travis was constantly kissing Kylie on the cheek and whispering in her ear. Their relationship seems to be getting stronger and they’re closer than ever.”  Jenner also went on to get an ankle tattoo (in tribute to ex Tyga) redone — transforming what once was a lowercase “t” to a lowercase “la.”  MATCHING RINGS — JUNE 2017  CPR/Premiere/BACKGRID  First matching tattoos, now this?! Jenner and Scott seemed quite determined to make their love known, and their latest romantic display came in the form of matching rings. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star and the rapper were spotted out in Los Angeles, both wearing sparkling bands on their ring fingers.

BIRTHDAY BLING — AUGUST 2017  BACKGRID  On her 20th birthday in August, the Life of Kylie star enjoyed a low-key family celebration at home before hitting a movie theater with Scott. But what fans were quick to point out was the fact that Jenner was sporting some new bling — a very sparkly new diamond necklace, which was a birthday gift from her rapper-boyfriend.  SEAL OF APPROVAL — AUGUST 2017  INSTARimages.com  RELATED PHOTOS: All the Outfits Kylie Jenner Has Worn to Hide Her Pregnancy  Though Jenner and Scott’s relationship was still rather new at the time, her family was definitely on board with the romance: A source told PEOPLE in August that the KarJenner crew “loves Travis.”  “Kylie and Travis are doing great,” said the source. “There’s no drama with Travis. He’s a cool guy.” “He treats Kylie with a lot of respect and love,” added the source. “Kylie is very happy.”  BABY ON BOARD — SEPTEMBER 2017  In September, multiple sources told PEOPLE the Kylie Lip Kit creator was pregnant with her first child. “They started telling friends a few weeks ago,” said the source. “The family has known for quite some time. She is really excited and so is Travis.” Another source close to the family told PEOPLE: “It is an unexpected but completely amazing turn of events that she could not be more excited or thrilled about.”  NEW PARENTS — FEBRUARY 2018  After months of keeping fans in the dark, Jenner confirmed pregnancy rumors and announced she and boyfriend Scott had welcomed their first child, daughter Stormi Webster, together on Feb. 1.  “After the baby was born, Kylie was relieved that the moment was finally here,” a source told PEOPLE. And even though the delivery room was “a bit chaotic with all the family and friends around,” the source added that the 20-year-old “was overwhelmed in a good way — overwhelmed with the joy, love and support everyone was giving to her and Travis.”  HAPPY TIMES — FEBRUARY 2018  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star became a first-time mom on Feb. 1 when she welcomed daughter Stormi with her rapper boyfriend Travis Scott, who has his own place but is co-parenting with Jenner. “Despite being new parents, Kylie and Travis are still in a new relationship too.

When he wants to work, Kylie is supportive.” The source added that the Kylie Lip Kit creator “has everything she needs right now and seems very happy.”  HOT WHEELS — MARCH 2018  Kylie Jenner/Instagram  Showing off two sleek and shiny new cars, Jenner hinted that the vehicles were meant for her and her boyfriend when she captioned the shot, “mom and dad.” While one of the vehicles is a bright orange Lamborghini Aventador, the other appears to be a matching model in a darker hue.  BIRTHDAY BOY — APRIL 2018  Kylie Jenner/Instagram  To celebrate boyfriend Travis Scott’s 26th birthday on April 30, Jenner had a private party at Six Flags Magic Mountain in Los Angeles, which was attended by her sisters Kendall Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian West and her husband Kanye West. “Rented out six flags for baby’s birthday,” she wrote alongside a video of the start of one of the night’s many roller coaster rides on her Instagram Story. “They’ve never been.”  COVER STARS — JULY 2018  Ronald Martinez/Getty  Gracing the cover of GQ’s August issue, Jenner and her boyfriend are opening up about how they first met, how their lives have changed since they welcomed daughter Stormi — and whether they’re worried about the so-called “Kardashian curse,” the belief that all the men who date a member of the famous family ultimately end up derailing.  “I don’t even be looking at motherf—ers,” he told the magazine. “I don’t be looking at s—. Kylie actually likes me for me. Man, hell nah. Nervous for what? I’m on my own island. So hey, come over there to Astroworld. I’m not into all the other s—. I don’t get involved. I’m over here.

First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there’s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.  According to Naughty Gossip reports:  “Beyoncé likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,” sources tell Straight Shuter. “You can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.”  This story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyoncé is private. THAT doesn’t take an exclusive source to figure out.  Silent birth is a real thing though – something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don’t really see her doing a silent birth.  Speaking of Bey’s love of music… Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.  The 43-year-old daughter of legendary beauty icon Vidal Sassoon announced the news on her Facebook page on Wednesday, telling fans that she’s feels “free & ALIVE to BE the REAL ME that was not shown to the #bravo world of viewers.”  “I truly am #grateful for the experience & huge life lessons I was up against,” she wrote, adding on Twitter that her exit was the “best news EVER!” and that RHOBH was “just a moment in my journey.”  She hashtagged the tweets “#freedom.”  Paul Archuleta/WireImage  Eden had a tough road on RHOBH, where she debuted in season 7 as a friend of Housewife Lisa Rinna.  She opened up early on about her sobriety and the passing of her sister Catya, who died of an overdose in 2002 when she was just 34. But Eden perhaps got a little too personal when she compared he relationship with her sister to the bond between Kyle Richards and her recovering addict sister Kim Richards — causing tension and headed arguments between the three.  RELATED VIDEO: What Eden Sassoon Remembers Most from Tuff Turf Set with Kim Richards & Sister Catya  Things got worse when Rinna told Eden that Kyle was an “enabler” and that Kim was “close to death” — information that propelled Eden into trying to help Kim and Kyle (and, perhaps unfairly, only drove her further away from the group).  By season’s end, Eden had turned on Rinna, telling her, “I’ve given you so much of my time, my energy — my f—ing heart, you bitch! … It’s not okay for you to treat me the way that you do. It’s not okay for you to walk all over me and use me as your scapegoat.

And while some may feel their departure from reality TV is the end, Eden sees it as a fresh start.  “Remember an END is just a NEW BEGINNING…I will be in full force with #love #hugs #truth and #compassion which are all things that make me shine,” she wrote on Facebook. “So if you can’t handle my light .. please go be dim someplace else.”  “Grateful for season 7 #RHOBH,” she added on Twitter. “It brought me beautiful love from so many that I now have for life.

65b0cc27-8eb2-4457-be1a-df6c4e47544e,"A Hollywood heartthrob and confirmed bachelor falls for a brilliant, humanitarian lawyer, and eventually, the two create the picture perfect family. It's the sort of love story you'd expect to see in a filmland fairytale, and yet somehow in just five short years it's become the real life romance of Amal and George Clooney.  Here's the story of how the dedicated duo met, fell in love, and built a life together.  Getty Images  They met through a friend—at George's home.  People say that true love finds its way to you, but the adage is rarely as literal as it turned out to be for George and Amal. The couple met at the actor's Lake Como home in July of 2013, when a mutual friend stopped by while en route to Cannes with Amal in tow. In an equally fateful twist, the star's parents were also visiting him at the time, so Amal was introduced to the Clooney family on the same day she met her now husband.  George, then 52, had cultivated a reputation as one of Hollywood's most eligible bachelors with a dating history including celebs like Kelly Preston and Stacy Keibler, but there was clearly something special about his connection with the renowned human rights lawyer. “I got a call from my agent who said, 'I met this woman who is coming to your house, who you’re going to marry,'” George said during an appearance on My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman. “It really worked out that way.”  The two hit it off immediately, corresponding for several weeks before the romance truly blossomed. “She sent some pictures from when she was here, and we were writing each other, emailing, talking, mostly about what was going on in each other’s lives,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “And over a period of time it became clear we were more than just friends.”  Getty Images  Their first date was historic.  The duo's first official date came in October 2013 when George invited Amal, who was living in London, to come visit him at the famed Abbey Road Studios (best known as a recording home for The Beatles) while he supervised the score for his 2014 film The Monuments Men. ""That was a good first date,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter, adding: ""And pretty quickly, things escalated once I was in London.""  Getty Images  Amal was almost too shocked to say 'yes' when George proposed.  ""She'd had a conversation with her parents, who were like, 'What are George's intentions?' And she was saying, 'Take it easy. We've been going out for six months,'"" George explained. All the while he was preparing for the big moment.  After months of planning—down to a playlist of music to accompany the proposal—George invited Amal to a homecooked dinner on April 28, 2014, hiding the 7-carat engagement ring inside of a lighter box that Amal used to light the candlelit table. ""I did all the stuff, got down on my knee and did all the things you're supposed to do,"" the actor said. ""I was waiting for this song, 'Why Shouldn't I?' 'Why shouldn't I take a chance when romance passes by? / Why shouldn't I know of love?' It's a really good song about why can't I be in love? And it played, and she's like, 'Holy shit!' And she just kept staring at the ring, going, 'Oh, my God.' It was 20 minutes of me on my knee, waiting for her to say yes, because she was so shocked.""  Getty Images  They married in an intimate Venetian ceremony.  After a short engagement the couple tied the knot in September 2014, just shy of a year after their first date. ""We didn't tell anybody else that we were going to do it,"" Clooney recalled to The Hollywood Reporter, ""but eventually somebody figured it out. Oh, my God! Once people got wind of it, it became an event."" Surrounded by family (and a few famous friends, including Clooney's long-time collaborator Matt Damon, Cindy Crawford, and fellow celebrity couple John Krasinski and Emily Blunt) the couple wed in a private ceremony at the Aman Canal Grande luxury resort in Venice, Italy.  Getty Images  Children weren't part of their initial plan.  “It had never been part of my DNA,” George said, explaining his stance on fatherhood. “We didn’t plan on it. We never talked about it until after we were married, which is funny. There was an assumption that we didn’t want them. And then, after the wedding, we just felt we’d gotten very lucky, both of us, and we should share whatever good luck we’ve got. It would seem self-centered to just have that belong to us.”  When Amal became pregnant in 2016, the overjoyed couple got an additional surprise, in the form of twins. ""[The doctor performing the ultrasound] goes, 'Well, there's one.' And I said, 'Great.' And then he goes, 'And there's the second one.' And I was like, 'What?'"" Clooney told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We just sat there, staring at that piece of paper they give you, and I kept thinking there was a mistake."" But there was no mistake; in June of 2017, one month premature, Amal gave birth to twins Ella and Alexander.    Getty Images  They balance parenting with their demanding jobs.  Returning to her work representing refugees in September of 2017, Amal has managed to excel at the office and as a mom. ""She is sort of this remarkable human being and now mother which is something, I suppose, you should assume she would be wonderful at as well. But, when you see it in person, it makes you feel incredibly proud and also incredibly small,"" George told Letterman.  Coupled with George's creative work and the 2017 sale of his Casamigos tequila brand, the duo remain very busy, but make the time to dedicate to their children, traveling with them to some of the family's favorite spots around the globe.",real,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,1214

This casting news comes just two days after Bobby Moynihan shared he was departing after nine seasons on the late-night staple.  “Thank you SNL for 7 years of laughs, love and incredible memories,” she posted on Instagram. “It has been a dream come true.”  Bayer also posted an image of a sketch written by Colin Jost, saying “Thanks for this goodbye sketch at the table.”  Saturday night’s “SNL” hosted by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson with Katy Perry as musical guest will mark the final appearances for both Moynihan and Bayer.

af557476-8efb-4321-961f-6a44ea85a213,"The feud continues between these frenemies.  Days after Kim Zolciak-Biermann was accused by fellow Real Housewives of Atlanta star NeNe Leakes of being a “racist,” the mother of six has obtained legal counsel, PEOPLE confirms. (A rep for Leakes had no comment.)  Get push notifications with news, features and more.  “She put #KKK on the Instagram post. I’ve hired legal counsel at this point. It’s just that bad,” she told Larry King on Larry King Now Tuesday.  “It’s inappropriate. In this day and age, people are dying over racism,” said Zolciak-Biermann, who hasn’t seen Leakes since the feud ignited. “I’m on a show with all African-American women and I’m the only one that’s ever been on the show that’s Caucasian, so it’s the card that sometimes they play and it’s gross. And I won’t allow it.”  “I probably won’t shoot with her again,” she shared.  “I don’t take this lightly. It’s one thing like I said to kind of banter back and forth and have an opinion,” Zolciak-Biermann, 39, told E!’s Daily Pop on Tuesday. “This is far beyond just having an opinion.”  The reality star’s decision to hire legal advisors comes on the heels of a public feud that involves herself, her 20-year-old daughter Brielle Biermann and Leakes.  On Thursday, Leakes, 49, slammed Brielle over claims of “prejudice” after the mother-daughter pair visited Leakes’ home and allegedly found cockroaches. Leakes shared her response to an old video that showed Brielle in her bathroom with what appeared to be black bugs.  In addition, Leakes shared the recently resurfaced video of Brielle on her own Instagram account.  “@briellebiermann We don’t have roaches! If you found 1, u brought it with u or it fell outta yo funky p—-! Please know I will get You all the way together when you start f—ing with me and mine!” Leakes wrote in the comments section.  “Go somewhere and let the air outta those fake lips, fake titties and fake ass because you will never be @kylejenner Yo trashy mama should have taught you better! My home is Brand New but you guys were so jealous of it, you couldn’t even give a compliment. You had to stoop so low and be so disgusting #racisttrash,” she concluded.  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Slams Kim Zolciak-Bierman Over Daughter’s Snapchat Video, Calls RHOA Costar ‘Racist’  Also on Thursday, Brielle responded in the comment section of her own Instagram post after a follower accused her of calling Leakes a “black roach.”  “I’m not calling BLACK people roaches! I found a roach in NENEs home! not calling her a roach dumb f—. doesn’t matter if you’re black, white, hispanic, asian etc you can still have roaches in ur house if u don’t f—ing clean ur s—!!! #callorkinpls,” the eldest Biermann child wrote.  Then, Leakes responded in the comments of a separate Instagram account, calling the Biermann duo “racists.”  “Kim & her daughter oops whole family are racists! What her daughter did at my home, (which she nor kim were invited to so be clear abt that as well) was pure disgusting, racist, learned behavior etc,” Leakes wrote, adding, “children are NOT off limits when you allow your child to talk to adults any kind of way, post disrespectful things on social media and so on. Kim is a calculating bio polar racist with a horrible mouth, who uses black folks for her come up.”  Zolciak-Biermann told her side of the story to defend Brielle, saying RHOA fans and viewers will soon see the bug incident play out on the upcoming season.  “First off that video is a combination of 2 videos! I COMBINED THEM! Brielle posted the first video on snap unaware of the large bug in front of her when she was kneeling down .. until her DM’s blew up! She removed the video immediately!! I was filming as an INVITED guest at @neneleakes for RHOA!! Brielle was invited as well!” Zolciak-Biermann wrote on Instagram.  “Brielle went to the bathroom and saw several bugs and had sent ME the video on snap and NO ONE ELSE!!! We ARE filming a show, remember that, (RHOA) and Nene released this video herself! No one has EVER seen this video but RHOA! Nobody would have ever seen this video! Nene has said and done some things that are absolutely disgusting, however I will take the high road as you will see it on the show soon enough, but you WILL NOT make it seem as though my daughter did ANYTHING wrong! She never posted this video nor would she! As you see here I myself was not willing to send the video just for ratings for RHOA. END OF STORY,” Zolciak-Biermann concluded.  In a follow-up post, Zolciak-Biermann wrote a lengthy statement.  “It’s so sad and offensive that someone can stoop so low as to call someone a racist just because they are mad. Everyone in my life knows that I am far from racist and unfortunately NeNe Leaks has tried for the last 10 years to paint that picture because that’s her last resort. (It’s convenient that I’m not racist when we are getting along.),” she said.  “In a day and age where racism is very much alive and people are actually dying because of real racists, it’s heartbreaking that NeNe would cry wolf like this only because she’s upset. I think everyone including Nene needs to spend some time uplifting people insted of tearing them down. Nene should be embracing love instead of making up lies. There is absolutely no credibility to anything that she has said. I will NOT stand for these slanderous comments!”  WATCH: NeNe Leakes Returning to ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ for Season 10!  Later, Leakes responded to Zolciak-Biermann’s post with another statement of her own.  “Kim Zolciak is the one that sent the video to Cynthia, Sheree, Marlo, Porsha and Kandi while we were filming in Spain. Now she has the nerve to make a pitty post! No one from Kim’s household was invited to my white party. Kim came as Sheree’s plus 1. She is a huge lier,” Leakes wrote.  “All this season I have done nothing but try an be kind to her even when she said disrespectful things to me and broke glasses in my home. I STILL continue to be kind to her but this calculated video that was shot in my home during a time when we had no problems shows how low she will really go!

The late night host, who grew up and studied in the city, struggled to hide his emotion as he paid tribute to the victims and urged for stricter gun control on Monday’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” See stars’ reaction tweets below.  Kimmel went on, growing angrier as he disagreed with those who ignore gun violence. “I’ve been reading comments from people who say ‘This is terrible, but there’s nothing we could do about it.’ I disagree with that intensely. There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don’t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there’s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.”  And before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, “They should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.”  Among those commenting on the late night host’s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O’Donnell, who said, “Jimmy Kimmel is an American hero – [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.” Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, “A powerful call to action.

That's sugar from our candy mess from dylan's candy shop https://t.co/oICdPQVi8d — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 11, 2017  Image via Snapchat  For the record, Kim is indeed in NYC this week, and according to photos posted on TMZ she did take her daughter North to Dylan’s Candy Shop in Manhattan this Sunday.  This isn’t the first time a Kardashian has been involved in a social media related cocaine scandal. Kim’s sister Kendall Jenner, no stranger to scandals herself (see: the recent T-shirt fiasco, her Pepsi commercial), posted a photo to her Snapchat in July of last year of a tiny plastic bag with the caption: ""this is the cutest little ziploc baggie I have ever seen."" Many identified the “cute” baggie as the same kind of bag popularly used to store cocaine. Kendall deleted the snap soon afterwards.",fake,news article,human,pre-GPT,FakeNewsNet_Gossipcop,313

dd4994f9-25d4-455f-bde2-c9d0277f0d4a,"So Kim Kardashian is set to appear on Ellen today, which means she’ll be the first family member to finally let everyone know what’s up with Khloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson’s relationship. That is, if they even have one anymore.  To jog your memory, Khloé just gave birth to a baby girl named True and in the same week that happened, rumors of Tristan’s alleged affairs surfaced. Kim and other members of the Kardashian-Jenner family had flown out to Cleveland, Ohio to be by Khloé’s side when she gave birth, and Kim is graciously sharing what it’s been like ever since.  Advertisement - Continue Reading Below  In a sneak-peek released last week, Kim said it's not going that great for the youngest Kardashian sister.  In Kim’s interview with Ellen DeGeneres, Kim said, ""Like, I don’t even know how to describe it besides it’s just so f*cked up."" Indeed it is, Kim.  And in the full interview clip, Kim said Khloé is taking some time for herself and True and isn't making any hasty decisions about her and Tristan's relationship.  According to Kim, Khloé is currently alone in Cleveland to have time to bond with her baby and is still on the fence about whether or not she and Tristan will stay together.  ""You know, I think she’s not thinking of anything,"" Kim said. ""I think she just wants a clear head and just wants to be alone with her baby and figure that out and the family’s flown out there a few times.""  She went on to say, ""I think it must be so hard to have your heart broken and fall in love all in a day or two, all happening at the same time and I think she just needs some [space].""  Kim said her whole family is just trying to be supportive of Khloé.  ""We really were rooting for Khloé, and we still are. She's so strong and she's doing the best that she can. It's a really sad situation all over.""  The only thing she didn't talk about was if she ever liked Tristan.  When Ellen asked her about her opinion of Tristan, Kim danced around the question and threw some shade toward him.  ""I kind of made this rule with my brother, if there's a baby involved, I'm not going to talk. I'm going to keep it cute and keep it classy and not talk too bad. I'm going to try not to say anything so negative because one day True is going to see this.""  And there you have it folks, a prime example of if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all.
