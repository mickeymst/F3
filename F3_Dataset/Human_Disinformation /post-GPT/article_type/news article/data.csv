Conviction and Exoneration





In the early hours of April 20, 1989, the body of a woman barely clinging to life was discovered in Central Park. Assaulted and left for dead, the 28-year-old jogger, Trisha Meili, would survive grave injuries and a coma with no memory of the events. Within days of the attack, McCray, 15; Richardson, 14; Salaam, 15; Santana, 14; and Wise, 16, implicated themselves in Meili's rape and beating after hours of psychological pressure and aggressive interrogation at the hands of seasoned homicide detectives.
The police announced to a press hungry for sensational crime stories that the young men had been part of a gang of teenagers who were out ""wilding,"" assaulting joggers and bicyclists in Central Park that evening. The ensuing media frenzy was met with a public outcry for justice. The young men were tried as adults under New York laws of the day — and convicted, despite inconsistent and inaccurate confessions, DNA evidence that excluded them, and no eyewitness accounts that connected them to the victim.
On December 19, 2002, Justice Charles J. Tejada of the Supreme Court of the State of New York granted a motion to vacate the thirteen-year-old convections in the infamous case. He did so based on new evidence: a shocking confession from a serial rapist, Matias Reyes, and a positive DNA match to back it up. A year later, the men filed civil lawsuits against the City of New York, and the police officers and prosecutors who had worked toward their conviction. In 2014, they settled that civil case for $41 million dollars. Despite their exoneration, the police and prosecutors involved in the case maintain that they were guilty of the crime.

2950467b-4935-4b3d-9436-53b3b567ffd5,"On Aug. 1, 2022, we received mail from our readers asking us to find out if U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., had repeated a 1928 utterance by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler about Christianity. The original Hitler quote, which we authenticated previously , read, ""We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity. Our movement is Christian."" A meme that appeared in several public Facebook posts (and likely quite a few private postings as well) also attributed that statement to Greene , as if she were echoing Hitler's exact words. However, we found no record of Greene repeating Hitler's statement about Christianity. While it's true that Hitler said these words, we were unable to find any evidence that Greene ever repeated the quote. We looked to reporting from Salon and HuffPost . It appeared that the idea to add Greene to the Hitler meme was likely inspired after she was interviewed at the conservative Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit (SAS). The student event took place on July 23, 2022 in Tampa, Florida. The same date was mentioned in the meme under Greene's name. On or around July 23, Greene was interviewed by Tayler Hansen with the conservative Next News Network. A video of the interview was published on Twitter : During the interview, the following exchange took place, in which Greene called herself a ""Christian nationalist"": Hansen: What do you think is the primary focus of the GOP going into 2022? What should it be opposed to what is it? Greene: Oh wow. That's such a good question, because there's a lot of things it should be. I think Republicans really need to recognize the people they represent, ok? Their voters. Not the lobbyist donors. Not the corporate backs. Not those people. That's not who the Republican Party should represent. We need to be the party of nationalism. And I'm a Christian and I say it proudly: We should be Christian nationalists. And when Republicans learn to represent most of the people that vote for them, then we will be the party that continues to grow without having to chase down certain identities or chase down, you know, certain segments of people. We just need to represent Americans. And most Americans, no matter how they vote, really care about the same things, and I want to see Republicans actually do their job. That's what I want to see. In addition to the interview, Greene spoke onstage at the student event in Tampa about why she refers to herself as a ""nationalist."" At the 4:07 mark in the following YouTube video , Greene said, ""If you're a nationalist, that means you care about your country, which we should. Now, all of our tax dollars are hard-earned tax dollars, they should go towards our country, isn't that right?"" Greene added remarks at the 8:18 mark in the video about referring to herself specifically as a ""Christian nationalist"": I also call myself a Christian nationalist. And that's not a bad word. That's actually a good thing, right? And there's nothing wrong with leading with your faith, because we should lead with our faith, because if we're doing that then we're doing the right thing. Doesn't mean we're perfect. It just means we're doing the right thing, and I think that's what the Republican Party needs to be about. The Republican Party also needs to be the party that cares about the American worker, not the corporations. The ""Christian nationalist"" remarks from Greene led to backlash from Christian groups Faithful America and Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty , as well as colleagues in Congress . In sum, the meme's claim that Greene repeated the words Hitler uttered about Christianity in 1928 is false. Note: We reached out to Greene's office for comment about the meme but did not yet receive a response.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,761
22062f06-c4a6-42ac-bf94-842d39c53d41,"On March 27, 2023, claims began to spread on social media that the Nashville Covenant School shooting was a ""false flag."" Those claims are false. "" False flag "" conspiracy theories portray tragedies as orchestrated events aimed at advancing a political agenda. These false claims often spread in the aftermath of mass shootings, including the Sandy Hook and Uvalde school shootings. Typically, they characterize the victims of such crimes as hired ""crisis actors"" or unwitting pawns in an insidious plot to deceive the public. The Nashville Covenant School shooting, which left three students and three adults at the school dead, was no different. There have been several posts on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit asserting that the shooting was a false flag. One variant claims that the shooting clearly must have been a false flag because a woman who had previously survived the Highland Park mass shooting in July 2022 ""interrupted"" a news conference during an update about the situation. ""Tell me you're pulling out all the stops with your false flag narrative without telling me you're pulling out all the stops,"" a Twitter user posted . Tell me you're pulling out all the stops with your false flag narrative without telling me you're pulling out all the stops. pic.twitter.com/RA0hVMNQUS — AwakenedOutlaw⚒️ (@AwakenedOutlaw) March 27, 2023 Another tweet accused the woman of being a ""crisis actor"" — someone who pretends to be a victim of a tragedy in order to manipulate public opinion about the event. There's no evidence the woman, Ashbey Beasley, is a crisis actor. She said she was on a family vacation and meeting a friend whose son's school then went into lockdown. After a news conference with Metropolitan Nashville Police, news publications like USA Today and The Washington Post reported that she turned to reporters and asked, ""Aren't you guys tired of covering this?"" The moment was caught on video and aired by news organizations like Fox News , from which the video that has circulated most frequently online originated. We reached out to Beasley about the ""crisis actor"" accusation, and will update this fact check if we hear back. Another post asserted that U.S. President Joe Biden was in on the alleged false flag. ""Biden already knows what kind of gun it was & how she had,"" a Twitter user posted . ""It just happened he knows everything already. False flag palooza."" Attached to the tweet was a photograph that says Biden said (erroneously) that the shooter used two AK-47s, but that police hadn't released the make and model of the guns that were used at that point. Biden already knows what kind of gun it was & how she had. It just happened he knows everything already. False flag palooza https://t.co/HuXndUuDLD pic.twitter.com/twu2XOt6Yb — GM_Anon (@AnonWeaponry3) March 27, 2023 When addressing the shooting on March 27, Biden said , ""You know, the shooter in this situation reportedly had two assault weapons and a pistol — two AK-47."" Biden didn't claim he knew how the shooter had obtained the guns. The Metropolitan Nashville Police on March 27 released photographs of the guns the shooter used. At the time of this publication, the guns were identified in news reports as an AR-15, a Kel-Tec SUB 2000, and a handgun. There is no evidence that Biden knew about the shooting beforehand. At the time of the shooting, he was in Washington, D.C., speaking at the Small Business Administration Women's Business Summit. It should not surprise anyone that the president would receive some details about such an incident before they have been widely disseminated. We've fact-checked other rumors about the Nashville Covenant School shooting, including false claims that someone named ""Samantha Hyde"" was the Nashville shooter.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,715
b977d724-7ae3-4b53-9c49-49f16cafb3cf,"UPDATE: On March 30, 2023, The Wall Street Journal , Associated Press , and other reliable sources reported a Manhattan grand jury indicted former U.S. President Donald Trump on charges related to hush-money payments made to Stormy Daniels, with whom he allegedly had an affair. On March 18, 2023, amid reports that former U.S. President Donald Trump was likely to be indicted and arrested on charges related to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels , an image spread on Twitter that claimed to show Trump being placed under arrest. We found it wasn't real. See also: Is This Donald Trump's Jail Mugshot? ""EXCLUSIVE: Trump Arrested in FBI Mar A Lago raid this evening."" Twitter user @TheInfiniteDude tweeted on March 18. A photo attached to the post claimed to show Trump escorted by three police officers to a car. (The tweet has since seemingly been deleted, though an archived version can be found here .) Trump was indicted on March 30, over a week after the image first appeared. The image was made using artificial intelligence (AI). Even though there was no disclaimer stating that the image was AI-generated, the photo included clear tells. Midjourney, an AI generator, has been noted to have difficulty generating realistic-looking hands. One of the police officers in the fake image doesn't have an index finger, while Trump's fist is balled into a fist with no fingers visible. The Infinite Dude posted a Forbes article about how the image was made by AI. The account also claimed to have made other AI-generated images that showed the FBI raiding Mar-a-Lago. We reached out to the account and will update this check if we hear anything back. Other Twitter users noted that the photo was AI-generated: The claim spread the same day Trump himself predicted he would be arrested on March 21. Publications like USA Today and Politico reported the arrest would be in connection with allegations he made hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,380
8c4f09b0-4746-41a2-84ec-783c719722af,"On March 12, 2023, social media users spread the claim that 15 banks in the U.S. had shut down under former U.S. President Donald Trump. We found the claim to be true. The subject emerged in partisan discussions of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse on March 10. With $209 billion in assets when it closed, it was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, behind Washington Mutual's failure in 2008. Silicon Valley Bank's failure also prompted regulators to close Signature Bank, which was the third-largest bank failure in U.S. history. The bank had $110 billion in assets when it closed. Another bank, Silvergate Capitol, announced its intent to wind down operations and liquidate its assets on March 8. MarketWatch reported the bank was facing multiple lawsuits that accused the bank of not having adequate protections to detect money laundering on its platform. The bank had $11 billion in assets at the end of 2022. ""More people should be talking about the fact that 15 banks failed while Donald Trump was president,"" said a Twitter post from progressive political action committee MeidasTouch . Playing the same game of partisan ""whataboutism,"" Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that he didn't remember any banks collapsing during his father's administration, prompting journalist Jake Sherman to provide a list: Banks did fail under trump. many. here is the list of bank failures. https://t.co/EdDZDwrsSL https://t.co/6SIbHMbr6v — Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) March 12, 2023 According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) , there were indeed 15 bank failures during Trump's presidency: four in 2020, four in 2019 and seven in 2017. Additionally, Harvest Community Bank , which was located in New Jersey, closed on Jan. 13, 2017, a week before Trump took office. Here is a list of the banks that closed, with dates of closure: Seaway Bank and Trust Company: Jan. 27, 2017 Proficio Bank: March 3, 2017 First NBC Bank: April 28, 2017 Guaranty Bank, (doing business as BestBank in Georgia & Michigan): May 5, 2017 Fayette County Bank: May 26, 2017 The Farmers and Merchants State Bank of Argonia: October 13, 2017 Washington Federal Bank for Savings: December 15, 2017 The Enloe State Bank: May 31, 2019 Louisa Community Bank: October 25, 2019 Resolute Bank: October 25, 2019 City National Bank of New Jersey: November 1, 2019 Ericson State Bank: February 14, 2020 The First State Bank: April 3, 2020 First City Bank of Florida: October 16, 2020 Almena State Bank: October 23, 2020 The partisan blame game fails to address economic factors underlying bank failures. Many factors could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. Attributing those failures solely to the political party in power ignores those nuances, as well as what lessons can be learned to prevent other banks from failing in the future. The banks that closed during Trump's presidency were significantly smaller in size. The largest was Seaway Bank and Trust Company, which had $361.2 million in assets when it failed in 2017.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,598
2610c9a4-4a67-47b9-a966-b223c179ed84,"As U.S. President Joe Biden left Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 22, 2023, after a surprise visit to Ukraine , videos of him stumbling while climbing stairs to Air Force One went viral. The footage appeared to show him walking up the stairs, and, near the top, stumbling slightly and falling forward. He caught himself, stood up and continued to climb. Sharing the clip, Liz Wheeler, the host of a conservative political commentary podcast, wrote on Twitter, ""Joe Biden trips and falls up the stairs on Air Force One."" To determine whether the clip was real or miscaptioned, we looked for longer videos of Biden's walk up the stairs from reputable news sources. By examining footage from Sky News, for instance, at the 18-minute mark, we saw Biden did indeed stumble: We reached out to the White House for confirmation and received its pool report for the day. That document read: ""The president boarded at 5:34. About half way up the main stairs he stumbled and fell forward. He quickly recovered, stood and continued to the door, giving a quick wave before going in."" Given that acknowledgment from the White House, as well as the clear, undoctored video evidence that shows Biden stumbling, we rate this claim as ""True."" The videos of the fall are not to be confused with miscaptioned footage from earlier in the trip — a clip that supposedly showed Biden falling down the stairs when disembarking from Air Force One. In that video, the individual who fell was not actually the president. Critics of Biden used the Feb. 22 slip to comment on Biden's health, question his fitness for office, and recall his past stumbles . (We have covered Biden's falls before, including a time he fell off a bicycle in 2022. Also, the February 2023 incident was not the first time cameras caught Biden tripping while boarding Air Force One.) We should note that questioning a president's physical and mental health is a reoccurring trend no matter who is in in the Oval Office or their political affiliation.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,397

FILE - President Joe Biden, center, speaks during a State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on, March 1, 2022.



President Joe Biden will deliver the State of the Union address on Tuesday. The annual speech brings together the three branches of government under one roof and allows the president to make the case that the nation is strong and that better days lie ahead.
The State of the Union is full of pomp and circumstance, with some traditions dating back to the nation's founding while others are more modern adaptions. One convention that receives plenty of attention is the seating chart. Who sits where is part custom and part political play. 
Here's a breakdown of the seating in the gallery and where all the major players in Washington, D.C. will sit:

The President
President Biden will deliver his speech on the dais surrounded by every single member of Congress — except those who chose to skip the event in protest — the Supreme Court justices, his cabinet members, the joint chiefs of staff and the Capitol Hill press corps. 
Behind the president on the left will be Vice President Kamala Harris and on the right, new GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy wielding the gavel for the first time since stepping into the role.
Congress
Lawmakers are split in the gallery by party affiliation, with Republicans to the president's left and Democrats to Biden's right. Senators from each party get the front row seats and House lawmakers fill in the rows behind them. 
Aside from reserved places for leadership, seats in the chamber are not assigned to members. However, they are allowed to claim a seat at any time during the day — as long they remain physically in the seat to hold their place for the speech. That means some lawmakers camp out in the aisle for hours a head of the address in order to retain the coveted aisle seat.
Supreme Court Justices
While the Constitution makes no mention of Supreme Court justices attending the State of the Union,  most of the the justices have shown up in their official robes over the years and taken designated seats in front of the Democrats in the gallery. Chief Justice John Roberts said in a 2010 interview, whether to attend is “up to each individual member of the Court.” Justice Samuel Alito hasn’t attended a State of the Union since 2010 and the late Justice Antonin Scalia stopped going in 1997 after deciding it was a ""childish spectacle.""
Cabinet Members
Across the aisle from the high court's justices is President Biden's cabinet members. These include the heads of the 15 executive departments: the Secretaries of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation, Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, and the Attorney General.
Additionally, the Cabinet includes the White House Chief of Staff, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, the Director of National Intelligence, and the U.S. Trade Representative, as well as the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Small Business Administration.
First Lady and Guests 
The first lady and the president's guests typically sit together in the box behind and above congressional Republicans. This year's list of guests include Rock star Bono, the 26-year-old who disarmed a gunman in last month's Monterey Park, California, shooting, and the family of Tyre Nichols. 
Press Corps
The Capitol Hill press corps sit directly behind and above the president. They cannot see the president from the press gallery, but the vantage point offers them a view of the audience to gauge the reactions of members of Congress to the president's speech.

41689b05-9ea9-45c7-a937-80c265845b11,"On Feb. 1, 2023, at least two GOP members of Congress were photographed wearing an AR-15-shaped rifle pin: U.S.Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and Rep. Ana Paulina Luna, R-Fla. The lapels were spotted by Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif.: As The Daily Beast reported , this was not the first time that such a pin appeared on a U.S representative. Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., had been photographed with the pin in June 2021 . In a later tweet, Clyde took credit for their 2023 appearance, announcing on Twitter that he handed the AR-15 pins out, and that he had plenty to spare: Clyde is the owner of a gun store in his home state of Georgia. As reported by the Washington Post, the AR-15 pins were not the first weapons-based souvenir promoted by some GOP members of the 118th Congress: Clyde's distribution of the gun-shaped pins comes after newly elected Rep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) passed out dummy grenades stamped with the GOP logo last week to other members of Congress, along with a note on his office letterhead emphasizing that the ordnance was made in Florida. Because the photograph is genuine, the claim is ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,222
61a924fc-cea4-4029-9634-e96999d50669,"In 2007, Former U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi instituted a ban on smoking in the Capitol, announcing that ""the days of smoke-filled rooms in the United States Capitol are over."" That ban, in essence, brought the Capitol in line with public smoking bans instituted around the country at the time. As The New York Times explained in 2007, this ban did not affect smoking in a Representative's office, but did affect a classically smoke-filled room known as the Speaker's Lobby. Lawmakers can still smoke in their individual offices, but they can no longer light up in the ornate hallway outside the House chamber known as the Speaker's Lobby, the spot where lawmakers often gather to talk with each other and with journalists. Most other areas of the Capitol, including the public areas outside the Senate, had already banned smoking. At the start of the 118th Congress in January 2023, the Republican-controlled House reversed this ban, allowing smoking in public portions of the capitol excluding the House floor. Reports of increased tobacco smoke at the start of the 118th Congress appear to stem, at least in part , from the fact that Rep. Tom Cole — an avid cigar smoker — had moved into an office near the house press gallery. For example, Reuters reporter Patricia Zengerle tweeted that ""there's indoor smoking on the House side of the Capitol now that the Republicans have taken control."" Another Reuters reporter suggested that the new odors were cigars because Rep. Cole ""evidently loves cigars."" Following these observations, several news outlets suggested the practice of politicians like Cole smoking in their office was a result of that policy change. However, there has never been a ban on smoking in a House member's own office, even under the Pelosi ban. While it is factual that a smoking ban instituted by Pelosi was overturned , that reversal did not affect the presence of office smoking. Because, however, a ban instituted by House Democrats in 2007 was overturned by House Republicans in 2023, the claim is ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,388

By Steven Aftergood • February 16, 2006 					


“Is it your view that a Vice President has the authority to declassify information?” Vice President Cheney was asked yesterday by Fox News’ Brit Hume.
“There is an executive order to that effect,” replied the Vice President.
This was a simple answer to a straightforward question, but the matter is actually a bit more complicated.
The executive order in question is E.O. 13292 on classified national security information, issued by President Bush in March 2003.
It states in section 1.3 that “The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by: (1) the President and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President; (2) agency heads and officials designated by the President in the Federal Register…”
Remarkably, the phrase “and, in the performance of executive duties, the Vice President,” which dramatically elevates the Vice President’s classification authority to that of the President, was added to the executive order in 2003.
Prior to that, the Vice President only had classification authority comparable to that of an agency head, having been delegated such authority in a 1995 presidential order.
So much for classification authority. What about declassification?
Declassification authority is defined in Section 6.1(l) of E.O. 13292. It is granted to: “(1) the official who authorized the original classification…; (2) the originator’s current successor in function; (3) a supervisory official of either; or (4) officials delegated declassification authority in writing by the agency head or the senior agency official.”
So the Vice President has authority to declassify anything that he himself classified. He also clearly has authority to declassify anything generated in the Office of the Vice President, which he supervises.
But is the Vice President, like the President, “a supervisory official” with respect to other executive branch agencies such as the CIA? Did the 2003 amendment to the executive order which elevated the Vice President’s classification authority also grant him declassification authority comparable to the President’s?
“The answer is not obvious,” said one executive branch expert on classification policy.

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-GA) today introduced H.R. 25, the Fair Tax Act, to replace the current tax code with a national consumption tax known as the Fair Tax.

“Cosponsoring this Georgia-made legislation was my first act as a Member of Congress and is, fittingly, the first bill I am introducing in the 118th Congress,” said Rep. Buddy Carter. “Instead of adding 87,000 new agents to weaponize the IRS against small business owners and middle America, this bill will eliminate the need for the department entirely by simplifying the tax code with provisions that work for the American people and encourage growth and innovation. Armed, unelected bureaucrats should not have more power over your paycheck than you do.”

Joining Rep. Carter as original cosponsors are Reps. Andrew Clyde (R-GA), Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Kat Cammack (R-FL), Scott Perry (R-PA), Bob Good (R-VA), Thomas Massie (R-KY), Ralph Norman (R-SC), Bill Posey (R-FL), Gary Palmer (R-AL), Jim Banks (R-IN), and Barry Loudermilk (R-GA).


“As a former small business owner, I understand the unnecessary burden our failing income tax system has on Americans. The Fair Tax Act eliminates the tax code, replaces the income tax with a sales tax, and abolishes the abusive Internal Revenue Service. If enacted, this will invigorate the American taxpayer and help more Americans achieve the American Dream,” said Rep. Jeff Duncan.

“I support the Fair Tax because it simplifies our tax code. This transforms the U.S. tax code from a mandatory, progressive, and convoluted system to a fully transparent and unbiased system which does away with the IRS as we know it. It is good for our economy because it encourages work, savings, and investment. Thank you to my colleague Rep. Buddy Carter for leading this effort to simplify the system for American taxpayers,” said Rep. Bob Good.

“I’m very proud to once again co-sponsor the FairTax Act,” said Rep. Kat Cammack. “We’ve seen a continued growth of the IRS and a persistent punishment of hardworking Americans via the tax code. What we’re calling for is a simplified and fair code that works for all, not just some. I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation that fights back against the weaponization of the IRS and stops punishing those who work hard to succeed.”

First introduced into the U.S. Congress in 1999 by former Georgia Congressman John Linder, the Fair Tax is the leading tax reform movement in the country. In addition to eliminating all personal and corporate income taxes, the death tax, gift taxes, and the payroll tax, the Fair Tax would also eliminate the need for the Internal Revenue Service. The Fair Tax would repeal the current tax code and replace it with a single national consumption tax that is pro-growth and allows Americans to keep every cent of their hard-earned money. It is the only tax system that is simple, efficient, friendly to economic growth, non-discriminatory, unintrusive, and FAIR.

1fd24d66-508e-4efc-8ee7-f04c48f8c594,"On Jan. 9, 2023, House Republicans passed a bill that would rescind much of the money that the below-outlined legislation, a Democratic-led spending package, would provide the IRS, The Associated Press reported . The Democratic-controlled Senate, however, has vowed to ignore the January 2023 bill. After the U.S. Senate passed a sweeping spending budget in August 2022, Republicans began spreading outlandish claims about the roughly $80 billion of funding allocated to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). They said, for example, that the IRS would be hiring 87,000 new tax agents who would be ""coming for"" average Americans. The IRS is not planning to hire 87,000 new tax agents for the purposes of targeting or ""coming for"" Americans who earn below a certain income. These exaggerated claims appeared to be aimed, at least in part, at capitalizing on partisan anger over the FBI raid on former U.S. President Donald Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago earlier in August. The raid was part of an investigation into whether Trump took classified records from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago residence, and had no apparent connection to taxes or the IRS. Numerous conservatives tweeted a range of allegations surrounding the alleged hiring of 87,000 new IRS agents. So, what is the $80 billion allotted to the IRS actually for? The Inflation Reduction Act would inject much needed funds into the federal tax agency, which has spent years chronically underfunded , according to The Washington Post, without the resources to process returns efficiently, or assess tax avoidance strategies. The agency's budget and staffing dropped considerably during that time. Around 50,000 staff members would be eligible for retirement in the next five years, according to Natasha Sarin, Treasury counselor for tax policy and implementation. She told The Washington Post that most of the funding will be focused on mitigating the effects of those losses by hiring more customer service and information technology specialists, as well as enforcement agents. $45.6 billion of the funds would be aimed mostly at enforcement, with the remainder spent on upgrading technology and operations. Treasury officials say they do not know the exact number of enforcement agents that will be added to the staff. So where did the 87,000 number come from? A Treasury Department May 2021 report estimated that the injection of new funds via the legislation would enable the IRS to incrementally hire around 86,852 new staff by 2031. But most of those hires would neither be for new positions nor for the roles of IRS enforcement agents. New staff would be added in increments of about 7,000 to 12,000 people. The Treasury Department report analyzed how best for the administration to address the "" tax gap ,"" which is the difference between what is owed to the government and what is actually collected. That figure is believed to be at least $381 billion a year due to underreporting of income. According to the report , enforcement would be focused on those with higher incomes: This involves spending nearly $80 billion on IRS priorities over the course of the decade including hiring new specialized enforcement staff, modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing in meaningful taxpayer service—including the implementation of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to American families. Importantly, the additional resources will go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes, and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for those earning less than $400,000 in actual income. Moreover, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen sent a letter to the IRS directing the agency to limit those audits to higher earners: Specifically, I direct that any additional resources—including any new personnel or auditors that are hired—shall not be used to increase the share of small business or households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to historical levels. This means that, contrary to the misinformation from opponents of this legislation, small business or households earning $400,000 per year or less will not see an increase in the chances that they are audited. In response to the claims about the IRS gearing up to target lower-income people for audits, Sarin told Time magazine : ""It is wholly inaccurate to describe any of these resources as being about increasing audit scrutiny of the middle class or small businesses [...] There's a big wave of attrition that's coming and a lot of these resources are just about filling those positions.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,811
00e68c9a-c8a2-4091-8991-51eac520fd49,"In early January 2023, as Republican U.S. Rep. Kevin McCarthy suffered numerous vote losses in his quest to become speaker of the House, where his party held a slim majority, Mitch McConnell, his counterpart in the Senate and minority leader, broke the record as the longest-serving senator in the chamber's history. Republicans remained divided on McCarthy as House speaker due to a small but vocal group on the far right. Meanwhile, as of this writing, former U.S. President Donald Trump was attempting to divert Republican ire toward McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, using anti-Asian rhetoric to refer to the latter. In a post on TruthSocial on Jan. 4, 2023, he wrote: ""we ought to be fighting Mitch McConnell and his domineering, China loving BOSS, I mean wife, Coco Chow. The harm they have done to the Republican Party is incalculable."" We noticed, however, that back in 2018 all of these parties appeared to be on the same page. A photograph of McCarthy and Chao, who was then -U.S. Secretary of Transportation in the Trump administration and who was speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, made the rounds on the internet. This photograph is authentic. The panel they were speaking on was titled "" Strategic Outlook: United States "" and was moderated by Gerard Baker, who was editor-at-large at The Wall Street Journal. They were joined by Kirstjen Neilsen, then-U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security. The full panel can be found here , and you can see a screenshot of it below: (Screenshot via World Economic Forum) At the time, McCarthy was serving as House majority leader. In the panel, around the 2:34 mark, he mentioned having dinner at the house of Klaus Schwab, the chairperson of the WEF. ""You've got to understand what does 'America First' mean,"" McCarthy said in the talk. ""We wanted to focus on the economics of America, we want the citizens to be safe at home and abroad. ""As I sat around Klaus' dinner last night, what's interesting is the number of countries who are now talking about their tax system,"" he continued , explaining the reasoning behind Trumps' ""America First"" slogan. ""With doing something as big as the tax change [...] the economics of America rising helps the rest of the world. It also helps from a safety perspective around the world."" After the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Chao criticized Trump and resigned from her position. In late 2022, Trump also blamed her and McConnell for the ""turmoil"" in the Republican party, while continuing to use racist language against her. McConnell, meanwhile, appeared alongside Democratic U.S. President Joe Biden in early January 2023 to promote bipartisan efforts to improve infrastructure. While much of his career has been spent stymying the Democratic agenda, McConnell was increasingly criticizing Trump and shifting toward promoting a more bipartisan image. We therefore rate the above claim as a ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,575

43ca3320-f391-4373-b574-7647c46a2bef,"Screenshots supposedly showing statements by former U.S. President Donald Trump about House Republicans' vote to elect a speaker circulated widely on Jan. 4, 2023. In the statements, Trump endorsed Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the leadership position. The screenshots indeed depicted authentic statements by the former president. He shared them on his social media platform, Truth Social, after McCarthy failed to secure enough support from members of his own party in multiple rounds of voting on Jan. 3. Considering those facts, we rate this claim ""True."" In the early hours of Jan. 4, Trump wrote on Truth Social, ""Some really good conversations took place last night, and it's now time for all of our GREAT Republican House Members to VOTE FOR KEVIN, CLOSE THE DEAL, TAKE THE VICTORY, & WATCH CRAZY NANCY PELOSI FLY BACK HOME TO A VERY BROKEN CALIFORNIA,THE ONLY SPEAKER IN U.S. HISTORY TO HAVE LOST THE ""HOUSE"" TWICE! REPUBLICANS, DO NOT TURN A GREAT TRIUMPH INTO A GIANT & EMBARRASSING DEFEAT. IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE, YOU DESERVE IT. Kevin McCarthy will do a good job, and maybe even a GREAT JOB - JUST WATCH!"" While Trump had backed McCarthy publicly before, on Jan. 3, the first day of voting, his enthusiasm appeared to wane . In an interview with NBC News, Trump declined to reiterate his support for McCarthy as House speaker, saying, ""We'll see how it all works out."" Then, on Jan. 4, that stance shifted with the above-displayed Truth Social post. (Roughly 20 minutes after posting the endorsement, Trump posted again , urging Republicans turn their ire to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.) While Trump's post supporting McCarthy for House speaker was indeed an official statement from the former president, less accurate — or completely fake — screenshots supposedly showing his posts or press releases are quite popular on social media. For example, we've previously covered fake statements that supposedly showed Trump calling Mike Pence a ""dog,"" insulting Joe Rogan, responding to Biden's COVID-19 diagnosis, and criticizing Liz Cheney . Some of McCarthy's most vocal opponents remain loyal to Trump. Another vote for House speaker will be held on Jan. 4. McCarthy made several concessions to appease lawmakers who did not vote for him initially. — This report includes contributions from the Snopes staff.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,446
4eacfa54-96b9-4efc-a5b6-4e0a8edf5a8d,"In early December 2022, we received inquiries from readers who asked if it was true that former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration had previously agreed to an exchange that released 5,000 Taliban prisoners. They also wanted to know if Trump had at one time planned to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David. We soon found that all of this was true. Both of these old news items made a comeback on social media following the Dec. 8, 2022, release of WNBA star Brittney Griner. Griner was freed from a Russian prison in exchange for the U.S. releasing ""notorious Russian arms dealer"" Viktor Bout, The Associated Press reported . Some social media users pointed to the previous Taliban prisoner exchange and Camp David plans that occurred under Trump, while at the same time critics of U.S. President Joe Biden's administration decried the deal made that freed Bout. In this story, we're going to look at the facts behind the claim that 5,000 Taliban prisoners were exchanged. We'll also examine the prior news of plans for a Camp David summit. The Origins of the Rumors According to the Austin American-Statesman and PolitiFact, both of these claims appeared to have first gained some prominence after U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, mentioned them. On Aug. 29, 2021, during Biden's first year in the White House, Romney appeared on CNN and blamed both Trump and Biden for the way the final years went down with the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan. Just three days prior to when the interview aired, as the U.S. was completing its withdrawal from Afghanistan, a single suicide bomber killed at least 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul. Romney referenced the attack during the interview with CNN's Jake Tapper: If you focus on, gosh, what should we do right now, recognize that we're in the position we're in right now because of terrible decisions made by two administrations. One, the Trump administration negotiating directly with the Taliban, getting ready to invite them to Camp David, opening up a prison of 5,000 Taliban and probably ISIS-K individuals, and letting them free. I mean, we don't know whether some of them were involved in the attack that occurred. These were the decisions that led to what you're seeing and the danger that existed at the airport. This should not have happened. President Biden closing the Bagram air base. That's what's led to what's happening. 5,000 Taliban Prisoners Exchanged On Aug. 30, 2021, VerifyThis.com published a fact check about the Taliban prisoner exchange with a well-sourced report. They also rated ""True"" the fact that the Trump administration agreed to the exchange. One of the sources cited in the reporting was a U.S. Department of State document titled, ""Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban and the United States of America."" It was dated Feb. 29, 2020, which was at the beginning of the final year of the Trump administration. There were a few components in the agreement, several of which sought assurances to keep the U.S. and its allies safe from retaliation. To keep things brief, here's the part of the agreement that's relevant to this story, which said that 5,000 Taliban prisoners would be exchanged for up to 1,000 prisoners ""of the other side"": The United States is committed to start immediately to work with all relevant sides on a plan to expeditiously release combat and political prisoners as a confidence building measure with the coordination and approval of all relevant sides. Up to five thousand (5,000) prisoners of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban and up to one thousand (1,000) prisoners of the other side will be released by March 10, 2020, the first day of intra-Afghan negotiations, which corresponds to Rajab 15, 1441 on the Hijri Lunar calendar and Hoot 20, 1398 on the Hijri Solar calendar. The relevant sides have the goal of releasing all the remaining prisoners over the course of the subsequent three months. The United States commits to completing this goal. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognized by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban commits that its released prisoners will be committed to the responsibilities mentioned in this agreement so that they will not pose a threat to the security of the United States and its allies. At the time, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the agreement an ""historic opportunity."" VerifyThis.com noted that, ""Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell welcomed the agreement, although warned the U.S. must be vigilant in dealing with the Taliban."" Additionally, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the agreement ""an important initial step toward advancing security and stability in Afghanistan,"" adding that, ""many significant additional steps remain to achieve comprehensive and enduring peace."" The reporting also pointed to a Congressional Research Service document that was published months after Trump left office. It was dated June 11, 2021, weeks prior to the attacks at the airport in Kabul, and said, ""The prisoner exchange was completed in early September 2020."" Trump was still in the White House at the time. The document included a key part, which read, ""Talks between the two sides continue but have not made substantial progress and remain complicated by a number of factors."" This indicated that the Taliban prisoners were released without both sides agreeing to terms. Taliban Leaders to Camp David In Romney's answer on CNN, he also referenced the Trump administration's prior plans to invite Taliban leaders to Camp David. On Sept. 7, 2019, about one year before the Taliban prisoners were all freed, Trump himself tweeted a small thread about the plans, saying that the Taliban leaders were going to ""secretly meet"" with him at Camp David on Sept. 8, just three days before the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. This raised eyebrows, as the Taliban had previously ""forged a close relationship"" with al-Qaida, the terrorist group that carried out the attacks , according to Brittanica.com . The three tweets from Trump read as follows: Unbeknownst to almost everyone, the major Taliban leaders and, separately, the President of Afghanistan, were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday. They were coming to the United States tonight. Unfortunately, in order to build false leverage, they admitted to.. ....an attack in Kabul that killed one of our great great soldiers, and 11 other people. I immediately cancelled the meeting and called off peace negotiations. What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn't, they.... ....only made it worse! If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks, and would even kill 12 innocent people, then they probably don't have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway. How many more decades are they willing to fight? Trump's tweets said that the meeting with Taliban leaders at Camp David was planned, but had been canceled before it took place.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1369
500a1b4e-cf9b-479c-8da4-31a5db9917e9,"Since the 2020 elections, Fox News host Tucker Carlson has attacked U.S. President Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, for allegedly engaging in business practices by means of which Hunter allegedly benefited from his father's position. But just a few years ago, according to an internet rumor, Carlson was asking for the younger Biden's help in getting his son into college. A meme going around claims that an email shows Carlson thanking Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown University on behalf of his son, Buckley. This claim is accurate. In 2014, when Joe Biden was serving as vice president, Carlson and his wife, Susie, reached out to Hunter Biden for help in getting their son into Georgetown University. Their email communication was revealed through forensic analysis of a laptop once owned by Biden that he had purportedly left at a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019. The laptop was obtained by Trump's then-lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and its contents pushed out to the New York Post in 2020. The correspondence on Biden's hard drive, a copy of which was also in the possession of the FBI, was largely used to investigate his overseas business dealings during his father's time in the White House, but also have illuminated more about the Carlson-Biden relationship. The emails were given to The Washington Post on a hard drive by activist Jack Maxey, who received it from Giuliani. The Washington Post revealed the details of Carlson's and Biden's communication in May 2022, and was able to confirm with the help of forensic analysis and interviews with people familiar with the communications that this and other emails on the hard drive were real. So what did Carlson actually say? The Post shared an image of a few of the emails in which he thanks Biden for writing a letter to Georgetown ""on Buckley's [his son's] behalf."" He added, ""So nice of you. I know it'll help."" Image via Washington Post Carlson's wife wrote to Biden in 2014: ""I realize you don't really know Buckley. Maybe you could meet or speak to him and he could send you a very brief resume with his interests and grades attached."" She also wrote: ""Tucker and I would be so grateful if you could write a letter or speak to someone in the Georgetown Admission's Office about Buckley."" Biden wrote back that he would be honored to help. ""I will do anything you would like me to do,"" he said. Carlson described his son's interest in squash and fly fishing and wrote, ""He loves Washington for all the right reasons, I think, and really wants to go to school here."" When Biden agreed to write a letter for Buckley, Susie responded with, ""Tucker and I have the greatest respect and admiration for you. Always!"" Carlson admitted that he was once close with Biden in a phone interview with the Post. He said: ""Hunter Biden was my neighbor. Our wives were friends. I knew him well. I talked to him many times about addiction, something I know a lot about. And I've said that. I think that Hunter Biden is an addict and that's why his life is falling apart, and I feel bad for him. I've said that many times, and I mean it."" He refused to discuss the emails, however, pointing (with apparent irony) to claims that the timing of the laptop's emergence in 2020 had the hallmarks of Russian disinformation. Previously, Carlson had dismissed and mocked claims of a Russian disinformation campaign as an effort by the establishment and tech giants to protect Joe Biden's 2020 election campaign. It is unclear if Biden ended up writing a letter, but Carlson's son did end up going to the University of Virginia. ""I can't confirm these emails. The emails that you're referring to were described by our intel community as Russian disinformation,"" he said . He added that he could not verify the emails as he did not have access to the account. Hunter Biden declined to comment to the Post. Since 2020, Carlson has regularly skewered the younger Biden on his show, accusing him of getting ""lucrative jobs … because he had an important father."" He did say there were certain lines he would not cross, pertaining to the laptop. In October 2020, he said: ""Much of the material on the laptop is of limited relevance to the public. [...] And by the way, if we're being honest, some of the exchanges between Hunter Biden and his father, and they are on there, too, reveal that whatever you say about them, Joe Biden really loves his son, and they're touching."" But following the 2020 election, Carlson's anti-Hunter Biden rhetoric grew , and he even poked fun at his addictions in an October 2021 segment: ""So again, let's say you were a crackhead through your 40s, made a lot of pornographic videos mostly of yourself, your genitals covered in M&Ms, and then once you got to your 50s, decide, 'Hey, I want to be Andy Warhol. You probably couldn't do it unless your dad happened to be the president, and that's how Hunter Biden pulled that off.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1015
7cbd748f-b5f1-4330-bec1-0f1ad849ab1a,"Since September 2022, some internet users have shared screenshots of a tweet by Republicans on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee claiming that their Democratic colleagues ""just voted to support NON-CITIZENS voting in our elections."" The posts are misleading. The source of the posts is a tweet published on Sept. 21, 2022, by the official Twitter account for Republicans on the U.S. House Judiciary Committee. A follow-up post indicates that the tweet was in reference to a Democratic majority's rejection of an amendment to proposed legislation about the translation of voting materials to languages other than English. The amendment stated that the proposed legislation not be construed as allowing non-citizens to vote. To be clear, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee didn't vote to change existing laws that bar non-citizens from voting in U.S. elections. We will explain below. The Underlying Legislation Non-citizens are barred by federal law from voting in federal elections. In limited cases , local jurisdictions have passed laws that allow non-citizens to vote in local elections only — for example, school board and city council elections. In September 2022, U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Georgia, introduced H.R. 8770 , titled the ""Expanding the Voluntary Opportunities for Translations in Elections Act."" The bill, which has not been passed as of this writing, would make ""several clarifications and improvements"" to Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, in comments supporting the bill during a hear on Sept. 21, 2022. Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act governs when elections officials must provide ballot materials in languages other than English to constituents. The U.S. Department of Justice on its website states the law affects ""localities where there are more than 10,000 or over 5 percent of the total voting age citizens"" who are speakers of a single minority language group, based on U.S. Census data. Elections materials must be provided in both English and the language in question, when the threshold is met. H.R. 8770, according to the bill's text , would require the U.S. attorney general to notify jurisdictions if a minority language population is on the verge of triggering translations of voter materials under Section 203, and provide grants to jurisdictions that wish to provide translated materials to language populations, even if it's not required by Section 203. The bill makes no mention of changing the already-existing law barring non-citizens from voting. Where Did Claim about Non-Citizens Voting Come from? The claim stems from an amendment proposed by U.S. Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, who stated that his amendment is intended to clarify ""that this bill does not intend or permit or encourage non-citizens to vote,"" tying English-language fluency with citizenship status. McClintock stated that, ""A requirement of citizenship is to speak English. This is fundamental to a democratic society, the abilities of citizens to talk things out among ourselves."" But that's true only in some cases, namely when someone applies for naturalization. Prospective naturalized American citizens are tested on their English language skills, but exceptions exist. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) states on its website that older adults who have legally resided in the U.S. for years are exempt from the language test, as are those who can't take the test due to a disability. Furthermore, the U.S. has a number of indigenous languages spoken in homes, like Navajo, Dakota, and Alaska native languages, while millions of American citizens speak languages other than English at home. Democrats voted down McClintock's proposed amendment. U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, stated , for example, that ""federal law already states that a non-citizen cannot vote."" The Claim Is a 'Straw Man' Logical Fallacy As we have previously reported , logical fallacies underly many misunderstandings, items of misinformation, and rumors. A straw man argument ""replaces a person's original argument with one that is exaggerated or distorted and attacks the extreme version, as if that claim was made by the person in the first place. In essence, this new argument — or 'straw man' — becomes easier to refute or defeat."" In this case, the original proposed bill sought to make changes to a section of the Votings Rights Act that deals with language access in ways that could expand ballot translation to more non-English speaking voters. McClintock's amendment ties citizenship with English language fluency, alleging that translating elections materials to languages other than English could be interpreted as encouraging non-citizens to vote. The screenshot circulating on social media alleges that something that never happened, happened, namely that Democrats had voted to give non-citizens the right to vote in the nation's elections, when they had in fact voted down an amendment to proposed legislation that restated existing federal law.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,892
c7ced791-e5d3-46a2-9b2f-6d6a0807eac5,"On Nov. 6, 2022, Daylight Saving Time ended, once again, with clocks being turned back one hour, prompting confusion among some, because U.S. Congress had seemed poised to end the yearly time change earlier in the year. The confusion may be best embodied by a Seattle Times headline from an article dated Sept. 9, 2022: ""Daylight saving ends soon. Wait, didn't lawmakers vote to end this?"" The reason some had been laboring under the incorrect assumption that, come Fall 2022, there would be no ""fall back"" change in the clocks is because in March 2022, the Senate did agree to end the practice by passing the Sunshine Protection Act, but the bill stalled in the House of Representatives, so as of this writing, it hasn't become law. Even if both houses of Congress had passed the bill at that time, it wouldn't have gone into effect until 2023. So we would have been falling back in November 2022 regardless. The time change is sometimes the source of internet rumors and jokes, such as a false claim that Stonehenge, the famous ancient rock formation in England, is "" reset "" every year to accommodate it. In 2020, a Norwegian official apologized to fellow Norwegians about the fact that setting clocks back had the effect of making that bruising year one hour longer.

1d72f37c-b074-4e7f-be6a-2083ffa98d88,"In September 2022, a Twitter user posted that flyers were available at a rally held for former U.S. President Donald Trump that named him as ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ."" It was true that the flyers showed the cover of a real, published book from author Helgard Müller, titled, ""President Donald J. Trump, The Son of Man - The Christ."" Müller confirmed to us via the Messenger app that he personally handed the flyers out at the most recent Trump rally in Youngstown, Ohio, which took place on Sept. 17. ""I did hand the flyers out. I gave them to the people in line. Some were sitting,"" he said. We also asked him if anyone with Trump's campaign or team had ever handed out the flyers in any official capacity. ""No,"" he answered. (We were notified by Courier-Journal columnist Joe Gerth that the picture of the flyer in the tweet was taken by him in Kentucky on Sept. 10.) Posts on Müller's Facebook page showed that he traveled with a trailer (the small one below) and some signage to help promote his book at Trump rallies. The book 's release appeared to have been around March 2022. ""Is this satire?,"" a Facebook commenter asked . ""Nope,"" Müller answered. ""The real deal."" Another Facebook commenter asked for an explanation, posting, ""What!!?? Trump...The Christ? Are you pulling our leg?"" Müller provided an answer by pointing to his interpretation of Bible verses, saying he believed the son of God to be Jesus Christ , and the son of man to be Trump, meaning he believed there to be two Christs: You know that Jesus, the Son of God always spoke about the Son of MAN in a third person? ""For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words (Jesus, the Son of God), of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in his Father's, and of the holy angels."" Have you not notice how Jesus, the Son of God spoke in the first person about himself and always referred to the Son of MAN in the third person? Müller also told us that he believed there to be a comparison between Jesus being betrayed by Judas and Trump purportedly being ""betrayed by Pence,"" purportedly referring to the former U.S. vice president's decision to follow the U.S. Constitution rather than overturning the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election based on conspiracy theories. (In reality, no credible evidence of massive voter fraud has ever been produced to show that the election was ""stolen,"" as Trump often claimed.) Following the Ohio rally, Müller uploaded a video that provided a longer explanation as to why he believed Trump to be ""the son of man"" and ""the Christ,"" as mentioned on the cover of his book. ""Don't get offended. Don't say, 'Ew, that's blasphemous,'"" he said. ""Jesus is the king of the Jews. Trump is the king of kings."" In sum, yes, it's true that flyers were being handed out at a Trump rally for a book that called Trump ""the son of God"" and ""the Christ.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,644
a3d0796f-57f4-4ac3-9dcb-8b6fb75aefe3,"In August 2022, we received mail from readers that asked if Anne Frank's ""The Diary of a Young Girl"" and the Bible were both ""banned"" by a Texas school district. A seemingly endless number of Facebook posts and news headlines made this specific claim. We soon found that there were a lot of moving parts to this story, many of which were being misunderstood by social media users due to its complexity. On Aug. 8, 2022, a new policy was enacted in the Keller Independent School District in Keller, Texas. The town is located north of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. According to The Times of Israel , this policy established new guidelines for responding to parental book challenges: ... following school board elections in May [2022], right-wing activists backed by campaign funds from a PAC affiliated with conservative cell phone company Patriot Mobile gained a majority on the board. They are now rewriting the guidelines for responding to parental book challenges and have ordered all challenged books from last year to be removed from school libraries in the meantime. The new policy required a fresh review of a list of 41 books that had been previously challenged, many of which were then approved to remain on shelves. The books had been challenged either by parents or community members. Some of the books that had been approved to stay on school shelves during that process contained sexually explicit content, according to a video published by the Keller ISD Family Alliance YouTube channel: Aside from the books mentioned in above video, the list of 41 previously challenged items included a graphic novel edition of Frank's diary that was first published in 2018, titled, ""Anne Frank's Diary: The Graphic Adaptation."" The Bible also made the list. According to the Keller ISD website , each of the two books had apparently been challenged by a lone parent. The graphic novel version of Frank's work purportedly contains ""references to female genitalia, same-sex attraction, and other sexual matters,"" according to the reporting from The Times of Israel. At the same time, the more than 50 copies of the standard edition of Frank's ""The Diary of a Young Girl"" that were available in the school district's libraries were never challenged or removed from shelves, according to a statement from the superintendent, Rick Westfall. This was one fact that wasn't mentioned in many of the popular Facebook posts about this rumor. The New York Times reported that, on Aug. 16, just hours before the first day of classes for the new year, ""a school administrator sent an email [...] to principals and librarians to tell them to remove certain books that had been challenged by the end of the day."" This was because of the aforementioned new policy and guidelines of Aug. 8. That email was then reported on by various news websites, which led to the brouhaha that blossomed out of misinformed social media posts. All of this commotion led to Westfall issuing his statement on the Keller ISD website. A key part of Westfall's statement read as follows: I would like to remind everyone that the list of challenged books was not created by Keller ISD or any Keller ISD employee, but by parents and community members. We have, unfortunately, received reports of individual employees being attacked on social media, by phone, and through email because some have perceived these employees as having developed this list. Every Keller ISD employee works every day to ensure that students' educational needs are met, and these kinds of attacks on employees are unfair, uncalled for, and do nothing but distract from those efforts to serve our students. All of the books on the list were challenged by parents and community members for various reasons, and District officials considered these concerns through the previous review process. With a new policy and new guidelines in place, these titles will simply once again be reviewed through the lens of this new policy. If the books pass the new standards, as determined by reviews conducted in coordination with campus administration and librarians, the books will be promptly returned to shelves. As these titles are reviewed, the status will be updated on our website at www.KellerISD.net/InstructionalResources . We anticipate that books like the Bible, Anne Frank’s Diary: The Graphic Adaptation, and other titles will be on shelves very soon. (Please note that more than 50 copies of the Diary of Anne Frank have remained in circulation; only the graphic novel edition was previously challenged, and is, thus, under review again.) It is important to be clear about this point – regardless of headlines or social media stories, none of the books under re-evaluation were banned. In the process of researching the facts behind this story, we viewed a YouTube video that showed one member of Keller ISD’s Board of Trustees expressing concerns about one of the books on the list. However, this book was not the graphic novel of Frank's work, nor was it the Bible. We have chosen to not link to this video since it mentions the board member's children. In sum, no, the Keller ISD in Texas did not ""ban"" Frank's ""The Diary of a Young Girl"" or the Bible, as misleading Facebook posts claimed. According to the school district's updated list of Current Book Challenges , both books were re-evaluated, approved, and returned to circulation as of Aug. 19.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1025
3efa85c6-98fb-4b65-b38e-e6a87131f611,"Origin One of the most memorable scenes in the 2004 movie ""Anchorman"" takes place when news anchor Ron Burgundy, played by actor Will Ferrell, insults the city of San Diego due to someone editing his script after the editor is informed that ""Ron Burgundy will read anything that is put on that teleprompter. And when I say anything, I mean anything."" In November 2021, social media users mocked U.S. President Joe Biden for having a ""Ron Burgundy moment"" after a deceptively edited video was circulated online that appeared to show Biden randomly saying ""end of quote."" This video has been viewed more than 1 million times. And while it appears to show Biden randomly saying ""end of quote,"" this video is edited to omit the part of Biden's speech where the president informed his listeners that he was beginning a quote. In other words, ""end of quote"" wasn't a random non-sequitur that he read off the teleprompter simply because it was there. It was part of his speech that indicated he was no longer quoting someone else. The above-displayed video shows Biden delivering a speech on the economy. Here's a transcript of this portion of Biden's speech: We also met with the CEOs of Walmart, Target, Home Depot, TJ Maxx, and others. Those retailers — large retailers and others agreed to move products more quickly, stock their shelves more quickly. And, by the way, you may have heard the CEO of Walmart yesterday on the steps we’ve taken. He said, and I quote, “The combination of private enterprise and government working together has been really successful.” He went on to say, “All the way through the supply chain, there’s… a lot of innovation.” Because of the actions we’ve taken, things have begun to change. End of quote. While Biden clearly said ""end of quote"" because he was no longer quoting the CEO of Walmart, a number of news outlets reported on this fake faux pas. Fox News, for example, published an article titled ""Biden appears to read 'end of quote' from teleprompter during gas price inflation speech."" Fox would later amend this title to note that while ""Biden appeared to read ‘end of quote’ from teleprompter"" he ""was actually quoting a business leader."" The Daily Mail made a similar edit, changing this title ""Don't go off script, Joe! Awkward moment Biden says 'end of quote' while reading his economics speech off a teleprompter before his Thanksgiving weekend"" to this title ""Joe Biden's awkward 'Ron Burgundy' moment is not as it seems: President uses 'end of quote' to clarify he was simply repeating Walmart CEO's comments over supply chain issues."" Biden's full speech can be seen below. The portion of the speech dealing with this quote starts around the 2:30 mark. The above-displayed video does not show that Biden will read anything that is put on his teleprompter, a la Ron Burgundy. Here's what a real Ron Burgundy moment looks like. July 2022 Incident In July 2022, social media users claimed that Biden had another ""Ron Burgundy"" moment when he said "" repeat the line "" during his remarks after signing an executive order to protect access to reproductive health care services.

44992e8c-363e-487e-97b0-8eaf2a175b4e,"In November 2021, shortly after Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges in the killing of two people during a night of civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a social media post went viral that embellished some aspects of the case. The post claimed, for example, that Rittenhouse was defending a gas station that belonged to his grandparents during the deadly altercation. The post begins: If you only watched or learned about the Rittenhouse trial via ABC, CBS, CNN, MSNBC, or NBC, you will not know: The gas station, where they initially attacked Rittenhouse, is owned by his grandparents. They came on to his family’s property to attack him. Rittenhouse put out a dumpster fire being rolled towards that same gas station, meant to burn it down and possibly cause an explosion. [...] I didn't know that someone knocked Rittenhouse down twice and then attempted to kick him with lethal force to the head. I didn't know that Huber had hit him in the head 2x with a skateboard. This post is false or misleading in several ways. For one, Rittenhouse's grandparents did not own the gas station involved in the altercation. And second, many of the items mentioned in this post — for example, Rittenhouse testified that Anthony Huber, one of the men who was killed, had hit him with a skateboard — received coverage from mainstream outlets such as CNN. We have found no evidence to support the claim about Rittenhouse's grandparents. Rittenhouse's defense team did not make this claim during the trial, nor did we find any reports from credible news outlets reporting this to be the case. Rittenhouse testified that he traveled to Kenosha in order to protect a car dealership (not a gas station) called Car Source, which had been damaged a few days prior during a night of unrest following the shooting of Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse said that the owners of the dealership had asked him to help protect the business. Members of the family who own Car Source (who are not related to Rittenhouse) disputed this claim during their testimony: After the shootings, the sons of the owner of Car Source told multiple media outlets they never asked for armed help. The sons are Sahil “Sal Khindri” Khindri and Anmol “Sam Khindri” Khindri. They said their father speaks little English. On the stand Friday, both Sal Khindri and Sam Khindri said they never asked anyone for armed help. While there is some dispute over whether this dealership asked for help (an employee later said it did), this dealership clearly is not owned by Rittenhouse's grandparents. Rittenhouse did visit a gas station near Car Source during the night of the fatal shootings, but there's no evidence to suggest that his grandparents owned the gas station. Here's what Rittenhouse said about this gas station during his testimony (full transcript at Rev.com here ): Attorney 1: Did you continue on your way down Sheridan Road without [Ryan] Balch? Kyle Rittenhouse: No. I actually went to go look for Mr. Balch in the Ultimate gas station parking lot. Attorney 1:  When you went to the Ultimate gas station parking lot, describe what was going on there. Kyle Rittenhouse: There were a lot of people there. I don’t really know what was going on, I was just focused on trying to find Mr. Balch. As I was looking for him, couldn’t find him. I said, okay, no problem. I’ll just go back to the Car Source lot Car Source number too. Rittenhouse was also asked about his grandparents during his testimony. While Rittenhouse said that his grandmother (as well as an aunt, uncle, and cousins) lived in Kenosha, he did not claim that they owned a gas station nor that he was trying to protect their property during the fatal shooting. Here's another excerpt from Rittenhouse's testimony : Attorney 1: Do you have any other family that’s from Kenosha? Kyle Rittenhouse: Yes. Attorney 1: What? Kyle Rittenhouse: My grandmother, my aunt, my uncle and cousins all live in the city of Kenosha. The viral post falsely claims that mainstream media outlets failed to report Rittenhouse's grandparents owned the gas station — they didn't report this because it isn't true. That said, we also searched for this tidbit on more conservative-leaning news outlets such as Fox News and The Daily Caller. Neither of these outlets have reported that Rittenhouse's grandparents owned a gas station in Kenosha. Here's an excerpt from a Fox News article reporting on how Rittenhouse ended up in Kenosha: Black testified that he, his brother and Rittenhouse traveled to Kenosha the morning of Aug. 25, 2020 to see the aftermath of the riots during two nights prior. They then left, and returned to the city at around 5 p.m., after one of Black's friends said they should help protect a local business, Car Source. [...] Rittenhouse and Black met with other armed individuals in Kenosha on the night of the shootings. Rittenhouse testified that he headed there to help patrol the streets, protect businesses and provide first aid, which he came prepared for with a medical bag. Two members of the family that owns Car Source, however, denied setting up plans for Rittenhouse or anyone else to protect the business. Prosecutor Thomas Binger also showed screenshots of text messages Rittenhouse sent Anmol Khindri, a member of the family that owns Car Source. [...] Before the shootings, Rittenhouse was a police explorer for the Grayslake Police Department and a cadet with the Antioch Fire Department. He lived in Antioch with his single mother, Wendy Rittenhouse, and his two sisters. Antioch borders the Wisconsin state line and is about 20 miles, or roughly a 30-minute drive, from Kenosha, where his father, grandmother, aunt, uncle and cousin live. In addition to falsely stating that Rittenhouse was protecting a gas station owned by his grandparents, the general thrust of the viral post is to misleadingly insinuate that people following Rittenhouse's trial would be misinformed if they got their news from mainstream media outlets. Many of the listed items in this post, however, were actually covered by outlets such as MSNBC and CNN. CNN, for example, reported that Joseph Rosenbaum , one of the men killed by Rittenhouse, had been previously convicted of sexual conduct with a minor. It should also be noted that some of the listed items in this viral post didn't emerge until the trial. For example, Gaige Grosskreutz testified that he pointed his gun at Rittenhouse before being shot, something that bolstered the defense's claim of self-defense. When this testimony occurred, it was reported on by mainstream media outlets, including Snopes . The New York Times reported : As Mr. Grosskreutz described the seconds before Mr. Rittenhouse shot him, he was shown photos that captured him pointing his gun at Mr. Rittenhouse. “So when you were standing three to five feet from him with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right?” Corey Chirafisi, a defense lawyer, asked. “Correct,” Mr. Grosskreutz answered. “It wasn’t until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him with your gun — now your hands down, pointed at him — that he fired, right?” Mr. Chirafisi said. “Correct,” he said.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1406
dd568414-6fd9-4711-b7bd-f8367fce1fd1,"In late October 2021, a misleading copypasta meme spread on Facebook that attributed port bottlenecks and shipping delays to ""California's liberal trucking laws."" The meme circulated on various platforms including Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Here is a version of the meme that was posted to Facebook: The meme above reads, in part: So ships are piling up at Long Beach waiting to get unloaded. The port is jammed full of containers with no place to stack more. The liberal media is blaming it on the trucking industry while the nation's store shelves are becoming bare ... Well there's more to the story. Could Gavin Newsom and California's liberal trucking laws be the blame ? ? The NEWS says the California port situation is caused by a driver shortage. Not so fast: It is in part caused by a California Truck Ban which says all trucks must be 2011 or newer and a law called AB 5 which prohibits Owner Operators. The two state laws mentioned are AB5 , a 2019 law intended to prevent employers from wrongly classifying workers as contractors, and something called ""California Truck Ban."" The meme also mentions a September 2020 executive order by California Gov. Gavin Newsom that seeks to phase out fuel-burning vehicle engines by 2035 in an effort to combat global warming. The meme is referencing congestion at the ports in San Pedro Bay in Southern California and the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, which collectively handle an estimated 40 percent of the nation's imports. The back-up is resulting in something of a crisis in shipping delays right before the 2021 winter holidays. The meme above attempts to lay the blame for the crisis at the feet of Newsom, along with California labor and environmental laws. But from a broad perspective, the disruption in the supply chain is a global phenomenon sparked by a confluence of major calamities in 2020 and 2021, including labor shortages, facility closures, and an increased e-commerce demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather, and a massive container ship that had become lodged in the Suez Canal for nearly a week. Here we will look at whether the two laws and executive order mentioned in the meme are to blame for the slowdown at the Southern California ports. The 'California Truck Ban'? There is no law called the ""California Truck Ban."" But from the description above — that ""all trucks must be 2011 or newer"" — it appears the post is referencing the California Truck and Bus Regulation . That regulation doesn't currently block registration of vehicles from the year 2010 and older, however. The Truck and Bus Regulation requires trucks serving the ports to have engines from 2010 or newer as of Jan. 1, 2023. If they don't, the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) would deny registrations to non-compliant vehicles. But the rule, which was adopted in 2008, has taken effect gradually over several years. It's not new, whereas the situation at the L.A. and Long Beach ports in the fall of 2021 is acute. In an email, Stanley Young, spokesperson for the California Air Resource Board, told Snopes, ""As of 2021 only trucks with engines older than 2005 would have their registration denied."" Young added that 96 percent of the trucks currently serving the major ports in California are already compliant with the regulation. ""Despite what you may have heard or read, there is simply no evidence to support any claims that the current congestion at our ports has any connection to the state’s efforts to clean up California’s trucks,"" Young stated. ""Since trucks at major California ports have been required to have 2007 or newer engines since 2014, and since these engines are legal until at least 2023, it’s impossible that any shortage of vehicles at ports is the result of CARB regulations."" AB5 Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5) is a California law that went into effect in January 2020, although it has faced an onslaught of legal challenges preventing it from being implemented. The law is intended to prevent companies like Uber and Instacart from misclassifying so-called gig workers as independent contractors, rather than employees. Truckers often operate under an ""owner-operator"" model, in which they own their own vehicles, which they then use to transport goods as contractors for trucking companies. Both the California Trucking Association (CTA) and freight transport company Cal Cartage Express filed legal challenges against AB 5. Cal Cartage lost its case but the U.S. Supreme Court has yet to decide whether to hear a petition by CTA. Until it does, AB 5 remains in limbo for the trucking industry. Matt Schrap, CEO of the the Harbor Trucking Association (which represents drayage truck companies serving the ports of L.A. and Long Beach) said it's not a shortage of truckers that's driving the delays, and pointing the finger at AB 5 doesn't take reality into account. Instead, Schrap said that the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns spurred an explosion of online buying that ramped up sharply during the pandemic lockdowns, and the ports of L.A. and Long Beach don't have the infrastructure to handle the sudden influx. ""It’s like jamming ten lanes of freeway traffic into five lanes,"" Schrap said in a phone interview with Snopes. Currently, the bête noire for truckers and trucking companies at the ports of L.A. and Long Beach is an excess of empty shipping containers piling up at the ports, which often block truckers from picking up and dropping off cargo. ""We’re struggling with these empty containers,"" Schrap said. ""That is really what’s working us over."" Schrap said he expects that the situation will start to improve, because with the sudden attention on the issue, officials are taking steps to help resolve it, like placing fees on cargo ship companies that leave behind empty containers, and potentially allowing empty container stacking on empty parcels of land at the ports. But these are just Bandaids on a larger problem, which is that the Southern California ports need investment in infrastructure to prevent crises like these, Schrap stressed. ""We’re in this problem because of the underinvestment in the infrastructure that supports the American consumer’s buying habits,"" Schrap said. ""It's a temporary solution to a longstanding problem."" Trucks Illegal in 2035? Newsom issued an executive order in September 2020 seeking to phase out gas-burning vehicles by making all new vehicles sold as of 2035 and beyond zero-emission. But Newsom's order wouldn't make the current fuel-powered trucks illegal as of 2035. The executive order explicitly states that while California will require new vehicles sold as of 2035 and beyond to be zero-emission, older vehicles will not be illegal to own and operate, and can still be purchased and sold. A news release from the governor's office announcing the order states, ""The executive order will not prevent Californians from owning gasoline-powered cars or selling them on the used car market.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1317
fe157973-7da9-4f49-8698-ccf276a1df4e,"In October 2021, social media posts and news outlets reported that the new Ohio license plate, whose design Gov. Mike DeWine had just unveiled, contained a notable historical inaccuracy. For example, one Twitter user wrote, ""Holy shit. The Wright Brothers Flyer is flying backwards on the new Ohio license plate,"" while Axios reporter Tyler Buchanan wrote, ""That tail-looking thing is actually the front. But the banner's facing the other way."" The unveiling of the new license plate design, at a news conference on Oct. 21, can be watched below. Among other features, the plate contains a banner that reads ""Birthplace of Aviation"" emerging from a representation of the Flyer — the ground-breaking aircraft designed by Dayton, Ohio, brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright, which made the first ever airplane flight in 1903. https://youtu.be/xDABUXKeqiA?t=582 In the design unveiled at the news conference, the banner emerged from the smaller end of the Flyer, giving the impression that this was the back of the aircraft. This was evident in a tweet posted by the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) : However, that smaller end of the Wright Flyer, composed of the ""elevators,"" was actually at the front , as this National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) graphic shows: So tweeted photos and other descriptions of the originally unveiled license plate design — showing the banner emerging from the smaller end of the aircraft — were authentic, and social media users were right to point out that that representation was indeed inaccurate. As such, we are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) promptly acknowledged the error and issued a new design version of the license plate later on the same day, which correctly showed the banner emerging from the back end of the aircraft: A spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Public Safety told Snopes that around 35,000 license plates had already been manufactured with the error featured on them, but said the state would be recycling all of them. The spokesperson said it was not yet clear what the cost would be of having to re-print those license plates with the corrected design.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,414
8769b11a-5339-4f85-a1a5-3faea2443b98,"In September 2021, a photograph started to circulate on social media that supposedly showed U.S. President Joe Biden and a group of children wearing hats, shirts, and other memorabilia featuring slogans for former President Donald Trump. This image was widely circulated on social media by those claiming that Biden had been ""punked"" by the kids, or that the president had been tricked into taking a photograph with children wearing Trump memorabilia. The @RealDonaldTrump Gab account — an account that reposts emailed statements from the former president since Trump has been banned by more popular social media networks — shared the image along with the caption: ""These kids tricked Biden just like the Taliban did."" This is a genuine photograph of Biden with several children wearing Trump memorabilia. However, there's no evidence to support the claim that the president was ""tricked"" into taking this photo. In fact, Biden referenced this photograph as an example of unity and a social media account that appears to belong to one of the children featured in this image stated that Biden was aware of the hats. The child wrote on Instagram: ""Yes [he was aware of the hats] he actually said “I believe in liking people even if they don’t like you. This photograph was taken on Sept. 11, 2021, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, during an event to commemorate 9/11. Biden referenced this photograph as an example of unity after he was asked by a reporter what he had been thinking during the 20th anniversary of 9/11 . Biden's full response hit on a number of different topics. He talked about a friend of his who lost a son during the attack and the heroism of the passengers of United Flight 93. Biden also praised the remarks delivered earlier by former President George W. Bush regarding the forces that were dividing the country, and then talked about meeting the children in the viral photograph who were wearing memorabilia for his former political rival. Biden said: I thought that President Bush made a really good speech today — genuinely good speech — about who we are. We’re not — the core of who we are is not divided. It’s just this notion of — I don’t know how to explain it. I think, Jeff, I talked to you a little about this. I think the real issue for those kids that — just had a picture taken with — couple of them had Trump hats from last year — I think, for them, it’s going to be: Are we going to, in the next 4, 5, 6, 10 years, demonstrate that democracies can work, or not? [...] There’s a lot of autocrats who truly believe that democracies can’t function in the 21st century. Not a joke. They think because the world is changing so rapidly and people are so divided, you can’t bring people together in a democracy to get a consensus, and the only ones that are going to be able to succeed are the autocrats. That’s why it’s so damn important we demonstrate — everybody says, “Biden, why do you keep insisting on trying to bring the country together?” That’s the thing that’s going to affect our wellbeing more than anything else: how the rest of the world responds to us — knowing that we actually can, in fact, lead by the example of our power again. And I think we can do it. We got to do it. This photograph was also posted by Jana Musser , the mother of one of the children wearing a ""Make America Great Again"" hats. Musser's original caption for the image stated that ""We may not always see eye to eye, but we can all come together to be United!""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,726

Demand for oil continues to fall due to the new coronavirus outbreak. As demand for fuel plummeted worldwide and the oil industry faced a devastating drop in oil prices, the U.S. took the rare move of stepping into negotiations involving the member countries of OPEC and non-members such as Russia and Mexico. (AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)NEW YORK (AP) — As demand for fuel plummeted worldwide and the oil industry faced a devastating drop in oil prices, the U.S. took the rare move of stepping into negotiations involving the member countries of OPEC and non-members such as Russia and Mexico, an alliance called OPEC+.President Donald Trump and a group of U.S. senators wielded political influence to push OPEC and its allies to agree over the weekend to cut production by nearly 10 million barrels per day — about 10% of current global output.The unusual action by the U.S. — and the fact that the intervention worked — reflect the desperate conditions the oil industry found itself in due to the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus outbreak. “There have been oil market crises, but nothing like this before,” said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. “Even when the price collapsed in 1986 or 1988, demand actually went up. You’ve never had a 20 to 25% drop in demand just overnight. You’ve never had the world economy shut down overnight.”Trump also knew what was at stake domestically — The U.S. is now the world’s largest oil and gas producer.“This historic action will help nearly 11 million American workers who are supported by the U.S. oil and gas industry,” Trump said during a coronavirus press briefing Monday. HOW SIGNIFICANT IS THE U.S. INVOLVEMENT? American officials have gotten involved with OPEC in the past, making phone calls or attempting to sway a deal during international crises and unusual circumstances. The intervention has typically been in response to high prices; instead, in the current situation, oil prices dropped more than 60% since the start of the year. “There is nothing new about a president phoning Riyadh to ask for help dealing with oil market disruptions, but the level of pressure and deep involvement of both sides of Pennsylvania Ave., not to mention the G20, along with the scale of the oil cuts on the table, is something rarely seen in OPEC history,” said Jason Bordoff, founding director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.WHAT EXACTLY DID THE U.S. BRING TO THE TABLE?Mexico stalled the negotiations by refusing to cut more than 100,000 barrels a day of production, when OPEC was asking for double or triple that amount. Trump said the U.S. would help by shouldering the cuts that Mexico was unwilling to make. While Trump’s promise to help Mexico may have seemed hollow — U.S. companies were already cutting production due to the low prices — Trump’s intervention on Mexico’s behalf sent a message that could have helped push the wary alliance into a deal.“They had to agree to give something like a cover story, a diplomatic cover, so that the other parties in OPEC, who whether they liked it or not were going to have to accept these terms, would be able to do so without a loss of prestige,” said Kevin Book, managing director at Clearview Energy Partners.Trump’s statements also signaled that the U.S. views Mexico as an important partner in the integrated North American energy market, said Amy Myers Jaffe, senior fellow at the Council for Foreign Relations, who also saw it as an important policy move. “I think it will serve the president well on every count,” including border issues, she said.Even more stark was a call between a dozen U.S. senators and high-ranking energy and defense officials Saturday. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, noted there is legislation drafted that would remove American forces, including Patriot Missile batteries, from Saudi Arabia. “If they lose that group of senators you start to see veto override majorities on legislation that deals negatively with the Saudis,” Sullivan told a small group of congressional reporters.That was a very clear threat, Book said. “It’s not really a negotiation at all.” he added. “It’s a pretty dangerous neighborhood for the Saudis, and the U.S. plays a vital role in protecting them.”COULD FORCED PRODUCTION CUTS WORK IN THE U.S.? With state-run oil operations, OPEC nations can easily enact a cut or boost production. But the U.S. has thousands of independent oil producers, so coordinating and enforcing a production cut would be complicated, and experts say it’s unlikely.Some oil producers in Texas and Oklahoma are pushing for state-mandated production cuts, but the industry is split on the prospect. Right now, the producers with more costly production are most likely to suffer, and would be the first to file for bankruptcy or shut down existing wells, damaging oil fields. But a state-managed production cut “spreads out the pain uniformly,” Book said. “We’re not suggesting that Oklahoma can balance the market, we can’t do that,” said Mike Cantrell, owner of Cantrell Investments LLC, an oil and gas investment group based in Oklahoma. But statewide, production has declined about 20% this year, the equivalent of about 100,000 barrels a day — a cut similar to Mexico’s. If sustained, “that would be a cut that would be a significant cut in the world scheme of things,” he said. In Texas, commissioners will hold a meeting Tuesday on the topic. WHY DIDN’T OIL PRICES RECOVER AFTER THE OPEC+ DEAL?Despite the deal, U.S. benchmark crude was trading at about $22 a barrel Monday, well below what most producers need to financially survive. But that was still better than what some analysts had predicted — including a drop in the price to the single digits.“A clock was ticking, for all the players, because by the end of April or early May...the world was going to run out of storage, and the price of oil was going to drop like a rock,” Yergin said.WHAT ABOUT LOW FUEL PRICES?Low oil prices lead to cheap gasoline prices, and consumers in different times would praise discounts at the pump. Gasoline prices are about $1.86 per gallon, about $1 less than a year ago, according to AAA. But most consumers aren’t able to take advantage, because many are staying home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Even when travel restrictions lift, economic turmoil could prompt consumers to save money and stay home.___AP Writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.Follow Bussewitz on Twitter: @cbussewitz AP NEWSTop StoriesVideoContact UsAccessibility StatementCookie SettingsDownload AP NEWSConnect with the definitive source for global and local newsMore from APap.orgAP InsightsAP Definitive Source BlogAP Images SpotlightAP ExploreAP BooksAP StylebookFollow APThe Associated PressAboutContactCustomer SupportCareersTerms & ConditionsPrivacyAll contents © copyright 2023 The Associated Press.

942f66b0-4727-46bf-bfa5-01c8d3144131,"Fact Check Former U.S President Jimmy Carter was considered to be ahead of his time on issues surrounding climate change, exemplified by his installation of solar panels on the rooftop of the White House in the 1970s. Years later, Reagan removed the panels when he came into power, and they returned decades after, during the Obama administration. Some sources have reported that the solar panels installed by Obama are still in place. We are in the process of verifying that. A photograph of Carter showing off the panels he had installed at a dedication ceremony in 1979 was popular on Reddit in September 2022: The above caption does correctly state that Carter displayed the solar panels to guests at the White House, but it's incorrect as to when Carter’s successor, President Ronald Reagan, had the panels removed. Carter had 32 panels installed there, and for seven years they were used to heat water in the household until the Reagan administration removed them in 1986 -- not two years later as the post claims. According to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History , which now has one of the original panels in its collection, they were a symbol of Carter’s faith in “the power of the sun.” The above photograph is taken from the Jimmy Carter Presidential Library collection, and was published in The New York Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution . The same image can be seen on Britannica . The New York Times' caption stated: “In 1979, President Carter showed off new solar panels on the West Wing that would provide hot water for the White House.” Various shots from that event are available in the National Archives catalog , and shots of that particular moment can be seen in the bottom half of the photographic film scans. These photographs were taken at the White House dedication event for the solar panels. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library At the ceremony, which was held in June 1979, Carter said : In the year 2000 this solar water heater behind me, which is being dedicated today, will still be here supplying cheap, efficient energy [...] A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people. Other photographs from the same event show the panels more clearly displayed on the rooftop of the White House's Cabinet Room, which is where the dedication event appears to take place. Jimmy Carter Presidential Library What happened to those panels after they were removed? According to Scientific American , one ended up at the National Museum of American History, one is in the Carter Library, and one is at the Solar Science and Technology Museum in Dezhou, China. Solar panels made a comeback at the White House during former President George W. Bush's tenure in 2002, but not on the Executive Mansion's roof. According to the White House Historical Association , the National Park Service oversaw installation of three solar energy systems on the White House grounds starting in 2002. The installation during his tenure helped heat up the White House swimming pool. In 2010, then-U.S. President Barack Obama announced that solar panels would once again be installed on the White House rooftop. The installation was completed in 2014 . The video below highlights the process: We reached out to the White House Historical Association to learn if any updates or changes were made to the panels during the Trump administration. They shared with us a photograph from a July 2021 news article in which the panels are still visible, stating, ""It appears from photographers that the panels are still installed on the roof."" While they confirmed that the panels are still there, they could not verify with certainty if the Trump administration had made any changes to them before 2020.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,727
d2be1a6f-ac06-4b24-998f-290f739f2417,"Fact Check As former U.S. President Donald Trump remained under investigation for potentially mishandling classified government documents seized by the FBI at his Mar-a-Lago estate, conservative outlets began accusing former President Barack Obama’s foundation of mishandling his own presidential records. For example, on Sept. 22, 2022, PJ Media, a right-leaning organization, claimed that “The Obama Foundation stored classified documents in an abandoned furniture warehouse, according to a 2018 letter from the Obama Foundation to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).” In addition to stating that a letter of agreement from September 2018 between the foundation and NARA on the digitization of Obama’s presidential documents, the article said the foundation ""not only acknowledged possessing classified documents but also admitted that they kept them in a facility that did not meet NARA standards for the storage of those documents.” The section of the letter quoted in the article states (bolded by PJ Media): The Obama Foundation agreés to transfer up to three million three hundred thousand dollars ($3,300,000) to the National Archives Trust Fund (NATF) to support the move of classified and unclassified Obama Presidential records and artifacts from Hoffman Estates to NARA-controlled facilities that conform to the agency’s archival storage standards for such records and artifacts, and for the modification of such spaces . The first transfer of $300,000 was already made on August 9, 2018. An additional interim transfer will be made within 180 days of that date. The full letter can be read here , and does indeed state the above. What the article fails to mention is that this was an agreement in which the foundation provided funds to move documents, but did not state that the foundation had control or access to those documents. There are also no ongoing investigations or credible accusations against the Obama Foundation for mishandling said documents. According to the National Archives website , the Barack Obama Presidential Library is located at 2500 W. Golf Road in the Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and contains unclassified materials, while classified records were eventually moved to the Washington, D.C., area. On Aug. 12, 2022, NARA released a statement on the location of these materials, and who maintained responsibility for them (emphasis ours): The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) assumed exclusive legal and physical custody of Obama Presidential records when President Barack Obama left office in 2017, in accordance with the Presidential Records Act (PRA). NARA moved approximately 30 million pages of unclassified records to a NARA facility in the Chicago area where they are maintained exclusively by NARA. Additionally, NARA maintains the classified Obama Presidential records in a NARA facility in the Washington, DC, area. As required by the PRA, former President Obama has no control over where and how NARA stores the Presidential records of his Administration. This location is indeed a former furniture store, but that is hardly unusual. According to the Chicago Tribune , the space was leased in February 2016 by the General Services Administration (GSA) and NARA took official custody of the documents on Jan. 20, 2017, the day of Trump’s inauguration. However, they were able to begin managing and handling the documents before then. The location is an old Plunkett’s store which was shuttered in 2009, and, contrary to the claims by PJ Media, it is secured and not open to the public. The Tribune reported that Obama’s documents would remain there until the opening of the Obama Presidential Center, and only then would some documents be available for public viewing. The article also noted that documents of previous presidents were also kept in temporary storage facilities. George H.W. Bush’s papers were kept in a “strip mall space previously occupied by a bowling alley and a Chinese restaurant,” for example, while Bill Clinton’s were in a former Oldsmobile dealership near his future library in Arkansas. Obama’s Presidential Center’s construction appears to still be in progress. Since the Obama Foundation is privately run, it will need to request to borrow artifacts or records from NARA to display at the center. NARA has said that they did receive funding from the Obama Foundation to help digitize the records, but NARA remains responsible for handling them. We should note that an ex-president, when building a presidential library, is required to provide a privately funded endowment for that library to NARA, and it must cover 60% of the cost of building the library. If the Obama Presidential Center were to include a library, the foundation would have to raise millions to endow it. However, in 2017, NARA and the foundation announced that the Obama library would be digitized, a decision that saved the foundation a lot of money. Under the digitizing plan, NARA would maintain control of all physical copies of documents once they’ve gone online, and “store and preserve the original materials in an existing NARA facility that meets NARA’s standards for archival storage.” Classified documents would go to a facility in the Washington, D.C., area. On Sept. 23, 2022, NARA released a statement maintaining that the Obama Foundation had no access to their records, which were maintained in Hoffman Estates “in accordance with archival storage standards” (emphasis ours): The Obama Foundation, an independent entity, has never had control over the records in Hoffman Estates. All records in that facility are stored and managed by NARA in accordance with archival storage standards, and all classified records were stored in an appropriately secured compartment within the facility. NARA moved these records at the end of the Obama administration to the Hoffman Estates facility under the assumption that former President Obama and his Foundation would be building and transferring to NARA a traditional, physical Presidential Library in the Chicago area. When former President Obama decided that he would not build a physical, NARA-operated Presidential Library, NARA transported the classified records back to secure locations in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. The Obama Foundation provided NARA with funds to help convert the Hoffman Estates facility and to cover some of the expenses of moving the classified records, but the foundation has never had possession or control over the records. The statement directly refutes the claim that the Obama Foundation has access to the materials in Hoffman Estates, while adding that classified records were moved to a separate secure location. The Obama Foundation states the same on its website: All of the official presidential records of the Obama administration are owned and managed by NARA. This includes 1.5 billion pages of “born digital” records—emails, PDFs, digital photos, tweets—that have no paper equivalents—along with roughly 30 million pages of paper documents and 30,000 physical artifacts. Together, these “born-digital” and digitized records and artifacts will make up NARA’s Obama Presidential Library. NARA will maintain ownership and management of these records and make them available under the same standards and practices under which they have always administered records, in accordance with the Presidential Records Act. [...] While the Museum itself will be paid for and managed by the Foundation, a substantial number of the records and artifacts on display will be loaned to the Foundation by NARA, allowing visitors to engage with presidential items as they do at other NARA-run presidential museums. We have reached out to the foundation and will update this page if we receive more information.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1383
0dcd5344-c655-4da2-876c-8a7515f12803,"Fact Check In September 2022, unfounded rumors spread on social media alleging that a coup attempt was underway in China and President Xi Jinping was under house arrest. The rumor was sourced from social media accounts and various media channels that offered no legitimate evidence for their claims. Some, for example, posted video from an explosion, connecting the flames to the alleged coup: But the video included in the tweet above shows a different event altogether -- a massive industrial explosion in the city of Tianjin in 2015 that killed 173 people. The same video can found in a compilation of such videos, taken by witnesses apparently using camera phones, published by The Guardian . The coup rumor metastasized by way of various foreign news outlets reporting only that the rumor was ""trending"" on social media, as opposed to reporting facts about the alleged event itself. Tellingly, none of these outlets pointed to evidence that any such event was underway. For example, India's English NEWJ posted a video citing vague and sundry items as ""evidence,"" such as flight cancellations, claims that Xi allegedly hasn't been spotted in public recently, and video showing military vehicles being moved by train. But the NEWJ video also pointed out that none of the sources spreading the rumor were credible. Drew Thompson, a former U.S. Department of Defense official overseeing China and visiting senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, traced the rumor to media personalities and networks associated with the Falun Gong (FLG), a spiritual movement opposed to Xi which has a track record of spreading disinformation. It's important to take note of who is not reporting this rumor. If Xi Jinping were indeed being deposed and a coup was in progress in China, it would be a major global event, covered by every major news outlet. Pro-democracy protests, which turned into a government-executed massacre of civilians in Tiananmen Square in 1989, received wall-to-wall coverage from major, international news outlets, for example. In comparison, no reputable news outlet was reporting a coup in China in late September 2022. The Guardian observed that the rumor swirled at a politically precarious moment in China, namely amid a purge of Xi's political foes and a meeting of Chinese Communist Party elites at which Xi is expected to be granted an unprecedented third term in power after eliminating the two-term limit in 2018.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,453
afe8ecb3-9e61-43d6-8a24-c4c23c88299b,"A photograph that's frequently shared online appears to show a younger Hillary Clinton, perhaps back in her days as U.S. first lady, playing a Game Boy while seated on a flight. Was the picture altered? Was Clinton perhaps originally using an old Palm PDA (personal digital assistant) or something else before someone doctored the photo with Adobe Photoshop? The answer to those two questions is no. The truth is that Clinton was authentically photographed while playing a Game Boy. The picture was captured by photographer Ralph Alswang on April 20, 2015. It was posted to Instagram by the William J. Clinton Presidential Library & Museum, which was named for her husband, former U.S. President Bill Clinton. The Instagram caption read, ""April 6, 1993: Hillary Rodham Clinton plays a Nintendo ""Game Boy"" electronic game on her flight from Austin, Texas to Washington, DC. Photographed by Ralph Alswang. #NARA #Nintendo #GameBoy #Videogames #ClintonCenter #ClintonLibrary #PresidentialLibraries #HRC #FirstLady."" The original Game Boy required four AA batteries. It's unclear if Clinton carried extras. On May 24, 1993, Carol Jouzaitis with Chicago Tribune reported that the Game Boy belonged to Clinton's daughter, Chelsea. We don't know what game Clinton was playing since the angle of the photograph obscured the title on the cartridge. However, two good guesses would be Super Mario Land and Tetris. The games were included in some of the bundles that were packaged with the original Game Boy. On July 19, 1994, Sara Williams reported for the News-Press in Fort Myers, Florida, that she did some digging in an attempt to find out what games Clinton enjoyed the most: She's dressed to the nines. Her hair is done to perfection in one of the 15 styles she wears. She's kicked off her shoes. The most powerful man in the free world rubs her toes. Faxes, dispatches, and telephone calls are on hold as she wings her way to Europe on Air Force One. She needs to unwind. So what does she choose? Game Boy. ""I've become fond of Game Boy,"" she recently told Redbook magazine. Yes, Hillary Clinton loves video games. … So I called up the White House to find out exactly what games Hillary Clinton plays on which machines, only to learn that this is a state secret. ""If we said what Mrs. Clinton likes to play, it could be considered an endorsement,"" said a press aide. It could also be an embarrassment. ""Tetris,"" after all, was invented in Russia at least 15 years ago, quite possibly as a sop to the hungry and disgruntled masses who had no access to the goods. Clinton later went on to serve as a U.S. senator for the state of New York and as secretary of state under former U.S. President Barack Obama.

b8479148-de52-4e21-98e1-e01573248d6c,"It's true that film actor Tommy Lee Jones and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore were roommates in college. Gore, a leading climate activist and a former Democratic presidential candidate in the 2000 U.S. presidential election, first met Jones on the campus of Harvard College in 1965. Jones has won awards for his roles in numerous films, perhaps most notably his best supporting actor Oscar for the 1994 film ""The Fugitive,"" which starred Harrison Ford in the leading role. College Days In 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected to his first presidential term. Gore was his running mate. Prior to Election Day, The Associated Press ran a story headlined, ""Tipper Gore: A One-Time Motorcycle Mamma."" The article told the story of the days when the two roommates would cause a bit of trouble and make a run from the police: BOSTON (AP) — Tipper Gore likens the Democratic presidential campaign bus tour to a double date with Bill and Hillary Clinton, but not so daring as double dates in college. She, Al Gore, and their friends would pile onto one motorcycle and turn down narrow alleys to ditch the police. ""I would get up on the handlebars, and then there would be Al, and then there would be my roommate, and then there would be Tommy Lee Jones,"" Mrs. Gore said during a visit to the city where she went to college. Tommy Lee Jones became an actor, Al Gore became the Democrats' vice presidential nominee and Mrs. Gore returned to her alma mater, Boston University, this week to stump for the Clinton presidential campaign. 'One of My Closest Friends' While serving as Clinton's vice president for two terms, Gore set his sights on the presidency. In 2000, he won the Democratic primary for president. At the time, multiple newspapers published the fact that Jones and Gore were roommates during their time at Harvard College. That August, Jones spoke briefly about his friend in front of a crowd at the Democratic National Convention, calling Gore one of his ""closest friends."" Jones' Convention Speech The speech in Los Angeles began like this: Al Gore has been one of my closest friends since the day we met on the first day of college 35 years ago. There are plenty of people at this convention who can and will speak to big policy questions, but I have one very real issue to talk about. One I can probably address as well as anyone outside the Gore family. And that is the quality of this man's character. He is a good, caring, loving man. I know 35 different people at least who have known Al Gore for 35 years at least and I know that every single one of them will tell you the same thing. I lived with him for four years, and what did we do? We shot pool and we watched ""Star Trek"" when maybe we should have been studying for exams. He'd challenge me to shooting contests. We'd see who can hit a tin can from the farthest away, and I tell you, it was usually Al. My parents lived overseas when I was in college, and the Gore home in Carthage was always open to me. When I visited Al in middle Tennessee, we did the complicated things you'd expect college kids to do. We'd catch a loose cow, go canoeing and hunting, and chasing through the woods with coon dogs in the middle of the night. One time in college, neither of us could make it home for Thanksgiving, so we made a fire in the venerable old fireplace in our room and we wrapped a big turkey in a couple of rolls of tin foil and rustled it right there in the dorm. I know from Tipper that that has been some of the most ambitious cooking that Albert has done since then. And there were serious times too. We were all affected by the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, and our country's tragic involvement in southeast Asia. I remember how Al struggled to hold on to his faith at a time when it seemed like America was losing its way. And I can tell you, Al Gore never did lose faith in America. Jones' speech continued with various remembrances about his former college roommate, including a moment when he said of Gore, ""Al is the closest thing I've had to a brother.""

c8c8547b-ac64-4dc3-86d7-8a3298c0de78,"Fact Check In the summer of 2022, some social media users shared posts alleging that U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order that would replace cash with cryptocurrency, and allow the government to track and control people's finances and spending. ""Biden Orders US Dollar Replaced with Trackable 'Spyware' Version,"" announced a rattling headline from a website called Paradigm Press. Paradigm Press reported Biden's ""order"" stemmed from Executive Order 14067, titled, ""Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets,"" signed by Biden on March 9, 2022. The Paradigm Press story dramatically asserts that Section 4 of the order basically sets up a dystopian, authoritarian regime by eliminating cash in favor of government-issued digital currency, allegedly authorizing the following: The language in Section 4 makes Order 14067… …the most treacherous act by a sitting President in the history of our republic. Because Section 4 sets the stage for… Legal government surveillance of all US citizens… Total control over your bank accounts and purchases… And the ability to silence all dissenting voices for good. In this new war on freedom, the Dems aren’t coming for your guns. No, they’re thinking much bigger than that… They’re coming for your money. The executive order in question doesn't make any of those sweeping changes to the U.S. system of government, nor does it ""set the stage"" for such changes. It instead lays out the Biden administration's intent to take a multi-agency government approach to examining the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency. The order, according to the White House, focuses on six areas: The Order lays out a national policy for digital assets across six key priorities: consumer and investor protection; financial stability; illicit finance; U.S. leadership in the global financial system and economic competitiveness; financial inclusion; and responsible innovation. We found no language in Section 4 of the nine-section order that calls for replacing the U.S. dollar with digital currency, or takes any of the other drastic, unconstitutional steps listed by the Paradigm Press website. Section 4 instead instructs various federal government agencies to explore the benefits and risks to the U.S. financial system of issuing digital government currency (central bank digital currencies, or CBDCs), and report how such a system would be implemented. The U.S. Attorney General, for example, is required to report whether and what legislation would be needed to in the event the U.S. government would issue CBDCs. Section 4 also specifically states that, hypothetically, if the U.S. were to implement a future digital monetary system, it would have to protect the rights of citizens in keeping with, ""democratic values, including privacy protections, and that ensures the global financial system has appropriate transparency, connectivity, and platform and architecture interoperability or transferability, as appropriate."" The U.S. Federal Reserve stated that the potential issuing of CBDCs would entail the expansion of means of payment, not the elimination of one, namely cash. ""The Federal Reserve is committed to ensuring the continued safety and availability of cash and is considering a CBDC as a means to expand safe payment options, not to reduce or replace them,"" the agency said. According to the White House, the move is in response to the rapidly expanding use of cryptocurrencies, with an estimated 16 percent of Americans (about 40 million adults) stating they have used cryptocurrency assets. ""Over 100 countries are exploring or piloting Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), a digital form of a country’s sovereign currency,"" according to a White House fact sheet on the executive order. According to a tracking tool provided by international policy think tank Atlantic Council, many countries are in various stages of research, testing, piloting, and implementing such currencies.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,704

Amid speculation about the guest list for the funeral, one TikTok video claimed that the queen expressly did not want former President Donald Trump to be on the guest list. There is no available evidence confirming the veracity of this claim. In fact, according to official documents received by Politico, only current heads of state and their partners were invited to the attend the funeral in the U.K. Trump, being a former head of state, does not qualify. The office of former President Jimmy Carter confirmed to the news media that he did not receive an invitation. The offices of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, and George W. Bush have not yet commented. U.K.’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), in a message sent to overseas embassies said that they “[regret] that, because of limited space at the state funeral service and associated events, no other members of the principal guest’s family, staff or entourage may be admitted.” However, heads of state unable to attend will be able to choose someone else as their official representative. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, however, confirmed that the Bidens would be in attendance. During a press briefing aboard Air Force One on Sept. 12, 2022, she said: [...] the invitation for the President and the First Lady came in the form of a note verbale sent from the protocol directorate of the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office.  It was received late Saturday night.  And as you all know, the President accepted the invitation on Sunday morning. And so as far as invites, I would refer you to the United — the United Kingdom, their government, on that protocol generally. The invitation was — extended to the U.S. government was for the President and the First Lady only. Someone asked her if Biden could invite other former presidents to join him, to which she said: Again, this is a decision that is — that is made for the UK government.  They decide who gets invited.  Again, the invite was for the President and the First Lady only.  It is for them to move to decide on how they’re going to proceed with invites, and they have. In a statement on Truth Social and the Daily Mail website, Trump expressed his admiration for the Queen, writing: “Spending time with Her Majesty was one of the most extraordinary honors of my life.I grew up in a household where Queen Elizabeth — her grace, her charm, her nobility — were deeply admired, especially by my mother, who came from Scotland.” Given that the U.K. invitations have only been extended to current heads of state, and the Bidens have confirmed their attendance, there is no evidence that Trump was deliberately excluded, or that such was the Queen’s express wish.

For example, The Florida Standard reported , ""Book in Tampa Middle School Library Has Instructions on Anal Sex and Hookup Apps."" As of the writing of this story, we can report it was true that author Juno Dawson's book, ""This Book Is Gay,"" was available on the shelves of the Pierce Middle School library in Tampa . The school is part of Hillsborough County Public Schools, which is described as ""the 7th largest district in the United States."" It was also true that the book includes a chapter with information and instructions that teaches kids about anal sex, oral sex, and hookup apps. In this article, we've laid out all of the facts to help inform our readers about this subject. We've included a link to a school board meeting video, text from an advisory in the book, pictures of pages that were being discussed, further context, and answers from our correspondence with the school district. Board Meeting Speech On Aug. 31, Just The News reported that Will Witt, The Florida Standard's editor in chief, spoke at a school board meeting ""against the book being available in children's libraries."" The speech was tweeted on Witt's Twitter account on Aug. 30, the same day as the meeting. It has since been retweeted and liked thousands of times: Chapter Introduction One of the chapters that appeared to receive the most attention in the reporting from The Florida Standard and from social media users was titled, ""Chapter 9: The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex."" The chapter begins with the following advisory: This chapter is about sex. Therefore it has sex in it. WELL, DUH. If you are a younger reader and you feel you aren't ready for the finer details of same-sex pairings, then simply skip this whole chapter. HOWEVER, before you do, I'd like to remind you that we taught you all about straight sex when you were ELEVEN YEARS OLD during sixth grade. The fact that they didn't also teach you what same-sex couples do is nothing less than institutionalized homophobia. Straight sex was presented as the norm to make five percent of the population feel abnormal. Is there something icky about gay sex? Is there something wrong with it? I challenge any politician to discuss this with me. I WILL RUIN THEM. This chapter is simply all the stuff teachers SHOULD be saying if they want to be inclusive of people with same-sex feelings. We contacted the school district with several questions for our story. As part of one question, we mentioned the two bolded sentences above. In response, a spokesperson for the district told us that the quote ""is from a book that is not representative of our curriculum."" (More of their answers to our other questions are available near the end of this article.) 'The Ins and Outs of Gay Sex' Social media users shared pages from the book that taught about how to have anal sex and oral sex. The book also made mention of Grindr, a mobile app that provides sexual encounter opportunities (hookups) for men. We verified that all of these pages did come from Dawson's book, ""This Book Is Gay."" Sex Diagram Pages The Florida Standard and social media users also described a page in the book with a diagram of a naked boy. The diagram was titled as, ""Part One: Boy-On-Boy Sex."" We continued reading the chapter and found the next part to be titled, ""Part Two: Girl-On-Girl Sex."" It showed a diagram of a naked girl. However, none of the articles or social media posts that we reviewed included information that expressed any outrage about the second diagram, nor did they make any mention whatsoever about the part about girls having sex with each other. They only referenced the page about boys. Available in Three Schools According to online library data for the Florida school district, we were able to confirm that two copies of ""This Book Is Gay"" were indeed part of Pierce Middle School's library selection. The book also showed up as being listed at Middleton High School and Tampa Bay Technical High School, which were in the same district. ""This Book Is Gay"" showed up in three local schools, including Pierce Middle. Book Hasn't Been Officially Challenged By email, a spokesperson for Hillsborough County Public Schools told us that, as of Sept. 1, ""no one has officially challenged this book at any of the three schools where it is available."" We also inquired about the general policies that the district follows regarding challenging a book at a school library. In response, they provided the following information: We have a process that allows anyone to challenge a book they feel is inappropriate on the school level. Parents are encouraged to speak to their librarian first, who can then discuss the concerns, and the school's Educational Media Materials Committee can then convene to review the challenged material. Committee members then read or view the material in its entirety and consult professional review and academic resources to weigh the merits against alleged faults in light of the material as a whole. The committee then determines the extent to which the material meets the criteria for selection. They make an ultimate decision on whether the book will remain on the shelf at that school. The school district's website featured further documentation about its policies.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., in which she stated her disagreement with the Biden administration's plan to forgive some federal student loan debt. In the video included in the tweet above, Greene used an appearance on right wing broadcaster Newsmax to opine that it's ""completely unfair"" to some taxpayers, namely those that didn't take out a student loan, to ""have to pay off the great big student loan debt"" of others. The White House's clap-back tweet was in reference to reports that Taylor Commercial, a construction company owned by Greene and her husband, received money through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The tactic has been used to attack other conservatives, although in the case of commentator Ben Shapiro, it backfired because he didn't get a $20,832 PPP loan, as some had claimed. U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) records show Greene's company accepted $182,300 in PPP loan money in April 2020, and that it was ""Paid in full or forgiven,"" which refers to loans ""repaid and those fully forgiven from repayment under PPP guidelines,"" per the SBA. A database of PPP loans provided by the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica, which obtained data from the SBA via public records, shows that Taylor Commercial had a total of $183,504 forgiven, including accrued interest. We reached out to Greene's office asking for comment on the controversy, and were provided a statement that didn't address the student loan/PPP loan discourse, but instead pointed to swatting incidents targeting Greene's home. ""It's a shame that [U.S. President] Joe Biden and his spokesmen in the media continue to make MTG a target simply because she is outspoken against Democrat policies, like genital mutilation surgeries for minors,"" the statement read, a likely reference to surgeries performed on some transgender people as part of gender affirming care (although such procedures are rarely performed on minors). There is important context to this controversy, namely that student loans and PPP loans are entirely different in their purpose and structure. PPP loans were given during the COVID-19 pandemic to businesses with the expectation that, if used as intended, they would be forgiven. Many businesses had no choice but to cease or curtail operations during the height of the pandemic, and the program was intended to prevent them from laying off workers or going under. Student loans, on the other hand, are sought by those seeking higher education and are taken out with the expectation that they will be paid back.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,500

However, the clip had been digitally manipulated to create the false impression that DeSantis expressed approval of the execution of the search warrant . He did not. The video clip, as originally shared on Twitter by its creator, Timothy Burke , ostensibly documented a segment of Fox News' ""Hannity"" show on which both DeSantis and Lara Trump were guests: If you watch the video with a careful eye, however, it's easy to detect that it was pieced together from separate, unrelated clips of DeSantis, Trump, and Hannity to create the impression that the three debated one another on Hannity's show. But the DeSantis clip , which dates from 2020, has nothing to do with the Mar-a-Lago raid. Rather, it shows DeSantis speaking to a WPTV reporter about a law enforcement raid at the home of Rebekah Jones , a former Florida Department of Health data scientist.

New York Post reporters visited the golf club and photographed Ivana Trump’s grave. Their report included a number of shots from different angles, including one revealing a wooded area near the site. A source told the New York Post that Ivana was buried not too far from the club house. According to the report, she was buried in a place that was not visible to golfers as they tee off for a round of golf. The small section of the club where she was buried is below the backside of the first tee. A number of memes consisting of edited versions of those photographs went viral in late July 2022, with one in particular getting tens of thousands of likes and comments on Instagram. The image — posted by Instagram account homegrownterrorists — showed a golf cart rolling past what appeared to be Ivana Trump's gravesite. It's clear that this photograph is fake when it's compared to the pictures published in the New York Post article . The gravesite has been inserted into a wider shot of a golf cart on a golf course fairway. Unlike the Post's photographs, the manipulated image doesn’t show a wooded area immediately adjacent to the grave. A separate rumor speculates that Trump used the burial site for tax break purposes. Indeed, the New Jersey tax code does exempt cemetery land from all taxes, rates, and assessments. Potentially, her grave could save the property from paying a significant sum in a state with high tax rates. According to the code , a cemetery company is exempt from paying real property taxes, income taxes, sales and use taxes, business taxes, and inheritance taxes; cemetery trust funds are also exempt from taxes. Trump has expressed his desire to be buried at the New Jersey golf course for years. His company even described it as his “favorite property” in a 2014 filing with the state. A 2017 Washington Post report revealed how he had been trying to convince local authorities to let him build cemeteries at the golf course since 2007. After numerous attempts, two of his plans were approved around 2017, but construction for them had not begun. The 2017 report said that the Trump Organization still needed to apply for state approval to make the land a public cemetery. However, Ivana Trump is the first known family member to be buried at the Bedminster golf club. Brooke Harrington , a sociology professor at Dartmouth and tax researcher, pointed out that the tax code has no stipulation for a minimum number of human remains needed for the tax breaks to apply. Documents published by ProPublica show that the Trump Family Trust had sought to designate a property in nearby Hackettstown, New Jersey, as a non-profit cemetery company. However, this was not the first time Trump had been accused of trying to reduce his taxes on the property by varying its use. A 2016 Wall Street Journal report found that the golf club benefited from a farmland tax break because part of the land was designated for agricultural purposes — specifically for hay production and a small herd of goats. The Huffington Post reported in 2019 that he had saved around $88,000 that year. New Jersey laws state “a landowner must have no less than five acres of farmland actively devoted to an agricultural or horticultural use for the two years immediately preceding the tax year being applied for and meet specific minimum gross income requirements based on the productivity of the land.” A representative for the Trump Organization told Fortune magazine that the links being drawn between Ivana Trump's gravesite and tax laws were “truly evil.” While it is unknown if the choice of this location for her grave had any connection to taxes, the Trump family has a history of seeking ways to reduce tax bills. Furthermore, given the photographs, and an acknowledgement from a Trump representative regarding the location of her grave while denying the rumors connecting it to tax laws, we rate the overall claim as “True.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,783
d471dcc1-5d1c-4495-9d66-df49bd7463bd,"Fact Check Conservatives online have been taking offense at the use of gender pronouns to introduce oneself, particularly after Vice President Kamala Harris described herself with “she/her” pronouns in a meeting at the White House in late July 2022. Anger at pronoun usage has been ongoing for a long time as part of resistance to gender-inclusive language that accommodates the needs of transgender and nonbinary people. Some conservatives, like this GOP congressional candidate in Florida, have been tweeting out criticisms of the practice: Many have pointed out that the Constitution is filled with pronouns, however. Merriam-Webster defines pronouns as “any of a small set of words (such as I, she, he, you, it, we, or they) in a language that are used as substitutes for nouns or noun phrases and whose referents are named or understood in the context.” Indeed, pronouns are a necessary part of the English language, and the Constitution famously begins with the pronoun “We”: We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. According to Darrell A.H. Miller, a professor of law at Duke University, pointed out that the early meaning of this “We” was not very inclusive, and there were no female pronouns in the Constitution: How egalitarian is this We ? In the early republic, not very. African Americans certainly were not included in this We . Nor were women, except in some derivative sense, perhaps. But, the Fourteenth Amendment, Brown v. Board of Education, the Warren Court revolution, the (stymied but influential) Equal Rights Amendment, the elevation of one, then two, then four women to the High Court, Obergefell v. Hodges , 17 all made the We more capacious. As Kathleen Sullivan notes: “When new groups were recognized as members of the popular sovereign, The People fundamentally altered their national identity and recommitted to their newly shared commitments.” The We came to contain multitudes.” He added that the “​​The Constitution leans heavily on the pronoun they. ” He explains how this pronoun was used and the possible meanings behind it: They and its cognates appear over fifty times in the Constitution, often, but not exclusively, to describe the structure of the legislative powers in a House of Representatives and a Senate assembled in Congress. The House is a they ; the Senate is a they ; the Congress is a they . Coming so quickly after the stirring pronouncement that the Constitution was ordained by “We the People of the United States,” the switch to the third person plural is somewhat jarring. A majestic statement about unity and nation building, about us , quickly turning into a them . But perhaps this should come as no surprise. As most historians note, the Founding generation was deeply skeptical of anything that smacked of unchecked “democracy”— which they associated with intemperance, demagoguery, and tyranny. It should not come as a shock then that when the institutions of representative government are referenced, it is with a pronoun that stands at a step removed from the sovereign people. Other buffers between the people and the organs of government are similarly smothered in they — the Electoral College, the life-tenured Article III judiciary. This is not the only time Spicer tried to score a political point with these statements that defy or ignore the very rules of the English language. On July 24, 2022, she tweeted , “There are no pronouns in the Bible.” Except, of course, there are , starting with God who is referred to as “he.” So unless there are different definitions of pronouns we are unaware of, these claims are “False.”",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,737
f44b29e1-620c-459c-ab0e-11e85109a204,"Fact Check Is a recession defined as two consecutive fiscal quarters of falling gross domestic product , or GDP? (GDP is defined as the money value of all goods and services purchased by consumers in the country at a point in time.) That's the crux of what critics of U.S. President Joe Biden alleged in July 2022 social media posts and commentary claiming the White House ""changed the definition"" of what a recession is. For example, Donald Trump, Jr., the eldest son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, stated in a Twitter post, ""Apparently The White House is changing the definition of recession this week so we can pretend that we’re not in one."" ""BREAKING NOW,"" conservative social media personality and former Florida candidate for Congress Chuck Callesto tweeted . ""Reports Swirling The White House will be CHANGING THE DEFINITION OF RECESSION as a second quarter of negative growth looms.."" Did the White House Change the Definition of 'Recession'? The short answer is no -- but that doesn't mean we're not in a recession, nor does it mean the White House hasn't been doing all it can to get out in front of bad economic news. We will explain. The tweets quoted above may give readers the misleading impression that the Biden administration literally tried to revise the criteria economists use to determine when a recession has occurred. But that was not the case. Those criteria are determined and assessed by a committee that is part of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), an independent nonprofit organization. The NBER's Business Cycle Dating Committee is made up of eight elite economists who weigh a number of factors -- not just whether the economy shrank for two consecutive fiscal quarters -- and act as the official arbiters who make the call on whether or not there's a recession. Among the factors considered are personal incomes, employment, consumer spending, retail sales, and industrial production. ""There is no fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in our decisions,"" according to the NBER. Therefore, in the U.S., there is no formal definition for what constitutes a recession, said Nicholas Bloom, economics professor at Stanford University. And because it takes awhile for the necessary data to come out, the NBER committee often doesn't determine that the U.S. is in a recession until months, or sometimes even a year, after it's already happened. ""It's always backwards-looking,"" Bloom said. Outside the U.S., nevertheless, the two-quarter downturn rule is a widely used metric, said David Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth. On July 28, 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that the GDP had indeed fallen for the second consecutive quarter. In the tweets quoted above, critics of the White House aimed to draw attention to how the Biden administration was pushing back against ""recession"" talk ahead of the November 2022 midterm elections, emphasizing factors like a strong employment rate over two consecutive quarters of GDP contraction. Where Did the Claim About a 'Definition Change' Originate? On July 21, 2022, the White House published a blog post titled, ""How Do Economists Determine Whether the Economy Is in a Recession?"" The post, in short, challenged the idea maintained by ""some"" that a recession is defined by two consecutive fiscal quarters of a shrinking economy. ""Instead, both official determinations of recessions and economists’ assessment of economic activity are based on a holistic look at the data — including the labor market, consumer and business spending, industrial production, and incomes,"" the blog post said. The post added that NBER, as ""the official recession scorekeeper,"" defines recession as ""a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months"" which includes data on factors like personal income, employment, consumer spending and industrial production. Many widely-shared social media posts took screenshots from the White House blog post and claimed they documented the executive branch's attempt to ""redefine"" recession. For example, Jacqui Heinrich, White House correspondent for Fox News, tweeted : Bracing for impact: Even if Thursday's GDP report shows a second consecutive quarter of negative growth, you won't hear the Biden admin using the R-word. The Council of Economic Advisers is redefining what a recession is… So Is the U.S. in a Recession or Not? The short answer: It's subjective, until the NBER panel calls it a recession. That said, some social media posts appeared to be aimed at leveraging the economic pain and anxiety many in the U.S. were experiencing, in part due to the rising costs associated with inflation , for political gain. Some insinuated that the U.S. was, in fact, in a recession, and that the Biden administration was either in denial or ""moving the goalposts"" in an attempt to mislead people into believing times were better than they actually were. By the same token, other indicators , like strong jobs and income numbers, had some claiming they point to good economic health overall. But Blanchflower, who predicted the 2008 ""Great Recession"" a year before it happened, said he believes the U.S. is, in fact, in the midst of a recession, an observation that has made him rather unpopular with some. Blanchflower predicts that the NBER committee will make the call that a recession in the U.S. began in January 2022. A key predictor that is often overlooked by economists, Blanchflower added, is consumer confidence, which as of July 2022 was at its lowest point since February 2021. ""From April, May, June of last year onward, people started to worry about what was coming and started pulling back on their spending,"" Blanchflower told Snopes in a phone interview. ""And then of course, as the price of gas goes up, people have to pay gas, heat, air conditioning bills, so what do they do? They don’t buy other things."" That puts the businesses affected by those decisions out of business, Blanchflower said. ""That's a recession."" Regardless of what the NBER eventually decides, Blanchflower said, ordinary readers of Snopes probably have a better nose for what the economic forecast holds than experts. He calls it ""applied common sense,"" or ""the economics of walking about,"" because members of the general public and businesses are good at seeing what's coming and act on it with their spending patterns. He noted that although many have been pointing to a strong employment rate, the Bureau of Labor Statistics in early July 2022 released statistics that showed a loss of 315,000 jobs in a survey of households. It isn't just the U.S. experiencing a slowdown. The forces tamping down U.S. economic growth are global in nature -- namely the COVID-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine, and inflation. In late July 2022, the International Monetary Fund warned that a global downturn could be at hand.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1330

A clearly doctored photograph showing him kneeling in front of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman made the rounds in mid-July 2022, after the leaders had a high-profile meeting in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The photograph was tweeted by right-leaning pundit Sebastian Gorka who also served under former President Donald Trump. The original picture of Biden kneeling was taken from another moment back in 2020, which we fact-checked on a separate occasion. In that story Biden was campaigning for the presidency in Detroit in September 2020 and knelt down in front of a young boy. In fact, the exact photograph of him kneeling that was later placed into the above image with the crown prince was shared by Reuters Pictures Editor Corinne Perkins in 2020: This picture has the same angle as the one in the above tweet from Gorka. Biden himself shared the moment from a slightly different angle on his Instagram account: We also looked through photographs taken from the meeting, and found nothing that indicated the president had kneeled in front of the prince. While Biden did not kneel in front of the crown prince, he did greet him with a fist bump , which the Saudi government was quick to spread across social media. During his meetings with the crown prince and his father King Salman, Biden raised his concerns over the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and emphasized that he thought Bin Salman was responsible. Khashoggi, a U.S.-based journalist, was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. A U.S. intelligence report released in 2021 said the prince likely approved the killing. Bin Salman has, however, has denied any involvement.

The post, published by Teatro El Shadday on July 20 , contained the text ""Supreme Court FINALLY signs VERDICT to IMPEACH Speaker Pelosi as Hunter's Laptop IMPLICATES her."" It also featured a 10-minute video montage of several prominent Republican senators and Congress members making speeches from the floors of their respective chambers: None of those remarks even mentioned the putative decision — supposedly by the Supreme Court — to impeach Pelosi. The primary reason for that was that the court had not made any decision or pronouncement about Pelosi's impeachment, because in reality, the court has no role whatsoever in the removal of a House speaker or member. The claim was inaccurate and nonsensical, and our rating is ""False."" Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution states the following: Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member. Therefore, if members of the House wish to remove or expel any member, including the speaker, a simple two-thirds majority vote is all that is required, and the question of impeachment — which also requires the agreement of the Senate and would therefore be unnecessarily onerous — does not arise. In any case, Article I, Section 2, Clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution states the following: The House of Representatives shall [choose] their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment. So even in the highly unlikely hypothetical scenario in which, for some reason, House members wished to attempt to impeach their speaker — rather than simply voting to remove or expel — the Supreme Court would have no role whatsoever in initiating that process, which has in any case never taken place in U.S. history.

In our research, we found a variety of sources that confirmed that the key points made in the viral copypasta were accurate. The viral Facebook post about DeSantis ' life began with the following bit about an April 2021 segment on the CBS News program, ""60 Minutes"": Just in case you were wondering why 60 minutes had a hit piece on this Paisan - the Governor of Florida. Anyone who criticizes him - I have a question for you - can you please post your education and service to our country resume so we can put things in perspective?

According to the article, the news magazine TV show failed to provide ""substantial evidence"" after claiming that DeSantis gave the Publix grocery store chain ""preferential treatment to distribute COVID-19 vaccines."" The charge was that DeSantis favored Publix simply because they donated to his campaign. He responded to the segment by calling it ""irresponsible"" and ""a lie."" According to the Poynter article, ""it doesn’t appear as if DeSantis did anything wrong."" The rest of the Facebook post recounted DeSantis' accomplishments before entering politics. It read as follows: Ronald Dion DeSantis was born on September 14, 1978, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Karen (née Rogers) and Ronald DeSantis. He is of Italian descent. His family moved to Orlando, Florida, before relocating to Dunedin, Florida, when he was six years old. In 1991, he was a member of the Little League team from Dunedin National that made it to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Dunedin High School in 1997, DeSantis attended Yale University. He was captain of Yale's varsity baseball team and joined the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. On the Yale baseball team, DeSantis was an outfielder; as a senior in 2001, he had the team's best batting average at .336. He graduated from Yale in 2001 with a B.A. magna cum laude in history. He then spent a year as a history teacher at the Darlington School. DeSantis then attended Harvard Law School, graduating in 2005 with a Juris Doctor cum laude. DeSantis received his Reserve Naval officer's commission and assignment to the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAG) in 2004 at the U.S. Naval Reserve Center in Dallas, Texas, while still a student at Harvard Law School. He completed Naval Justice School in 2005. Later that year, he received orders to the JAG Trial Service Office Command South East at Naval Station Mayport, Florida, as a prosecutor. In 2006, he was promoted from lieutenant, junior grade to lieutenant. He worked for the commander of Joint Task Force-Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), working directly with detainees at the Guantanamo Bay Joint Detention Facility. In 2007, DeSantis reported to the Naval Special Warfare Command Group in Coronado, California, where he was assigned to SEAL Team One and deployed to Iraq with the troop surge as the Legal Advisor to the SEAL Commander, Special Operations Task Force-West in Fallujah. DeSantis returned to the U.S. in April 2008, at which time he was reassigned to the Naval Region Southeast Legal Service. The U.S. Department of Justice appointed him to serve as an Assistant U.S. Attorney at the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Middle District of Florida. DeSantis was assigned as a trial defense counsel until his honorable discharge from active duty in February 2010. He concurrently accepted a reserve commission as a lieutenant in the Judge Advocate General's Corps of the US Navy Reserve. He was awarded the Bronze Star Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal. #DeSantis #leadership We weren't able to find documentation to verify the exact dates cited for all of these items.

f51d259a-0ab2-4282-a248-0d447c298a4f,"Fact Check In late June 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortions nationwide, Ohio outlawed abortions for people who have been pregnant for six weeks or longer. Soon after, in July, several news outlets reported that Ohio's law forced a 10-year-old girl who had gotten pregnant by rape to travel to the neighboring state of Indiana to legally terminate the pregnancy. Many people, including politicians and members of the media , questioned the veracity of the story. We reached out to its source , an Indianapolis-based OBGYN, and we did not receive a response. About a week after the story went viral, a 27-year-old man was jailed and charged with raping the girl, according to reputable news outlets . As news of that arrest circulated online, a rumor surfaced claiming that Ohio's abortion law would have actually allowed the girl to legally terminate the pregnancy in that state — in other words, she supposedly could have avoided the trip to Indiana for an abortion. For instance, Glenn Greenwald , a journalist and lawyer, stated in a tweet thread, ""Ohio has a rape exception in its law..."" But that was not the case. Ohio's law banning abortions for people who have been pregnant for six weeks or longer did not make an exception for rape victims, as of July 2022. For that reason, we rated this claim ""False."" The false claim stemmed from a July 11 Fox News segment featuring Ohio’s Attorney General Dave Yost. In that interview, Yost claimed that the 10-year-old rape victim could have actually sought treatment in Ohio because of that law's fine print. However, in his comments, Yost did not explicitly claim that the law had an exception for rape victims; that rumor appeared to be a result of people's misinterpretation of his remarks regarding the law's perimeters. He said on Fox News: Ohio’s heartbeat law has a medical emergency exception broader than just the life of the mother. This young girl, if she exists, and if this horrible thing actually happened to her — breaks my heart to think about it — she did not have to leave Ohio to find treatment. What does Ohio’s law actually state , as of mid-July 2022? According to the law , the ban does not apply to pregnant people — no matter the length of their pregnancy — if/when physicians believe an abortion would prevent death or serious physical harm to those patients. In other words, as the law states , a physician “who performs a medical procedure that, in the physician's reasonable medical judgment, is designed or intended to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman,"" is a physician operating legally. We reached out to Yost’s office to ask if, or to what extent, that language or any other exceptions in the law apply to rape victims. In response, the office shared a document with us titled, ""Explainer Regarding Ohio's Heartbeat Law Exceptions."" That statement, which also appeared on the office's website, read: The statute contains three exceptions, though they are not labeled as such: one to prevent the death of the mother, the second, due to a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant mother, and the third in cases of an ectopic pregnancy. But what would constitute as a ""serious risk"" to a ""major bodily function?"" The attorney general's explainer defined that to mean: [...] any medically diagnosed condition that so complicates the pregnancy of the woman as to directly or indirectly cause the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function . A medically diagnosed condition that constitutes a “serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function” includes preeclampsia, inevitable abortion , and premature rupture of the membranes, may include, but is not limited to, diabetes and multiple sclerosis, and does not include a condition related to the woman's mental health. The guidance continued, “Whether these exceptions apply to a particular case depends on the facts of that case.” As far as the 10-year-old rape victim, it was unknown if, or to what extent, the exceptions to Ohio's law would have allowed her to legally terminate the pregnancy in the state. Aaron Blake, a writer for the Washington Post, wrote in a July 14 analysis of the statute and attorney general's statements that it was “certainly conceivable that a prosecutor would decide or a court would rule that this case would qualify for that second exception"" — in reference to the exception for pregnant people who could risk serious physical harm giving birth because of her young age. Elizabeth Nash, a researcher with Guttmacher Institute, also weighed in, arguing that Yost's claim that the child could have legally obtained an abortion in her home state downplayed the impact of Ohio's ban. Furthermore, from Nash's point of view, the law's ambiguous language to describe exceptions to the ban created challenges for providers and patients. Maria Phillis, an OB-GYN in Ohio, told the Ohio Capitol Journal that, from her read, the state's abortion ban made two exceptions for the health of the pregnant person. For one, she said, physicians can legally perform abortions in emergency situations, like when patients are ""imminently bleeding out on the table, or having a stroke or cardiac arrest."" In those cases, they would ask themselves, '""if I don’t do something right now, somebody’s going to suffer death or severe consequences."" The other exception would apply to less urgent situations: when physicians determine that birth would risk a pregnant person experiencing ""substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function."" That can happen no matter a pregnant person's age, she said. “Pregnancy itself overall is a risk for anyone who enters it,” Phillis said. “It completely alters the broad physiology of the body. It alters the heart function. […] It alters kidney function. It alters a number of different body systems and folks that have preexisting disease or complications are at a higher risk of bad outcomes.” While children and teenagers who are pregnant certainly face a different set of risks compared to adults, Phillis said determining a patient's risk happens on a case-by-case basis. As far as the 10-year-old mentioned above, she said, it's hard to say whether her age would ""put her at a higher risk than other conditions, say chronic hypertension, chronic diabetes."" Court records in Franklin County, Ohio, indicated the suspect in the 10-year-old's case was arraigned on July 13 on charges of raping a child under the age of 13, a felony, and was being held on $2 million bond at Franklin County Correctional Center in Columbus. He was due back in court for a preliminary hearing on July 22, as of this writing.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1340

When Liz Truss resigned months later, on Oct. 20, we published a new story about Larry outlasting four, not three, British prime ministers. Being the first cat of the United Kingdom is not an easy job, especially when you have to deal with a revolving door of prime ministers. In July 2022, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced his resignation as Conservative Party leader – and eventually as prime minister – after a series of scandals , and a collapse in support from his government ministers. While Johnson announced he would stay on until a replacement was selected, someone else will have a longer tenure than him: Larry the cat has been in residence at 10 Downing Street since Feb. 15, 2011, according to the British government’s official page , and was the first cat to hold the title of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. He was adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home. According to the official government website , he has many roles: He has captured the hearts of the Great British public and the press teams often camped outside the front door. In turn the nation sends him gifts and treats daily. Larry spends his days greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences and testing antique furniture for napping quality. His day-to-day responsibilities also include contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house. Larry says this is still ‘in tactical planning stage’. Larry has also outlasted three prime ministers, assuming he will still be present at 10 Downing Street after Johnson leaves his role. He arrived toward the early part of David Cameron’s tenure from 2010 to 2016, was a part of the household through Theresa May’s time from 2016 to 2019, and is expected to outlast Johnson’s tenure in the office. Cameron was believed to have a chilly relationship with Larry, and he posted a picture of the cat in his lap in an effort to dispel such rumors. May also hinted that she was more of a dog person. While a timetable for Johnson’s replacement had yet to be confirmed as of this writing, it took several weeks before he took over from his predecessor May. Larry himself has not commented on the upcoming changes. Meanwhile, Larry is expected to be waiting in 10 Downing Street and will likely be unimpressed with whoever is the new occupant.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,455

On July 7, for example, Twitter users posted pictures of the statue, along with captions that characterized the move as expert trolling on the part of Madame Tussauds: The photos were authentic and not the result of digital manipulation, and the descriptions accurately stated that Madame Tussauds in Blackpool had deliberately placed their figure of Johnson outside a nearby Jobcentre Plus, as a joke or publicity stunt.

In recent years, the same core claim — that Biden once voted in favor of effectively overturning Roe and returning abortion policy to the states and the U.S. Congress — has featured in news articles by the The New York Times , Fox News , and the New York Post . That claim is accurate, although Biden did vote against an identical proposal just one year later. Our rating is ""True."" What Exactly Was the 1982 Vote About? The vote in question took place on March 10, 1982. Biden, then a U.S. senator for Delaware and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was considering a proposal put forward by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The proposal, Senate Joint Resolution 110 , contained the following text: Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of each house concurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States within seven years from the date of its submission by the Congress: ""ARTICLE — ""A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution. The Congress and the several States shall have concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortion: Provided, That a provision of a law of a State which is more restrictive than a conflicting provision of a law of Congress shall govern."" The key finding of Roe was that the U.S. constitution — in particular the ""due process"" clause of the 14th amendment — recognized a right to privacy, and that that included a woman's right to an abortion. Hatch's proposed amendment would have explicitly inserted into the Constitution the assertion that ""a right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution."" Clearly, that would have been completely incompatible with Roe, and therefore would have effectively — and emphatically — overturned Roe. The amendment would also have returned to Congress and the states the ability to govern abortion access. This was precisely the effect of the Supreme Court's ruling, 40 years later, in Dobbs — the decision that ultimately overruled Roe. Hatch's proposal went even further, though, stipulating that, while Congress could enact legislation governing abortion access on a national level, if an individual state's abortion law was stricter than the federal law, the state law would take precedence. The amendment never made it as far as a vote in the full Senate or House, but on March 10, 1982, the Senate Judiciary Committee did vote to advance it out of committee for the consideration of the full Senate. As a later committee report described it , the committee voted 10-7 to ""favorably report out"" the proposal. This is an important distinction. Judiciary committee members can vote to advance a measure to the full Senate ""without recommendation,"" meaning that, whether or not they personally support the proposal, they believe it should be considered by the full Senate. Biden's March 1982 vote went further, and he joined the committee's majority in explicitly supporting the proposal itself. The votes were as follows: For : Hatch, R-Utah; Laxalt, R-Nev.; Dole, R-Kan.; Simpson, R-Wyo.; East, R-N.C.; Grassley, R-Iowa; Denton, R-Ala.; Biden, D-Del.; DeConcini, D-Ariz.; Thurmond, R-S.C. Against : Mathias, R-Md.; Specter, R-Penn.; Kennedy, D-Mass.; Byrd, D-W.Va.; Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Leahy, D-Vt.; Baucus, D-Mont. At the time, Biden said his vote was an exceptionally difficult one, and described abortion as ""the single most controversial issue in the United States of America.""  Snopes asked the White House for a fuller explanation of the reasoning behind Biden's March 1982 vote, but we did not receive a response in time for publication. Prior to that vote, the Delaware senator had expressed clear opposition to Roe. For example, in a 1974 interview he declared: ""I don’t like the Supreme Court decision on abortion. I think it went too far. I don’t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body."" However, when Hatch submitted a similar proposed constitutional amendment in 1983, Biden voted against it, both in the judiciary committee and in the full Senate chamber . From that point, his public stance on abortion rights in general, and Roe in particular, evolved from one of hostility, to neutrality, and as of 2022, firm support.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1163
10bb0c82-3111-40e0-9e27-cb1940e35736,"Shortly after the deadly U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, social media users shared a number of striking videos. One of those videos purportedly showed a police officer waving in protesters to move past barricades as a way of encouraging them to get closer to the Capitol. He or she was giving supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump the green light to charge toward the building from the east side, the social media posts claimed. However, a second video shot from a different angle provided evidence that debunked this rumor. There were a number of rumors about actions purportedly taken by individual law enforcement officers on the day of the Capitol riot . For this fact check, we will be concentrating only on this one specific rumor. The Misleading Video On Jan. 7, the day after the Capitol riot, TikTok user Josh Helfgott reposted a misleading video with the caption, ""A Police Officer WAVED THEM ALL IN!!"" It received millions of views and more than 500,000 likes. Helfgott's specific captioned version of the video was also reshared on Twitter . As of July 2022, Helfgott was a verified user on the platform and had well over 5 million followers. The same misleading video was also shared by a TikTok user named @travisjakers with the caption, ""Capitol Police Officer Brings Terrorists In."" That TikTok account no longer exists, but the video was downloaded and uploaded again to Twitter with the caption, ""Capitol Hill police officer encourages Trump terrorists to go in."" The Second Video Months later on Oct. 31, the Hunting Insurrectionists YouTube channel posted a second video that debunked this rumor. A review of the alternate angle that was recorded in the same location outside of the Capitol showed that the officer was waving to his or her fellow officers to fall back. At that point, Trump supporters could be seen as having moved behind the officers' positions. It's unclear if the officers seen in the video were with U.S. Capitol Police or with the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C. The Hunting Insurrectionists YouTube channel hosts a number of other videos that were shot during the Capitol riot. Some of the videos show synced-up clips of the same timeline from multiple sources . The channel serves as a library of content that helps to shed light on the truth of what happened on Jan. 6 . It does so by introducing evidence, not half-baked conspiracy theories. The channel is operated by Twitter user @StevieG54099097 . Fallout As of July 2022, more than 800 people had been charged with crimes for their participation in the Capitol riot. At the time, the U.S. House Jan. 6 panel was continuing its investigation of the incident with televised hearings . According to the U.S. Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department, 140 law enforcement officers were injured on Jan. 6. One officer died the next day and others have since taken their own lives. Some of the protesters who entered the Capitol carried “Blue Lives Matter” and “Thin Blue Line” flags. Such flags are supposed to represent support of police officers. Trump supporters attempted to storm the Capitol after being egged on by Trump, who consistently pushed the false and baseless claim that U.S. elections were prone to massive voter fraud . That false claim was pushed during Trump's Jan. 6 speech at the Ellipse in the hours before protesters broke into the Capitol. It had also been spread by the president's own words in the months and years before the deadly riot. No credible evidence was ever introduced to show that there was massive voter fraud in the 2020 U.S. presidential election . The Trump supporters who participated in the Capitol riot only briefly delayed Congress from conducting an official electoral count. That electoral count is part of a process that's outlined in the U.S. Constitution . After the Trump-supporting rioters attempted to stop Congress from following the Constitution, the proceedings resumed later on the same day, where Joe Biden was named as the next president of the United States. In sum, no, the video of the police officer waving his or her arm did not show that Capitol police or any other local law enforcement personnel had encouraged or invited protesters to run past the barricades on the east side. A second video angle put this false rumor to bed.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,801
63b1058d-56e8-41c0-bb9d-25a996794fe7,"Fact Check In July 2022, the United States began to come to terms with the complicated and fragmented legal status of abortion in the states , after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade , removing federal constitutional protections for abortion. In particular, a set of questions arose over whether and how some states might seek to prevent their residents from obtaining abortions in other states, and how other states might seek to provide legal protections for residents subject to much stricter anti-abortion laws. Against that background, social media users enthusiastically shared a July 1 tweet that appeared to describe a relatively extreme approach to preventing women from traveling to obtain an abortion. The tweet read: Mississippi legislators openly discuss using dogs at airports to sniff women leaving the state. The dogs can tell if a woman is pregnant. In reality, that claim was inaccurate — the concoction of Chip Franklin, a left-wing humorist who frequently posts polemical and irony-laden political commentary. Our rating therefore is ""False."" Although Franklin describes himself on Twitter as a ""comedian,"" he told Snopes that his claim was not intended to be humorous. His claim was very widely shared on on Twitter, with many users posting comments that clearly showed they took the tweet seriously , and expressed genuine outrage and bemusement at what they took to be a fact about Mississippi. On Facebook, users posted screenshots of the claim , giving it an even wider audience. Franklin told Snopes the intention behind his tweet wasn't to be funny. Asked to provide sources, he outlined the following: He had read that dogs could detect the presence of prostate cancer, COVID-19, and pregnancy During a Twitter Spaces conversation about the extent to which anti-abortion state governments might go in order to stop women from getting an abortion, ""I brought up the idea of pregnant [sic] sniffing dogs at airports"" Two participants in that conversation said they had heard Dr. Troy Majure, a Mississippi veterinarian, mention in a podcast that dogs might be able to detect whether a woman was pregnant Franklin asked some unnamed women whether they had heard about plans to deploy pregnancy-detecting dogs at airports, to which the women reportedly replied ""Anything is possible."" This is extraordinarily thin evidence on which to base the viral claim that Mississippi state legislators were publicly discussing the use of dogs in airports to ""sniff out"" pregnant women, and prevent them from travelling outside of the state. The key component of what Franklin sent to Snopes was the admission ""I brought up the idea of pregnant [sic] sniffing dogs at airports."" By Franklin's own admission, he could present evidence of only one person independently raising the possibility of pregnancy-sniffing airport dogs as an anti-abortion tactic — himself. The other points he highlighted are not relevant to the question of whether airport dogs were being publicly discussed as a tactic by Mississippi state legislators, Republican officials, anti-abortion activists, or indeed anyone, other than Franklin himself. In sum, we found no evidence whatsoever of any state lawmaker in Mississippi engaging in any such discussion, and in any event, neither the state senate nor the state house have convened since the beginning of April.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,597
c00f69dc-9872-4f67-af7d-077c4a687b80,"Fact Check When the COVID-19 vaccines were being developed in 2020, one persistent rumor held that these vaccines contained the cells of aborted fetuses. This is false. As we wrote in December 2020 , again in March 2021 , and again in October 2021 , none of the COVID-19 vaccines contains aborted fetal cells. However, many vaccines, including the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines, were developed using what researchers describe as ""historic fetal cell lines"" in their research and testing phases. James Lawler, associate professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the Nebraska Medical Center, defined ""fetal cell lines"" and explained how they're different from aborted fetal cells as follows: The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any aborted fetal cells. However, fetal cell lines – cells grown in a laboratory based on aborted fetal cells collected generations ago – were used in testing during research and development of the mRNA vaccines, and during production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine … Fetal cell lines are cells that grow in a laboratory. They descend from cells taken from abortions in the 1970s and 1980s. The practice of using fetal cell lines in the development of the COVID-19 vaccines resurfaced as an issue in June 2022, after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas mentioned it in a dissenting opinion published after the court declined to take up a case related to New York's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Thomas wrote that COVID-19 vaccines were ""developed using cell lines derived from aborted children."" This is true. When news outlets reported on Thomas' dissent, many suggested Thomas had cited a debunked claim. NBC News, for example, wrote that the Supreme Court justice had cited the ""debunked claim that Covid vaccines are made with cells from 'aborted children.'"" Politico and Axios published similar stories, with Axios' story originally being published under the title ""Clarence Thomas suggests COVID vaccines are made with 'aborted children.'"" On social media, this claim was even further exaggerated, with one Instagram post with more than 170,000 likes falsely stating that Thomas had written that the COVID-19 vaccines ""contain the cells of aborted children."" But that isn't what Thomas wrote. What Did Thomas Write about COVID-19 Vaccines and Aborted Fetal Cells? Thomas did not claim that COVID-19 vaccines contain aborted fetal cells. What Thomas did say is that the COVID-19 vaccines were ""developed using cell lines derived from aborted children."" Despite his use of the highly politicized term ""aborted children"" (as opposed to ""aborted fetuses""), his claim that such cell lines were used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines is accurate. Here's the full quote from Thomas' dissent : Petitioners are 16 healthcare workers who served New York communities throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. They object on religious grounds to all available COVID–19 vaccines because they were developed using cell lines derived from aborted children. Pet. for Cert. 8. Ordered to choose between their jobs and their faith, petitioners sued in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, claiming that the State’s vaccine mandate violated the Free Exercise Clause. Again, for clarity, ""fetal cell line"" refers to cells that were grown in a lab. While it is true that these cell lines were derived from a fetus that was voluntarily aborted in the 1970s, none of the original fetal tissue remains in these cell lines.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,638

In June 2022, a purported screenshot of one of her tweets went viral, with many attributing it to the famed author of the “Harry Potter” series of books. The alleged tweet came in response to the historic ruling on June 24, 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court voted to strike down Roe v. Wade via Planned Parenthood v.

According to Google cache , a service implemented by the tech giant to archive websites, the tweet in the screenshot below was real: This Twitter discussion on the subject of abortion occurred one day following the news that the U.S. Supreme Court had overturned Roe v.

In response, Walsh or someone with control of his account chose to quote-tweet the question instead of inserting a traditional reply underneath, answering with, ""Yes."" The tweet then vanished from Walsh's account after @samthielman revealed that the image showed that of an elephant fetus. Before Walsh's tweet disappeared, it had already been liked thousands of times. According to two sources , the picture truly did show a fetus of an elephant. Before Walsh engaged with the elephant fetus image, another tweet on Walsh's account read, ""Could not be happier to see the pain and heartbreak of abortionists. Absolutely loving every minute of it."" This may have been what prompted the back-and-forth discussion with @samthielman. Charlie Kirk and the Dolphin Fetus Walsh's apparent elephant fetus mishap was similar to an incident in which conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was asked about a different picture.

427ec6ab-59e3-485e-bcc3-3be2583adbb6,"In June 2022, we were asked by readers to look at a Facebook post that was being copied and pasted. The viral post claimed that a woman pulled out a pistol while attending a party at an apartment complex in Charleston, West Virginia, shooting and killing a convicted felon named Dennis Butler after he began firing an AR-15 at the crowd. CNN, ABC News, NBC News, MSNBC, and ""other liberal news outlets"" did not report the news, the post claimed. While many of the major details in the post were indeed correct, it did contain several minor inaccuracies. Butler's apparent attempt to gun down partygoers in West Virginia came just one day after the mass shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas. The Uvalde incident resulted in the deaths of 19 children and two adults . At least seventeen others were wounded , including both children and adults. The tragic shooting reignited the debate over enacting stricter gun control laws in the U.S. The Facebook Post At least two posts on Facebook that featured the copy-and-paste story received thousands of shares. One of those posts appeared on a Facebook page named WE R PRO 2 . This indicated that strong supporters of the Second Amendment were using the Charleston shooting in order to advance their opinions on the role of guns in American society. In the same way, those who support stricter gun control measures were using the Uvalde school shooting to advance their case. The copy-and-paste Facebook post that's in question in this fact check read as follows: On Friday, May 27, 2022, 4-time convicted felon Dennis Butler, opened fire on a graduation party in Charleston, West Virginia with a stolen AR-15. A woman (inset), pulled her legally owned and registered handgun from her purse and shot him dead before anyone was injured. I'm sorry I couldn't post this earlier, however, I couldn't find anything about it on CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, or any of the other Liberal news outlets. The Facts According to police, it's true that a woman, who was not identified, really did shoot and kill Butler after he began firing an AR-15-style rifle at a crowd that had gathered for a birthday-graduation party in West Virginia, according to reporting from The Associated Press. The shooting occurred on May 25 (not May 27 as was stated in the Facebook posts). Other than Butler's death, there were no other injuries. WRAL.com reported that Lt. Tony Hazelett with the Charleston Police Department said the woman prevented ""a mass casualty incident,"" stopping ""the threat of probably 20 or 30 people getting killed."" WRAL.com also published that the woman was ""carrying her firearm lawfully."" We didn't find any reporting to confirm that the woman specifically pulled the pistol from a purse, as was mentioned in the Facebook posts. However, this was a small and rather unimportant detail. As for Butler's criminal history, WCHSTV.com reported that he was a convicted felon, just as the posts claimed. We are still in the process of confirming with police whether he was in fact, a ""four-time"" convicted felon, as well as whether the AR-15-style rifle he used was indeed ""stolen."" CNN, ABC, NBC, and MSNBC The Facebook posts were also at least somewhat correct about the lack of reporting. We were unable to locate any evidence that CNN, NBC News, or MSNBC had reported the news, whether on their websites, in online videos, or on broadcasts for television. ABC News did, in fact, report on the shooting by republishing the story from The AP. As for NBC News, we found no published articles about the shooting or Butler's death on NBCNews.com or in transcripts from any of NBC's national broadcasts. At the same time, we did notice that the story from The AP was republished by NBCChicago.com , NBCNewYork.com , and other local news websites. The AP's story was also republished on CBSNews.com . In other words, the news about Butler, a man who fired an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd, who was shot and taken down by a woman with a pistol, was readily available on multiple well-known news websites. 'Children Were Playing' According to The AP, police said that Butler had been warned earlier in the evening by unidentified persons to slow his driving because ""children were playing"" nearby at the apartment complex . He later returned with the AR-15-style rifle and began firing: Dennis Butler, 37, was killed Wednesday night after he pulled out the rifle and began shooting at dozens of people attending the birthday-graduation party outside an apartment complex in the city of Charleston, police said in a statement. The woman, who was attending the party, drew a pistol and fired, killing Butler, the statement said. No one at the party was injured. “Instead of running from the threat, she engaged with the threat and saved several lives last night,” Chief of Detectives Tony Hazelett told news outlets Thursday. Butler was at the apartment complex earlier in the evening in a vehicle and had been warned to slow down because children were playing, police said. They said he left, but returned later, parked in front of the complex and began firing. The reporting said that no charges would be filed against the woman who killed Butler. In sum, the woman did, according to police, shoot and kill Butler with a pistol while he was firing an AR-15-style rifle into a crowd, very likely preventing a mass casualty incident. However, the popular copy-and-paste Facebook post that described the shooting included a few inaccuracies.

Andrew Wilhoite, a local farmer , was running for one of the three open seats on the Clinton Township Board. He was charged in March 2022 with killing his cancer-stricken wife, Elizabeth “Nikki” Wilhoite. Wilhoite, however, withdrew from the ballot in mid-May 2022. He did not give a reason for the withdrawal. If he were to be convicted for a felony before the November general elections, his name would have been withdrawn from the ballots by election officials. He was incarcerated when police accused him of striking his wife in the head with a blunt object. Investigators said that he then “placed her into a vehicle and drove to a nearby creek where he dumped her body.” Prosecutors charged him with a level 1 murder felony. Wilhoite initially lied about his wife’s whereabouts, before admitting that he killed her after she attacked him, according to prosecutors. According to the local news Lebanon Reporter , Elizabeth had completed her last chemotherapy session and was seeking a divorce when she learned her husband had an affair with another woman. According to the affidavit, Wilhoite confessed that Elizabeth charged at him on the porch and he hit her with a “gallon-sized concrete flowerpot with dirt in it.” She fell to the ground and he did not know what to do, so he put her in his pickup truck. He described how he drove to a bridge over the creek and threw her over the wall and into the creek. The police were alerted after Elizabeth’s coworker asked them to check on her when she did not arrive for work saying that the couple had domestic troubles. Their three children had also been trying to get in touch with Elizabeth. According to election records , he received 60 votes for his seat, while the other Republican candidates received 100 and 106 votes respectively for the remaining seats. Wilhoite remained on the ballot as he faced murder charges in jail, and his jury trial was set to begin in August 2022.

We found this to be mostly true, with two clarifications. Our review of the application, which was provided to us by the Town of Edgartown's Selectboard , found that the request was for three propane tanks. When combined, the three tanks equalled 2,500 gallons. Also, the application indicated that the tanks would be installed above ground, not buried. The reason behind the tanks' purchase was not public at the time this article was published. The property's size was once mentioned by Chicago Sun-Times as measuring 29.3 acres . It's unclear if the tanks were meant for the Obamas, the U.S. Secret Service, or for another purpose. We reviewed earlier reporting about the application for the propane tanks from both Miami Standard and The Martha's Vineyard Times , also known as MVTimes.com. On June 7, 2022, The MV Times published the following: The select board approved a request for a 2,500-gallon commercial propane tank for 79 Turkeyland Cove Road in Katama — owned by former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. “We’ve never had a private propane tank come to us,” said select board member Arthur Smadbeck, with select board member Michael Donaroma noting a private-residence propane tank is typically a fraction of the quantity being requested. To confirm the reporting, we contacted the Town of Edgartown Selectboard in Massachusetts. The town is located on Martha's Vineyard . By phone, we requested the minutes from the Selectboard's meeting on June 6, as they weren't yet available on the board's website. We received the board's minutes by email. According to the two-page document, a single, 2,500-gallon propane tank was discussed by the board for a street address matching the Obamas' Martha's Vineyard property. The agenda item was introduced by the board's chairman, Margaret E. Serpa: Ms. Serpa then addressed the next item which was an application from Star Propane to install a buried 2500g tank at 79 Turkeyland Cove. Mr. Smadbeck moved to approve. Mr. Donaroma seconded. Unanimous. The minutes contained no additional information. We again inquired with the board by email, asking if the purpose of the propane was public knowledge or if they had any other information that could be passed along. In response, they sent the application for the tanks that had been signed on May 31, 2022. The application showed that a request had been made for three propane tanks, including two sized at 1,000 gallons and another one at 500 gallons. The name of the person who made the request was Ashley Tate-Gilmore. A person with the same name previously served as Obama's White House travel director. The news of the propane tanks led to a number of videos that pushed a conspiracy theory that the Obamas made the purchase for "" prepping ."" The conspiracy theory referred to the idea of preparing for a future and potentially apocalyptic turn of events, in particular a financial collapse. At the time, the Federal Reserve had sought to ""tame high inflation"" by putting forth its ""largest rate hike since 1994,"" according to The Associated Press . This led to fears of a possible future recession, the reporting said. In sum, an application was submitted to the Town of Edgartown for three propane tanks equalling a total of 2,500-gallon capacity that were to be installed above ground on the Obamas' property on Martha's Vineyard.

In response, the left-wing commentator Brian Tyler Cohen accused Oz of hypocrisy, claiming that his own ""family business"" had been caught ""illegally hiring thousands of immigrants using fake names."" Cohen wrote : Dr. Oz just tweeted that he “will fight to end illegal immigration”— his family business was fined $95,000,000 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for illegally hiring thousands of immigrants using fake names.

Those social media posts referred to a real Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) case involving a Pennsylvania company called Asplundh Tree Expert. However, by describing Asplundh as Oz's ""family business,"" they grossly exaggerated and distorted its actual ties to Oz himself, and his lack of involvement in the company's affairs.

(Photo By Tim Leedy/MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images) In September 2017, ICE announced that Asplundh had agreed to pay $95 million — including $80 million in forfeiture and $15 million in civil payments — to settle a major immigration enforcement case. In a news release , ICE described it as ""the largest civil settlement agreement ever levied by ICE,"" and added: Asplundh Tree Experts, Co., one of the largest privately-held companies in the United States, headquartered in Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, (“Asplundh”), pleaded guilty today to unlawfully employing aliens, in connection with a scheme in which the highest levels of Asplundh management remained willfully blind while lower level managers hired and rehired employees they knew to be ineligible to work in the United States. In court filings , the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania stated that federal audits had found at least 100 Asplundh employees were ineligible to work in the United States, and that these workers subsequently quit or were fired. However, Asplundh was accused of abusing the Department of Homeland Security 's E-Verify system by knowingly rehiring these former employees under different names and using different Social Security numbers for them. Checking those numbers on the E-Verify system would yield a match to a real person authorized to work in the U.S., even though that wasn't actually the person who was being hired. Operating in this way afforded Asplundh managers plausible deniability about the illegal scheme. Neither court filings nor federal government news releases about the case specified the total number of unauthorized workers in question. However, prosecutors did stipulate that the fraudulent rehiring scheme involved workers ""throughout many regions in the United States"" over a four-year period between 2010 and 2014. Given that Asplundh had 35,000 employees in total, as of 2018 , it was certainly plausible that the number of workers embroiled in the scheme came to ""thousands,"" as Cohen claimed in his tweet. The Link to Oz Apr. 29, 2018 file photo of Lisa Oz and Mehmet Oz at the 2018 Daytime Emmy Awards in Pasadena, California.  (Photo by David Crotty/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images) Since June 1985, Oz has been married to the former Lisa Lemole. Her mother , Emily Jane Asplundh Lemole, was herself the daughter of Carl Hjalmar Asplundh Sr ., who co-founded the family business in 1928, along with his two brothers Lester and Griffith. Lemole is therefore a granddaughter of one of the company's founders. Over the decades, several generations of Asplundh family members have worked for the company in various capacities and at various levels. The CEO of the company during the period involved in the ICE investigation was Scott Asplundh — the grandson of co-founder Griffith Asplundh and second cousin of Lemole. Oz and Lemole also own shares in the company. Federal Election Commission records show that between 2008 and 2020, the couple contributed a total of $51,000 to the Asplundh Tree Expert Political Action Committee, which in turn distributed campaign funding to various Republican candidates. In each of those filings, Oz and Lemole listed themselves as shareholders. However, we could find no evidence whatsoever to suggest that either Oz or Lemole have ever been employed by the company, or involved in any decision-making there. In February, a spokesperson for Oz's campaign told the New York Post as much, stating: Neither Dr. Oz nor Lisa Oz have even worked at the company or had any involvement in decision-making regarding its business practices, period. The company reached a civil settlement in 2017 with the federal government with no further action taken since then. Dr. Oz and Lisa Oz are passive shareholders in the company along with 200+ other family members. As passive, minority shareholders, Dr. Oz and Lisa Oz had zero involvement in the settlement. Notwithstanding Lemole's obvious familial ties to the company, it would be misleading to describe it as ""her family business."" She does not work for the company, and it's not her business. And since Oz is connected to the Asplundhs only through his marriage to Lemole, it is even more misleading to describe the company as ""his family business,"" as Cohen did in his tweet.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1041
f2eaf3d6-1e3f-4b74-8317-c104c77041e9,"Fact Check It's back. The ridiculous ""body double"" conspiracy theory that once targeted then-first lady Melania Trump was targeting U.S. President Joe Biden in late spring 2022. A widely viewed TikTok video , posted in early June 2022, showed Biden carrying two handbags to an SUV. The video was captioned, ""No comment (double)!?"" Notably, the above video clip doesn't contain any descriptions about the time, place, or circumstances under which it was shot. Although it doesn't state outright why the man in the video is supposed to be a Biden ""double,"" the implication appears to be that Biden, as president, wouldn't carry his own luggage. But the explanation may be a rather simple one: The video was taken during an earlier period of time, likely before Biden was president. He appears to be slightly younger in the video than he is now. This isn't the first time the Biden body-double claim has been made. For example, in 2020, Snopes debunked a claim based on false allegations that Biden's earlobes in various images and videos were different, proving he must have been cloned or using a body double. In similar past claims, social media users posted a digitally altered image to falsely accuse Biden of using a body double to get a COVID-19 booster shot. Others confused a lighting effect to mean that Biden's skin tone didn't match his natural coloring, falsely alleging a body double stood in for him during a television interview. As noted above, false claims that Melania Trump used a body double became so persistent that her husband, then-President Donald Trump, addressed it — in the process launching his own conspiracy theory. Taking to his now permanently suspended Twitter account, Trump stated: ""The Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania, then propelled conspiracy theories that it’s actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places,” the president tweeted. “They are only getting more deranged with time.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,380
a18ec5a3-fa98-4652-a5da-8c4d721c5ead,"Fact Check Founding Father and U.S. President George Washington never said the words, ""When any nation mistrusts its citizens with guns , it is sending a clear message,"" nor did he continue with, ""It no longer trusts its citizens because such a government has evil plans."" These were two of the most shared memes that we found that featured the fake Washington quote about guns and the government having ""evil plans."" Even though the Washington quote is fake, social media users still shared memes like the ones above in the aftermath of the deadly school shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde , Texas . The shooting, which occurred on May 24, 2022, killed 19 children and two adults , and reignited the debate over enacting stricter gun control laws in the U.S. We found that the fake Washington quote had been shared in the past on Facebook , Twitter , Pinterest , and Truth Social . In one Truth Social post that promoted the quote days before the Uvalde school shooting, a user replied , ""Right on! … Is it not amazing what our forefathers new [sic] would be coming in the future."" MountVernon.org , the association that manages Washington 's estate, confirmed on its website that the quote about mistrusting citizens with guns and the government having ""evil plans"" was indeed fake. The website said the quote may have come from an apparently recent publication named, ""The American Wisdom Series presents Pamphlet #230, 'President George Washington's Thoughts on Firearms.'"" No citation was given for the quote, as it was not genuine. A search of books.google.com , a catalog of just about every available piece of literature ever written, showed that the fake Washington quote never appeared in any known printed materials until sometime after 2011. When a supposedly centuries-old quote doesn't show up in a online search of old books until the 21st century, that's a pretty enormous red flag that something's not right. In sum, no, Washington did not say that a nation mistrusting its citizens with guns means that its government has ""evil plans."" We previously published fact checks about two other quotes that did not originate with the first president of the United States. One misleading quote meme showed an illustration of Washington with the words, ""When government takes away citizens' right to bear arms, it becomes citizens' duty to take away government's right to govern."" Another misleading quote meme, which also showed an illustration of Washington , read , ""Firearms stand next in importance to the Constitution itself.""

bc6d4623-5339-4de8-982e-fcf873e62ac4,"Fact Check In May 2022, social media users shared images that supposedly showed the face of the first U.S. President, George Washington, facing right — not left — on the front of a new quarter coin released in 2022. Many of these social media posts stated that Washington was now facing away from the coin's inscription ""In God We Trust ,"" and that the alleged change revealed a change in modern society's religious views. While we have no insight to offer on how this numismatic design does or does not reveal a change in the religious views of modern American society, we can say that Washington indeed previously faced left on the common quarter , and that the design for the coin released in 2022 has his profile facing right. There's no evidence to indicate that this design was chosen for any religious reasons. In fact, this isn't the first time that Washington has faced away from the words ""In God We Trust"" on a quarter. The U.S. Mint released the coin with Washington's profile facing right as part of its "" American Women Quarters Program ,"" an initiative that was set to run between 2022 and 2025 and include as many as five new quarters every year. For 2022, the U.S. Mint said it was releasing quarters to honor Maya Angelou , Dr. Sally Ride , Wilma Mankiller , Nina Otero-Warren , and Anna May Wong . As of this writing, the quarters featuring Ride and Angelou were currently in circulation. George Washington's profile appeared on the obverse side of each coin, no matter which woman it honored, and the design of it was new. Well, actually, it was an old design that had never been used. The design of a right-facing Washington was created by Laura Gardin Fraser , one of the 20th century's most prolific female sculptors, and submitted to the U.S. Mint in 1932 after Congress launched a design competition to honor Washington's 200th birthday. Fraser's design, which was based on a bust by French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon and featured a right-facing Washington, didn't win the competition. Instead, Congress chose a design by John Flanagan , which featured the familiar sight of a left-facing Washington. Fraser's design While some social media users criticized the government for turning Washington ""away"" from the phrase ""In God We Trust,"" this isn't the first time that this has taken place. In 1999, for example, the U.S. Mint introduced its ""50 States"" series of quarters that featured a left-facing Washington and the words ""In God We Trust"" on the right side. Here's an image of the reverse side of a Pennsylvania quarter . In 2021, when the U.S. Mint announced designs for its initial run of quarters in the ""American Women Quarters Program "", then-Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen decided to use Fraser's 1932 design of Washington for the obverse side of the honorary coins. The U.S. Mint wrote in a news release : Contributions of American women have often been overlooked, but that is about to change. Literally. Beginning in 2022, the American Women Quarters™ Program will feature reverse designs honoring distinguished American women. One woman’s design, created 90 years ago, will take its place as the program’s common obverse: the unifying element of the program. [...] In 2022, 90 years after she intended for it to do so, Laura Gardin Fraser’s design will fittingly take its place on the quarter. It will be the obverse for the American Women Quarters Program, a four-year program that celebrates American women and the contributions they made to this country. The Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-330) requires a new obverse design that maintains a likeness of George Washington, but be designed so as to distinguish it from the one used during the previous quarters program. It should be noted that this was not the first time a piece of U.S. currency featured Fraser's work. Fraser was the first woman to design a commemorative coin, the 1921 Alabama Centennial Half Dollar , and her work can also be seen on the 1922 Grant Memorial Half Dollar and Gold Dollar , the 1925 Fort Vancouver Centennial Half Dollar , and the 1926 Oregon Trail Memorial Half Dollar . Also, the ""American Woman Quarters Program"" was not the first time that the U.S. Mint used Fraser's right-facing Washington design on a coin. The George Washington Commemorative Gold Five-Dollar coin, which was issued in 1999, featured it, too. Dean Kotlowski, a member of the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC), said of Fraser's design in a U.S. Mint news release : 'She’s able to create a sense of his seriousness of purpose. The cheek muscles, you see the strength, the strength of character. The looking ahead, straight ahead, the sense of vision. All of these come together with a sense of statesmanship and a commanding presence that she is able to achieve with remarkable ease.' In sum, it was true that quarters released in 2022 showed Washington facing right, while the common quarter had depicted his profile looking left. However, there wasn't any evidence that the design of the new quarters had anything to do with religion. Fraser's right-facing design was chosen, in part, because the series of coins honored the contributions of women to American society and Fraser was a well-known female sculptor. Furthermore, the isn't the first time that Washington has faced away from the phrase ""In God We Trust.""

a7e774de-7000-470d-b55d-49e01858a36c,"Fact Check The Uvalde massacre in May 2022, in which an armed assailant shot dead 19 children and two teachers at Robb Elementary School, provoked a tsunami of grief and outrage throughout Texas, the United States, and beyond. Unfortunately, however, it also prompted a grimly predictable slew of conspiracy theories , including the now-familiar "" false flag "" canards, which wrongly claimed the entire atrocity was sinisterly staged or orchestrated in order to advance a political agenda — typically presented as enhanced gun control. Taking in the grief on the faces of those whose children were slaughtered in their school classroom, it's difficult to imagine that any observer could suggest the whole episode was a hoax and the mourners were ""crisis actors"" (performers who, according to conspiracy theorists, try to convince onlookers that a tragedy had occurred when it actually hadn't). And yet, that's exactly what some self-discrediting websites and activists did. For example, on May 27, the right-wing propaganda site NewsTreason published a post with the headline, ""False Flag? Uvalde Shooting Victim Has Different Fathers on CNN & NBC — How?"" The post contained a 90-second video that consisted of heavily-edited excerpts from two television interviews, designed to create the impression that sinister actors, including cable news networks, had staged the Uvalde massacre and used ""crisis actors"" to portray the loved ones of victims. In this particular case, promoters of the conspiracy theory focused on the family of 10-year-old Amerie Jo Garza, a fatal victim of the elementary school shooting. According to the theory , the plotters slipped up by having two different ""actors"" play the same father, thus revealing their chicanery. In reality, the two men interviewed were Garza's stepfather and biological father, each of whom was referred to simply as her father in each interview. On May 25, CNN's Anderson Cooper interviewed Angel Garza, who is the stepfather of Amerie Jo Garza, and husband to the girl's mother, Kimberly Garcia. That interview can be watched in full on YouTube . On May 26, Savannah Guthrie, presenter of NBC's Today, interviewed Alfred Garza III, who is the biological father of Amerie Jo Garza. That interview can also be watched in full on YouTube . The girl's family relationships were clearly outlined in her obituary , which was published on the website of Hillcrest Memorial Funeral Home in Uvalde on May 25 — before conspiracy theorists presented the remarks of her two fathers as having no reasonable explanation: Amerie Jo Garza's obituary, which clearly explained that she had both a biological father and stepfather, was freely available online for five days before Charlie Kirk, conspiracy theorist and founder of the right-wing Turning Point USA, promoted the NewsTreason video on Rumble , and to his roughly 2.4 million Facebook followers .",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,527
88c2d7d6-4feb-47b5-831d-79dbad1d697a,"Fact Check In May 2022, a website purporting to be a local news site for the western portion of Illinois' Cook County, the state's most populous county that covers the Chicago metro, published an article falsely claiming that Oak Park and River Forest High School (OPRF) officials were set to implement a ""race-based grading system."" The article alleged that administrators would make it mandatory for ""teachers next school year to adjust their classroom grading scales to account for the skin color or ethnicity of its students."" The website was called ""West Cook News,"" and the article featured a cropped version of OPRF Administrator Laurie Fiorenza's Twitter profile photo . The contents of the article stemmed from a presentation that she gave during a recent school board meeting (a video of it posted on May 26 and is displayed below). In the presentation, she discussed research around grading students more fairly, known as ""equitable grading,"" and shared findings with school board members for their consideration. Neither she nor any other member of the board announced policy changes that would require teachers to change how they grade students, much less make it mandatory for them to assess students based on their race or ethnicity. For these reasons, we're marking this claim ""False."" The school said in a statement published to its website: The article contains a variety of misleading and inaccurate statements. The article’s mischaracterization of the Board meeting is unfortunate and has caused unnecessary confusion [...] At no time were any statements made recommending that OPRF implement a race-based grading approach. An Academic Discussion At the above-mentioned school board meeting, Fiorenza gave a brief presentation about the progress of a board committee that researches professional development strategies for teachers, called the Transformative Education Leadership Team (TELT). Fiorenza noted that during the school year, teachers had read several books about ""equitable grading,"" or strategies to assess students on a non-biased basis. That said, Fiorenza did not say that teachers were required to implement equitable grading (which is not ""race-based grading""). Here's a video of the meeting: We reached out to Karin Sullivan, the executive director of communications at OPRF, who told us that ""there are no changes being proposed. This was a report on the committee’s research of best practices."" What Is Equitable Grading? The rumor that OPRF was implementing a race-based grading system appeared to largely stem from a misunderstanding of the term ""equitable grading."" Ralph Matire, secretary of the OPRF School Board, said during the meeting: OK, equitable grading. People are going to hear that, and they are not going to understand that. So I want to be very clear that equitable grading practice [is] the objective assessment of academic mastery. It is not a dumbing down. It is not making concessions for this, that, or the third thing. It's finding a way to be objective about determining whether a student has mastered the academic content, because too often, subjective evaluation can be off and that's where inequity comes in. So it's getting to an objective measurement of student mastery of academic content. The community needs to hear that. It's an important thing. Margaret Sullivan, an associate director at EAB, a consulting firm specializing in education institutions, wrote about equitable grading in November 2021: Course failure rates more than doubled during the pandemic, reducing student confidence in school and their chances of pursuing postsecondary education. But lack of learning isn’t the only driver of course failures. Up to 40% of traditional student grades include non-academic criteria that do not reflect student learning gains — including participation and on-time homework submission. As a result, traditional grading may inadvertently penalize underprivileged students who struggle to meet non-academic expectations. One of the goals of equable grading is to focus on whether students understand course material, no matter their timeline for doing so, as opposed to testing them for points on specific dates. For example, supporters say, to achieve more equitable grades, teachers should drop zeroes on assignments from grade books when students demonstrate that they know the material from those assignments. During the presentation, Matire talked about how the latter change could give teachers a better assessment of a student's performance, saying: So, a kid scores zero points on a quiz, then three weeks later demonstrates complete mastery of the material that was in that quiz, why should that zero points hold down that kid's grade when the kid has demonstrated mastery of the academic content? That's what moving to an equitable grading system is. It's understanding that students grow at different paces. And it's teachers interacting with and assessing their students in a manner that allows them to objectively determine that the student has inf act mastered the content. Karin Sullivan told us that there had been ""no school-wide recommendation or implementation"" of equitable grading at OPRF, and that this presentation was just a ""discussion of research-based best practices."" If a teacher does implement equitable grading into their instruction plan, Sullivan said, ""any teachers using such practices would have to use them across the board for all students, regardless of race."" Rumors Spread on Social Media West Cook News' article carried the sensational and false title ""OPRF to implement race-based grading system in 2022-23 school year."" As noted above, the school simply was not implementing a new grading system, and the grading strategies that officials discussed at a recent school board meeting (equitable grading) had nothing to do with students' race or ethnicity. Despite (or perhaps because of) the inaccuracy of this headline, screenshots of West Cook News' article spread widely on social media. When Libs of Tiktok , a social media account that has gained a massive following thanks to its ability to stir up conservative outrage with claims that are often misleading, false, or stripped of context (no, litter boxes haven't been installed at schools because kids ""identify"" as cats), spread this rumor, they added screenshots from the presentation that highlighted specific passages: Neither of these highlighted passages stated that OPRF officials were implementing a race-based grading system. What these passages refer to, again, is equitable grading, or an attempt to remove bias from the classroom so that teachers can grade students purely on their mastery of a given subject. The school explained in their statement : As part of the Board of Education’s strategic plan, the OPRFHS Grading and Assessment Committee was formed to examine national research on objective, unbiased practices for determining whether students have mastered academic content. Again, the presentation slides do not state that teachers at OPRF will implement a race-based grading system. Rather, the slides note that teachers had read books about how take non-academic factors (such as attendance) out of the equation could give them a more objective view of a student's mastery of a subject. Is West Cook News A Local News Outlet? West Cook News is part of a so-called ""pink slime news"" network , a network of websites purporting to be local news outlets (despite having few or no local reporters) that publish politically biased content. The website is run by Local Government Information Services (LGIS), which is part of the Metric Media Foundation, a pink slime network that operates more than 1,200 ""local news"" outlets . A 2019 investigation by the New York Times found that these networks received ""at least $1.7 million from Republican political campaigns and conservative groups."" A disclaimer on the site about its funding read: ""Funding for this news site is provided, in part, by advocacy groups who share our beliefs in limited government."" While West Cook News presented itself as a local news outlet covering the suburban area west of Chicago, the majority of the stories published by this website were written with an algorithm, according to co-founder Brian Timpone. The Columbia Journalism Review reported in 2018: Most of the stories published on LGIS news sites are written by algorithm, co-founder Brian Timpone says in an interview with CJR, using software that analyzes data (school test scores, for instance) and splices it by region to deliver to local publications around the state. [...] When stories are written, their authors are usually freelancers, many of whom report their stories from well beyond the Illinois state line. The story about ""race-based grading"" carried no author byline. Instead, the article stated it came from the ""LGIS News Service."" The Times reported that this network also publishes ""pay-for-play"" content. Or, in other words, clients can pay to have stories written and published on this network of sites. While reputable news websites would either label this type of content as ""paid content"" (or, more likely, simply avoid it altogether), these paid advertisements were published by the Metric Media Foundation as if they were regular news stories. The New York Times reported : Internal documents show how much influence the clients have. ""The clients pay us to produce a certain amount of copy each day for their websites,"" said one “tool kit” for new writers. ""In some cases, the clients will provide their own copy."" Did OPRF Officials Implement, or Announce a Plan To Implement, Race-Based Grading? No. This rumor can be traced back to an article published on a pink slime news network in May 2022 that mischaracterized a presentation slide about equitable grading. School officials did not say they were preparing to implement any changes to their grading system, much less adjustments that would force teachers to account for a student's race or ethnicity. Furthermore, any potential future changes to how students are graded would apply to all students, not just students of a specific race. OPRF said in a statement : ""OPRFHS does not, nor has it ever had a plan to, grade any students differently based on race.""

bec6df7f-74de-40fa-963b-4f9c76b23b2e,"Fact Check On May 24, 2022, a gunman entered Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, and killed 19 children and two teachers . It was the 212th mass shooting in the U.S. (defined by the Gun Violence Archive as a shooting in which four or more people were shot or killed, excluding the shooter) of 2022, and the 27th shooting to take place in a school . As news circulated that 19 children under the age of 10 had been killed in another mass shooting, Steve Kerr, the head coach of the Golden State Warriors basketball team, expressed outrage at the lawmakers who refuse to vote on the federal bill H.R. 8, the ""Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021,"" and noted that 90% of Americans support universal background checks for gun purchases. Kerr said :  ""Do you realize that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want background checks, universal background checks? 90% of us ... We are being held hostage by 50 Senators in Washington who refuse to even put it to a vote, despite what we the American people want. They won't vote on it because they want to hold on to their own power."" Do 90% of Americans Want Universal Background Checks? A number of polls taken over the years show that the vast majority of Americans support universal background checks for those wanting to buy guns. In 2015, for example, a national Public Policy Polling survey of gun owners found overwhelming support (83%) for background checks, a 2018 Gallup poll found that 95% of people supported ""requiring background checks for all gun sales,"" and in 2019, a Quinnipiac University poll from 2019 found that 94% of American voters supported universal background checks. The Pew Research Center wrote in 2019 : When it comes to specific gun-related policies, the public finds broad agreement in certain areas. Overwhelming majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (91%) and Republicans and Republican-leaners (92%) say they strongly or somewhat favor barring people with mental illnesses from purchasing guns. These views are largely unchanged since the question was first asked in 2017. Similarly, large majorities in both parties continue to favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks (93% of Democrats, 82% of Republicans). Kerr's claim that 90% of Americans support universal background checks falls within the scope of the available data. What is H.R. 8? H.R. 8 is a bill that would expand background checks for all firearm sales in the country (including sales by private and non-licensed sellers). This bill establishes new background check requirements for firearm transfers between private parties (i.e., unlicensed individuals). Specifically, it prohibits a firearm transfer between private parties unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check. The prohibition does not apply to certain firearm transfers or exchanges, such as a gift between spouses in good faith. While the legislation has already passed in the U.S. House, the bill has been held up in the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass. CNN reported : Another bill, HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. Currently, background checks are not required for gun sales and transfers by unlicensed and private sellers. The legislation has bipartisan support, passing the House last year in a 227-203 vote. Eight Republicans supported the bill and one Democrat voted against it. [...] For now, either Democrats must all agree to end the filibuster or Republicans must begin to support gun control measures in larger numbers. Until then, there will be no new federal gun laws.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,714

According to the ad, the photograph and resulting article would reveal an illness that Clinton was currently dealing with. However, all of this was misleading and false. The ad in question. We found the original picture of Clinton from the ""sickness"" ad on the WireImage and Getty Images websites. Other photographs taken on the same evening showed that he had been accompanied by his wife, 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton . The original picture was shot on Dec. 20, 2014, years before it appeared in the misleading ad: Former President of the United States Bill Clinton attends ""Last Ship"" and ""Saturday Night Scream Christmas Carols Benefiting New York Cares Coat Drive"" on Dec. 20, 2014, in New York City.

According to BBC.com , in 2021, the former president was treated for a urinary tract infection. He also had previous surgeries for ""extensive"" heart disease and a clogged artery. However, we found no reporting that mentioned Clinton was dealing with a specific ""sickness"" that might show up in his complexion, as hinted by the clickbait ad. For further reading of past fact checks about Clinton , we previously reported in 2017 about a false rumor that claimed he was on his death bed.

9ab1a3d4-6f3a-49e0-b1f0-4c9001f8c42d,"Fact Check In May 2022, rumors surfaced claiming that U.S. President Joe Biden was planning to give the country's sovereignty over health issues to the World Health Organization (WHO), along with the leaders of 193 other countries . While these rumors stemmed from genuine proposals that United Nation members were discussing at the time to strengthen the world's preparedness against global pandemics, they grossly exaggerated, distorted, and misinterpreted the actual impacts of the proposed ideas. For example, one popular claim held that proposed amendments to existing guidelines would grant WHO the authority to lock down countries. Former Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann popularized that assertion when she discussed the issue in an interview with Steve Bannon, a political strategist who was charged with defrauding people before he was pardoned by former President Donald Trump . During this interview, Bachmann said : 'There are 193 nations belonging to the UN. The Biden administration is bringing amendments that were proposed that all nations of the Earth cede their sovereignty over their national health care decisions to the WHO. 'This means that the WHO would have decision-making authority to intervene in the United States government policy and any nation of the world without our permission; for instance, the lockdown where you see 26 million people today locked down in Shangai, China. They can’t leave their apartments or homes. The WHO would have the authority to be able to enforce that here in the United States, on whatever pretext they want. They don’t have to show data. They could do this.' While it was true that almost 200 countries (including the U.S.) were members of WHO, and that that group was discussing potential changes to how they work together as of spring 2022 (we elaborate on that fact below), Bachmann's claim that those talks could result in the WHO having new authority to implement lockdowns in the United States or any other country was untrue. What Are WHO Members Proposing To Change? In 1969, the WHO adopted a set of guidelines known as the International Health Regulations (IHR) in order to empower the international health agency to surveil global diseases. International officials have revised the regulations a few times over the years, including in 2005 after the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wrote : The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 are a legally binding agreement of 196 countries to build the capability to detect and report potential public health emergencies worldwide. IHR require that all countries have the ability to detect, assess, report, and respond to public health events. In December 2021, following the deaths of nearly 6 million people around the globe from the COVID-19 pandemic , world leaders started working on amendments to the IHR in order to strengthen the world's response to the next global pandemic. Reuters reported that some proposed amendments involved the sharing of data related to emerging viruses, a ban on wildlife markets, and a plan for equitable vaccine distribution. The European Union proposed that the ideas take the form of a new treaty, though the U.S. and other countries expressed reluctancy toward such a binding agreement, Reuters reported . In other words, as of this writing, WHO members were discussing the proposed amendments to existing regulations, and the exact contents of a future ""pandemic preparedness accord"" were unknown. Reuters reported : A new pact is among more than 200 recommendations for shoring up the world's defences against new pathogens made by various reviewers following the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 6.2 million people in two years. Negotiations on new rules for dealing with pandemics will begin at the World Health Organization on Thursday, with a target date of May 2024 for a treaty to be adopted by the U.N. health agency's 194 member countries [...] Suggested proposals for the pact include the sharing of data and genome sequences of emerging viruses and rules on equitable vaccine distribution.  The European Union is pushing for a ban on wildlife markets and incentives for reporting of new viruses or variants, an EU official told Reuters. Would Biden's Proposals Give WHO New Authority Over Lockdowns? While there was no official version of what the WHO was calling a ""pandemic preparedness accord"" among members, the Biden administration had released its ideas for how it would like to amend existing international guidelines. Those amendments (available via a PDF on the WHO's website for public viewing) did not outline ways for the WHO to gain new authority to implement U.S. lockdowns. In fact, the amendments made no mention of ""lockdowns"" at all. That said, it was still possible that the WHO could recommend a lockdown in a region due to a contagious disease. But that recommendation would still require government action in order to take place, and that system was already in place, with or without the proposed amendments by Biden's team. Additionally, nowhere in this document did the presidential administration propose to give WHO the authority to override the decisions of any member state, nor to give up its national sovereignty. In general, the Biden administration's proposed amendments dealt with monitoring emerging diseases, implementing a notification system across countries, and developing strategies for WHO officials to assist member states in times of emergency. For example, Article 12, a section of the document that dealt with the ""determination of a public health emergency,"" stated that when a global health threat is determined, the Director-General of WHO ""shall notify all States Parties and seek to consult with the State Party in whose territory the event arises."" WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus addressed some of the above-outlined rumors during his opening remarks at a media briefing on May 17.  Ghebreyesus dismissed the notion that any country was giving up its sovereignty by working on the potential agreement between WHO members, and stated that they, not WHO officials, were driving the work. Ghebreyesus said : The accord process is led by Member States with their own Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (called INB), representing all regions of the world. The INB has now started a two-year process that includes global public hearings with all stakeholders. This represents the world’s opportunity to plan together, detect pathogens quicker, share data broadly and collectively respond more effectively to the next diseases X or known pathogens. Unfortunately, there has been a small minority of groups making misleading statements and purposefully distorting facts. I want to be crystal clear. WHO’s agenda is public, open and transparent. WHO stands strongly for individual rights. We passionately support everyone’s right to health and we will do everything we can to ensure that that right is realized. The first ever World Health Assembly, which took place soon after the WHO Constitution entered into force in 1948, was a watershed event in global public health. And like the proposed pandemic preparedness accord, this did not mean WHO usurped nations’ sovereignty; in fact it strengthened countries’ ability to fight diseases together. WHO is an expression of Member States' own sovereignty and WHO is entirely what the sovereign 194 Member States want WHO to be. Every year, these sovereign governments come together at the World Health Assembly to set the health agenda for the world. Individually we can’t beat pandemics; our best chance is together [...] The accord process is at the very beginning of a multiyear Member State-led negotiation, which will only be finalized in 2024 after multiple public hearings around the world. And all voices will be heard. The essence of the proposed pandemic preparedness accord is to improve cooperation, coordination, and the sharing of data, information, biological materials and lifesaving tools. Considering that statement, as well as the fact that the claim was unsupported by the actual language in Biden's proposed amendments, we rate this claim ""False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1466

In one viral tweet , politics lecturer Yuan Yi Zhu captioned the picture ""Margaret Thatcher telling off a young Justin Trudeau, c. 1984"": The photograph is entirely authentic, not the result of digital manipulation, and does indeed show Thatcher and Trudeau, next to his father, then-Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Thus, we are issuing a rating of ""True."" However, contemporary accounts suggest Thatcher was having a friendly conversation with the young Trudeau, rather than chastising him, and the date provided in the May 2022 tweet, specifically, was off by a few years. The picture was taken on June 25, 1980 (not 1984 or thereabouts), and shows Thatcher talking to Trudeau outside 10 Downing Street — the official residence of the U.K. prime minister — in London. Behind Trudeau is his father, and to Thatcher's left, wearing an orange coat, is Jean Casselman Wadds, then Canadian high commissioner to the U.K. The Canadian government actually holds two slightly different versions of the shot — one showing Thatcher with her eyes open , as in the May 2022 post, and the other with her eyes closed . Several other photographs showed the same scene, with Thatcher wearing a distinctive bow at her collar, the elder Trudeau wearing the same jacket, and the young Trudeau wearing the same wind-breaker: Trudeau, then 8 years old, had accompanied his father on a trip to Europe , during which the Canadian PM attended talks and summits in Italy, the U.K.,  and Norway. While in Rome, both generations of Trudeaus obtained an audience with Pope John Paul II. Several contemporary news reports described Justin as having been sitting in a car at 10 Downing Street, but beckoned out on to the street by Thatcher, who was keen to chat to him. A brief, friendly exchange then took place, according to reports. For example, the Vancouver Sun wrote that : [Thatcher] spotted Justin huddled in the back of the Daimler, reported the Daily Mail. The newspaper said Justin explained that he was off to the zoo to see some baby monkeys. ""Have you seen them?"" he asked Thatcher. ""No,"" she said. ""But you must tell me about them when we meet again."" In their 1990 political biography of Pierre Trudeau , Stephen Clarkson and Christina McCall cited a report by the Toronto Sun, and wrote of the June 25, 1980, meeting: The amiable nature of the occasion was pointed up by an exchange between Margaret Thatcher and Justin Trudeau, who had come with his father to Europe and was waiting for him in a limousine so they could go first to the London zoo and then to Buckingham Palace. The Iron Lady and the eight-year-old were photographed shaking hands amidst much prime ministerial joshing, with Trudeau trying to intervene to prevent the photo session from continuing. When the Canadians finally drove away, Justin grinned, stuck out his tongue, and waved from the limousine's back-seat.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,605

The headline of an article on XYZ.Net.au , for example, read: ""Psychopath Daniel Andrews (Premier of Victoria) Plans To STARVE Victorians."" On social media, the claim was boiled down to digestible memes and brief tweets, including the following: The claim was not true, however. This rumor centered on a genuine proposal by Victorian lawmakers called the Agriculture Legislation Amendment Bill 2022 . That bill — which had bipartisan support, as of this writing — dealt with invasive species and other potential threats to Australia's agriculture industry. In a fact sheet about the bill, the state government explained its purpose and addressed the false claim that the legislation would prohibit Australians from growing their own food: This Bill aims to help safeguard food security, food safety and access to export markets which are vital for Victoria’s economy. Claim: The State Government is passing a bill now which means you won't be allowed to grow your own food, they can forcibly come in and rip it all out. Facts: * The amendments will help safeguard food security, food safety and access to export markets. For example, by preventing contamination of food from pesticides. * The amendments will not result in the destruction of crops, nor will they prevent people growing their own food. * Information circulating online misinterprets and misrepresents amendments in the Agriculture Legislation Amendment Bill. Professor Paul Martin, director of the Australian Centre for Agriculture and Law, told AAP FactCheck : What the legislation does do is provide a way of dealing with potential biodiversity issues and invasive species problems that have emerged or could emerge. Some of these are serious, real threats, and laws are being tightened in response, to make existing controls easier to enforce."" Reuters spoke to a Victoria Government spokesperson, who also said of the bill: ""No one will be prevented from growing their own food as part of these changes."" The news agency continued : [The spokesperson] added that the bill was designed to support the agriculture sector, as well as safeguard food security, food safety and access to export markets. Professor Michael Blakeney, from the University of Western Australia’s Institute of Agriculture ( here ), said he “couldn’t find anything” within the bill that “prevents people cultivating food crops on their own properties."" The claim that Australian lawmakers were considering the purported food-growing ban was shared in articles that also pushed other debunked conspiracy theories. The article on XYZ.Net.Au, for example, falsely claimed that there had been an unusual amount of fires at food processing plants this year and that the U.S. government was paying people to destroy crops . While the rumor about Australian legislation gained traction on social media, it reached a larger audience thanks to podcast host Joe Rogan. In an episode that aired in mid-May 2022, he talked about the claim like Australian officials really were pushing a policy package that would prohibit people from growing their own food. Then, another person on mic presumably looked up online whether any reputable news outlets had reported on the alleged initiative and came up empty. In other words, the conspiratorial podcast was once again spreading misinformation . It's important to note that this claim was part of a baseless conspiracy theory that the government (either Australia's or the United States' or the "" New World Order "") was purposefully creating a food shortage in order to starve people so that a nefarious group of elites could enslave them. These conspiracy theories are often connected to white supremacist ideals as they pit ""regular"" Australian farmers attempting to grow their own food against ""others"" who are competing for the food supply.

f80f6b93-50ee-4650-a7c1-358939ae159e,"Fact Check In May 2022, as abortion-rights and anti-abortion activists digested and responded to a leaked majority Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, attention turned to what some presented as a callous and inhumane argument for the restriction or prohibition of abortion access in the United States. For example, on May 6, left-leaning commentator and self-described body language expert Jack Brown tweeted : BREAKING: In a brief re abortion, Supreme court Justices Amy Coney Barrett/Alito's Draft, said US needs a “domestic supply of infants” to meet needs of parents seeking to adopt — that those who would otherwise abort must be made to carry to term — giving children up for adoption. In another widely shared tweet, @PaulCogan claimed that: Conservative Supreme Court Justice Barrett, wrote a brief about abortion. She noted the USA needed a “domestic supply of infants” to meet needs of parents seeking infants to adopt. She argued that mothers must birth their baby & give it up for adoption to meet market demands. And @tnicholsmd wrote : When a Supreme Court Justice writes that abortion should be outlawed for the purpose of generating an increased “domestic supply of infants” to meet needs of parents seeking infants to adopt, we aren’t exaggerating by stating that they want you to be brood mares for the state. @Stonekettle similarly claimed that the conservative justices in the majority had cited the ""domestic supply of infants for adoption"" as ""justification for taking away your right to your own body,"" and @LadyJayPersists described the argument in the brief as ""forced pregnancy in order to add to a 'domestic supply of infants' for adoption."" These tweets grossly misrepresented, or fundamentally misunderstood, the contents, context, and function of a footnote from the leaked draft opinion. None of the justices, including Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett, made the argument that abortion should be banned or restricted for the purpose of creating, maintaining, or increasing a ""domestic supply of infants."" Our rating is therefore ""False."" Where Did 'Domestic Supply of Infants' Come From? Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito is seen after a swearing-in ceremony for Mark Esper to be the new U.S. Secretary of Defense July 23, 2019, in the Oval Office. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.) The document whose leaking set off a firestorm in May 2022 was a draft majority opinion, written by Alito, in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization , which revolved around Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban. In it, the majority explicitly overruled Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey , a landmark 1992 case in which the court substantially reaffirmed the central hold in Roe, namely that the U.S. Constitution — in particular the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment — acknowledges and protects a fundamental (but not absolute) right to an abortion, as part of a broader fundamental right to privacy. Alito's draft opinion attacked that principle, which is essential to Roe, and stated: We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely — the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 'Important Policy Arguments' Should Be Weighed by 'the People and Their Elected Representatives' The draft opinion also recommended that the legal status of abortion should henceforth be left to lawmakers — federal and state — to decide (""It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people's elected representatives""), even though both opponents and supporters of abortion rights have made what the draft describes as ""important policy arguments"": Both sides make important policy arguments, but supporters of Roe and Casey must show that this Court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the States. They have failed to make that showing, and we thus return the power to weigh those arguments to the people and their elected representatives. Here's how Alito's draft summarized the ""important policy arguments"" made by both sides. First, ""defenders of Roe and Casey"": ""Do not claim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the underlying moral question,"" but; ""They do contend that changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion."" For example: ""Without the availability of abortion, they maintain, people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the types of relationships they desire"" [""Without the availability of abortion], women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors."" Meanwhile, ""Americans who believe that abortion should be restricted ... note that"": ""Attitudes about the pregnancy of unmarried women have changed drastically"" ""Federal and state laws ban discrimination on the basis of pregnancy"" ""Leave for pregnancy and childbirth are now guaranteed by law in many cases"" ""The costs of medical care associated with pregnancy are covered by insurance or government assistance"" ""States have increasingly adopted 'safe haven' laws, which generally allow women to drop off babies anonymously"" ""A woman who puts her newborn up for adoption today has little reason to fear that the baby will not find a suitable home"" ""Many people now have a new appreciation of fetal life and ... when prospective parents who want to have a child view a sonogram, they typically have no doubt that what they see is their daughter or son."" Remember, those are not arguments or claims that Alito or anyone else on the majority is making. Those are arguments made by others, but listed in Alito's draft opinion as representative of the most up-to-date policy positions on either side of the great moral and legal debate over abortion. One can quite legitimately dispute the fairness and representativeness of Alito's lists of ""important policy arguments,"" but it cannot reasonably be asserted that these are arguments Alito himself is making. Adoption and the 'Domestic Supply of Infants' The argument about adoption is as follows: Historically, one reason why a woman who was not in a position to care for a child might have chosen to access an abortion, rather than choosing to give birth and place the baby for adoption, was that she was concerned the child would not be properly cared for in the adoption system. However, in recent years the number of would-be adoptive parents has far exceeded the number of infants placed for adoption, which increases the likelihood of a stable and loving family environment being found for any given baby, thus undermining the relevance of the ""adoption fear"" basis for abortion, as outline above. In order to explain this point, Alito's draft opinion included a footnote that cited an August 2008 report published by the federal U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as some CDC statistics on adoption: The footnote also quoted from the 2008 CDC report, as follows: Nearly 1 million women were seeking to adopt children in 2002 (i.e., they were in demand for a child), whereas the domestic supply of infants relinquished at birth or within the first month of life and available to be adopted had become virtually nonexistent. Some readers might quite reasonably find it jarring to see the language of ""supply and demand"" — more commonly seen in the context of markets — being used in a federal government report about adoption. However, this is not what several viral social media posts said in May 2022. They said, specifically, that Alito and other conservative justices had themselves argued for the prohibition of abortion access, in order to increase or protect the ""domestic supply of infants"" made available for adoption. That claim fails in the following ways: The draft opinion did not make the argument about adoption, it cited it as one of several ""important policy arguments"" frequently made by opponents of Roe, Casey, and abortion rights A key point in the draft opinion was to stipulate that the evaluation of such policy arguments should not be a function or role of the Supreme Court. Thus, the opinion not only did not state a view on the adoption argument, it explicitly renounced its own stating a view on it As articulated in the draft opinion, the argument about adoption was not that abortion should be banned in order to increase the number of infants available for adoption, but that the ample availability of qualified would-be adoptive parents meant women considering abortion over adoption should not be concerned that any child to whom they give birth will not be given a suitable and loving home The phrase ""domestic supply of infants"" — the wording of which gave rise to considerable opprobrium — came from a 2008 CDC report included in a footnote, and not the main, original body of the draft opinion itself",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1683

In a statement on its website, the Department of Education said 41% of the submitted textbooks on the list would not be included for the following reasons (emphasis added): The approved list followed a thorough review of submissions at the Department, which found 41 percent of the submitted textbooks were impermissible with either Florida’s new standards or contained prohibited topics – the most in Florida’s history. Reasons for rejecting textbooks included references to Critical Race Theory (CRT), inclusions of Common Core, and the unsolicited addition of Social Emotional Learning (SEL) in mathematics. The highest number of books rejected were for grade levels K-5, where an alarming 71 percent were not appropriately aligned with Florida standards or included prohibited topics and unsolicited strategies. Despite rejecting 41 percent of materials submitted, every core mathematics course and grade is covered with at least one textbook. The department did not share information on the specific content that it objected to and the textbook publishers told The New York Times they had not received details about the objections. “It seems that some publishers attempted to slap a coat of paint on an old house built on the foundation of Common Core, and indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism, especially, bizarrely, for elementary school students,” DeSantis said. In 2021, Florida banned CRT from all classrooms in the state, arguing that instruction “must be factual and objective, and may not suppress or distort significant historical events.” Back then DeSantis took issue with the curriculum, describing it as “the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons."" Snopes has covered CRT and the controversies surrounding it previously. In recent years, Florida has passed legislation limiting the ways that race, gender, sexual orientation and social-emotional wellness can be taught and discussed in classrooms. DeSantis is also expected to sign legislation that prohibits instruction that could potentially make students feel uncomfortable about historical events because of their own race, sex, or origins. The Department of Education also cited materials from the Common Core as objectionable. Common Core is a nationwide effort to standardize mathematics and literacy curriculum expectations, and Florida and a number of other states have pushed back against it. While the exact content described as objectionable is not publicly available, this did not stop many on the internet from sharing posts falsely purporting to show pages from the rejected mathematics textbooks. One post on Facebook claimed that a question in a math textbook that also mentioned sexual abuse was in one of the rejected books. In reality , the question was from a math textbook in a Philadelphia high school (a claim we fact-checked back in 2018). Some of the questions related to the life of the Black poet Maya Angelou, as outlined in her autobiography , ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings . "" Another pos t, sent to us by readers, argued that a series of math questions that referenced slavery was also in the rejected textbooks. These questions were in fact from an elementary school in Georgia and generated controversy back in 2012.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,664

The people listed (from left to right) were Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke , former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain , conservative commentator Ben Shapiro , and former U.S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson . The tweet was authored by Jason Campbell of Media Matters for America , a left-leaning media researching group, shortly after 7 a.m. Over the course of hours, it had received almost 29,000 ""likes"" and 3,800 retweets (and counting), with many observers noting that Shapiro is white and Cain died in July 2020 after battling COVID-19. The tweet depicted an authentic visual moment from the conservative news outlet, though omitted the fact that concurrent audio (the host speaking) made clear that Cain was dead and Shapiro was white. Considering those facts, which we outline in detail below, we rate this claim ""True."" First, we went to Newsmax's website, where it archives recent video segments. We found the clip in question: a segment that aired the day prior on host Greg Kelly 's show, titled ""Greg Kelly Reports."" Around the 13-minute mark, the program showed footage of former President Donald Trump at a South Carolina rally, where he criticized an unspecified group of news outlets for ""not getting it"" — supposedly in reference to racial inequality in the U.S. Then, Kelly said: ""You can watch hours upon hours, centuries, actually, of the fake news ... and not learn a damn thing about what's really happening in terms of race in America, in my opinion. They're having a silly, foolish conversation about race to avoid having a serious, impactful one to actually help people."" Instead of turning to mainstream news outlets for updates on the era's ongoing civil rights movement , Kelly advised viewers to listen to actor Chris Rock and showed a years-old skit by the comedian titled, ""How Not to Get Your Ass Kicked by the Police."" Then, the Newsmax host called attention to the death of Patrick Lyola , a 26-year-old Black man who was fatally shot by a white officer in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and shared what he supposedly considers to be advice to avoid poverty and/or incarceration. As he spoke those words, the screen displayed the messages: ""A SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT RACE"" and ""LYOLA WOULD BE ALIVE IF LISTENED TO CHRIS ROCK"" and ""GO TO SCHOOL, GET MARRIED & HAVE KIDS."" Soon after that, the screen showed clips of Democratic politicians — which included U.S. President Joe Biden and U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley — talking about systemic racism and its existence throughout U.S. history. Among them was Yasmin Vossoughian , an MSNBC anchor. After that, the screen indeed depicted the headshots and names of Clarke, Cain, Shapiro, and Carson, all above a chyron that read: ""LEFT CONSIDERS BLACK CONSERVATIVES TO BE TRAITORS."" Meanwhile, Kelly said verbatim, according to the video: I wonder what Yasmin would do, and any of those other people, when they meet a Black conservative. They're out there, but they're shunned because, boy oh boy, what they have to say. And the late Herman Cain and, of course Ben Shapiro — not Black but one of the heroes of the movement. This really disrupts the narrative, and that's why they are marginalized, and they shouldn't be. They should be celebrated and listened to. In sum, it was true that Newsmax aired the headshots, and listed the names of Clarke, Cain, Shapiro, and Carson above the in-question chyron. However, simultaneously, host Greg Kelly made clear in his spoken remarks that Cain was dead and Shapiro was not Black.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,743

As social media users commented on the unusual trailer, a supposed screenshot of a Fox News chyron was circulated on social media that seemingly featured a quote from Heidi Cruz about how her husband, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, ""does not tan his testicles."" This is not a genuine quote from Heidi Cruz, nor is this a genuine chyron that aired on Fox News. In fact, the image has been digitally altered in more ways than one. In addition to adding a fake chyron, the photo of Heidi Cruz has itself manipulated. The image above was created by altering a photograph of Heidi during Cruz's unsuccessful presidential run in 2016 in an apparent attempt to make Cruz look older. The genuine photograph was used in several news articles at the time, as it seemingly captured Heidi being momentarily upset after her husband accidentally elbowed her during a group hug: It's unlikely that the Fox News would use a doctored photo of Cruz's wife during its broadcasts. Furthermore, we have not come across any videos showing this chyron, nor any alternate examples of screen captures of this supposed chyron. It appears that the fake chyron was created by @NotHoodlum , a Twitter account that labels itself as ""Satirical Emeritus"" in its bio. It was then reshared by @duty2warn as the "" chyron of the month .""

It did give a slightly reductive and over-simplified impression of the trailer, which was more than twice as long, and contained more context than was shown in the clip.

One Twitter user, for example, posted the below-displayed meme about the 39th president in April 2022: A reverse-image search of the meme revealed numerous instances in which internet users promoted this underlying claim: that Carter, at age 95, fell, received stitches and then the following day helped build houses for Habitat for Humanity — a Christian nonprofit that helps low-income families build homes and pay their mortgages. [See also: Why Do the Bidens Look Giant in Photo With Carters? ] The claim was true — though the incident had occurred more than two years ago, as of this writing. On Oct. 7, 2019, The Associated Press published the photographs featured in the meme, writing : NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — With a bandage above his left eye and a large, red welt below it, former President Jimmy Carter was greeted by a cheering crowd Monday morning as he prepared to help build a home with Habitat for Humanity in Nashville. Carter fell at home on Sunday, requiring 14 stiches, but he did not let his injuries keep him from participating in his 36th building project with the nonprofit Christian housing organization. He turned 95 last Tuesday, becoming the first U.S. president to reach that milestone. The newspaper reported that he and his wife, former First Lady Rosalyn Carter, worked that day on building corbels, a type of support bracket, for a home. CNN also reported on the public appearance, including the following quote from the former president in its Oct. 8, 2019, story: “I fell down and hit my forehead on a sharp edge and had to go to the hospital. And they took 14 stitches in my forehead and my eye is black, as you’ve noticed,” he said. “But I had a No. 1 priority and that was to come to Nashville and build houses.” According to the nonprofit's website , the couple formed a partnership with Habitat for Humanity in the 1980s , and they have rallied ""thousands of volunteers and even celebrities"" to join the organization's cause since then. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, Habitat for Humanity paused its so-called ""Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter Work Project,"" a reoccurring event during which the couple fundraises to build a grouping of homes somewhere.

For example, Chelsea Clinton is not married to Soros' nephew, Adam Schiff's sister is not married to Soros' son, and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is not Soros' niece. In April 2022, as Russia continued its assault on Ukraine, another version of this rumor was circulated on social media, this time falsely claiming that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was Soros' cousin. This false rumor was shared on social media along with a claim that this information came directly from the Pentagon: The Pentagon has released no such statement. We searched the Pentagon's website and social media accounts and found no remarks about Soros and Zelenskyy being cousins. A spokesperson for the Pentagon told Lead Stories that no such statement was released, and a spokesperson for Soros' Open Society Foundation told Politifact that the rumor was ""entirely false."" The Pentagon did not release a statement identifying Zelenskyy and Soros as cousins, Soros' foundation has denied these rumors, and this claim mirrors a common smear tactic among far-right circles. Furthermore, Zelenskyy was once asked about a similarly baseless rumor, the claim that the Ukraine government was ""installed"" by Soros. In 2020, Zelenskky laughed at the notion, saying: ""I am not familiar with a person named Soros. I have never met him. I'm definitely not one of that 'followers of Soros'.

We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. In April 2022, U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel, R-Ohio, released a new campaign ad that featured video footage of him condemning critical race theory while standing on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, the site of a series of civil rights marches during March 1965. While much of the social media chatter around the ad focused on Mandel's choice of location, (Martin Luther King's daughter Bernice , among others, criticized the ad), other social media users promoted the specious claim that Mandel's face had been digitally overlaid onto a Black U.S. Marine's body during a different segment of the ad. There's no truth to this claim. Mandel's face was not pasted onto a Black Marine's body. This is a genuine photograph of Mandel, who enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserves in 2000 and served at least two tours as an intelligence specialist in Iraq , posing with five fellow Marines. The claim that the producers of the ad pasted Mandel's face onto a Black Marine's body is based almost entirely on third-party observations that the skin tone of Mandel's face in the photo appears lighter than the skin tone of his hands. No evidence (such as an unaltered photo showing six Black Marines instead of five Black Marines plus Mandel) has emerged to prove that Mandel was not originally in the photograph. It's possible that the photo was altered in another respect, however. Politico reporter Natalie Allison obtained the original and posted it on Twitter for comparison. While there appears to be a significant color difference between Mandel's face and his hands in the version that appeared in the campaign ad, this color difference is far less noticeable in the original photograph (at right in the tweet below): We reached out to Mandel's campaign for additional information but have yet to hear back.

A video of Wisconsin talk radio host Vicki McKenna's appearance on the Dr. Duke Show, a podcast hosted by Dr. Duke Pesta, racked up more than 100,000 views as it circulated on social media: There's no truth to this rumor. The Waunakee school district has not seen a wave of students identifying as cats, and they did not enforce any ""furry protocols"" in order to deal with these alleged students. Randy Guttenberg, the superintendent of the Waunakee school district, told the Wisconsin news outlet Isthmus.com : “I am aware of the misinformation that is circulating on social media. The Waunakee Community School District does not have protocols for furries, nor do we have an issue with disruptions in our school and classrooms.” The ""furry protocol"" rumor is the newest wrinkle in a series of false claims concerning absurd behavior in schools. In January 2022, for example, unfounded rumors were circulated on social media claiming that a school in Michigan had installed litter boxes in order to appease students who had started identifying as cats . The rumor about litter boxes gained enough traction that it was even mentioned during a March 2022 debate between state lawmakers in Nebraska. Sen. Bruce Bostleman would later apologize for falsely claiming that students were meowing, identifying as cats, and going to the bathroom in litter boxes. NBC News reported : A Nebraska state lawmaker apologized on Monday after he publicly cited a persistent but debunked rumor alleging that schools are placing litter boxes in school bathrooms to accommodate children who self-identify as cats. [...] “They meow and they bark and they interact with their teachers in this fashion,” Bostelman said during legislative debate. “And now schools are wanting to put litter boxes in the schools for these children to use. How is this sanitary?” The claim that the Waunakee school district had implemented furry protocols appears to have originated with an email sent to Pesta. In the days before McKenna appeared on Peta's podcast, Pesta gave a few presentations that mentioned this alleged email. A photograph from one of those presentations went viral on social media: While we're not sure exactly when or where this photograph was taken, we did find a video of Pesta using this same slide at a presentation in Hartland, Wisconsin on March 31, 2022, called ""American Public Schools: From Failure to Fascism."" This event was sponsored by No Left Turn In Education, a group Media Matters describes as an anti-critical race theory group, and presented by the FreedomProject Academy, an online academy founded by the right-wing political advocacy group the John Birch Society. Interestingly, Pesta follows the slide about ""furry protocols"" with another false rumor about a teacher being fired for protesting against the installation of litterboxes at schools in Michigan for students who identified as cats. While Pesta claims that this woman was fired, she was not fired . Furthermore, there's no evidence that any schools in Michigan installed litterboxes for their students . Midland Public Schools Superintendent Michael Sharrow said: “There is no truth whatsoever to this false statement/accusation! There have never been litter boxes within MPS schools.” It's also worth noting that while McKenna claimed on Pesta's podcast that she had received multiple emails about these furry protocols, the email she presents is the same email Pesta has been showcasing during his presentations. The claim that a Wisconsin school district implemented furry protocols in order to deal with a wave of students identifying as cats is based almost entirely on one alleged email said to have been sent from a third-party (an anonymous student's grandmother) to a podcast host. No actual evidence has been presented to support the claim. There are no photos or videos documenting such behavior. No teachers have come forward to talk about the supposed protocols, and no students or parents have corroborated any of these claims.

How long should Americans expect — how long should we be bracing for this really, sort of, historic inflation and some unprecedented gas prices? Vice President Kamala Harris: When we look at Putin’s actions — the previous question — there is — it is painful to watch. It is painful to watch what is happening to innocent people in Ukraine who just want to live in their own country and have pride in themselves as Ukrainians, who want to be home speaking the language they know, going to the church that they know, raising their children in the community where their families have lived for generations. And by the millions, now, are having to flee with nothing but a backpack. And then you compound that with what happened a couple of days — the President talked about it today; I talked about it yesterday — in terms of a maternity hospital, pregnant women. We are — we have the unfortunate experience, all of us right now who are not in Ukraine, of witnessing horror. So we are committed in everything we are doing. And, yes, then the President did say in the State of the Union, there is a price to pay for democracy. Got to stand with your friends. And as everybody knows, even in your personal life, being loyal to those friendships based on common principles and values, sometimes it’s difficult. Often, it ain’t easy. But that’s what the friendship is about, based on shared values. So that’s what we’re doing.

2aac5d13-6b0d-4c94-b879-52d3deb8cf76,"In March 2022, MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell outlined some interesting historical context for the grilling of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson by Republicans during Senate confirmation hearings. O'Donnell claimed that the tradition of public confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominees was not in place for the dozens of white Christian men who assumed a seat on the court after its establishment in 1789, but was urgently created for the first Jewish nominee Louis Brandeis in 1916. O'Donnell's presentation of the facts was highly accurate. His argument — that the tradition of rigorous and hostile senate confirmation hearings was started in response to the nomination of the first Jewish justice — was largely correct. However, he did omit to mention a closed-door hearing for one nominee in 1873, and he mistakenly claimed the Senate ""stopped asking questions for decades"" after Brandeis, when in fact, just nine years later, another nominee was grilled for several hours by Senate committee members. We are therefore issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" What Lawrence O'Donnell Said O'Donnell made the claim on Twitter on March 22, where he wrote : ""For the 1st 127 years when only white Christian men were allowed to be Supreme Court Justices, there were zero confirmation hearings. Confirmation hearing was invented for the 1st Jewish nominee."" Earlier, he devoted a segment on his MSNBC show ""The Last Word"" to dissecting the demographic and historical background of the nomination of Jackson who, if she is confirmed, would become the first Black woman to sit on the nation's highest court. O'Donnell explained: Most of the 115 Supreme Court justices did not even graduate from law school. Only 49 of them were actually law school graduates. For the first 127 years, the Supreme Court was a bastion of affirmative action for white Christian men only ... And not one of them ever had to answer a single question from a senator about anything. Not one of them had confirmation hearings. Not one . At least one of those people was confirmed by the full senate the day after he was nominated. That's how easy it was. Then, in 1916, came the first Jewish nominee for the United States Supreme Court — Harvard Law School graduate Louis Brandeis. And that is when the confirmation hearing had to be invented . The white Christian men of the senate wanted to ask some questions of the first Jewish nominee to the Supreme Court. After Justice Brandeis was confirmed, the senate stopped asking questions for decades. They had no questions for Stanley Reed, in 1938 — the last Supreme Court justice who did not graduate from law school. Only in the television age did confirmation hearings become routine for Supreme Court justices, and that was entirely because senators wanted to be on TV. [Emphasis is added]. Early History of Senate Confirmation Hearings According to research conducted by the Congressional Research Service — a non-partisan and highly reliable source — there were 101 nominations of Supreme Court associate or chief justices between 1789 and 1916. Of those, none was subjected to public hearings of any Senate committee, thus effectively supporting the first part of O'Donnell's claim. In January 1916, that changed dramatically. After the death of Justice Joseph Lamar, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis, a progressive lawyer born in Kentucky but based in Massachusetts, and known for suing major corporations, defending workers' rights, and advocating privacy protections. Many Republicans fiercely opposed Brandeis's nomination, in part because they portrayed him as a "" radical"" and a ""socialist ,"" but also, undoubtedly, because Brandeis was Jewish . Senators would subject Brandeis to an unprecedented 19 days of committee hearings (although he himself did not attend in person ), and it would take four months for his appointment to be confirmed — still a record for the slowest successful Supreme Court confirmation process in history. In the end, the Senate confirmed his appointment by 47 votes to 22 in June 1916, and Brandeis served on the court until 1939, becoming one of the major legal figures in the United States in the 20th century. While Brandeis was the first Supreme Court nominee subjected to public hearings — contentious, protracted hearings at that — the Senate had held closed-door hearings on one occasion in the previous 127 years. In December 1873, President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Attorney General George Henry Williams to serve as Supreme Court Chief Justice. Initially, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended his nomination be confirmed, but later that month, reversed course after the emergence of several rather murky allegations of corruption and embezzlement against Williams. After holding two ""executive"" (that is, private) sessions, the committee members unanimously opposed Williams' ascension, and in January 1874, Williams himself asked Grant to withdraw his name from consideration, which Grant duly did. After Brandeis, the Senate largely resumed its previous practice of confirming or rejecting Supreme Court nominations without the need for substantial public hearings. However, there were closed hearings in 1922, and in 1925, the Senate judiciary committee held a public hearing on the nomination of Attorney General Harlan Stone. There, committee members grilled Stone for several hours , in what was the first ever occasion on which a Supreme Court nominee appeared in person to answer questions submitted by the senate. That spectacle took place less than nine years after the Brandeis hearings. So O'Donnell's claim that after Brandeis, ""the senate stopped asking questions for decades"" is not right. Senate hearings were very rare, and the intensity of scrutiny to which Brandeis was subjected was indeed unique at that time. However, he was not the only Supreme Court nominee made to sweat over his confirmation during that era. The next public hearing came in 1930, and during that decade Supreme Court nominees were as likely as not to face public hearings in the judiciary committee. From the 1940s onward, though, Supreme Court nominees were more likely than not to be subjected to committee hearings.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1119

The Misleading Tweets A user named @sourpatchlyds tweeted about the photograph of Biden and the trees with green leaves in the background: ""This picture is staged. The trees in DC do not look like that right now. Why? Why is it staged. Why is everything a fucking lie with these people."" Source: Twitter Another Twitter user named @debostic also appeared to tweet that the picture of Biden showed trees with green leaves that weren't really there in the month of March: ""This is a live shot of The White House today. The trees are mostly bare and the weather is overcast. Your administration is a propaganda machine spreading misinformation. Everything you do and say is a lie."" Source: Twitter Jackson's Magnolia Trees Despite these two tweets, the truth here was quite simple. The ""live shot"" picture tweeted by @debostic showed the north side. The photograph in the tweet from Biden's @POTUS Twitter account was taken from the opposite side: This picture from inside Marine One showed Biden saluting a U.S. Marine and walking on the South Lawn in front of the South Portico and two large trees. On this south side of the White House are two historic Southern magnolia trees ( Magnolia grandiflora ) that, according to tradition , were originally added by former President Andrew Jackson in 1835. Southern magnolia trees such as the ones framing the South Lawn have evergreen leaves, which explains why the trees are leafy and green in the photo of Biden. For further evidence, another picture captured on the same day by Getty Images photographer Alex Wong also showed one of the magnolia trees in the background. Magnolia Trees We found more information about magnolia trees on Brittanica.com. The website published that magnolia trees and shrubs have ""evergreen or deciduous, alternate smooth-margined leaves"": magnolia, (genus Magnolia), any member of the genus Magnolia (family Magnoliaceae; order Magnoliales), about 240 species of trees and shrubs native to North and South America, the Himalayas, and East Asia. They are valued for their large and fragrant white, yellow, pink, or purple flowers and frequently handsome leaves and conelike fruits. Some are important garden ornamentals; others are local timber sources. They have evergreen or deciduous, alternate smooth-margined leaves. The flowers, usually cuplike and fragrant, are located at the branch tips and have three sepals, six to 12 petals arranged in two to four series, and many spirally arranged stamens. The numerous simple ovaries in the centre later form a conelike fruit. The seeds, usually reddish, often hang pendulously by slender threads. According to The Associated Press , one of Jackson's two magnolia trees on the South Lawn was trimmed in 2017 due to safety concerns. It also noted that the two trees rise ""almost as tall as the White House itself."" In sum, no, Biden, his administration, nor anyone else staged the photograph in front of the White House with faked or digitally altered trees.

33b592d0-5602-4334-a724-6e104bdd857d,"After a long line of global companies halted business endeavors in Russia, the world’s largest food and beverage company came under fire for maintaining activities in the hostile Eastern European nation. As of the original publication of this article on March 22, 2022, Nestle was still operating in Russia following that nation’s invasion of Ukraine. In a statement dated March 11, the company said that it was “shocked and deeply saddened by the invasion of Ukraine” and noted that in addition to certain limitations on its production activity in Russia, Nestle was continuing to keep its activities “under close review.” “As a food company and employer, we recognize that we also have a responsibility toward our more than 7,000 employees in Russia — most of whom are locals. We will continue to do our utmost to ensure a reliable supply of safe and essential food products for the local people,” read the statement, which is archived here . Nestlé further noted that it was continuing to “focus on meeting the needs of the local people” by doing the following: We have halted all our advertising activities in Russia We have suspended all capital investment in the country We have suspended exports of our products out of Russia (except for essential foods, like baby food, to Commonwealth of Independent States countries) We have suspended imports of our products into Russia (one example being Nespresso) except for essential foods (including baby food, cereals, and tailored nutrition and therapeutic pet foods for specialist retailers and veterinarian clinics) The decision to keep operating in Russia came under fire after international governments and a number of private organizations announced their own forms of sanctions against President Vladimir Putin . As the Swiss company announced its decision to remain, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy singled Nestle out during a livestreamed speech, reported Bloomberg News and CNN . ""'Good food. Good life.' This is the slogan of Nestle. Your company that refuses to leave Russia. Even now — when there are threats from Russia to other European countries. Not only to us. When there is even nuclear blackmail from Russia,"" the president reportedly said. Nestle continued to sell things like baby food, cereal, and pet food in Russia, according to a CBS News report . Similarly, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal made pointed remarks on social media to Nestle CEO Mark Shneider about the “side effect of staying in the Russian market.” “Unfortunately, he shows no understanding. Paying taxes to the budget of a terrorist country means killing defenseless children&mothers [sic]. Hope that Nestle will change its mind soon,” Shmyhal tweeted on March 17 . A spokesperson for the food company reportedly responded to the allegations in an email to CBS MoneyWatch . ""The fact that we, like other food companies, supply the population with important food does not mean that we simply continue as before,"" the spokesperson reportedly said. ""We are doing whatever we can in Ukraine and neighboring countries to help alleviate this humanitarian catastrophe. We are still one of the few active food companies in Ukraine and sometimes even manage to distribute food in Kharkiv,"" added the spokesperson.

The ad led to an article on NickiSwift.com that had the headline: ""Things You Didn't Know About Barron Trump.""

07f6e92c-ad46-4641-93bd-b2385459cc2e,"March 2022 saw the latest prominent example of a ludicrous conspiracy theory that falsely claims Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is a neo-Nazi, or holds views sympathetic towards Nazism. The smear against Zelenskyy — who is himself Jewish and whose great-uncles died in the Holocaust — is designed to justify Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which began in late February. Previously, Snopes has debunked a similar false rumor about Zelenskyy, concluding that a photograph which appeared to show him holding aloft a soccer jersey emblazoned with a swastika was, in fact, the result of digital editing. In this case, social media users pointed to a symbol visible on Zelenskyy's T-shirt during his daily video messages, claiming it was a Nazi ""Iron Cross,"" and therefore proof of Zelenskyy's Nazism. For example, a March 16 post on the /conspiracy section of the popular forum Reddit contained: screenshots of Zelenskyy wearing a green T-shirt emblazoned with a cruciform symbol; pictures of the Iron Cross; an excerpt from the Wikipedia entry for ""Iron Cross""; and the suggestive caption ""Probably just a coincidence."" Some were more explicit in claiming that Zelenskyy was wearing a Nazi symbol, in a brazen demonstration of his supposed Nazism, while others rather insidiously presented their claim in the form of a question . On Facebook, the claim was shared widely , as shown in the screenshot below: In reality, of course, those claims were false. Zelenskyy did not wear a Nazi symbol, not least because he himself is not a Nazi or neo-Nazi. Rather, the cross on his T-shirt was the official emblem of Ukraine's armed forces. Given that he is, in his capacity as president, also the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of those armed forces, and those forces are currently fighting off an invasion, Zelenskyy's wearing of the symbol could hardly be less surprising, less controversial, or less in need of elaborate explanation. Our rating is ""False."" The emblem of Ukraine's Armed Forces was officially adopted by a presidential decree in September 2009 . It consists of the tryzub — the blue and gold trident of Vladimir the Great, a medieval Ukrainian leader — placed at the center of a red cross pattée: Zelensky often wears attire emblazoned with a modified version of that emblem, without the original color palette. For example, here it is on his T-shirt in a March 6 video : And in a March 9 video : The cross pattée is a type of cross whose legs are narrower at the center and widen at their ends. It has been a nearly ubiquitous feature of European heraldry and symbolism for nearly 1,000 years, featuring in countless flags, coats of arms, and emblems, in a variety of historical, geographic, and political contexts. For example, the cross pattée is a key component of the Victoria Cross — the most prestigious royal honor available to members of the British Armed Forces: Victoria Cross, The Victoria Cross Is The Highest Military Decoration Awarded For Valour To Members Of The Armed Forces Of Various Commonwealth Countries, And Previous British Empire Territories. (Photo By Encyclopaedia Britannica/UIG Via Getty Images) Similarly, the cross pattée features prominently: on the flag of the country of Georgia ; the U.S. Armed Forces Distinguished Flying Cross ; flags used by the Knights Templar ; the coat of arms of Durham University in England; and the crest of Toulouse F.C. , a French soccer club, among many others. In Russia, the cross pattée forms an important part of the medals awarded to those inducted into the Order of St. George, the highest Russian military honor available. The order, including descriptions of the cross pattée to be used in associated medals and ribbons, was reestablished in August 2000 under a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin . In the late 19th century and during World War I, the cross pattée was a key component of the Iron Cross — a military medal awarded in the German Empire. In World War II, Adolf Hitler reintroduced the Iron Cross, and it has since taken on an association with Nazism. It's important to note here that even in the rather narrow historical context of German military insignia, the cross pattée is not originally or uniquely Nazi; but because of its use in World War II, the Iron Cross has become one of several Third Reich symbols favored by 21st-century white supremacists and white nationalists in the United States. However, the Anti-Defamation League notes on its website : ""...An Iron Cross in isolation (i.e., without a superimposed swastika or without other accompanying hate symbols) cannot be determined to be a hate symbol. Care must therefore be used to correctly interpret this symbol in whatever context in which it may be found."" Some key facts, in conclusion: The emblem of Ukraine's armed forces is not an Iron Cross . Both contain the cross patée, but the Ukrainian emblem has a second component, which is lacking in the Iron Cross — the trident of Vladimir the Great. Therefore, claims that Zelenskyy was furtively showing off his supposed Nazism by wearing an Iron Cross were: factually inaccurate (it's not actually an Iron Cross); incoherent (by the same logic, Durham University is a bastion of Nazism, and anyone awarded the Victoria Cross is a Nazi of the highest order); and execrable (Zelenskyy is Jewish and has family members who were slaughtered in the Holocaust).",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1017

CNN's Daniel Dale, who has access to the network's raw footage of this broadcast, reported that Greene clapped four times during this speech. Here's one more example of Greene's clapping: While one may argue that Greene did not clap enthusiastically for Zelenskyy, the claim that she ""refused"" to clap is simply incorrect. Greene did applaud during this speech by the president of Ukraine. However, she also put out a statement saying that the United States should stop providing aide to the embattled country .

As a result, we're issuing a rating of ""Mostly False."" What those claims actually referred to was something called the Members Representational Allowance (MRA), which the non-partisan Congressional Research Service describes as follows : Members of the House of Representatives have one consolidated allowance, the Members’ Representational Allowance (MRA), with which to operate their offices... While Representatives have a high degree of flexibility to operate their offices in a way that supports their congressional duties and responsibilities, they must operate within a number of restrictions and regulations. The Members’ Representational Allowance (MRA), the allowance provided to Members of the House of Representatives to operate their DC and district offices, may only support Members in their official and representational duties. It may not be used for personal or campaign purposes. The MRA can be used to pay office staff, but does not include the salary of House members themselves, which has not changed since 2009 and is $174,000 for a typical member. Usually, representatives spend their MRA on travel, paying staff, printing services, office supplies, and so on. On March 15, President Joe Biden signed into law the massive omnibus spending bill. H.R. 2471. Around halfway through the 2,700-page text of the bill , the following stipulation can be found: Members' Representational Allowances Including members' clerk hire, official expenses of members, and official mail For Members' representational allowances, including Members' clerk hire, official expenses, and official mail, $774,400,000. In other words, the collective MRA for the House of Representatives is just over $774 million for the 2022 fiscal year. For the 2021 fiscal year , the MRA was $640 million, which means a year-on-year increase of $134.4 million, or exactly 21 percent, as highlighted by Roll Call . Senators, who also typically have a salary of $174,000, avail themselves of a roughly equivalent allowance, called the Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense Account ( SOPOEA ).

d60796f9-942e-4ff2-8f19-fd1953f9cc2d,"The U.S. and European countries began isolating Russia economically since its invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022. At the same time, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration came under fire from right-wing media for its reported dependence on Russian oil. Fox News host Sean Hannity claimed on his show, “This oil is Putin's lifeblood, and it is and has always been. And to me, it's just incomprehensible and frankly unconscionable that despite these terrifying war crimes that you see unfolding every day and night against men, women and children, that the Biden administration continues to buy this thug's oil.” He said that Russia was selling billions of dollars worth of oil to the U.S. and European countries, and was effectively enabling Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. The U.S. does import oil and other energy products from Russia. However, in March 2022, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the U.S. government was “exploring” options to ban all imports of Russian oil and energy products. ""Our bill would ban the import of Russian oil and energy products into the United States, repeal normal trade relations with Russia and Belarus, and take the first step to deny Russia access to the World Trade Organization,” she said. White House spokesperson Jen Psaki discussed the possibility on Feb. 25, 2022, saying “on the energy sector, no option is off the table.” Psaki added that cutting imports could have harmful effects in the U.S.: But again, to go back to [...] some of the principles here, our sanctions are designed to harm Russia’s economy, not our economy, and that’s a key balance that we’re clearly trying to strike. [...] The other factor here on the energy sector is that starting out with energy or — could actually benefit President Putin and pad his pockets because, given high oil and gas prices, cutting off Russian oil and gas could drive prices up to Putin’s benefit. How Much Energy Does US Import from Russia? According to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2020 total Russian petroleum (including crude oil) made up only 7% of imports. The U.S. imported 52% of its total petroleum from Canada, by comparison. The American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) trade association said that in 2021 the U.S. imported 209,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and 500,000 bpd of other petroleum products from Russia. “Although Russian crude accounts for only three percent of U.S. crude oil imports and about one percent of total crude oil processed by U.S. refineries—Russian crude oil imports are important to refineries on the West Coast and Gulf Coast,” the group said , referring to 2021 numbers. By comparison , 61 percent of imports came from Canada, 10 percent from Mexico, and 6 percent from Saudi Arabia. Russian imports of crude oil to the U.S. have increased since 2019, “to help replace heavy sour crude from Venezuela that U.S. refineries can no longer import.” According to Adam Pankratz , a professor at the University of British Columbia’s Sauder School of Business, one potential scenario of cutting out Russian oil would result in the U.S. relying on its strategic petroleum reserves, and so the country would not be badly affected by the loss in oil supply. On the other hand, Pankratz told Al Jazeera , “If the U.S. stopped importing Russian oil, that would mean that likely many other countries would also no longer be importing Russian oil, and that would make a very tight oil market already much tighter, and that would drive up the price of oil and that in turn can drive inflation, which in turn can affect the US economy.” AFPM suggested policies that could blunt the impact of reducing Russian energy supplies: While there is no near-term, silver-bullet policy to blunt the impact of geopolitical disruptions of the market, pursuing policies that allow domestic production to return to pre-pandemic levels will help to provide market stability and insulate not only the U.S. but the world from major disruptions. Policymakers can also provide relief from policies that increase the cost of producing refined product and policies that make it uneconomic to transport crude oil and petroleum products domestically. Nearly half of Russia’s overall exports are of crude oil, petroleum, and natural gas. According to Russia’s finance ministry , the country made around $119 billion in oil and gas revenue in 2021. In October 2021, the country made almost $500 million per day from oil and gas sales. The E.U., U.K. and U.S. together accounted for about half of Russia’s goods exports in 2021, which means they are effectively providing a significant chunk of Russia’s revenue from energy exports. The U.S. is still importing Russian energy products. However, the U.S. is not as reliant on them as a source of energy as expected, and is considering legislation that bans imports from Russia.

We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. During the early days of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, in March 2022, social media users enthusiastically shared a lengthy post that claimed back in 2014, United Nations (U.N.) Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had declared Ukraine was not a independent state, and as a result, Russia's military aggressions there eight years later were justified. Several Facebook posts , dated late February and early March , contained versions of the same post, which typically began as follows: The Secretary-General of the United Nations has stated that Ukraine has not applied for border registration since 1991, so the state of Ukraine does not exist....And we don't know about it!!!... The earliest version we could find was posted by conspiracy theorist Simon Parkes, on Feb. 22: To the untrained eye, the post might have appeared authoritative, with its citations of specific dates and self-assured discussion of various texts and reference points such as, ""According to the CIS Treaty,"" ""Under international law,"" and ""According to the Budapest Memorandum..."" In reality, the screed was inaccurate, incoherent gobbledygook. Ukraine is indeed an independent nation-state, and has been universally recognized as such since 1991. We are issuing a rating of ""False."" Why Ukraine is a Sovereign Nation State Article 4 of the UN Charter of 1945 sets out the requirements for membership in the U.N.: Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations contained in the present Charter and, in the judgment of the Organization, are able and willing to carry out these obligations. The admission of any such state to membership in the United Nations will be effected by a decision of the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council. Two of the founding members of the U.N. were the Soviet Union and Ukraine — then known as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR). In August 1991, upon Ukraine's declaration of independence, the Ukrainian SSR's representative to the U.N., Hennadiy Udovenko, informed the U.N. that the country's new name was, simply, Ukraine. There was no other change to Ukraine's membership of the U.N., which was retained in 1991, nor its status as a sovereign state. Nor was there any requirement for Ukraine to ""register its borders."" Furthermore, the U.N. lists Ukraine as one of its members — a prerequisite for which is the status of independent state — and former Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has, of course, repeatedly referred to Ukraine as an independent state . So too has his successor, the current U.N. Secretary General António Guterres, who said just this week, in the context of Russia's invasion, ""The territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine must be respected in line with the UN Charter."" The CIS Charter , which established the post-Soviet Commonwealth of Independent States , makes no reference whatsoever to the territorial integrity or sovereignty of Ukraine. The Budapest Memorandum was a 1994 agreement between the U.S., U.K., Russia and Ukraine, which had to do with nuclear non-proliferation and the thorny question of how to manage Ukraine's decommissioning of its nuclear weapons, in the post-Soviet era. Not only does the Budapest Memorandum not state that ""Ukraine has no borders,"" as Parkes' post bizarrely claims, it actually required the signatories — including Russia — to re-affirm the very opposite : The Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America, reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine...to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,721
6bab9eeb-c32e-4478-a1ae-cdb2b56acb58,"In early 2022, right-wing Congress members Paul Gosar of Arizona and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia provoked outrage and criticism, including from some fellow Republicans, after they took part in a conference organized by white nationalist Nick Fuentes . Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, for example, took aim at the pair in response to a question from CNN's Dana Bash, on Feb. 27, making a reference to a line from the movie ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"": ""One character says 'Morons. I've got morons on my team.' And I have to think anybody that would sit down with white nationalists and speak at their conference was certainly missing a few IQ points."" In the days that followed, social media users shared what appeared to be a screenshot of a response issued by Gosar, dated March 1, 2022. The tweet seemed designed to defend or counter-attack against Romney's criticism, but was phrased in such a way that Gosar inadvertently made himself look worse: Mitt Romney says that speaking at a white nationalist event makes me a ""moron."" Does he think that bothers me, being called stupid? I've heard it my whole life. From my classmates. My colleagues. My constituents. The media. My siblings. Every teacher I ever had. Nice try though. The screenshot was also shared very widely on Facebook , as the image below demonstrates: In reality, Gosar never sent any such tweet, and the screenshots were fake. We are issuing a rating of ""False."" As of March 4, Gosar's official Twitter account — @RepGosar — showed no record of any such tweet , meaning one of two things must be true: either the tweet was removed or deleted, or it never existed. Luckily, we can check whether the tweet was deleted using a resource called Politwoops — a database created and maintained by ProPublica, which tracks and keeps a record of tweets removed or deleted by U.S. politicians and electoral candidates. A quick check of the @RepGosar feed on Politwoops shows that the most recent deleted tweet from that account came on  Feb. 21. Therefore, we can safely conclude Gosar never sent the ""stupid"" tweet, and never made the remarks attributed to him. Even if we were unable to definitively determine that the tweet was bogus using Politwoops, other clues indicated that it was not the genuine article. For example, every social media post appeared to contain the same screenshot, or slightly cropped variations — showing Twitter in dark mode , with a dark blue background. If the tweet was real, one could reasonably expect that more than one person had taken a screenshot of it, and it would therefore be highly likely to be available with a white background, as well. Furthermore, while screenshots of the purported tweet were widely available on social media, a link to the tweet itself was not. This is another common sign that a tweet does not actually exist, but is instead the result of digital editing.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,571

They claimed that Ukraine was run by Nazis ( false ), that Ukraine was committing genocide on its own people ( false ), and that Russia was attacking biolabs to prevent ""COVID-2"" ( false ). Another line of disinformation attempted to downplay violence in Ukraine. This was largely done when people posted photographs and videos that supposedly showed ""crisis actors ,"" or people pretending to be in crisis there. A video of a camera crew filming people running through the street, for example, was posted to Bitchute ( a video platform known for hosting far-right, conspiratorial, and hate content ) along with the title  ""How to Make a Propaganda Video?"" and the hashtags #UKRAINE #RUSSIA and #PROPAGANDA. Rumble, another video platform known for hosting far-right content, posted this video under the caption ""completely choreographed Fake News In Ukraine - Still Believe Mockingbird Media?"" On ""TheGreatAwakening,"" a conspiratorial website dedicated to the debunked QAnon conspiracy theory, this video was shared with the caption ""Lights, Camera, Action!"" and on Twitter it was shared as if it showed ""crisis actors"" filmed ""in the middle of the 'massive and scary' Russian invasion."" Was this Video Filmed in Ukraine? This video was not filmed in the Ukraine, and it was not filmed in 2022. This video was originally posted in 2013 and shows a behind-the-scenes look at the making of "" Invasion Planet Earth "" (originally titled "" Kaleidoscope Man ""), a sci-fi adventure movie about an alien invasion. The above-displayed scene was filmed in Birmingham, England, not Ukraine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEONOBOAkEM Did News Outlets Share This 'Helpless Ukrainians' Footage? Another version of this rumor hinged on the claim that the news media was sharing an abbreviated version of this video that only showed people running (with no hints of a camera crew) in order to exaggerate the state of affairs in Ukraine. By claiming that a miscaptioned version of this footage was being shared by the news media, social media users could claim that this was an example of ""globalist propaganda."" But we have not found a single post from a genuine news outlet that presented this footage as if it were real. The ""news outlet"" included the above-displayed screenshot is a weeks-old Twitter account, @mightyfarooz200, that has no apparent connections to any credible news outlet. How to Make a Propaganda Narrative This video was not filmed in Ukraine during Russia's invasion of the country. It does not show crisis actors and it was not shared as if it were genuine footage of Russia's invasion as reported by credible media news outlets. However, this is still a good example of propaganda, just not in the way that it's being presented online. This footage was widely circulated on social media with one of two claims: First, that it showed Ukrainian ""crisis actors"" filming a propaganda video, and second that the news media was using miscaptioned footage to misrepresent the situation in Ukraine. Neither of these claims were true. Our search for postings of this video turned up dozens of far-right accounts sharing this video as if it showed crisis actors, and practically zero postings of people sharing this video as if it showed a genuine attack. In other words, this video was widely shared by those attempting to downplay the violence by Russians in Ukraine, not by those attempting to exaggerate it.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,665

I want to see the focus of our government move to issues that matter and impact our daily life. It's time to move away from the manipulation of special interest groups. Money and power have no place in influencing our public servants,” wrote Taylor. According to her website, those issues include a pro-life platform centered around gun rights, election reform, immigration, the economy, and education.

694783fd-a846-4ecb-bad1-30efb587c418,"On Feb. 3, 2022, U.S. President Joe Biden claimed in a speech about gun violence and policing in New York City that gun manufacturers are part of ""the only industry in America"" that is exempt from being sued. Sitting next to New York State officials, including Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Merrick Garland , Biden asserted the following, according to video footage of the event and the official White House transcript : Imagine had we had a liability — they’re the only industry in America that is exempted from being able to be sued by the public . The only one. Imagine had that been the way with cigarette manufacturers. Where the hell would we — where the heck would we be? We’d be in tough shape. Why gun manufacturers? Because of the power of their lobbying ability. It’s got to end. End. They’ve got to be held responsible for the things that they do that are irresponsible. And, folks, you know, it’s the only industry in America, as I said, that’s exempt from being sued. And I think — I find it to be outrageous. [See The Associated Press' coverage of Biden's full remarks in New York City here .] Conservative media outlets such as Townhall.com and the National Review highlighted the above-transcribed claim by the president, and numerous commentators called into question its legitimacy. The president's statement was untrue on multiple levels. While the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act provides gun manufacturers some exemptions in liability (it grants them immunity against lawsuits alleging wrongdoing because their products were used in crimes), people can still sue gun manufacturers for a variety of reasons and be successful. Next, the country's gun-making industry is not the only sector for which federal lawmakers have developed some liability protections. For example, the federal government has granted vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna immunity from liability if something goes unintentionally wrong with their COVID-19 shots, as reported by CNBC . CNN fact-checking database said of the president's Feb. 3 claim: [Gun] manufacturers can still be held liable for (and thus sued for) a range of things, including negligence, breach of contract regarding the purchase of a gun, or certain damages from defects in the design of a gun. In 2019, the Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit against gun manufacturer Remington Arms Company to continue. The plaintiffs, a survivor and families of nine other victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, are attempting to hold the company, which manufactured the semi-automatic rifle that was used in the killing, partly responsible by targeting the company's marketing practices, another area where gun manufacturers can be held liable. Other industries also have some exemptions in liability. For example, vaccine manufacturers cannot be held liable in a civil suit for damages from a vaccine-related injury or death. And for the next four years, pharmaceutical companies developing the Covid-19 vaccines will have immunity from liability under the 2005 Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act. Those who claim to have been harmed by vaccines may receive money from the government, not the pharmaceutical company, via the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""False."" We reached out the White House's press office in an email that laid out the above-outlined evidence that proves the president's statement wrong.

We've collected some posts that help explain how we do what we do. Happy reading and let us know what else you might be interested in knowing. U.S. President Joe Biden’s lack of military service has been frequently commented on by conservatives, even before he became president. Snopes readers also sent us numerous requests to look into Biden’s history of draft deferments, asking for confirmation of the circumstances under which he was able to avoid serving in the Vietnam War. Some asked us specifically if it was true that he received five draft deferments because of his asthma as a teenager. Biden’s Selective Service records were released in 2008 to The Associated Press by the campaign of then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama. According to the documents, Biden did receive a total of five draft deferments when he was an undergraduate at the University of Delaware and when he was a law student at Syracuse University. However, all of these deferments were granted by reason of his status as a student, not because of any medical condition. According to the draft classifications , one can receive a deferment as a student. Classification 1-S denotes, “Student deferred by status – (H) high school; (C) college.” Before Congress reformed the draft in 1971, ""a man could qualify for a student deferment if he could show he was a full-time student making satisfactory progress in virtually any field of study."" Under current law , college students can have their induction postponed ""only until the end of the current semester,"" while seniors can postpone it until the end of the full academic year. David Wade, then an Obama campaign spokesperson, told The Associated Press, “As a result of a physical exam on April 5, 1968, Joe Biden was classified 1-Y and disqualified from service because of asthma as a teenager.” I-Y means “Registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency.” This classification was abolished in December 1971. Less detailed records of Biden’s Selective Service draft card are available on the National Archives website. The Associated Press noted that in Biden’s memoir, “Promises to Keep,” he did not mention his asthma, and described an active childhood as a lifeguard and football player. Biden is not the only leader who took advantage of student deferments. Former Vice President Dick Cheney also received five draft deferments . His first four were because he was a student, and the fifth because he became a father. While Biden did indeed receive five draft deferments, these were due to his status as a student. Later, when he underwent a physical exam, he was classified unable to serve owing to his history of asthma. As such, we rate this claim as “Mostly True.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,541

For example, on Dec. 14 Jeff Lundeen posted a very widely shared tweet that contained an old picture of a young Carter, a screenshot of the anecdote, and the following caption: Do you remember the world's very first nuclear meltdown? That time the US President, an expert in nuclear physics, heroically lowered himself into the reactor and saved Ottawa, Canada's capital? Sounds like schlocky action movie, but it actually happened! That tweet was itself drawn from an earlier Facebook post by the Historical Society of Ottawa, which can be seen below: The core claim from those accounts was that, as a young naval officer, Carter played a significant role in containing a nuclear meltdown. That claim was accurate, and we are issuing a rating of ""True."" In main control room of USS K-1 (SSK-1) between June and October 1952. (Source: Naval History and Heritage Command). Carter, who was born in 1924 and grew up in Plains, Georgia, had a relatively short but distinguished naval career, as summarized by the U.S. Navy itself : President James Earl ""Jimmy"" Carter graduated from the Naval Academy in 1946 with distinction, after which he was assigned to USS Wyoming (E-AG 17) as an ensign. After completing two years of surface ship duty, Carter applied for submarine duty. He served as executive officer, engineering officer, and electronics repair officer on the submarine SSK-1 . When Admiral Hyman G. Rickover (then a captain) started his program to create nuclear-powered submarines, Carter wanted to join the program and was interviewed and selected by Rickover. Carter was promoted to lieutenant and from 3 November 1952 to 1 March 1953, he served on temporary duty with the Naval Reactors Branch, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Washington, D.C., to assist ""in the design and development of nuclear propulsion plants for naval vessels."" From 1 March to 8 October 1953, Carter was preparing to become the engineering officer for USS Seawolf (SSN-575), one of the first submarines to operate on atomic power. However, when his father died in July 1953 Carter resigned from the Navy and returned to Georgia to manage his family interests. Carter was honorably discharged on 9 October 1953 and transferred to the retired reserve at his request with the rank of lieutenant. On Dec. 12, 1952, an accident took place at the National Research Experimental (NRX) nuclear reactor at Chalk River, near the Canadian capital of Ottawa. A detailed, official Atomic Energy of Canada account of the incident and its aftermath can be found here and here . Having been promoted to lieutenant in June of that year, Carter was at that time on secondment from the Navy to the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission's Division of Reactor Development at Schenectady, in upstate New York. A 2019 video, vetted and published by All Hands, the official magazine of the U.S. Navy, contained the following account of the future president's involvement in the cleanup operation: Due to a combination of mechanical failure and human error, a power surge of up to 90 megawatts caused some fuel rods to melt after rupturing in the NRX research reactor at Chalk River Laboratories. The reactor's core was baldy damaged, requiring a massive cleanup operation. This was the first incident of this magnitude, and Carter was ordered to lead a team of 23 people to assist in the cleanup. When he arrived on the scene, there was a duplicate reactor set up on a nearby tennis court, where he and his team would practice removing bolts and pieces as quickly as they could. Once lowered into the damage reactor, each person would only have 90 seconds to work, due to the extreme radioactivity. The core was shut down, rebuilt, and put back into operation without further incident. Reflecting on the episode in 2008, Carter told the Canadian author Arthur Milnes that he and his team were exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation at Chalk River, as Milnes would later write for CNN : ""We were fairly well instructed then on what nuclear power was, but for about six months after that I had radioactivity in my urine,"" President Carter, now 86, told me during an interview for my new book in Plains in 2008. ""They let us get probably a thousand times more radiation than they would now. It was in the early stages and they didn't know."" Despite the fears he had to overcome, Carter admits he was animated at the opportunity to put his top-secret training to use in the cleanup of the reactor, located along the Ottawa River northwest of Ottawa. ""It was a very exciting time for me when the Chalk River plant melted down,"" he continued in the same interview. ""I was one of the few people in the world who had clearance to go into a nuclear power plant,"" he said. ""There were 23 of us and I was in charge. I took my crew up there on the train.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,990

Though some observers might object to Harris's even mentioning the Capitol attack in the same breath as Pearl Harbor and 9/11, it is simply inaccurate to claim that she said, or even implied, that Jan. 6 was, by some unspecified measure, ""worse than"" those two earlier infamous days. She did not, and we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly False.""

9fbd7d7a-8575-47dc-9253-88e006f88994,"In late 2021 and early 2022, critics of former U.S. President Donald Trump, primarily left-leaning, enthusiastically shared a social media post which appeared to add some credibility to long-standing rumors about him. On Dec. 29, a jury in New York convicted English socialite Ghislaine Maxwell of assisting her longtime companion, the disgraced billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein, in procuring underage girls to be sexually abused, over a period of many years. Epstein died in prison in August 2019, while facing sex trafficking charges, in what the New York City medical examiner determined was a suicide. Like other influential and well-connected politicians and businessmen, Trump knew and socialized with both Epstein and Maxwell, and he has long been the subject of so-far unsubstantiated rumors of sexual impropriety involving young women and even girls. Against that background, @USAlight3, a Twitter account that regularly posts left-wing, anti-Trump content, wrote on Dec. 30: ""FOX NEWS: Trump vowed to pardon Ghislaine Maxwell if he wins in 2024."" The claim was that Fox News reported that Trump had said he would pardon Maxwell if he were elected as president again in 2024. In reality, Fox News had reported no such thing. Back in the summer of 2021, several outlets wrote about a snippet from Michael Wolff's book ""Landslide"" which alleged, based on unnamed sources, that Trump had mentioned Maxwell in the context of conversations about his presidential pardon power, before he left office in January 2021. Notably, Trump did not actually pardon Maxwell, even though the charges against her were well known by that time. We are issuing a rating of ""Mostly False."" By logical necessity, any ""vow"" by Trump to pardon Maxwell if he won election in 2024 would have to have taken place after President Joe Biden's election win in November 2020 (otherwise, Trump would have framed his intention in terms of a second term). We could find no such report on the website of Fox News during the period since Biden's victory. Nor did we find any similar reports from any other reputable news source. So the ""2024"" claim, in particular, was baseless. However, although unproven, the broader allegation that Trump has held an interest in pardoning Maxwell was at least based on some external source, namely Michael Wolff's 2021 book "" Landslide ."" In it, Wolff describes the chaotic final days and weeks of Trump's presidency, and in one section, writes about Trump's approach to issuing pardons, as follows: Bored by the process and the details, Trump nevertheless, in the last week, would trawl for candidates, with sudden spurts of determination not to leave this power unused. “Who do you think should be pardoned? Give me one person—who’s your top pick?” became a frequent conversational interruption. One ""Oh, shit"" moment involved his sudden interest in Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein now facing years in prison over allegations of her role in the Epstein sex-abuse scandal. Trump had tried hard to downplay his own long relationship with Epstein “Has she said anything about me?” He openly wondered. “Is she going to talk? Will she roll on anybody?” But pardon talk almost immediately segued to the question of if he should pardon himself: “They say I can. Unlimited pardon power.” Wolff's putative sources are unnamed, so we cannot even begin to test the accuracy of that description. However, one thing we do know for certain is that Trump did not actually pardon Maxwell of anything while he was president, despite having the power and opportunity to do so.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,692
ba18678a-8e44-4a5f-935f-4b06f9d864dc,"Some who attended a three-day event featuring various conspiracy theorists and Republican political figures in Frisco, Texas, in December 2021 asserted that they became ill after the gathering, theorizing that they were poisoned by a biological agent. Some stated that they believed they were attacked with anthrax . We found no evidence, however, that any such attack occurred. The event, ""ReAwaken America,"" took place at Elevate Life Church over the Dec. 10-11 weekend. According to the Dallas Morning News, it was organized by the consulting company ThriveTime Show. It featured speakers like former U.S. President Donald Trump's son Eric Trump, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Infowars conspiracy theorist Alex Jones , and Sidney Powell, an attorney who spread false, fantastical claims of widespread election fraud amid the 2020 election cycle. A little over a week after the ReAwaken event, various conspiracy theorists, including Qanon ""influencer"" Ron Watkins , began repeating a claim that some who were there were ""very sick with what is suspected to be anthrax poisoning."" The rumor got picked up by some right-wing websites. A bioterrorism attack on U.S. soil would no doubt spark a massive emergency response and result in investigations at multiple levels of government. However, when we reached out to local police asking if they knew of any such an incident occurring during the ReAwaken America event, we were told that nothing of the kind had been reported. A spokesman for Frisco police told Snopes in an email that there have been ""no reports"" of anthrax or any biological agent deployed against the event. Anthrax, the disease caused by Bacillus anthracis bacteria spores, is one of the most feared and potentially deadly agents used in bioterrorism attacks. Untreated anthrax from inhalation of spores has an extremely high mortality rate. The most significant anthrax attack in the U.S., which took place shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, killed five people and sickened 17. In that case, anthrax was delivered to people through the mail in letters laced with the spores.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,383
fe68c996-a9f8-4bc3-b93e-a598ae3e9fc0,"Various social media posts circulating in late December 2021 claimed that thanks to coronavirus stimulus legislation known as the American Rescue Plan, U.S. President Joe Biden's administration and Democratic legislators would begin ""spying"" or ""snooping"" on users of cash apps like PayPal and Venmo. Here is an example of one such post: The truth is, unsurprisingly, more nuanced, but the bottom line is that, contrary to what the above Twitter posts state, the effect of the legislation in question isn't that the Biden administration or Democrats will be ""tapping into"" or ""spying on"" bank or cash app accounts. This is a misleading characterization. What the legislation does is significantly lower the threshold for reporting taxable transactions made using cash apps like Venmo, PayPal, or Zelle for goods and services to the IRS. And when you reach that threshold, the app companies will then be required to send a tax form called a 1099-K to both you and the IRS. A 1099-K is, according to PayPal , an ""informational tax form that is used to report goods and services payments received by a business or individual in the calendar year."" As of this writing, the current threshold for such reporting is $20,000 and 200 payments in goods and services. Come Jan. 1, 2022, that reporting threshold will drop down to $600. This could have a significant impact on platform users' tax returns. Here's how Bloomberg Tax described how users might experience the change: For example, a model train collector may have paid $5,000 for model train pieces over several years that they now sell for $8,000, and the marketplace that introduced the seller to the buyer and through which the sale took place may charge the seller a total fee of $800. It may cost the model train seller $200 in postage to send the pieces to its buyers. The Form 1099-K that the seller will receive from the TPSO will report $8,000 in gross proceeds paid. However, the seller’s taxable gain from that sale would only be $2,000. As a result, collectors and other online sellers will need to keep extensive records of their expenses going forward to avoid over-reporting of income and overpayment of tax. Also, consider the alternative—a teenager who walks dogs to earn extra money. If their income in 2022 exceeds $600, their expenses may be limited to the fees charged by the website that connects them to pet owners, but they will owe income tax—and possibly self-employment tax—on the income they earn. According to PayPal , which owns Venmo, the change doesn't affect people who use the apps for personal transactions, like paying a friend back for your share of dinner, gifts, or chipping in for trips. PayPal also states that its app allows users to categorize their own transactions as personal versus rendering payment for ""goods and services.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,545
228bc65b-2a67-4153-92ea-80cc64d2cbc7,"On Dec. 20, 2021, a brief clip of Fox News host Jesse Watters speaking about Dr. Anthony Fauci, U.S. President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, at a Turning Point USA conference went viral on social media. In the clip, Watters can be heard saying ""Now you go in with the kill shot -- deadly. Because, with an ambush, he doesn’t see it coming."" As this video circulated online, many people commented that Watters should be arrested or fired for supposedly encouraging violence against Fauci. Some even claimed that Watters had called for Fauci's "" assassination "": While this clip is real, and while Watters certainly used inappropriately violent language, this clip is missing context. Watters made this comment while instructing the audience on how best to verbally confront Fauci in public in order to generate viral clips for Fox News. Watters comment can be heard around the 2:24:00 minute mark of the following video. We've transcribed the relevant portions below: Watters said: ""Let's pretend this podium is Fauci. It's about the same size. You gotta ambush a guy like Fauci. This is how you do these ambushes like [conservative activist and Project Veritas founder James] O'Keefe. You've gotta be respectful. Because they'll turn the tables on you and you can't have it blow up in your face. So if you see Fauci out and about and you know he's coming to town this is how you approach."" Watters then talked about various tactics people could use to confront Fauci in public. He instructed the audience to introduce themselves, to accuse Fauci of lying about his research ( a generally false statement ), to wave a blank sheet of paper in Fauci's face, falsely claiming that it's a research grant, and then to go in with what he described as the ""kill shot"" question: So now he's in trouble. Now you're going for the kill shot. The kill shot with an ambush, deadly. Because he doesn't see it coming. This is when you say. 'Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab. The same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world. You know why people don't trust you, don't you?' Booooooom. He's dead. He's done. Now you do that, 30 seconds, that's all you need. Now you get that footage to us .... Imagine Tucker Carlson teases out of the block ""coming up, brave college student confronts lord Fauci at dinner. Exclusive footage."" Get us that. That's what we want. Watters does appear to be instructing people to verbally harass Fauci, and he did use violent, irresponsible language -- words such as ""ambush"" and ""kill shot"" -- during these remarks. However, he was not telling the crowd to assassinate Fauci. He was saying to ""ambush"" Fauci with questions. While Watters did not literally call for Fauci's assassination, as some claimed on social media, the loaded language he used while calling on the public to confront Fauci left many people concerned for Fauci's safety. On CNN, Fauci said that Watters' comments were awful, and that Watters should be fired.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,623

He was assassinated on Nov. 22, 1963, while riding in a car in Dallas, Texas. https://www.tiktok.com/@creepymania_/video/6953809315509718278 The video was viewed more than 1 million times. Its caption read: ""John F. Kennedy's bloodstained shirt he was wearing the day he was assassinated in 1963."" It's true that the picture shows Kennedy's bloody shirt from the day he died. We found several matching photographs on Getty Images that were credited to the National Archives. The TikTok video showed the back of Kennedy's bloody shirt: Courtesy: National Archives - JFK / Contributor We also found a picture of the front of the shirt: Courtesy: National Archives - JFK / Contributor A third image on the Getty Images website showed what was described as Kennedy's bloody and ""bullet-riddled shirt"": (Original Caption) This is a view of clothing worn by president John F. Kennedy, at the time of his assassination. (Courtesy: Bettmann / Contributor) In 2019, Kennedy's bloody shirt made the news after a hoax went around that claimed reality TV show star Kim Kardashian had gifted the item to one of her children, North. This was not true. At the time, People.com reported : Kim Kardashian West is setting the record straight on whether or not she gifted her 6-year-old daughter North former President John F. Kennedy‘s bloody button-down shirt for Christmas. On Monday, a fan on Twitter called out Refinery29 after the media outlet published a report , which included a photo originally believed to be from the reality star’s Instagram Stories depicting the shirt, which JFK assumably wore on the day he was assassinated in 1963. “I AM SCREAMING someone tweeted as a joke that Kim Kardashian gifted North JFK’s bloody shirt and Refinery29 wrote about it as if it were true????” the fan wrote on Twitter alongside a grab of the article, highlighting the excerpt “What is North West going to do with JFK’s bloody shirt? And why isn’t it in a museum?” Kardashian tweeted that the rumor was ""fake"" and a ""sick joke."" Also related to Kennedy's assassination, we found reporting from 2013 where the Houston Chronicle and The Associated Press chronicled another bloody shirt. This one belonged to Texas Gov. John Connally, who was also injured by the gunfire. At the time, Connally's shirt was set to go on exhibit to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination: ""It makes an impact, it's pretty dramatic and it kind of gives you pause,"" Sarah Norris, conservator at the Lorenzo de Zavala State Archives and Library [...] ""It creates the sense of immediacy about what happened that day."" John Anderson, preservation officer at the archives, said the display tells an important aspect of a well-known story. ""For Texans, this is something that maybe gets forgotten by some of the rest of the world, that Gov. Connally was shot at the same time,"" he said, noting that Connally's chest wound could have been fatal. Connally was ""seriously wounded"" but survived the ordeal.

f9763eeb-2b32-455a-85e6-c2467681cda3,"In December 2021, members of a white nationalist group known as Patriot Front marched at the Lincoln Memorial and other parts of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., wearing face coverings and an improvised uniform of khaki pants and dark blue jackets, and carrying shields and American flags. Images and videos from the rally were widely shared online, and the event attracted a measure of national news coverage . However, several figures from the American right sought to undermine the authenticity of the rally, claiming variously that it was conducted by federal law enforcement agents in disguise, and/or left-wing agents provocateurs, or actors. For example, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., described the men shown in one video as ""movie characters"": ""No Patriot group I’ve ever seen wears khakis, Stormtrooper knee pads, and covers their faces like they’re scared. Just more movie characters."" For his part, right-wing commentator Dinesh D'Souza speculated that the event was ""fake,"" and conducted by ""FBI agents,"" and asked ""Where are the media interviews so we can see and hear directly from this group?"" On Telegram, far-right conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl claimed ""these are feds,"" on the basis that the men shown in videos appeared to be unusually slim, and Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers, a prominent supporter of disproven election fraud conspiracy theories, described Patriot Front as a ""fake group"" composed of ""feds."" On Gateway Pundit, right-wing conspiracy theorist Jim Hoft described the event as ""feds on parade,"" while on the right-wing website 100 Percent Fed Up, Patty McMurray falsely described Patriot Front as ""a group no one has ever heard of."" While McMurray and others may not have been aware of Patriot Front's existence before December 2021, it is indeed a real, earnestly-motivated white nationalist group with a real, readily verifiable history. Its leader, a 23-year-old Texan named Thomas Ryan Rousseau, is a known far-right and fascist activist in the United States, and he was clearly visible and identifiable at the Dec. 4 National Mall rally. Claims that the event was faked or staged, by federal agents or actors, are entirely lacking in evidence, and are contradicted by the best available evidence. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""False."" Who Is Patriot Front? The origins of the group can be traced back to the aftermath of the infamous ""Unite the Right"" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August, 2017. The far-right and white supremacist demonstration descended into chaos and violence, culminating in an incident in which neo-Nazi sympathizer James Fields ploughed a car into a crowd of anti-fascist and anti-racist counterprotesters, killing Heather Heyer and injuring several others. Rousseau, then 18 years old, led a contingent from the neo-Nazi group Vanguard America, using the high-profile Charlottesville rally as an opportunity to strengthen his claim on the organization, amid a leadership struggle that summer. Fields dressed in a Vanguard uniform, but was reportedly not a recognized member of the group. In a still image posted online by the Southern Poverty Law Center, Fields can be seen standing close to Rousseau in Charlottesville. Patriot Front, then, was originally a splinter group from Vanguard America, led by Rousseau — a native of the Dallas-Forth Worth suburb of Grapevine — and started in late 2017. Far from being an ""unknown"" entity that suspiciously materialized out of nowhere in December 2021, both Patriot Front and Rousseau have been the subject of monitoring and news coverage since that time. The Anti-Defamation League, for example, has kept a public file on the group for at least 3 1/2 years. In May 2017 emails obtained by the Texas Observer , and seen by Snopes, an FBI special agent warned college administrators in North Texas that a ""Thomas Ryan Rousseau"" was one of four individuals believed to be responsible for posting white supremacist flyers on local campuses. At the time, Rousseau was still attending Coppell High School, and writing nationalist, pro-Trump columns for the student newspaper. Rousseau has been arrested or cited by police on at least two occasions , for misdemeanors relating to defacing property with white nationalist propaganda. He has described himself as a fascist , but Patriot Front's manifesto does not include any such keywords, instead placing an emphasis on American nationalism and a return to traditional values. According to in-depth research by ProPublica , this is part of a careful strategy, personally overseen by Rousseau, to soften Patriot Front's image, keeping its white supremacist, racist, anti-Semitic and violent tendencies out of sight when conducting public outreach or holding events such as the Dec. 4 rally at the National Mall. No doubt exists that Rousseau was present at the Dec. 4 Patriot Front rally in Washington, D.C., and that he led the participants in chanting various slogans, before making a speech outside the U.S. Capitol. Ample video evidence, posted to Telegram by Patriot Front itself, as well as a white nationalist propaganda platform called Media2Rise, demonstrates definitively that Rousseau led the rally. For example, in one clip, white nationalist propagandist Lucca Corgiat, who was embedded with Patriot Front throughout Dec. 4, introduces Rousseau by his first name, asking him to explain why the group is demonstrating in the nation's capital: Rousseau stood out from other participants in not wearing a face covering, and was therefore readily identifiable throughout the rally, as a still image from another Media2Rise video, and the following Patriot Front screenshot, both illustrate: Getty photographer Win McNamee also took pictures of Rousseau at the Dec. 4 rally, including the following one : Patriot Front founder Thomas Rousseau waits along the George Washington Parkway near Arlington Cemetery after the group marched on the National Mall on December 04, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) For reference, the following is a still image of Rousseau taken from an August 2021 video posted to Telegram by Patriot Front: It is a demonstrable fact that Rousseau attended the Dec. 4 Patriot Front rally in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as leader of that organization — a white nationalist, far-right group. Rousseau and Patriot Front have been the subject of considerable social media self-promotion, as well as investigative news coverage, for nearly five years. Furthermore, those claiming that the Dec. 4 rally was a ""false flag"" event perpetrated by left-wing agents provocateurs or federal agents, have presented no credible evidence to that effect. Snopes invited Taylor Greene to provide any evidence that would support her claims about the authenticity of the rally. A spokesperson for the Congresswoman asked us, in turn, ""What proof do you have to the contrary?"" In response, Snopes outlined that proof for the spokesperson, and repeated our request for evidence from Taylor Greene. We did not receive any further responses. Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers did not respond to a similar request for evidence from Snopes.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1307

But all kidding aside, I sincerely mean it."" On that basis, several observers and websites, primarily right-leaning and more broadly opposed to Biden's presidency, either stipulated or suggested that he had stated, in earnest, that Fauci was president.

Firstly, video of his remarks makes it clear he was speaking in jest. Secondly, a proper, contextual viewing of Biden's remarks makes it clear his use of the phrase ""I sincerely mean it"" referred to his broader expression of gratitude and praise to staff at the National Institutes of Health, rather than his throwaway quip about Fauci being ""the president.""

During an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson on Nov. 22, Rittenhouse himself said Biden had acted with ""actual malice, defaming my character"": Snopes has reviewed footage related to two instances in which Biden referred to Rittenhouse during the 2020 presidential campaign. Our conclusion is that Biden did not explicitly describe the Illinois man as a ""white supremacist."" However, Biden clearly suggested that Rittenhouse was a white supremacist or, at the very least, had substantial links with white supremacists and/or armed militias. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly True."" CNN Interview Biden conducted an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Aug. 27, 2020 — two days after the Rittenhouse shootings in Kenosha, which took place in the backdrop of a renewed wave of protests after police in the city shot and seriously injured Jacob Blake , a 29-year-old Black man. The relevant section of the conversation can be watched below, and the following is an excerpted transcript: Cooper: The president has not talked about the shooting of Mr. Blake. He's talked about violence at protests in the wake of it. I'm wondering why you think that is that he hasn't actually addressed it? There's obviously a lot we do not know about the circumstances around it, but the video, obviously, has been out there. Biden: Well look, I don't know enough to know whether that 17-year-old kid — exactly what he did. But allegedly he's part of a militia coming out of the state of Illinois. Have you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it?... In that response, Biden made one explicit factual claim about Rittenhouse — ""allegedly he's part of a militia"" — which was immediately followed by remarks about former President Trump and white supremacists. The clear sense from the totality of Biden's remarks, then, was that Rittenhouse is a white supremacist or, at the very least, he's a militia member with substantial links to white supremacists — claims that Rittenhouse subsequently explicitly denied in his post-trial interview on Fox News. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden now stood by the way in which he characterized Rittenhouse during his CNN interview, or if he wished to retract or modify those remarks. We did not receive a response in time for publication. Biden Campaign Ad During the first presidential debate on Sept. 29, 2020, Biden and Trump clashed over the Republican incumbent's support among white supremacist groups, with Fox News moderator Chris Wallace pressing the president to ""condemn white supremacist and militia groups."" That exchange — which we covered in considerable detail at the time — produced the famous ""Proud Boys, stand back and stand by"" moment, and prompted many critics of Trump to accuse him of ""refusing"" to distance himself from white supremacists and far-right militia groups. The following day, Biden's campaign produced an ad that highlighted that explosive moment from the previous evening's debate. It contained audio of the three-way exchange between Wallace, Trump, and Biden, overlaid with video footage and still images of various high-profile instances of white supremacist violence. An excerpted transcript is available here: Chris Wallace (addressing Trump): — but are you willing, tonight, to condemn white supremacist and militia groups — Trump: Sure Wallace: — and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities, as we saw in Kenosha, and as we’ve seen in Portland? On the words ""as we saw in Kenosha,"" the campaign video showed a still image of Rittenhouse holding a firearm, taken from the night of the shootings on Aug. 25, 2020: The clear suggestion there was, again, that Rittenhouse was himself a white supremacist militia member, or at the very least was closely associated with such groups — claims that, as we have shown, Rittenhouse has vehemently denied. Snopes asked the White House whether Biden stood by this component of the campaign ad, and whether he regretted the fact that it strongly suggested Rittenhouse was a white supremacist. We did not receive a response to this question.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,901

The ad led to a 59-page slideshow article on the Wanderoam website. It told a story about a Black police officer named Karl Baker in Alexandria, Virginia, and had the headline: ""Waitress Refuses To Serve Customer Is Shocked At What Comes Next."" An unknown person was paying for this ""cop refused service at a restaurant"" ad to be displayed on the Taboola advertising network. According to the tale, Baker, who was also mentioned as being a police chief, decided to spend part of his day off at a diner. However, he was refused service by a female cook. It ended by mentioning that Baker returned the next day in uniform, where he got the last laugh. However, there's no truth to this story. We found no reporting from any credible news sources about an Alexandria police officer named Karl Baker being refused service at a diner. It was made-up. According to an article from The Sun, the picture in the misleading ad showed Jakhary Jackson, a police officer in Portland, Oregon.

However, Noodles & Company is not a diner. Also, the reporting specified that it was a female officer who was refused service, not someone with the name Karl Baker. Further, nothing was mentioned about the officer returning the next day to confront the employees in uniform. According to the report, she was already in uniform when the initial incident occurred.

Bannon, 67, is charged with one contempt count involving his refusal to appear for a deposition and another involving his refusal to produce documents, despite a subpoena from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol. An arraignment date has not yet been set in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. As this news circulated on social media, many people noted that Bannon was the first person to be indicted by a grand jury on contempt of Congress charges in nearly 40 years. Laurence Tribe, professor of constitutional law at Harvard, wrote on Twitter : ""Bannon’s is the first indictment for criminal contempt of Congress in nearly 40 years. It was well earned."" Legal analyst Elie Honig made a similar observation on CNN: While the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate both have the power to certify contempt citations, it is up to the DOJ to pursue criminal prosecution. The Congressional Research Services writes : ""The criminal contempt statute permits a single house of Congress to certify a contempt citation to the executive branch for the criminal prosecution of an individual who has willfully refused to comply with a committee subpoena."" The House and Senate have both voted in recent years to hold various people in contempt of congress — such as former Attorney General William Barr, former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and former Attorney General Eric Holder — but it hasn't been since 1983 that the DOJ indicted someone (in that case, Rita M. Lavelle , a former Environmental Protection Agency official) for contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena to testify about the EPA's hazardous waste cleanup fund. While Lavelle was later cleared of this charge, she was later found guilty of perjury . The New York Times writes : ""The last person charged with criminal contempt of Congress, Rita M. Lavelle, a former federal environmental official under President Ronald Reagan, was found not guilty in 1983 of failing to appear at a congressional subcommittee hearing. She was later sentenced to prison for lying to Congress."" To find the last person found guilty of contempt of Congress charges, you have to go back another decade to 1974, when G. Gordon Liddy, a Watergate conspirator, was convicted of the charge. 10 May 1974, Fri Press-Telegram (Long Beach, California) Newspapers.com Bannon is the first person to be indicted on contempt of Congress charges since 1983, and he could become the first person to be found guilty of those charges since 1974. The DOJ noted in its release that ""all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law."" If Bannon is found guilty, he'll face a maximum sentence of one year in jail for each charge. Each count of contempt of Congress carries a minimum of 30 days and a maximum of one year in jail, as well as a fine of $100 to $1,000. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors. An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,684

Rumors started when Newsom abruptly canceled a trip to Scotland for a United Nations climate conference, citing ""family obligations,"" then didn't hold any scheduled public events for about two weeks. Newsom later explained that he canceled the trip to be with his children on Halloween, after a grueling year, including a pandemic and a failed recall election seeking to unseat him. He also stated he had been out and about with his family and working at the Capitol during that time. The rumor that Newsom was ""missing"" had various iterations, but one prominent version was that he experienced a serious adverse reaction to getting a COVID-19 vaccination booster shot in late October 2021 . ""Gavin Newsom is out of sight since getting his booster because he developed Bell’s Palsy or Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS),"" one Twitter post stated , referring to conditions that can result in partial facial paralysis.

Side effects for the COVID-19 vaccines can include tiredness and muscle pain, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). But Newsom's spokesman, Daniel Lopez, told the Daily Mail the opposite.

4ef14c2e-ca7f-4e4d-bcf0-2d19c83970b3,"Georgia was a pivotal swing state in the November 2020 election, and as such became a target of former U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive election disinformation campaign that baselessly alleged that a massive-scale voter fraud conspiracy cost him reelection. One year after the election, Trump's supporters were still trying fruitlessly to prove Georgia's election was plagued by widespread fraud. On Nov. 9, 2021, Trump's supporters took to social media platforms like Twitter claiming that Fulton County, Georgia was missing digital image scans of all in-person ballots, and 17,690 absentee ballot images. For example, a Nov. 9, 2021, tweet from Christina Bobb, a host for conspiracy theory-promoting network One America News (OANN) stated: ""ALL in person ballot images in GA are missing. 17,690 mail in ballot images are missing. This is FRAUD. So, GA has no way to verify that the ballots are legitimate reflections of what went through the machines."" Bobb's statement refers to digital scans of paper ballots created by voting systems. This statement is false, according to Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia Secretary of State's Office, who called it not just a lie, but a ""truly dumb"" lie in this sharply-worded tweet: The statement in Bobb's tweet, that ""ALL in person ballot images in GA are missing. 17,690 mail in ballot images are missing,"" is apparently sourced from a Nov. 9, 2021, news conference held by Garland Favorito, co-founder of the VoterGA, an activist group that has sought to overturn Georgia's 2020 presidential election result. In an email to Snopes, Favorito stated that Fulton County informed VoterGA that it did not have digital images of in-person voter ballots in response to a public records request submitted by VoterGA. Even if that's the case, claiming the missing ballot images equate to fraud is false framing, in that it invents a crisis where no crisis exists. The absence of scanned, digital images of ballots isn't an indication of fraud, nor does it mean there is ""no way to verify"" Georgia's election results. As Sterling indicated in the tweet above, Georgia's 2020 election results were counted three times, including a hand recount of the original paper ballots. The hand recount affirmed that the original machine count had accurately showed that Georgia voters chose U.S. President Joe Biden over Trump. A machine recount requested by Trump again affirmed Biden's victory in Georgia. A law that went into effect in March 2021, Georgia Senate Bill 202, will make digital images of ballots public record. Nevertheless it's the original paper ballots, not their digital images, that ""will remain the source of official vote counts, and they’re kept in the government’s custody, only unsealed by a judge’s order,"" as the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted , VoterGA was dealt a major legal defeat in its quest to find evidence of voter fraud when a judge in October 2021 threw out its lawsuit seeking to inspect absentee ballots.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,570

Gavin Newsom, citing an alleged unexplained absence from the public eye. It's a rumor that appears to have started with assorted anonymous social media accounts, only to be picked up by various political personalities with large social media followings and the mainstream media, apparently inspired by his last-minute cancellation of a scheduled appearance at the United Nations climate summit. As the rumor spread online on Nov. 7 and 8, some suggested Newsom was smote by God (or words to that effect) for his liberal policies. Those holding fast to anti-vaccine beliefs speculated he had become seriously ill with ""Bell’s Palsy or Guillain-Barre Syndrome"" after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine booster shot. ""Gavin Newsom received his booster shot 11 days ago, cancelled his scheduled appearances, and hasn’t been seen in public since,"" tweeted Charlie Kirk, head of the conservative activist organization Turning Point USA. ""Where’s Gavin?"" The ""where's Newsom"" narrative was also echoed by more mainstream sources. ""Where’s Gov. Gavin Newsom?"" a New York Times headline read . Suffice it to say it's not exactly a mystery. Newsom turned up in the public eye on Nov. 8, not missing and in fact photographed wearing a tuxedo, at the wedding of Getty heiress Ivy Love Getty. The following day, Newsom spoke at the California Economic Summit in Monterey, during which time he addressed questions about why he canceled the planned trip to Scotland for the U.N. climate conference, saying that his four young children wanted him to stay home with them for Halloween. ""My wife was going to go [to Scotland] as well,"" Newsom stated. ""And mom and dad missing Halloween, for them it's worse than missing Christmas. And I woke up that next morning with something that's probably familiar to a lot of parents, that knot in your stomach. I had no damn choice: I had to cancel that trip."" Newsom said he was out and about in public in the interim, visiting San Francisco's Boo! festival with his family and taking his children to work with him at the state capitol. When asked by host Lenny Mendonca whether he had been ""abducted by aliens,"" Newsom responded, ""There were some Twitter accounts, that I think we'd all do well taking some time away from social media. Just a thought."" Some readers may recall that in May 2018, a similar ""missing"" storyline surrounded former first lady Melania Trump. ""Where’s Melania? First lady not seen in public for 3 weeks,"" an Associated Press headline read . During that time, the then-first lady had been hospitalized to treat a kidney condition. Some conservative pundits appeared to use the ""Missing Newsom"" narrative as a clap-back to the ""missing Melania"" stories: In early 2017, some social media users convinced themselves that former CEO of the Clinton Foundation, Eric Braverman , had disappeared and was in peril simply because he hadn't posted on social media. He was not missing, nor was he in peril, putting rumors to rest with a tweet announcing a new job.

The screenshot in the post misrepresented the 2020 U.S. presidential election vote count from the Maricopa County audit in the state of Arizona . It used fake numbers to push the false narrative that 712,152 new votes were found for former U.S. President Donald Trump and that U.S. President Joe Biden's Arizona tally decreased by 385,879 votes. In November 2021, the same misleading Maricopa County audit post was shared again, thrusting it back into the spotlight. For example, it was shared by Wanda Freeman Barzizza, the wife of a formal mayoral candidate for the city of Germantown, Tennessee. She has close to 10,000 followers. The text of the meme read as follows: The Maricopa County Audit Team's Findings Trump 2,373,838- Remember, Trumps original vote count was 1,661,686. Trump's ""official"" vote total represents a staggering reduction of 712,152. Biden vote total= 1,286,264. The original Biden vote total was 1,672,143. The audit discovered that Biden's votes decreased by 385,879. President Trump won Arizona by 1,087,574 votes with 2,373,838 to Biden 1,286,264. President Trump captured nearly two-thirds of the vote. After conducting a forensic audit, the audit team found that the vote flipped by approximately 1.1 million votes. This means that over one-third of the vote was stolen by Democratic Party operatives. When the Facebook meme was posted in June 2021, the results of the Maricopa County audit had not even been released, as Reuters noted in its own reporting. It wasn't until three months later that the numbers finally came out. Despite the falsehoods in the Facebook post, we found the truth on the official website for the Arizona State Senate Republican Caucus.

32541182-9c0c-4c7e-bd5b-251fbed4e0c4,"In October and November 2021, readers asked Snopes to examine the accuracy of social media posts that claimed that the Build Back Better Act, a major budget and infrastructure bill, contained a ""methane tax"" of around $2,600 per head of cattle, and around $500 per swine, per year. For example, one widely-shared Facebook post claimed: ""Were you aware the $3.5 Trillion Human Infrastructure package includes an animal agriculture tax of $2,600!! per head of cattle? $500 for swine!!!..."" The post contained a photograph of a column written by U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma. In the column, which was also posted to his website on Sep. 22 , Mullin claimed that: In an attempt to eliminate fossil fuels, this legislation [the Build Back Better Act] would impose a “fee” on all methane emissions, including in our agriculture industry. We all know that a fee is just a tax and that consumers are the ones who will pay for it. The tax is estimated to cost $6,500 per dairy cow, $2,600 per head of cattle, and $500 per swine each year. That is more than what the animals are worth, it’ll run ranchers out of business. Mullin's description of the provisions of the bill was inaccurate, as were the numerous social media posts based on it. At the time those claims were made, and as of Nov. 2, 2021, the Build Back Better Act did not contain a tax or fee on methane that would equate to thousands of dollars per head of cattle, or hundreds of dollars per head of swine. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""False."" What the Build Back Better Act Says H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, is a 2,468-page budget and infrastructure bill , and has been the subject of intensive negotiations during the fall of 2021. Section 30114 of the legislation provides for a ""methane fee,"" but it applies only to ""petroleum and natural gas systems,"" and not the agriculture sector. Therefore, Mullin's claim — that ""this legislation would impose a 'fee' on all methane emissions, including in our agriculture industry"" — is false. A spokesperson for Mullin told Politifact that the congressman was referring to an amendment to the bill, proposed by Republicans in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which would have explicitly stipulated that the methane fee does not apply to agriculture. Democrats voted down that proposal, on the basis that the text of the legislation already explicitly stipulated that the fee related only to oil and gas production. While expressing concern about hypothetical future actions on the part of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the spokesperson effectively acknowledged that the Build Back Better Act does not currently do what Mullin claimed it did: ""While the language specifies the oil and gas industry, it also references EPA’s greenhouse gas inventory and leaves too much room for the EPA to expand its regulatory reach."" The same spokesperson also told Politifact that the key figures from Mullin's op-ed — ""$6,500 per dairy cow, $2,600 per head of cattle, and $500 per swine"" — came from an analysis prepared by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF). However, the AFBF later issued its own news release, clarifying that the analysis was conducted in order to address an entirely hypothetical question, namely what the effect of a methane tax would be if it were applied to the agriculture industry — a proposal that no participants in Congressional negotiations have so far made. In that Sept. 30 news release , AFBF Vice President Sam Kieffer said: Over the summer, American Farm Bureau economists conducted an analysis, at the request of Congressional committee staff, to determine the potential impact if agriculture were to be included in legislation imposing such a tax. We did so based on the formula set forth in legislative proposals that impose a methane tax on the oil and gas sectors. ...While we oppose any tax on methane, Farm Bureau is grateful to lawmakers for recognizing the thin margins in agriculture and that such a tax would undoubtedly put family farms out of business. We are especially grateful to the Senate for passing an amendment that specifically exempts agriculture. That Senate amendment was one proposed by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and passed by a vote of 66-33 on Aug. 10 . It prohibited ""the imposition of new Federal methane requirements on livestock.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,855

This is not a genuine message from Hutchins. This is a doctored tweet. The implication of the message above is that Hutchins was purposefully killed to protect Clinton. This follows in the footsteps of a long-standing conspiracy theory that has attempted to link numerous ""suspicious"" deaths to the Clinton family. This tweet, however, is fake. But we have not been able to find any traces of this message online. While there is a @HalynaHutchins Twitter account, this account is relatively new — it was started in April 2021 — and it doesn't appear that messages have been posted from the account. The account's timeline is blank, and archived versions of this account show no posted tweets. Furthermore, the @HalynaHutchins account on Twitter is not verified. The account in the doctored meme does have a verified symbol. It seems likely that this tweet was created with one of several ""fake tweet"" generators. Hutchins did have a genuine Instagram account. Before her death, she posted about how working on a western afforded her the opportunity to ride horses, how she stood with her crew, and about the incredible views in New Mexico. We looked over her recent posts and didn't find anything overtly political, or anything related to Clintons. This is not the first piece of disinformation to circulate in the wake of Hutchins' death. A series of doctored images designed to look like news articles were circulated that claimed that actor Alec Baldwin was acting erratically before the incident.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,350
451e9fae-b6b8-4758-849e-0b7e223c9781,"On Oct. 10, 2021, a Facebook meme was posted with two pictures of gas prices. The text read: ""Don't blame me when you voted for this. Cause I voted for this."" This first sentence was overlayed on a picture of gas prices at over $4 a gallon, while the second sentence was overlayed on a picture below the first showing gas prices under $2. According to when it was shared, and how commenters interpreted the meme, it was posted in opposition to U.S. President Joe Biden and in support of former U.S. President Donald Trump. For example, one commenter said : ""WHO WANTS TO BE A DEMO,"" referring to Democrats. Another commenter remarked: ""Who ever vote it for this shit not to smart."" However, this meme missed the mark. We found the top photograph with high gas prices on a Walt Disney World forum from July 26, 2020. Trump was in the White House at the time. We were unable to find any earlier years when it had been posted online. Meanwhile, the bottom picture in the meme with low gas prices of $1.74 for regular unleaded was published on a stock photography website on Sept. 9, 2016, according to the page's source code. At the time, former U.S. President Barack Obama was in office. The picture may have been captured prior to this date. So aside from poorly chosen pictures, what's the truth behind gas prices in 2020 and 2021? It all comes down to the COVID-19 pandemic . The demand for oil initially dropped , leading to falling prices beginning in March 2020, something that many consumers might remember. On May 26, 2021, The Associated Press published why gas prices were once again on the rise after having dipped so low in the previous year. Biden’s policies aren’t behind the price increases. Gas prices are up because of a rapid and unexpected bounce-back in demand, and because of lingering problems from the forced shutdown early this month of the Colonial Pipeline, which provides 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast. … Gasoline prices didn’t fall [in 2020] because of the Trump administration, as Trump often claims; they plunged because of the coronavirus forcing people to abandon their offices, schools, business trips, and vacations. Underscoring the connection to the pandemic shutdown, U.S. gas prices were at their lowest in April 2020 when people were staying home most but have mostly risen since then, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration, even when Trump was still in office. In sum, the pictures in the meme were not from the time periods referenced by the meme and by Facebook commenters. Further, the fall and rise of gas prices in 2020 and 2021 had less to do with politics, and more to do with the COVID-19 pandemic .",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,542
9596fa78-ae04-448f-8b0c-463a8e0485af,"In October 2021, a series of videos went viral on TikTok that supposedly showed students carrying their books in a variety of unusual items, such as grocery carts, microwaves, snow sleds, laundry baskets, and wagons, after their school banned backpacks in the wake of a school shooting. As this rumor went viral (one post from Starlight Miriam has nearly 8 million views , another from Drippy Peanut has 12 million ), another set of videos showing a very similar scene — students carrying books in items other than backpacks — was circulated on social media attached to a different claim: that this was part of a senior prank called ""No Backpack Day."" So what's the truth behind these videos? Do these videos show a school attempting to implement a ban on backpacks to prevent school shootings? Or are these humorous videos showing school day hijinks? Here's what we found. Jefferson School District 251 In September 2021, Jefferson School District 251 in Idaho banned backpacks after a gun was found in the backpack of a 13-year-old girl at Rigby Middle School. According to East Idaho News , this was the second gun-related incident at the school this year. On Sept. 23, Jefferson School District 251 banned backpacks in its secondary schools in the hours after deputies took an emotionally struggling 13-year-old girl into custody after finding a gun in her backpack. It marked the second gun incident at the school after a sixth-grade student opened fire with a handgun in May, where two students and a custodian were shot, but not killed. A few of the videos that went viral truly showed students in this school district improvising ways to carry their books after backpacks were banned. In the video below, there's a brief glimpse of the school's gymnasium. This is the same gym floor used at Rigby High School . Jefferson School District 251 Superintendent Chad Martin addressed the viral videos, saying that it was good to see the kids turning this into a positive thing. “I think that all kids need to be able to deal with things and I think they are dealing with it ... We hope (the backpack ban) is a temporary thing until we get a more permanent fix. If this can be a positive thing that they enjoy for a little bit, that’s wonderful.” Brazil's 'No Backpack Day' Confusingly, while videos from this backpack ban were going viral in the United States, another video showing similar behavior was going viral in Brazil. This video appears to show a sort of ""spirit day"" in which the older students get to make a rule for the younger students. In this case, they decided to ban backpacks for the day. The Reddit user who initially shared this video explained : ""I’ve seen that some people didn’t understand the context, so here it is some explanation: basically the students from the year before those who are about to graduate high school have to do whatever they want, it’s like when you are new in collage."" As best as we can tell, this video was taken at Magistério CEEP Brasílio Machado, a school in the city of Antonina in southern Brazil.

In late 2021, the United States faced a supply chain crisis during a global pandemic. Across numerous ports , including along the west coast, cargo ships were backed up, leading to worries of nationwide shortages of various goods. But this was not just limited to the U.S. Globally, around 584 container ships were stuck at ports around the world in mid-October. Of course, this led to rumors and speculation about the reasons behind the backlog. Our readers sent us screenshots from across social media, suggesting that the entire backlog of ships was a “manufactured crisis.” Some of our readers asked us if this was part of a “communist plot,” while others suggested that labor unions were behind it. For example, we got a message saying: “The Unions aren't allowing truckers, employees, no one, to unload these containers. The employees are being paid not to work...but that's not their choice.” Looking into news reports of the supply backlog, we learned that the biggest reason for these issues was the fallout from the global COVID-19 pandemic. There is no evidence that this was a ""manufactured"" crisis, let alone a communist plot, but it did expose the flaws in the current systems on which the world and the U.S. depend. A Washington Post report analyzed the reasons behind the failings at the ports. Primary among them, during the pandemic there was an overall reduction in spending at restaurants, theaters, and sports events, and an increase in spending on goods like laptops and bicycles, which triggered a sudden increase in imports that overwhelmed freighters. According to the BBC , 25% more cargo was shipped from Asia to the U.S. in the first eight months of 2021, compared with the same period in 2019 before the pandemic. In 2021 alone, the Los Angeles port was expected to handle 10.8 million containers of goods, a record amount, partly due to the high demand for goods during the pandemic. As a result, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) had even increased training and hiring of workers, which resulted in workers reporting feeling overworked and exhausted. At least 20 ILWU members died while working through the pandemic, the union reported. Transportation systems were also already weak from before the pandemic. Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of Los Angeles, told The Washington Post that U.S. ports were “decades behind” foreign ports in getting carriers, terminals, and shippers to provide each other access to commercial data for planning purposes. Privacy concerns over data resulted in a “fragmented” system, with individual ports operating independently and not as part of a nationwide system. But this was not the first time workers in shipping and transportation had raised the alarm. In September 2021 , industry groups, including the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), warned of a ""global transport system collapse.” In an open letter , they said: Our calls have been consistent and clear: freedom of movement for transport workers, for governments to use protocols that have been endorsed by international bodies for each sector and to prioritise transport workers for vaccinations as called for in the World Health Organization’s SAGE Roadmap for Prioritizing Uses of COVID-19 Vaccines in the Context of Limited Supply. [...] The impact of nearly two years’ worth of strain, placed particularly upon maritime and road transport workers, but also impacting air crews, is now being seen. Their continued mistreatment is adding pressure on an already crumbling global supply chain. We are witnessing unprecedented disruptions and global delays and shortages on essential goods including electronics, food, fuel and medical supplies. Consumer demand is rising and the delays look set to worsen ahead of Christmas and continue into 2022. We have all continued to keep global trade flowing throughout the pandemic, but it has taken a human toll. At the peak of the crew change crisis 400,000 seafarers were unable to leave their ships, with some seafarers working for as long as 18 months over their initial contracts. Flights have been restricted and aviation workers have faced the inconsistency of border, travel, restrictions, and vaccine restrictions/requirements. Additional and systemic stopping at road borders has meant truck drivers have been forced to wait, sometimes weeks, before being able to complete their journeys and return home. President Joe Biden announced a number of changes in mid-October to tackle the crisis, most notably an increase in working hours for the ports and workers in Los Angeles: After weeks of negotiation and working with my team and with the major union and retailers and freight movers, the Ports of Los Angeles — the Port of Los Angeles announced today that it’s going to be — begin operating 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This follows the Port of Long Beach’s commitment to 24/7 that it announced just weeks ago. Twenty-four/seven system — what most of the leading countries in the world already operate on now, except us, until now. This is the first key step toward moving our entire freight transportation and logistical supply chain, nationwide, to a 24/7 system. Workers had not been stopping work at ports. Rather, they had been overworked through the pandemic, and their work hours were only increasing. Biden also called on major retailers to step up and reduce the bottleneck by moving the goods from ports, adding that Walmart had committed to increasing their use of off-peak hours by 50% in moving products, and FedEx and UPS also planned to move more goods by night. He added a particular note of thanks to labor groups and unions like Teamsters, Transportation Workers Union, and others. A White House fact sheet also broke down some of the reasons for the disruptions: The pandemic has led to a surge in e-commerce, with sales increasing 39 percent in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2020. At the same time, COVID has disrupted workers in key transportation and logistics nodes – the jobs of 1,800 Southern California port workers were disrupted because of COVID earlier this year. John Wolfe, CEO of The Northwest Seaport Alliance, which oversees container traffic for the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma, spoke after Biden’s announcement, pointing out that trucks moving containers to warehouses from the port were in low supply. “When any portion of the supply chain starts to be stretched to the limits, it’s like a domino effect,” he said on Oct. 13. “When one domino falls [....] the other pieces of the supply chain then start to fail, and that’s what we’re experiencing.” The nature of the transportation and shipping industry is that it relies on each part to function smoothly, and as Wolfe pointed out, when one portion of the supply chain is down, the rest suffer too. This issue was occurring worldwide, but the U.S. shipping and transportation industry took a huge hit, in part because of increasing demand for certain goods during the pandemic. This resulted in the White House and the relevant industries pushing to increase work hours to relieve the backlog. There is no evidence that workers and unions coordinated this backlog and purposely shut down work. Likewise, there is no evidence that this was a “communist plot.” The crisis was a failure of the existing systems of global transportation and markets. As such, we rate this claim as “False.”",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1484

3a83387b-3207-4d8d-b4bb-c614b94cedc6,"In September 2021, several primarily right-leaning outlets reported that Lee Greenwood, a country singer best known for his patriotic hit ""God Bless the USA,"" had been replaced on the National Council on the Arts, with Greenwood claiming he was being removed for political reasons. For example, on Sept. 23, Greenwood told Fox News he was ""shocked"" to receive an email informing him he was to be replaced on the council, which advises the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, an agency that oversees federal arts policy and distributes grants to cultural organizations. ""He's cleaned house,"" Greenwood said of President Joe Biden. ""Finally he's fired the patriot."" On the right-wing platform Newsmax , Greenwood struck a similar tone, saying, ""I believe he [Biden] decided to clean house. He's getting rid of all conservatives in the government."" Earlier in 2021, Biden did signal his intention to replace Greenwood on the arts council, so this element of the claim was accurate. However, the notion that the country singer was specifically or exclusively targeted for his conservative political views was contradicted by the fact that seven other council members were set to be replaced as well, pending Senate confirmation of their replacements, and almost all of those were nominees of fellow Democratic (former) President Barack Obama. Furthermore, Greenwood had not actually been replaced as of October 2021, and will not be, unless the Senate confirms his replacement. As a result, we are issuing a rating of ""Mostly False."" Greenwood was first appointed to the arts council in 2008, after then-President George W. Bush nominated him, and the Senate confirmed his appointment . His patriotic 1984 single ""God Bless the USA"" had regained popularity in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and would later be used as entrance music during rallies held by former President Donald Trump, in 2016 and 2020. The Tennesseean's six-year term expired in 2014, but he has remained on the advisory board since then, because the Senate has not yet confirmed the appointment of a successor. In 2015, then-President Barack Obama nominated the jazz musician and songwriter Esperanza Spalding to replace Greenwood on the council, but the Senate failed to take any action on that nomination, meaning Greenwood remained in place. These ""expired"" appointments are actually quite commonplace. In fact, as of October 2021, all 15 members of the arts council were serving on expired terms. Far from singling out Greenwood for removal, the Biden administration has in fact proposed replacing no fewer than eight existing members, all of whose terms expired between 2012 and 2018, with eight nominees, as follows : Ismael N. Ahmed. To replace: Olga Viso ( Nominated by Obama, 2013 ) Kinan Azmeh. To replace: Charlotte P. Kessler ( Nominated by Bush, 2006 ; Nominated for re-appointment by Obama, 2015 ). Kamilah Forbes. To replace: Lee Greenwood ( Nominated by Bush, 2008 ) Huascar Medina. To replace:  Irvin M. Mayfield, Jr. ( Nominated by Obama, 2009 ) Christopher Kaui Morgan. To replace: David Masumoto ( Nominated by Obama, 2012 ) Fiona Whelan Prine. To replace: Diane Helen Rodriguez ( Nominated by Obama, 2015 . Rodriguez died in April 2020 ) Jake Shimabukuro. To replace: Rick Lowe ( Nominated by Obama, 2013 ). Of the eight current council members Biden sought to replace in 2021, six were originally nominated, or nominated for re-appointment, by Obama — a further blow to Greenwood's claim that his replacement was being sought as part of a targeted campaign, on the part of the Biden administration, against his conservative political views.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,700
5dfc5486-ba40-431a-aac1-e5b3a93583c0,"A persistent rumor in the summer of 2021 was that somewhere buried in United States President Joe Biden's Build Back Better plan was a hidden tax that was about to make driving much more expensive. In September, for example, the following messages were posted on social media claiming that Biden was implementing a new mileage tax: A screenshot from a broadcast on the conservative news channel Newsmax was also circulated on social media: Biden's Build Back Better plan does not impose a new mileage tax. These rumors appear to be based on a misinterpretation of a section of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that is currently (as of October 1, 2021) making its way through Congress. The infrastructure bill does not impose a mileage tax. Rather, this bill proposes a ""national motor vehicle per-mile user fee"" pilot program to study the impacts of a mileage tax. In other words, this bill will does not implement a new mileage tax. This bill provides funding to study the impact of such a tax. A mileage tax may or may not be implemented after this voluntary pilot program concludes in 2026. Andy Winkler, director of infrastructure projects at the Bipartisan Policy Center, told The Associated Press : “It is not a tax, it is not on everybody and it is voluntary."" Why Study a Mileage Tax? One of the purposes of this pilot program to explore alternative revenue streams to fund surface transportation programs. At the moment, the Highway Trust Fund is largely funded by taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel purchases. With the rise of electric vehicles, cars with better miles per gallon, and decreased personal travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, revenue from the gas tax has declined . One solution to this funding problem is to raise taxes on gasoline purchases. The state of Missouri, for example, just increased the state's gas tax for the first time since the 1990s . Another option would be to shift the burden of funds from the amount of gas a person uses to a person's actual mileage. Back in March 2021, Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg said: “If we believe in that user-pays principle—the idea that how we pay for roads is based on how much you drive—the gas tax used to be the obvious way to do it. It’s not anymore. A so-called VMT tax or mileage tax, whatever you want to call it, could be a way to do it.” While proponents of a mileage tax argue that it's a fair tax, as it will tax people based on how much they use the roads, opponents have argued that this tax could impact people in rural areas more as they typically have to drive longer distances. Others have also raised privacy concerns, questioning how a person's mileage use would be calculated. For the moment, the Biden administration is not implementing a new mileage tax. However, the infrastructure bill does include a pilot program to study the impacts of a mileage tax.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,560

It's an interesting choice: Lee's nihilistic ballad essentially says life is a series of meaningless disappointments, so you might as well drink away your sorrows and forget about the rest of the world. Mr. Trump sees it differently. ""It's a great song because I've had these tremendous successes and then I'm off to the next one. Because, it's like, 'Oh, is that all there is?'"" he told his biographer Michael D'Antonio, in 2014. In sum, Trump's favorite song was not ""Iris"" by the Goo Goo Dolls.

fe07ffb3-3599-494e-914a-c8b25714e6c3,"On Sept. 27, 2021, social media users circulated posts about California supposedly changing its election laws so that officials would automatically mail ballots to every active, registered voter in all future elections. The claim was true. On Sept. 27, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed legislation that would permanently force county election departments to mail every active, registered voter a ballot weeks before Election Day, according to legislative records obtained by Snopes. Before his approval, state statutes established such a program — though only temporarily. In the 2020 presidential election and 2021 failed effort to recall Newsom, officials sent all registered voters a ballot ""as a safety measure to counteract pandemic-related disruptions,"" as the governor described in a news release . However, under statutes governing universal voting by mail in those elections, the ballot distribution system would have expired at the end of 2021. According to Assembly Bill 37 : Existing law requires county elections officials to mail a ballot to every registered voter for all elections proclaimed or conducted prior to January 1, 2022. [...] This bill would extend the requirements to mail a ballot to every registered voter to all elections and apply them to all local elections officials. Both the temporary and permeant measures drew sharp criticism from political conservatives, who argued the process of mailing ballots to millions of people could open the door to fraud. [See also from Snopes: Do Mail-In Ballots Increase Risk of Voter Fraud? ] Before Newsom's approval of AB 37, for example, opponents drew attention to how county officials track who is — and who isn't — an active voter, the Los Angeles Times reported . ""Active"" and ""registered"" voters are residents who are legally able to vote; have filled out paperwork to submit their names to the voting registrar; and are reachable via their addresses on file. In a story about the permanent change, the L.A. Times wrote: One persistent criticism focuses on elections officials’ use of a list of inactive voters , those who may still be eligible to vote but haven’t been reachable at their mailing address on file and who haven’t cast ballots in recent elections. In some situations, inactive registrations are canceled after a voter fails to participate in two consecutive federal elections. When errors do occur, critics have insisted without any clear evidence that the mistakes are an indicator of larger, systemic problems. AB 37 stipulates that ballots can’t be mailed to anyone on a county’s inactive voter list. Republican lawmakers sought additional rules for how counties should maintain their lists of active and inactive voters. Those opponents also pushed unsuccessfully for stronger restrictions on who can turn in a completed ballot at designated drop-off sites or polling stations, as well as a shorter window for when ballots postmarked by Election Day can count, the LA Times reported. Supporters, however, believe the law makes voting in elections easier for more people. “Data shows that sending everyone a ballot in the mail provides voters access. And when voters get ballots in the mail, they vote,” Assemblyman Marc Berman, D-Palo Alto, the bill’s author, said during a Senate committee hearing in July 2021, as reported by the Los Angeles Times . That was indeed the case after California officials mailed every registered voter a ballot in the 2020 presidential election between former president Donald Trump and President Joe Biden. Almost 17.8 million people turned in completed ballots, according to the L.A. Times. That number accounted for about 71% of eligible voters, or the highest such percentage since 1951. “Last year we took unprecedented steps to ensure all voters had the opportunity to cast a ballot during the pandemic and today we are making those measures permanent after record-breaking participation in the 2020 presidential election,” Newsom said in the Sept. 27 release. With Newsom's approval of AB 37, California joined a handful of other U.S. states with the same type of programs, including Utah, Washington, Oregon, and Colorado. But, as the L.A. Times' story noted, no other state’s effort is comparable due to California's population and the law's scope.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,782
13e59a76-665e-4e32-967e-b063e746273b,"Since at least 2018, a Facebook meme about the U.S.-Mexico border has been shared that claimed: ""Louisiana Cajun Navy sends 2,000 gators to Texas to secure the Rio Grande river border."" It was still being posted as of September 2021 . At the time, it appeared to be shared in response to then-recent news in regard to thousands of Haitian migrants who were seeking U.S. asylum at the Mexico border near Del Rio, Texas. The Alligator Meme After some basic searches, we found that the meme about alligators purportedly being sent at the border was shared by multiple Facebook accounts and pages. The quality of the meme was degraded, as it appeared to have been compressed many times. When a picture is uploaded to Facebook, it's automatically compressed to reduce the file size. If a user downloads the photograph and then uploads it to Facebook again, the quality is further reduced. After this is repeated multiple times, the quality can become quite poor. On the Piracy1Radio Facebook page, a user named Carol commented on the post : ""Is this TRUE? I never know what is and isn't anymore."" Bertie added: ""[That's] one way to stop people."" Another commenter named Christina said: ""If it's true, [that's] awesome."" The meme was also posted on the Tiger Droppings message board and The Columbian Post Facebook page . The oldest post with the meme that we found was from Nov. 24, 2018. It was captioned with: ""The Great State Of Louisiana Sent 2000 Alligators To The Rio Grande!!! ? it. #AmericanFirst #Buildthatwall ??."" The meme was not labeled as being satire, nor did we find that it was an old April Fools' joke. Further, a majority of social media commenters appeared to believe it was genuine news. Nonpolitical Photograph Becomes Political While the picture of the alligators was real, the story about the border presented in the meme was not. The misleading and political caption on the picture appeared to be adapted from a nonpolitical news story. In 2017, Louisiana's volunteer force known as the Cajun Navy traveled from Louisiana to Texas to help in the recovery efforts after Hurricane Harvey. According to The Washington Post , ""Houston officials described a vast rescue effort and said about 2,000 people had been brought to safety with more still in need of help."" This might be where the creator of the alligator meme found the number 2,000 to use in the image. In reality, the photograph showed upwards of 200 (not 2,000) alligators at a giant sinkhole in Florida. The 2017 picture was credited to Lee Dalton, who posted more photographs on Facebook. 'Terrifying, Yet Breathtaking' This video shows the picture from the meme as well as aerial footage of the same alligators. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brudIkGrV1U On March 10, 2017, CBS News reported on the ""terrifying, yet breathtaking"" display of nature: Only a handful of people were able to make their way through the gates of Myakka River State Park in Sarasota, Florida, this week. A limit of 30 people are allowed to visit each day in order to retain the “wilderness experience,” park manager Stephen Giguere told CBS affiliate WTSP in Florida. It’s a hot and sticky 2-mile hike to get to “Deep Hole,” the 134-foot-deep sinkhole formation that’s about one-third of an acre in size, where the alligators like to hang out. The sinkhole is located at the lower lake of Wilderness Park at Myakka River State Park. ""On a typical day in the dry season you can see 50, 150, 200 alligators,"" Giguere said. ""They congregate to this area [as it's the] only deep water left during dry season and a good source of food."" In sum, the meme falsely claimed that the Louisiana Cajun Navy sent 2,000 alligators to Texas to secure the Rio Grande crossing at the U.S.-Mexico border. The picture in the meme had nothing to do with immigration or politics. Sources ""Dozens of Alligators Attract Hikers at Myakka River State Park.""

10a8310d-efe7-49f3-bcf1-c115df773425,"In late August 2021, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris visited Vietnam and conducted bilateral meetings with the prime minister and president, while on a trip across Southeast Asia. Three years after the passing of Sen. John McCain, who was also a prisoner of war in Vietnam, Harris stopped at a monument marking the spot where McCain’s plane was shot down in 1967, placing flowers there. After videos of her visit to the monument spread, many online claimed that she had inadvertently celebrated McCain’s captors, and laid flowers at a monument that celebrated his capture at the hands of the Vietnamese forces. Wire Daily News , a right-leaning website, claimed that she “Mistakenly Pays Tribute To The Communist Vietnamese Who Shot Down And Captured John McCain.” The website quotes a number of Twitter accounts including one user who says they are from Vietnam: While many accused Harris of inadvertently or mistakenly commemorating the Vietnamese captors by visiting the site, Harris and her team appeared fully aware of the significance and history of the monument. During her visit, she mainly spoke to media about McCain’s heroism: John McCain was an extraordinary American hero. I was honored and privileged to serve with him for a short time in the United States Senate. John McCain, he loved our country. He was so courageous and really lived the life of a hero—the sacrifices he made that were on every scale imaginable, loved our country and really always fought for the best of who we are. And it turns out today is the anniversary, so there we are. Rachel Palermo, Harris’ assistant press secretary, tweeted that the monument “serves as a reminder of the cost of war and a symbol of the continued growth in the U.S.-Vietnam relationship.” The structure was built in 1967 after McCain’s plane was shot down and he was pulled out of Truc Bach lake by villagers. He spent the next five and a half years as a high-profile prisoner in Hoa Lo prison in Hanoi, also referred to as the “Hanoi Hilton.” He said he and others had been tortured while in prison, and spent years in isolation. The monument depicts a pilot with his hands up in the air in front of a broken plane wing. On one side it states, “USA” with a star, and on the other is an inscription in Vietnamese. One translation of the inscription, according to a CNN report states: “On 26 October 1967 near the Truc Bach Lake, the Vietnamese people in Hanoi caught [John Sidney McCain]. He was the captain of a group who flew planes in the sky who attacked Hanoi. The number of the plane was A4. The plane fell on Yen Phu power plant. This was one of 10 planes that fell on the same day.” Another Salon report by Jake Tapper, which described McCain visiting the site in 2000, said the inscription described McCain as an “air pirate” and misidentified the then-navy pilot as a member of the U.S. Air Force. During that visit, McCain announced that the misidentification was “the greatest insult of all.” McCain visited the site of his capture a number of times over many decades, even tweeting about it in 2012, and describing it as a “monument” to his capture: McCain spent much of his political career developing U.S.-Vietnam relations, visiting the country of his capture, and despite saying he still bore his prison guards “ ill will ” for the way they mistreated his friends, he said he always received a warm welcome from the Vietnamese whenever he returned. He said in an interview , ""There is no reason for me to hold a grudge or anger. There's certainly some individual guards who were very cruel and inflicted a lot of pain on me and others but there's certainly no sense in me hating the Vietnamese ... I hold no ill will toward them."" When he died in August 2018, the monument depicting his capture turned into a condolence site, Americans and Vietnamese came to pay their respects there, leaving flowers and incense. Republicans have visited the monument over the years as well. In 2019, Sen. Lisa Murkowski tweeted about visiting the site of McCain’s capture, and described feeling “pride.” She added, “This monument represents the service of one incredible patriot, but also embodies the tremendous sacrifices of our nation’s military.” The monument was indeed created to commemorate the capture of McCain during the Vietnam war, but its meaning appears to carry an evolving significance as US-Vietnam relations have normalized, and was certainly considered to be a point of pride for Republicans and Democrats. It was also a place where Vietnamese and Americans commemorated McCain’s death. Whatever viewers may interpret the monument to be, Harris’ did not mistakenly visit it, nor was she or her team unaware of its history. As such, we rate this claim as “False.”",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,930

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. As the COVID-19 pandemic raged across the globe, a number of rumors and conspiracy theories attempted to blame the disease in some capacity on China and the Chinese Communist Party. Some politicians called the disease the "" Kung Flu ,"" a divisive piece of rhetoric that may be partly responsible for a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans , while internet rumors levied vague accusations at China, stating that they were responsible for a "" COVID cover-up ."" One rumor held that Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company that developed one of the vaccines against COVID-19, had 70 members of the Chinese Communist Party on its investment board: This list made its way around social media, along with various accusations about the vaccine. Some, for example, used this list to cast doubt on vaccine mandates. Others claimed that this was ""proof"" that the COVID-19 pandemic was manmade. The problem with these claims, of course, is that this document does not list 70 members of ""Pfizer's Investment Board"" who are also members of the Chinese Communist Party. Pfizer Doesn't Have an 'Investment Board' First off, it isn't exactly clear what this rumor is referring to as Pfizer's ""investment board."" The company's website has a page for investors , and that page lists several boards and committees - there's an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance & Sustainability Committee, Executive Committee, Regulatory and Compliance Committee, Science and Technology Committee - but no ""investment committee."" It's also worth mentioning that the aforementioned committees are all comprised of a handful of people, not the 100+ implied by the above-displayed meme. Pfizer Ventures (PV), the venture capital arm of Pfizer Inc., is led by a small team, none of whom are mentioned on this list. Lastly, this rumor may be referring to Pfizer Investments Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Pfizer that operates out of China . However, a spokesperson for Pfizer told us that ""none of the names listed ... are affiliated with our subsidiary Pfizer Investments Co., Ltd."" Where Do These Names Come From? If these names don't come from Pfizer's ""investment board,"" where do they come from? In December 2020, the Daily Mail and other outlets reported that a ""leaked database of 1.95 million registered (CCP) party members"" revealed that many British, Australian and American companies had employed people tied to the Chinese government. This database, which was originally leaked on Telegram, reportedly dates back to 2016. It doesn't appear that any government agency has verified the authenticity of this database and while this leak may have raised suspicions of corporate espionage -- a genuine threat that the Federal Bureau of Investigations is monitoring -- some news reports about it noted ""there is no evidence that anyone on the party membership list has spied for China."" Shortly after this ""leak"" made the news, the list purporting to show ""70 members of the Pfizer investment board"" who were also ""members of the Chinese Communist Party"" started circulating on conspiratorial internet forums such as godlikeproductions . At the time, this list was simply being shared as if it showed ""CCP members list (from the) leaked file. We have not been able to connect the names on this viral list to the leak supposedly showing 1.95 million CCP members (that database is not publicly available), and cannot say if any of the people on this list are truly connected to the CCP. As noted above, this leaked database reportedly comes from 2016 and may not even represent a person's current political affiliations. We searched for all 70 names on this viral list, and found that a few of those listed truly worked for Pfizer in some capacity (researchers, programmers, directors, etc...) In many cases, the names weren't properly rendered (the list mentions a ""Cai Bingbing"" that likely refers to a Bing Cai) and in some cases it appears the names were made up out of whole cloth. For example, we were not able to find any matches for ""Chen Thirsty,"" ""High Also,"" ""Jia Four Flowers,"" ""Jody,"" ""Strictly"" or ""Mosha."" One name, too, appeared to refer to a politician, not a Pfizer employee. ""Kevin Rudd"" is a former Prime Minister of Australia, who claimed that he lobbied Pfizer to expedite their vaccine rollout. We also found a few names on this list that referred to former Pfizer employees, not current ones. Are There 70 CCP Members on Pfizer's 'Investment Board'? No. This list first appeared in December 2020 after an alleged database containing 1.95 million names of members of the Chinese Communist Party was leaked online. While that leaked database reportedly showed the political affiliations of nearly 2 million people as of 2016, it does not show current CCP membership, nor does it provide evidence of corporate espionage. The list purporting to show ""70 CCP Members on Pfizer's Investment Board"" shows no such thing. Some of the names on this list relate to people who work for Pfizer, but none of these names were on Pfizer's ""investment board."" Several of the names on this list also appeared to be made up out of whole cloth or referred to politicians unaffiliated with Pfizer. While it's possible that members (or former members) of the Chinese Communist Party work for Pfizer, and while China has been accused of corporate espionage in the past, the list purporting to show ""70 CCP Members on Pfizer's Investment Board"" appears to be have been created by searching for Pfizer employees with Chinese-sounding names.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1160
7ca7a424-9e34-40a0-8f13-f6901dc4e37a,"In September 2021, a video of U.S. President Joe Biden started circulating on social media along with the claim that the commander-in-chief said that the COVID-19 vaccine would protect people against hurricanes. The video features a brief statement from Biden and then a clip from the Adam Sandler movie ""Billy Madison"": Biden did not say that vaccines protect people from hurricanes. This clip comes from a briefing on hurricane preparedness. The president was saying that it is important for people to get vaccinated in the event they have to evacuate their homes and possibly shelter in close quarters with strangers. This video was taken on Aug. 10, 2021, as Biden met with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, Chief Medical Advisor and NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci, Homeland Security Advisor Liz Sherwood-Randall, and COVID-19 Response Coordinator and Counselor to the President Jeff Zients to discuss the state of the COVID-19 pandemic during the approaching hurricane season. Biden said at the start of the meeting : Hey, folks. I’ll make a brief opening statement here. I want to thank you, Administrator Criswell, for the job you’ve been doing — outstanding work helping our country navigate what is overlapping challenges we’ve been facing. And you’ve been very busy. We’ve got wildfires in the West. We’ve got — approaching the peak of Atlantic hurricane season. All across the country, the Delta variant is spreading, as Dr. Fauci and others can tell you, and it’s spreading rapidly — rapidly among the unvaccinated. When these crises intersect, they compound one another — natural disasters and the Delta variant. And that’s what we’re going to be discussing today with the group I’ve assembled here. We need to be ready to manage our natural disasters caused by hurricanes hitting the Southeast and the environment and with a broad community spread of COVID-19. And the best thing we can do is — to prepare for that is for everyone who is not vaccinated — I know it’s a broken record, and I keep saying it — but to get vaccinated. The viral clip features a single out-of-context sentence. In the video, Biden can be heard saying, ""If you’re in a state where hurricanes often strike — like Florida or the Gulf Coast or into Texas — a vital part of preparing for hurricane season is to get vaccinated now."" Just before this sentence, however, he says, ""We have to make sure we’re ready to be protected against COVID-19"" in the case of a hurricane, and just after this sentence, he says ""everything is more complicated if you’re not vaccinated and a hurricane or a natural disaster hits."" You can see Biden's full statement here. We've included the relevant portion below. The single sentence included in the viral clip is highlighted in bold text: With the Delta variant, we’re seeing a pandemic of the unvaccinated.  Cases and hospitalizations are rising faster in states with low vaccination rates, such as Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, which are the states that — from a hurricane-prone — they’re the states that are most at risk. And so, we don’t wait until it’s too late.  And if, God forbid, a natural disaster strikes, we have to make sure we’re ready to be protected against COVID-19 as well. Let me be clear: If you’re in a state where hurricanes often strike — like Florida or the Gulf Coast or into Texas — a vital part of preparing for hurricane season is to get vaccinated now. Everything is more complicated if you’re not vaccinated and a hurricane or a natural disaster hits. If you wind up having to evacuate, if you wind up having to stay in a shelter, you don’t want to add COVID-19 to the list of dangers that you’re going to be confronting. Get vaccinated now so you’re ready for whatever may come this month.  And it’s likely some serious hurricanes are going to come this month. Biden did not say that vaccines protect against hurricanes. The president said that it was important for people to think ahead and to get vaccinated for COVID-19 before they were forced to evacuate in the event of a hurricane. Or, as Reuters wrote at the time: ""President Joe Biden on Tuesday urged Americans in hurricane-prone states to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to protect themselves in case they have to evacuate from their homes, warning that serious hurricanes could strike this month."" More than a month after Biden held this meeting, social media users took a single sentence from the president's statement, presented it out of context, and falsely claimed that the president made the absurd claim that vaccines protect against hurricanes.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,915
f12e2c8f-db46-4c2e-af21-cfc3f58df548,"In September 2021, former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani made an expletive-ridden and at times rambling public speech, during which he impersonated Queen Elizabeth and drifted between anecdotes about his time as a federal prosecutor, and the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The speech provided fodder for late night talk show hosts, and prompted widespread speculation that Giuliani, a prominent ally of former U.S. President Donald Trump, may have been drunk during his appearance at an event to commemorate the 20th anniversary of 9/11 — allegations that Giuliani has denied . In one widely-shared moment from his Sept. 11 speech, Giuliani claimed he had ""turned down a knighthood,"" because accepting it would have meant relinquishing U.S. citizenship: While it's true that only U.K. or Commonwealth citizens can be given full or ""substantive"" knighthoods, foreign recipients are simply not given the option of suddenly acquiring U.K. citizenship in order to receive a ""full"" honor. Rather, they are awarded only ""honorary"" awards, as Giuliani was. We are issuing a rating of ""False."" What Giuliani Said in His Sept. 11, 2021, Speech Giuliani's speech can be watched in full here (the relevant remarks begin around 3:09:25). At one point, Giuliani recalled the considerable difficulty associated with shepherding the city of New York through the aftermath of such an unprecedented and horrifying attack, then segued into a discussion of his honorary knighthood: I think what got me through it is — I don't want to sound like a name-dropper, but I told this to the queen of England. She said [affects accent] ""You did a wonderful job on September 11th. And therefore I'm making you an honorary knight commander of the royal something-or-other."" I turned down a knighthood, because if you took a knighthood you had to lose your citizenship. ...[Prince Andrew] told me ""My mummy wants to make you a knight""... I said ""Well what does it entail?"" He said ""Well if you want to be a full knight you have to give up your citizenship""... I said ""I think I'll turn that down. Do we have an alternative?"" He said ""Yes, you can do what Ronald Reagan did."" I said ""Anything Ronald Reagan does, I'll do."" He said ""You can be an honorary knight."" So when she gave it to me and to Bernie and to Tom, right after, she said to me ""You did a wonderful job..."" Giuliani is referring to the episode, in February 2002, when Queen Elizabeth bestowed an honorary knighthood on three prominent public officials associated with New York's response to the attacks of Sept. 11: Former mayor Giuliani; former NYPD Commissioner Bernie Kerik; and former FDNY Commissioner Tom Von Essen. News footage from that episode can be watched below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeiogSfMibs There's no doubt that Giuliani was offered, and gratefully accepted, an honorary knighthood, in 2002. So how does this track with his claim, 19 years later, that he ""turned down a knighthood""? How the Honors System Works Twice each year — in June, to mark her official birthday, and on New Year's Eve — Queen Elizabeth bestows various honors and awards on hundreds of people, as a way of formally recognizing their contributions to various aspects of public life, including business, charity, sports, culture, and so on. While formally, it is the monarch who confers those honors, the lists of recipients are recommended by various "" honors committees ,"" who forward their recommendations to a main honors committee. From there, the lists are vetted by the U.K. Prime Minister and government, who submit the names to Buckingham Palace. The honors are separated into various different orders , with some being more exclusive, and regarded as higher honors, than others.  While most recipients are either citizens of the U.K., or citizens of the Commonwealth (countries such as Australia and New Zealand, whose head of state is Queen Elizabeth), some are neither U.K. nor Commonwealth citizens. Non-British and non-Commonwealth recipients are given ""honorary"" awards. For example, in 1989 former U.S. President Ronald Reagan was given an honorary knighthood, and made an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honorable Order of the Bath, to which Giuliani alluded in his 2021 speech. Other prominent Americans to have received honorary knighthoods include George H.W. Bush (1993), Steven Spielberg (2001), and Bill Gates (2005). Foreign recipients of honorary awards are entitled to place the relevant initials after their name, but cannot use any associated honorifics , such as ""Sir"" or ""Dame,"" because they are not U.K. or Commonwealth citizens. Giuliani was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, a very significant honor . As such, he is entitled to style himself ""Rudy Giuliani KBE,"" but cannot style himself ""Sir Rudy Giuliani."" Interestingly, recipients of honorary awards can convert those to ""substantive"" awards, if they later obtain U.K. citizenship, such as was the case with the well-known Irish broadcaster Terry Wogan, who received an honorary knighthood in the queen's birthday honors in June 2005. After Wogan obtained U.K. citizenship, his knighthood was "" made substantive "" in the New Year's honors list, on Dec. 31, 2005. However, that process was not available to Giuliani, because he did not meet the standard requirements for obtaining U.K. citizenship, such as residency in the country. While there was a grain of truth in his remarks — full or ""substantive"" honors are indeed reserved only for U.K. and Commonwealth citizens — the reality is that, because of this, foreigners are only ever offered honorary awards in the first place. The prospect of Giuliani being offered a ""substantive"" knighthood, but only on condition that he obtain U.K. citizenship and/or relinquish his U.S. citizenship, simply would not have arisen. By contrast, if Giuliani were to move to the U.K., live there for several years, meet the criteria for naturalization, and obtain U.K. citizenship, he would then be eligible to apply for his honorary knighthood to be ""made substantive."" Then, and only then, could he call himself ""Sir Rudy.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1205

In Sept. 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order saying that all federal employees would have to be vaccinated by Nov. 22, 2021. Another order required vaccinations of all contractors who did business with the federal government. According to the White House website : Building on the President’s announcement in July to strengthen safety requirements for unvaccinated federal workers, the President has signed an Executive Order to take those actions a step further and require all federal executive branch workers to be vaccinated. The President also signed an Executive Order directing that this standard be extended to employees of contractors that do business with the federal government. Conservative website The Blaze reported that this meant that members of Congress and their staff did not fall under this mandate. This is correct. The vaccine mandate refers to employees working in the executive branch of government. This covers the president, the vice president, and their offices, which include their advisors and staffers, the cabinet appointed by the president, and heads of various federal agencies. The mandate covers federal agencies such as the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Treasury, and more. The armed forces are also included in the executive branch. According to the White House , the total number of people employed in this branch are 4 million. The legislative and judicial branches are separate from the executive branch, and do not fall under this vaccine mandate. Biden also cannot mandate as president that all Americans get vaccinated. That is up to each state. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in April 2021, “We cannot require someone to be vaccinated.  That's just not what we can do.  It is a matter of privacy to know who is or who isn't. I can't go to the Capitol Physician and say, ‘Give me the names of people who aren't vaccinated, so I can go encourage them or make it known to others to encourage them to be vaccinated.’  So we can't – we can't do that.” In August, a group of House Democrats called on the Capitol physician to institute a vaccine mandate for House members. In early August 2021 , Pelosi said that Congress would follow the guidance of Capitol Physician Brian Monahan. She added, “In a matter of days or weeks, the full approval [from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)] will be given to the vaccines, that I think will make a difference in terms of what we can do.” That approval came through on Aug. 23, 2021. In July 2021, Monahan issued an indoor mask mandate for House members and their staffs. This did not extend to the Senate. A vaccination mandate still hasn’t been enforced in Congress. As such, we rate this claim as “True.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,617
06e1566a-2202-496a-ac97-7088c2a66fea,"In mid-September 2021, social media users were surprised by a photograph of a billboard that contained a biblical quote that appeared to compare former U.S. President Donald Trump to Jesus, the central figure of the Christian religion. According to the Chattanooga Times Free Press, the billboard was on Highway 27 in the city of Fort Oglethorpe, which is in Georgia, but was removed on Sept. 13, 2021. It contained a portion of a prophetic Bible verse from the book of Isaiah, and a picture of Trump, leading some to conclude that the billboard likened Trump with a deity, if not Jesus. An image of the billboard was posted on Twitter by Washington Post journalist Eugene Scott: Although the sign says ""Romans 8:17"" on the bottom right, the verse is actually the first part of Isaiah 9:6 . Isaiah 9:6 in its entirety reads , in the King James Version: ""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace."" The verse is a familiar one, and as the Free Times Press editor Clint Cooper pointed out, ""Christians and biblical scholars believe the words prophesy the coming of Jesus Christ."" In fact, as Cooper further pointed out, the verse is the chorus to Handel's ""Messiah."" Romans 8:17 reads , ""And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."" We reached out to Reagan, the billboard company listed on the bottom of the sign, asking why it was taken down, and will update if we receive a response.

7333fc48-dfaa-4f95-936b-30d4fb0d4bba,"In the days following the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks, Snopes readers asked us to determine the validity of a viral photograph supposedly showing U.S. President Joe Biden pulling down his mask to yell something at a ceremony to honor the attacks' victims. A Sept. 13, 2021, column by Newsweek's editorial board claimed: At the 20th anniversary memorial for 9/11, top Democratic politicians all wore masks for a photo op. Then, as soon as the television cameras were off, the masks came off. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Gov. Kathy Hochul are masked one minute, unmasked and talking the next. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has hers off. President Biden even pulls his mask down to yell at someone. The idiocy. For the purpose of this fact check, we'll focus on the simple assertion: that the president briefly removed his COVID-19 facial covering to communicate something at a 9/11 memorial service. The claim stemmed from a real event that took place at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in Lower Manhattan, where the World Trade Center towers once stood. On Sept. 11, 2021, officials including Biden and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton gathered there for a memorial service that included a moment of silence and name-reading of victims, as reported by multiple reputable news outlets . And it was true that, while standing in the crowd, Biden on at least two occasions temporarily pulled down his mask to communicate something, according to photographic evidence. Considering that verified proof to substantiate the claim, we rate this claim ""True."" Getty Images photographers Chip Somodevilla and Ed Jones documented the moments in a series of photographs from the event, including those displayed in the following tweet. Within that group of photos, the the most controversial image (the featured photograph of this report) included the below-transcribed caption in Getty Images' database: NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 11: President Joe Biden (C) calls out as he is joined by (L-R) former President Bill Clinton, former First Lady Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama, former First Lady Michelle Obama, First Lady Jill Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, during the annual 9/11 Commemoration Ceremony at the National 9/11 Memorial and Museum on September 11, 2021 in New York City. During the ceremony six moments of silence were held, marking when each of the World Trade Center towers was struck and fell and the times corresponding to the attack on the Pentagon and the crash of Flight 93. The nation is marking the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, when the terrorist group al-Qaeda flew hijacked airplanes into the World Trade Center, Shanksville, PA and the Pentagon, killing nearly 3,000 people. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In other words, according to at least one reputable photojournalist who witnessed the scene, Biden indeed removed his mask to ""call out"" something while attending the commemoration event. However, the reasons why — or circumstances under which — Biden made the gesture were not made clear by that item of reporting. Also unclear was when, exactly, the moment occurred: before the ceremony began, during its activities, or after its closing. We reached out to Somodevilla for the answers to those questions, and we will update this report when, or if, we hear back from the photojournalist. Meanwhile, we obtained C-SPAN's live recording of the day's multiple commemoration ceremonies. Roughy 1.5 hours in, the footage showed Biden and his entourage walking in to the event at ground zero. Then, over the course of minutes, cameras from various angles focused on him and other politicians greeting members of the crowd. During those conversations before the service's start, Biden pulled down his mask to apparently say something to people around him, the footage showed. That split-second moment, which Jones captured via the below-displayed photo, was separate from the instance mentioned above based on Biden's positioning in the crowd (next to first lady Jill Biden and the Obamas). (Photo by Ed Jones-Pool/Getty Images) Shortly after that gesture, the C-SPAN footage showed, the crowd including the politicians assembled to mark the beginning of the memorial service with a flag ceremony and the Star-Spangled Banner . (The video recording did not include the other moment of Biden temporarily removing his mask captured by Somodevilla.) To conclude our research, we reached out to the White House. Our inquiry included a link to Somodevilla's photo showing Biden ""calling out"" something with his mask away from his face, and the explicit questions: What was the president saying in that moment, specifically, and to whom, or what, was he saying it? In sum, it was true the president temporarily pulled down his mask at least twice at a gathering to honor 9/11 victims, and, in one instance, a reputable photojournalist said he ""called out"" an unspecified word or phrase. However, what the president said in both moments, and with whom or what he was communicating, were unknown. Also undetermined was when — either before, during, or after commemoration activities — the photographs were taken.

The enforcement mechanism laid out in the law allows any private citizen to sue ""any person"" who performs such abortions, or ""aids or abets"" them. The law blocks access to an estimated 85 to 90% of medical system-provided abortion services, and provides no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest. The law was overwhelmingly backed by Texas Republicans and signed by the state's Republican governor, Greg Abbott. In response, Anonymous announced a campaign, dubbed ""Operation Jane,"" to render data collected in efforts to report abortions useless. As part of that campaign, Anonymous hackers took down the Texas GOP's website and replaced it with, among other things, an X-rated image of a man stretching out his anus. (There is an archived version of the hacked website , but view with caution: It is graphic.) Hackers also replaced the state GOP's mission statement with one that read, in part, ""WE REALLY REALLY LOVED THE HANDMAID'S TALE AND WISH TO ENACT IT TO IT'S FULLEST. FOOTBALL!!!!!!"" Texas Republicans acknowledged the vandalism with a statement on their website claiming it prompted them to ramp up their online security. The statement was accompanied by fields allowing website visitors to enter their payment card information and make a donation. The statement reads, in part, ""Stand with us now against these cyber criminals and their brazen attacks by rushing a contribution to harden our digital defenses."" Just days after the law went into effect, a website launched by the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life which was intended for reporting abortions that violated the new law was taken offline by domain host GoDaddy after a public pressure campaign. Anonymous is a loose collective of, as the name states, anonymous cyber activists who emerged in the late aughts to support popular protest movements like the Arab Spring and Occupy Wall Street. They are known for making ominous videos addressed to their hacking targets ending with the phrase, ""Expect us,"" and wearing Guy Fawkes masks to conceal their identities. Anonymous' presence peaked around the time of the Occupy Wall Street protests, in 2011 and 2012, but died down after a series of high profile arrests . They began to make their presence known again after the murder of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin in May 2020.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,495

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) which appeared to show her wearing a dress with the words ""TAX THE RICH"" printed across it. The New York congresswoman, widely known as AOC, purportedly wore the dress at the Met Gala, an exclusive event popular among New York socialites and wealthy and well-connected individuals. For example, on Sep. 13, journalist Ilana Kaplan posted two photographs of AOC to Twitter , one of which showed her wearing a white dress with the words ""TAX THE RICH"" printed across the back in bold red letters. Kaplan described the outfit as ""iconic"": Those pictures were authentic. AOC attended the Met Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, on Sep. 13. She wore a white dress, designed by the Canadian fashion designer Aurora James, with her political message of choice printed across the back. On Twitter and Instagram , Ocasio-Cortez posted a photograph of herself, wearing the dress, alongside James, along with the following description: The medium is the message. Proud to work with Aurora James as a sustainably focused, Black woman immigrant designer who went from starting her dream at a flea market in Brooklyn to winning the [Council of Fashion Designers of America awards] against all odds - and then work together to kick open the doors at the Met.

Following the U.S. full approval of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in late August 2021, some social media users suggested that nefarious actions of health experts were at play. In particular, posts claimed that National Institutes of Health (NIH) Chief of Bioethics Dr. Christine Grady , who is married to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was personally involved in the final approval of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Such posts alleged that the bioethicist and her husband presented a conflict of interest in approving the vaccine — and that the mainstream media failed to properly investigate and report such concerns. “This will blow your mind!” read memes readers sent to Snopes. “DID YOU KNOW: FDA doesn’t do testing for drug approval… NIH does and provides its findings for FDA approval… who is Christine Grady, head of NIH Bio Ethics…Who is her spouse? Move along, nothing to see here…” Grady has been married to Fauci since 1985 , and she is chief of bioethics at the NIH Clinical Center and a member of the institution’s research community. But in a statement sent to Snopes, the NIH said that Grady does not approve the conduct of any research protocol, and she has no input into the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) process for issuing emergency use authorizations. “The authority to issue emergency use authorizations and approvals lies with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, not the NIH,” wrote the health agency. “As part of her official duties, Dr. Grady and her staff teach medical ethics and perform research into complex ethical issues related to medicine and clinical research. Bioethics Department staff are available for bioethics consultation within the research programs of the NIH.” Fauci was appointed director of the NIAID in 1984 and oversees research on infectious diseases. He came to the forefront in 2020 when he led the COVID-19 response team. Grady, on the other hand, is a nurse-bioethicist and senior investigator at NIH and serves as the chief of the Department of Bioethics in one of the world’s largest research hospitals. The Department of Bioethics is described as “a center for research, training, and service related to bioethical issues” that conducts conceptual, empirical, and policy-related research into bioethical issues. Grady’s research focuses primarily on the ethics of clinical research as well as ethical issues faced by nurses and other health care providers — not in approving COVID-19 vaccines. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, now marketed as Comirnaty, was approved on Aug. 23, 2021, following its EUA on Dec. 11, 2020. And all vaccines approved by the FDA undergo agency standard processes for reviewing quality, safety, and effectiveness: For all vaccines, the FDA evaluates data and information included in the manufacturer’s submission of a biologics license application (BLA). A BLA is a comprehensive document that is submitted to the agency providing very specific requirements. For Comirnaty, the BLA builds on the extensive data and information previously submitted that supported the EUA, such as preclinical and clinical data and information, as well as details of the manufacturing process, vaccine testing results to ensure vaccine quality, and inspections of the sites where the vaccine is made. The agency conducts its own analyses of the information in the BLA to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective and meets the FDA’s standards for approval. A look through official documents issued by the FDA in August 2021 related to the approval of Comirnaty revealed no mention of Grady, including the approval letter , letter of authorization , a concurrence letter , and a decision memorandum .

ad5ea3c0-dbbc-4b12-a9a1-704c44d62c65,"In September 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the implementation of a controversial Texas state law that effectively bans most abortions, prompting an outraged response among Democrats, pro-choice activists, celebrities, and some sectors of corporate America . Texas Senate Bill (S.B.) 8 , signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on May 19 and implemented on Sept. 1, bans any and all abortions after the ""first detectable heartbeat"" of a fetus, an event that can take place as early as six weeks into pregnancy. It also allows a private citizen to sue any woman who undergoes an abortion after this point, or anyone who assists her, regardless of whether the citizen has any personal connection to those individuals. According to a widely shared Facebook post, one of the major U.S. companies to announce its opposition to the law was the ride-sharing app Lyft. On Sept. 4, Facebook user Izabella Kordalewski posted what appeared to be a screenshot of a letter from the company, addressed to ""Lyft riders and drivers,"" criticizing S.B. 8 as ""incompatible with people's basic rights to privacy."" The letter also promised to provide financial assistance to Lyft drivers who become caught up in the enforcement of the law by transporting women who are on their way to obtain an abortion, in potential violation of S.B. 8. Kordalewski introduced the letter by writing, ""Dear friends. Here is a screenshot of an email I received from Lyft yesterday. Go make good choices."" The letter itself read as follows: Dear Lyft Riders and Drivers, A new Texas law, SB8, threatens to punish drivers for getting people where they need to go - specifically, women exercising their right to choose and to access the healthcare they need. We want to be clear: Drivers are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Imagine being a driver and not knowing if you are breaking the law by giving someone a ride. Similarly, riders never have to justify, or even share, where they are going and why. Imagine being a pregnant woman trying to get to a healthcare appointment and not knowing if your driver will cancel on you for fear of breaking a law. Both are completely unacceptable. This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company. We are taking action on two fronts: Lyft has created a Driver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. Riders and Drivers: Nothing about how you drive, ride or interact with each other should change. TX SB8 is an attack on women’s right to choose. Lyft is donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to help ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. If you feel compelled to join us as an individual, you can make a donation here. That letter was entirely authentic, so we are issuing a rating of ""True."" On Sept. 3, Lyft shared the letter on its own website , stipulating that it was signed by co-founders Logan Green and John Zimmer, as well as the company's general counsel, Kristin Sverchek.

7fc21b18-31a1-4ec5-9edf-e63f6d6e118e,"As the Taliban took over Afghanistan, U.S. President Joe Biden pulled American troops out in August 2021, with the last military plane departing at the end of the month, marking the end of a two-decade-long presence in the country. Biden has faced plenty of criticism for the rushed departure particularly from right-wing voices, and the internet pulled out an old article he wrote for The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), titled ""How I Learned to Love the New World Order,” to bolster arguments against him. According to numerous posts like this one , the essay was arguing for the destruction of “national sovereignty” and the establishment of “a one world government.” Some claimed that because of the headline, Biden supported a “New World Order,” which advocates for “one world government.” This stems from the New World Order (NWO) conspiracy theory, which claims that a secret group of global elites is seeking to establish an all-powerful, authoritarian, one-world government. The essay was indeed published by The Wall Street Journal on April 23, 1992. We found a copy in the archives of the New York Public Librar y. The full version can be seen below: Biden wrote the essay in response to a Wall Street Journal editorial that claimed he was in favor of “neo-isolationism.” To be clear, in Biden's essay, he was not talking about the NWO conspiracy theory. He argued that the Pentagon’s strategy of making America a “Globocop” would render it a “hollow superpower.” The highlights made in the blog post above about his essay do not support the argument that Biden wants to “destroy national sovereignty.” In the article Biden argues for Americans to pull back on military intervention and build up economic might: “Bristling with weapons, we would continue our economic decline, while rising industrial and financial giants in Europe and Asia viewed our military pretensions with indifference or contempt.” The essay also addresses America’s role as a “Globocop,” arguing that “Power also emanates from [...] the economic leverage to wield diplomatic clout,” and not from “the barrel of a gun.” Biden argues in favor of multilateral military action by breathing “life into the U.N. Charter.” He envisions ""a permanent commitment of forces, for use by the Security Council. That means a presumption of collective action — but with a U.S. veto.” He concluded: “We must get lean militarily, revitalize American economic strength, and exercise a diplomatic leadership that puts new muscle into institutions of collective security.” The blog post makes another claim: that Biden wrote the WSJ article many years before writing the Patriot Act, a counterterrorism bill that increased surveillance capabilities by U.S. law enforcement after 9/11. This is partially true, because Biden did support the Patriot Act and claimed he was responsible for authoring earlier versions of counterterrorism legislation that featured prominently in it. Biden introduced and authored the Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995, which he argued provided one source of inspiration for the 2001 Patriot Act. In October 2001, he said in a Senate speech supporting the Patriot Act: “It allows law enforcement to keep up with the modern technology these terrorists are using. The bill contains several provisions which are identical or nearly identical to those I previously proposed.” The Patriot Act was criticized by civil rights advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who said it turned regular citizens into suspects, and resulted in a loss of privacy. While civil rights experts have criticized his support for the law, that criticism does not suggest that Biden is trying to build a “one world government.” While the WSJ did publish this essay by Biden, the article did not make the arguments that critical blog posts on social media are claiming. As such, we rate this claim as “False.” Sources: “Afghanistan: Last US Military Flight Departs Ending America’s Longest War.” BBC News, 31 Aug. 2021. www.bbc.com, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58390085.

427b13dd-5007-427b-b226-09c6bf95ac26,"The homepage of Google.com frequently features a ""Doodle"" -- a special, colorful page element displayed for a single day -- to commemorate a notable past event which took place on that day. These Doodles, according to Google , celebrate ""holidays, anniversaries, and the lives of famous artists, pioneers, and scientists."" On 21 April 2019, a number of conservative commentators took to social media to complain that while the search-engine giant has offered Google Doodles for a wide range of events, they don't do so for the Christian holiday of Easter: Other social media posts were more specific in their complaints , accusing the technology giant of religious bias by snubbing Christian holidays such as Easter while celebrating other religions' holidays, such as the Islamic holy month of Ramadan: While it is true that Google does not traditionally produce a Doodle in honor of Easter (although they did create one in 2000 ), this isn't due to bias against Christians. Google generally avoids creating Doodles for all religious holidays . The company told Fox News in 2018 that ""We don't have Doodles for religious holidays, in line with our current Doodle guidelines. Doodles may appear for some non-religious celebrations that have grown out of religious holidays, such as Valentine's Day, Holi's Festival of Colors, Tu B'Av and the December holiday period, but we don't include religious imagery or symbolism as part of these."" But what about the Ramadan Google Doodle? The graphic shown above is frequently shared as if it were official Google Doodle created to mark the Muslim observance of a month of fasting, prayer, reflection and community. However, that simply wasn't the case: this image does not represent an official Google Doodle. The graphic was created in 2010 as part of a social media campaign to convince Google to feature a Doodle for Ramadan. Despite the efforts, this image was never used or endorsed by Google as an official Doodle for Ramadan. The Facebook page at the center of this campaign is no longer active, but the Muslim blog Al-Kanz documented those efforts: ""Muslims have launched a Facebook campaign to convince Google to create a doodle for Ramadan this year, something that Google has not done as of yet. Here is one of their proposed doodles."" A spokesperson for Google told us in an email that ""We have never done a Doodle for Ramadan. Seems like there might be some fan art image out there being circulated on the web, but these were not created by Google and never ran on our home page."" We searched the Google Doodle archive and found no Doodles explicitly celebrating the Islamic holiday. Google has created Doodles for Mudik and Malaysia National Day, both of which are secular events that coincide with the end of Ramadan, but not for Ramadan itself. While Google traditionally avoids creating Doodles in honor of major religious holidays, a few exceptions exist, religious Doodles typically restricted to very specific locations. In 2006, for example, a Google Doodle for Rosh Hashana was displayed to users in Israel. In 2008, a Doodle for Diwali was used in India. An Easter Google Doodle was shown the search engine's home page for users in the United States on that day in 2000: While the company did not create a specific Doodle for Easter in 2019, the company did hide an Easter egg below the search bar on the Google homepage. Users who clicked ""I'm Feeling Luckily"" saw Easter eggs, bunnies, and other Easter items drop into the screen. The company also published a series of articles on Google Arts & Culture that explored the history of the holiday and the various traditions associated with it. A Google spokesperson told us: To celebrate Easter, we ran a full homepage experience on Easter Sunday. It was a first of its kind interactive experience which took over the full Google homepage on desktop ... By clicking the ""I'm feeling [animated Easter egg]"" button, people could activate a full homepage celebration that took you to a series of articles on Google Arts & Culture to help you explore the history and meaning behind U.S. and international Easter cultural traditions.

01cf846c-2b70-4325-8aa6-f1acab010f2e,"A statement ostensibly uttered by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina started to recirculate on social media after the Republican senator delivered an emotional, angry, and dramatic defense of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during a hearing concerning sexual assault allegations against the nominee in September 2018. Some social media users were taken aback by Graham's performance in defense of President Trump's nominee, as they remembered a time when the senator was highly critical of Donald Trump as a politician: ""If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed ... and we will deserve it"" is a genuine quote from Senator Graham that was originally posted to his official Twitter account on 3 May 2016. A screenshot of the tweet, which is still available on Graham's timeline as of this writing, can be seen below: This tweet was posted the day before Donald Trump became the Republican party's presumptive nominee for President of the United States on 4 May 2016. Prior to this date, Graham, who also ran for president but ended his campaign in December 2015 before the primaries, frequently voiced opinions critical of Donald Trump. For example, Graham repeatedly said that Trump was not qualified to be president and that his involvement in the election process was damaging to the Republican party: Graham struck a more conciliatory tone with Trump after the latter won the Republican party's nomination, and he eventually came out in support of Trump after the election. A number of news outlets, such as Politico , Mashable , New York magazine, the Washington Post , MSNBC , and the New York Times have noted Graham's transition from ""never-Trumper"" to Trump supporter. On 22 June 2018, the conservative Weekly Standard threw their two cents into the conversation: While most Republicans fell in line before the 2016 election, Lindsey Graham -- along with fellow senators Mike Lee, Ben Sasse, John McCain, and Rob Portman -- was a high-profile NeverTrumper on Election Day. ""My party has gone batshit crazy,"" Graham said in a February 2016 speech about Trump. Graham told Fox News that Trump is ""a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit to be president."" But sometime after the election, Graham became a neo-Trumper. ""You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the president some kind of kook,"" Graham said in November 2017. ""I intend to support him in 2020 without equivocation,"" Graham tells me now. What changed since 2016? A neoconservative, in Irving Kristol's famous formulation, was a liberal who'd been mugged by reality. Neo-Trumpers like Graham, then, are NeverTrumpers who were mugged by—what, exactly? Necessity? Expediency? Sean Hannity? To hear Graham tell it, policy is what changed his mind. ""He's on track to do big things,"" Graham says of the president. ""He built up the military. I campaigned on it. He got out of the Iran deal. I campaigned on it. He's destroying ISIL. I campaigned on it. He's restructuring the tax code and the way we do business. I campaigned on it. He's doing much of what I campaigned on, and I'm pleased."" Graham now speaks regularly with Trump and has become a close ally on matters ranging from North Korea to health care. What about the issues of temperament that in 2016 made Trump, in Graham's view, unfit to be president? Is there anything specific, I ask, that has convinced the senator that Trump isn't the ""kook"" Graham called him back then? ""One, I got to know him,"" Graham says. ""I've played golf with him. You know, play golf with somebody for three or four hours, you get to know them better. He's funny as hell. He's got a great sense of humor.

557b4cfe-951f-4d02-8889-e4d484f864bf,"On 26 October 2016, Donald Trump surrogate and former Charles in Charge actor Scott Baio took to Facebook to share some new ""discoveries"" he had unearthed about the Clinton family.  Chief among them was the claim that Chelsea Clinton had married the nephew of billionaire and philanthropist George Soros : Did you know???? Some Clinton connection I just discovered. So Chelsea is married to George SOROS nephew. Baio didn't provide any evidence that Marc Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton's husband, was related in any way to George Soros. The closest the actor came to connecting the two was when he said (falsely) that Clinton and Mezvinsky had been married at Soros' mansion. While this rumor has been circulating for several years, it is as untrue now as it always was. Chelsea Clinton and Marc Mezvinsky were married at Astor Courts on the old Astor estate Ferncliff Farm, a property that is not owned by George Soros. Furthermore, it's unclear where Baio ""discovered"" that Marc Mezvinsky was the nephew of George Soros, as this claim is demonstrably untrue. The billionaire had one brother, the late Paul Soros , who fathered two children , Peter and Jeffrey Soros. Therefore, George Soros has two nephews, Peter Soros and Jeffrey Soros, neither of whom employs the pseudonym 'Marc Mezvinsky' or is furtively married to Chelsea Clinton. Marc's father, Ed Mezvinsky, has one brother, Norton (who is not also George Soros' brother). Norton explicitly stated that he was Marc's ""only uncle"" after he did not receive an invitation to his nephew's wedding: The A-list roster of 500 guests for the Chelsea Clinton wedding didn't include a spot for her fiancé's lone uncle. A family feud blocked a disappointed Norton Mezvinsky from making the cut for the Saturday nuptials of his nephew, Marc, and the former First Daughter. ""I'm the senior male member of the family, and Marc's only uncle,"" Norton Mezvinsky told the Daily News Wednesday. ""I am not surprised, but extremely hurt I wasn't invited.""

eb293195-c906-4f4d-b722-b2ce108601c5,"""There's a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot."" Conspiracy theories have surrounded the death of President John F. Kennedy ever since he was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963. Central to nearly all those theories is the notion that Lee Harvey Oswald, who was judged to be a ""lone gunman"" by the Warren Commission, did not really act alone and in fact simply played the most visible role in a far-reaching conspiracy that may have included elements in the United States government itself. One bit of evidence regularly put forward in support of that notion is a statement Kennedy allegedly made seven days before he was killed. In it, he spoke of his intention to expose ""a plot to enslave every man, woman, and child"" in the country. The implication is that he was assassinated because the conspirators in that plot did not want it exposed. ﻿ Here is the statement in meme form, as shared on social media in 2018: But although variants of this quote have been making the Internet rounds for more than a decade, it does not appear in any of Kennedy's transcribed speeches or press conferences, nor in any books by or about the 35th president, nor in any academic or popular histories of the period. It doesn't even turn up in books devoted to JFK conspiracy theories published before the quote became commonplace on the Internet. The earliest example anyone has found to date appeared in the signature line of a message board user in a post dated 10 April 2004. That example featured slightly different wording from that of the later meme: ""There exists in this country a plot to enslave every man woman and child. Before I leave this high and noble office, I intend to expose this plot."" - President John F. Kennedy -- 7 days before he was assassinated. We looked especially closely at the two speeches Kennedy gave on 15 November 1963, exactly seven days before his assassination, for anything resembling the statement ""There's a plot in this country to enslave every man, woman and child."" The first , delivered at an AFL-CIO convention in New York, dwelt primarily on economic concerns and contained no mentions of a conspiracy to be quashed. The second , much shorter address he gave to the National Convention of the Catholic Youth Organization that day (also in New York City), made reference to an ""ideological gulf"" between democracy and its enemies (by which he presumably meant Communism), but again, Kennedy said nothing about a plot to enslave Americans. A search of our own message board archives uncovered an older, somewhat similar quote to """"There exists in this country a plot to enslave every man woman and child"" shared with Snopes.com a few weeks after the September 11 terrorist attacks in 2001: ""The high office of President has been used to foment a plot to destroy the American's freedom, and before I leave office I must inform the citizen of his plight."" -- John F. Kennedy at Columbia University, 10 days before his assassination There is also this slight variation, still circulating as of November 2018: If such a statement were made 10 days before the assassination, that would date it to 12 November 1963. However, according to an archived JFK Library post written in 2006, Kennedy did not speak at Columbia University on that or any other date in November 1963: Many references to this fictitious speech exist in assassination theorist material. Supposedly, the President was discussing changes in the Federal Reserve and the gold standard, and this topic was somehow linked to his assassination. Others also claim he said, ""The high office of President has been used to foment a plot to destroy American freedom, and before I leave office I must inform the citizen of his plight."" But the simple fact is that President John F. Kennedy did not speak at Columbia University in November of 1963. Those who believe in the ""fact"" of President Kennedy having made such a speech, either at Columbia or some other place, will simply deny this denial. At best, they will say that because ""all or most records"" have been destroyed, we simply don't know the truth; at worst, they will claim that there is a conspiracy to keep this issue silent. If someone chooses to believe in the existence of this speech, he or she does so as a matter of faith, which is fine, as long as that person realizes that it is religion and not history in which he or she is dealing. Conspiracy mongers often resort to the claim that evidence could have been covered up or purposely destroyed, but when the subject matter is an utterance of a President of the United States -- and especially one attended by controversy -- eradicating every trace of it from the historical record would be well-nigh impossible.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,941

a211d483-1f4e-48fd-96ff-1e1e9caa3967,"In June 2020, the Quaker Oats Company announced that it would be re-branding its Aunt Jemima line of products — syrup, pancake mix, and other breakfast foods — because the brand's origins were based on racial stereotypes. Kristin Kroepfl, vice president and chief marketing officer of Quaker Foods North America, told NBC News : ""We recognize Aunt Jemima's origins are based on a racial stereotype. While work has been done over the years to update the brand in a manner intended to be appropriate and respectful, we realize those changes are not enough."" This decision caused some online outrage as social media users accused Quaker Oats of erasing its history and diminishing the accomplishments of Nancy Green, the woman who portrayed Aunt Jemima in promotional materials in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Many of these posts claimed that Green was one of the first African American millionaires because of the amount of money she earned playing Aunt Jemima: But Green did not die a millionaire. In fact, she could not live off the earnings she made from her portrayal of Aunt Jemima, and continued to work as a housekeeper until a few years before her death in 1923. The Origins of Aunt Jemima The origins of Aunt Jemima can be traced back to 1889 when Chris Rutt and Charles Underwood created a self-rising pancake mix. The product originally carried the name ""self-rising pancake flour,"" but Rutt was inspired to change the name of the mix after he attended a minstrel show and saw men dressed in blackface perform a song entitled ""Old Aunt Jemima."" The Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture writes : In the fall of 1889, Rutt was inspired to rename the mix after attending a minstrel show, during which a popular song titled ""Old Aunt Jemima"" was performed by men in blackface, one of whom was dressed as a slave mammy of the plantation South. While Rutt and Underwood developed this self-rising mix and contributed the ""Aunt Jemima"" name, they were unable to turn their product into a commercial success. The duo sold their milling company to R.T. Davis, who, with Green's help, would go on to create the persona of Aunt Jemima and turn the brand into a national product. Green's World Fair Debut Davis hired Green, who was born a slave in Kentucky in 1834, to portray Aunt Jemima at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Green, as Aunt Jemima, served pancakes to the crowd and told romanticized ""stories"" of her time on the plantation. While these stories were presented as if they were the genuine memories of Aunt Jemima, Green was, of course, just playing a fictional character. In "" Mammy: A Century of Race, Gender, and Southern Memory ,"" author Kimberly Wallace-Sanders writes: At one point the most reliable means of consolidating the country involved inducing a kind of national amnesia about the history of slavery. Aunt Jemima was created to celebrate state-of-the-art technology through a pancake mix; she did not celebrate the promise of post-Emancipation progress for African Americans. Aunt Jemima's ""freedom"" was negated, or revoked, in this role because of the character's persona as a plantation slave, not a free black woman employed as a domestic. An African American woman, pretending to be a slave, was pivotal to the trademark's commercial achievement in 1893. Its success revolved around the fantasy of returning a black woman to a sanitized version of slavery. The Aunt Jemima character involved a regression of race relations, and her character helped usher in a prominent resurgence of the ""happy slave"" mythology of the antebellum South. [...] Nancy Green, a former slave from Kentucky, played the first Aunt Jemima. Green was a middle-aged woman living on the South Side of Chicago, working as a cook and housekeeper for a prominent judge. After a series of auditions, she was hired to cook and serve the new pancake recipe at the World's Fair. Part of her act was to tell stories from her own early slave life along with plantation tales written for her by a white southern sales representative. This combination of historic and mythic plantation was designed to perpetuate the ""historical amnesia necessary for confidence in the American future."" That this amnesia occurred at the expense of African American progress was clearly not an issue for the Pearl Milling Company, the inventor of Aunt Jemima. A pamphlet detailing the ""life"" of Aunt Jemima, which portrayed her as a ""happy"" slave with a ""secret recipe"" working at a plantation owned by Colonel Higbee of Louisiana, was also created for the 1893 World's Fair, and laid the foundation for future advertisements to build on the Aunt Jemima myth. One artifact from the early days of Aunt Jemima's fictional history was a set of paper dolls that supposedly showed Aunt Jemima and her family before and after they sold her secret pancake recipe. The ""before"" set included six paper dolls without shoes and dressed in shabby clothing, while the ""after"" set included a set of ""fancy"" clothes. But these dolls, like most of the fictional lore surrounding Aunt Jemima, did not accurately reflect reality. Was Green a Millionaire? We have been unable to find any specific details about how much Green was paid for her portrayal of Aunt Jemima. The evidence, however, suggests that Green did not become rich from her work and was likely paid a paltry sum. In "" Clinging to Mammy: The Faithful Slave in Twentieth-Century America ,"" Micki McElya writes that in 1900, Green listed her occupation as a ""cook."" While this may have referred to her job demonstrating pancake mix as Aunt Jemima, in 1910, she was working as a ""housekeeper."" In that year (1900) she listed her occupation as ""cook,"" which could have referred to her job demonstrating Aunt Jemima pancake mix or else indicated that her primary employment remained in domestic service. The latter was the case in 1910, when she reported her job as ""housekeeper"" in a private residence. Performing as the trademarked mammy was not her primary job by that time, if it ever had been. We reached out to McElya for more information about what monetary payments Green received for her portrayal of Aunt Jemima. McElya couldn't point to a specific dollar amount, but she did say that she ""found no evidence that Nancy Green died a millionaire in 1923,"" and that ""the available evidence suggests otherwise."" M.M. Manring, the author of ""Slave in A Box: The Strange Career of Aunt Jemima,"" also told us that ""all of the available evidence ... would suggest that [Nancy Green] was almost certainly not conspicuously wealthy."" Manring also addressed the notion that Green was given a ""lifetime contract"" to portray Aunt Jemima. This ""lifetime contract,"" according to Manring, was part of the lore created for the character of ""Aunt Jemima"" - but there's no evidence that it actually applied to Green. Manring said: I've been through the J. Walter Thompson archives at Duke, where so much of the papers related to the Aunt Jemima campaign are stored, and never found any reference to her pay. None of her obituaries mention anything regarding her wealth. If she had a $1 million fortune in, say, 1920, adjusted for inflation, that's the equivalent of about $13 million today, by my calculations. It would be surprising to me if all contemporaneous accounts of her failed to make any mention of her vast wealth. [...] All of the available evidence, such as it is, would suggest that she was almost certainly not conspicuously wealthy. She was comfortable enough to give to her church and do missionary work, but so were plenty of other people of ordinary means. As for the ""lifetime contract,"" that was a big part of the promotion of Aunt Jemima. You see the same language in the ads – that a milling company in Chicago brought Aunt Jemima north and gave her a lifetime contract, and even paid her in gold. I have never found nor to expect to find proof of a contract, and again, I can't prove a negative. But I do think you have to put that claim in context with a long-running ad campaign that mixed myth and reality, and people real and imagined. Obituaries for Green published in The Chicago Tribune and Daily Herald also made no mention of her being one of the first African American women to become a millionaire: https://www.newspapers.com/clip/53701027/ While no evidence exists to suggest that Green died a millionaire, she did make enough money (as both a housekeeper and for her promotional work as Aunt Jemina) to support the missionary work of the Olivet Baptist Church in Chicago. It should also be noted that Green's descendants (as well as the descendants of another Black woman who portrayed Aunt Jemima) filed a lawsuit against Quaker Oats, arguing that the company exploited Green, and that her family was owed billions in royalties, USA Today reported . The lawsuit was later dismissed after a judge ruled that the plaintiffs did not provide proof that they were related to the women who portrayed Aunt Jemima: Now, a lawsuit claims that Green's heirs as well as the descendants of other black women who appeared as Aunt Jemima deserve $2 billion and a share of future revenue from sales of the popular brand. The federal suit, filed in Chicago in August by two great-grandsons of Anna Short Harrington, says that she and Green were key in formulating the recipe for the nation's first self-rising pancake mix, and that Green came up with the idea of adding powdered milk for extra flavor. ""Aunt Jemima has become known as one of the most exploited and abused women in American history,"" said D.W. Hunter, one of Harrington's great-grandsons. The rumor that Green died a millionaire is, like much of the folklore surrounding Aunt Jemima, not supported by historical evidence. This claim is unfounded, and all of the material we examined suggests that Green was not conspicuously wealthy. Therefore, we've rated this rumor false. In February 2021, Quaker Oats announced that it was retiring the ""Aunt Jemima"" brand name and replacing it with the ""Pearl Milling Company.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1951
c1896bf3-fd49-4c47-acbe-59fa311f0738,"Back in 1971, Rep. Tom (not ""Tim"") Moore, Jr. of Waco, Texas — knowing that his fellow legislators in the Texas House of Representatives often passed bills and resolutions without fully reading or understanding them — pulled an April Fool's joke on the House by sponsoring a resolution commending Albert de Salvo for his unselfish service to ""his county, his state and his community."" That resolution read, in part: This compassionate gentleman's dedication and devotion to his work has enabled the weak and the lonely throughout the nation to achieve and maintain a new degree of concern for their future. He has been officially recognized by the state of Massachusetts for his noted activities and unconventional techniques involving population control and applied psychology. The joke, of course, was that Albert de Salvo was more commonly known as the Boston Strangler , assumed to be responsible for the murders of thirteen women in the Boston area between 1962 and 1964. (Technically, de Salvo was never convicted or put on trial for any of those killings — he was sentenced to life in prison for sexual assaults on several other women and confessed to the thirteen murders as well. He was stabbed to death in prison in 1973, and whether he actually committed the murders he confessed to has been a subject of controversy ever since.) As Rep. Moore expected, he saw his resolution passed unanimously; he then withdrew it and explained that he had offered the motion only to demonstrate a point. (A bit of sardonic humor offered at the time claimed that perhaps Moore was wrong: maybe the legislators had been paying attention.) Although we would hope our elected representatives would pay enough attention to their jobs not to pass resolutions commending murderers, that Moore's stunt succeeded wasn't necessarily as outrageous as it might seem. Federal and state legislators see a steady stream of resolutions that have no real legal impact and are offered mostly as public relations measures on behalf of one group or another. Poring over each and every one would take an inordinate amount of a legislator's time (especially in states like Texas where the legislature might be in session only relatively briefly and infrequently, creating a large number of bills and resolutions to be voted upon in a very short time). If a fellow legislator introduces a resolution to honor some favored person or group, you're expected to rubber stamp it as a gesture of good will — after all, you'll want him to return the favor when you need to boost your popularity with your constituents by extending similar honors to some of them.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,487
07a980c2-a6b5-4534-a6f2-3b7f080b46d8,"As mass shootings have become a disturbingly regular occurrence in the United States, so too have heated discussions about the weapon used in many of the worst incidents of the past decade, AR-15 firearms and their offshoots. Discussions about guns in America tend to be politically fraught, and so too is the terminology surrounding them. A frequent misconception about AR-15 firearms, for instance, is that the ""AR"" in the name stands for ""assault rifle."" It does not. AR stands for ArmaLite Rifle, reflecting the company name ( ArmaLite ) of the original manufacturer of the weapon. Although ArmaLite sold the design of the rifle to Colt in 1959, the term ""AR-15"" has persisted and acts as a catch-all for similar guns, even though various models with different manufacturers have different names. ArmaLite developed the weapon in the 1950s with the original intention that it would be used by the military but didn't have much success selling it before handing it off to Colt. As NPR reports , Colt had widespread success selling the automatic M-16 to the military, which troops used in Vietnam. Colt produced a semi-automatic, civilian version of that weapon and marketed it as the ""AR-15."" ""When Colt's patents for the AR-15 expired in the 1970s, other manufacturers began making similar models,"" NPR reported.

d2c2bf0d-cc15-44b3-98f2-874b0b6803db,"In November 2003, eight months after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Americans settling in for their own Thanksgiving celebrations were surprised by the news that President George W. Bush had made unannounced trip to Baghdad, secretly flying there from his ranch in Crawford, Texas, to spend his Thanksgiving holiday visiting U.S. troops stationed in Iraq. Example: [Collected via e-mail, December 2013] George Bush's surprise visit to Baghdad on Thanksgiving 2003. Is this a plastic turkey? Millions of Americans viewed images of President Bush like the one displayed above, showing him garbed in an Army workout jacket and carrying a platter bearing a nicely-cooked turkey surrounded by a bounty of trimmings as he chatted and joked with service members while they gathered about the chow line. What many Americans now recall about those images ten years later, however, is that what President Bush was carrying wasn't a real turkey — that it was a plastic imitation he crassly posed with to create a much-needed goodwill photo opportunity amidst the controversy of his decision to go to war in Iraq. Those recollections are wrong, though: The turkey on that platter was indeed an actual cooked bird, not one made of plastic or any other artificial material. The misremembering of President Bush's posing with a plastic turkey grew out of news reporting at the time of the event which noted that the although the bird on the platter was real, it was meant as a decorative piece only and was not actually served to or eaten by troops. At the time, there was some dispute over whether a White House report that a British Airways pilot had spotted Air Force One as it secretly made its way to Baghdad was genuine, or whether the tale was invented to associate President Bush's surprise trip with some publicity-generating suspense and danger. Washington Post reporter Mike Allen, who covered President Bush's surprise trip to Iraq, subsequently penned an article in which he invoked the ""show turkey"" doubts about the British Airways pilot tale and lingering controversy over the President's justification for going to war in Iraq to suggest that the White House had ""new credibility questions"": In the most widely published image from his Thanksgiving day trip to Baghdad, the beaming president is wearing an Army workout jacket and surrounded by soldiers as he cradles a huge platter laden with a golden-brown turkey. The bird is so perfect it looks as if it came from a food magazine, with bunches of grapes and other trimmings completing a Norman Rockwell image that evokes bounty and security in one of the most dangerous parts of the world. But as a small sign of the many ways the White House maximized the impact of the 2-1/2-hour stop at the Baghdad airport, administration officials said yesterday that Bush picked up a decoration, not a serving plate. The scene, which lasted just a few seconds, was not visible to a reporter who was there but was recorded by a pool photographer and described by officials yesterday in response to questions raised in Washington. Bush's standing rose in a poll conducted immediately after the trip. Administration officials said the presidential stop provided a morale boost that troops in Iraq are still talking about, and helped reassure Iraqis about U.S. intentions. Nevertheless, the foray has opened new credibility questions for a White House that has dealt with issues as small as who placed the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner aboard the aircraft carrier Bush used to proclaim the end of major combat operations in Iraq, and as major as assertions about Saddam Hussein's arsenal of unconventional weapons and his ability to threaten the United States. The White House has updated its account of an airborne conversation in which a British Airways pilot wondered into his radio if he had just seen Air Force One and was told that it was a Gulfstream 5, a much smaller plane. White House officials first said that the British Airways pilot had talked with the Air Force One pilot. Bush aides now say the conversation occurred between the British Airways pilot and an air traffic control worker. ""I don't think everybody was clear on exactly how that conversation happened,"" White House press secretary Scott McClellan said. British Airways said it has been unable to confirm the new version. ""We've looked into it,"" a spokeswoman said from London. ""It didn't happen."" Although Mike Allen did not state that the turkey carried by President Bush that day was plastic (or anything other than the real thing), his critical reporting on the President nonetheless created the impression that there was something ""fake"" about the event, an impression which was soon reflected in claims that the turkey itself had been a fake — a plastic, good-looking but inedible imitation of Thanksgiving's central image of bountiful, life-sustaining food. That impression has since been expressed in inaccurate assertions and false memories that President Bush was revealed to have been carrying a plastic turkey around a mess hall full of hungry soldiers on Thanksgiving. Even allowing that the turkey held by President Bush in press photographs was a decorative one and not one meant to be eaten by troops, criticizing the event (or at least that aspect of the event) as somehow being ""fake"" might still be considered overblown. As Allen also noted in his article, officials maintained the ""prop turkey"" was a regular Thanksgiving feature that had not been created for the President to show off during his visit: Officials said they did not know the turkey would be there or that Bush would pick it up. A contractor had roasted and primped the turkey to adorn the buffet line, while the 600 soldiers were served from cafeteria-style steam trays, the officials said. They said the bird was not placed there in anticipation of Bush's stealthy visit, and military sources said a trophy turkey is a standard feature of holiday chow lines. Brent Baker of the conservative Media Research Center also wrote at the time that: I don't know about you, but I realized the turkey was a display item the second I saw Bush holding it on TV with the turkey surrounded by perfectly arranged grapes. And later when Bush helped distribute food, he did so from behind a counter with steam trays, so it's not as if he somehow tried to pretend he was serving turkey from that [platter] to soldiers.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1184

As political pundits speculated that Oprah was eyeing a presidential run (host Seth Meyers even opened the show with an ""Oprah 2020"" joke), others claimed that her message was hypocritical, using a photograph purportedly showing her kissing Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein (who has been accused of sexual assault by several high-profile women) as proof : The photograph of Oprah kissing Harvey Weinstein is real, although it was taken several years before Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct was made public; it was taken at the 19th Annual Critics' Choice Movie Awards in January 2014 by photographer Kevin Mazur, and it is available here via Getty Images. Others took the criticism of Winfrey a step further, claiming that the photograph actually shows the famous television host nibbling or sucking on Weinstein's ear: The first rule of Anti-Sexual Assault Club is to not put a sexual assaulter's earlobe in your mouth at the head table. Am I the first person on planet Earth to blow up this picture? Ewww!! We compared this blown-up image with the photograph from Getty, and it does not appear to be doctored, but neither is it proof that his earlobe was actually in her mouth. The photograph, as best as we can tell, shows Oprah kissing Weinstein near his ear, not suckling it. We also examined contemporary reports on the 2014 Critics Choice Awards and couldn't find any mention of Winfrey and Weinstein engaging in inappropriate canoodling during the awards show, something that surely would have made the gossip pages if it had been true. However, even if this were true, it still would have been long before Weinstein was outed and ostracized as an alleged serial predator. Although Harvey Weinstein became the face of sexual harassment at the end of 2017, that was not the case in 2014. At that time, he was known mostly as a prolific producer who had worked with a number of well-respected actors and actresses. There certainly is much to be said about how an alleged predator was able to have a successful decades-long career (especially since this was apparently an "" open secret ""), but it is unclear whether Oprah knew about it at that time. What we do know, however, is that she called Weinstein's behavior ""hideous"" in an October 2017 statement : I've been processing the accounts of Harvey Weinstein's hideous behavior and haven't been able to find the words to articulate the magnitude of the situation. Filmmaker James Schamus captured so much of what I've been feeling when he said: ""This is the story of one predator and his many victims; but it is also a story about an overwhelming systemic enabling, and until that story is fully told we will fall far short of stopping future depredations on a similar scale."" https://w ww.hollywoodreporter.com/…/filmmaker-james-schamus-… Thanks to the brave voices we've heard this week, many more will now be emboldened to come forward EVERY time this happens. I believe a shift is coming. This is not the first time that Weinstein's behavior has been used to attempt to smear a celebrity retroactively.

ffedef44-b850-4d5b-9dce-847f4f6edfcf,"Fact Check One of the forms of political expression that frequently arrives in our inbox for verification is the ""evil plan"" warning, items which present the notion that some malevolent entity (ranging from Communists to Satan himself) not only expressed an intent to destroy our society from within, but outlined a specific plan for doing so. A quote attributed to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin that a reader emailed us in November 2011 exemplifies the genre: ""America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: its patriotism, its morality, and its spiritual life. If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within."" The specifics of these plans (no matter how long ago they may supposedly have been formulated) generally relate to current events, and the political purpose of circulating them is to make readers aware that trends which threaten the health of our society are currently in place (i.e., ""This is EXACTLY what is happening now!""), and to warn them that we must be vigilant about holding our course and stopping or reversing the encroachment of these socially unhealthful trends. This form has been expressed in such widely circulated items as Paul Harvey's "" If I Were the Devil "" essay, an (apocryphal) quotation by Karl Marx about the perils of consumer debt, and an (also apocryphal) warning from Abraham Lincoln about the accumulation of vast wealth in the hands of a few. The putative quotation from Stalin referenced above is another item of this genre, one which presents the concept that Communist enemies of the U.S. viewed patriotism, morality, and spirituality as America's greatest assets and cannily plotted that the U.S. could be made to collapse from within if these values were sufficiently undermined (and which, of course, serves as an admonition to American readers to be attentive in maintaining these values). Whatever level of truth one might find in this sentiment, however, it's highly unlikely that Stalin ever spoke these words. Proving a negative is often an uncertain proposition, but our reasons for believing this quotation to be of dubious origin are: We have found no presentation of this quotation that references a verifiable source for it. Nearly all reproductions of this quotation simply offer it as an undated, unsourced statement attributed to Stalin. Searching collections of Stalin's speeches, writings, interviews, and other statements (such as the Josef Stalin Internet Archive and the University of Pennsylvania's online library of Stalin documents ) fails to turn up any reference to this quotation. If Stalin had truly made this statement, we would expect to find references to it dating back to his lifetime. However, although Stalin died in 1953, the oldest expression of the ""healthy body"" quotation we've yet located is from 1983 (in a letter to the editor of the Lawrence Journal-World ). This statement doesn't really sound like something Stalin would have said, as its subtext is praise for the strengths of American patriotism, morality, and spiritual life. More likely Stalin would have offered some negative reasons (such as the supposedly deleterious effects of capitalism) to use in comparing the U.S. to an unhealthy body.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,598
0b604151-785b-4533-bd71-5729524af5eb,"Origin On Oct. 1, 2015, ten people (nine innocent victims plus the gunman) died in a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon. The incident marked the 294th mass shooting in 2015 alone and prompted yet another renewal of a national gun control debate in the U.S. Folks on both sides of that political debate would likely agree that the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 was a pivotal point in a perpetual American gun control controversy. Perhaps due to the unique horrors of that event, an unusually high number of conspiracy theories grew out of it: Some gun control advocates on social media later described the tragedy as proof positive Americans weren't interested in changing gun laws despite the exceptional pain inflicted by the incident, while some gun rights advocates asserted the events in Newtown were a government-sponsored false flag engineered to artificially justify a ""gun grab."" The latter camp wasn't much of a fringe movement — a key law enforcement figure of the Roseburg shooting, Sheriff John Hanlin , had shared Sandy Hook conspiracy material on his own Facebook wall prior to the Umpqua Community College shooting. The Sandy Hook shooting was somewhat of a watershed moment for Second Amendment ""truthers,"" and the conspiracies that sprang forth from it began coloring subsequent (and in some instances, prior) high-profile shootings or attacks on civilians in America. One of the common conspiracy themes that gained traction after the Newtown shooting involved "" crisis actors ,"" individuals who had (to that point) been primarily known to populate disaster drills. As the notion of gun grabbing conspiracies became more commonplace, the term was appropriated by folks who believed the faces of those grieving at (staged) shooting scenes or subsequent vigils were in fact paid government operatives assigned to fabricate the appearance of mourning. A common iteration of the rumor involved photographs taken at crime scenes or vigils in Newtown (Connecticut), Aurora (Colorado), Boston: After the 1 October 2015 shooting in Roseburg, the meme was altered to include what was purportedly yet another appearance by the ""same girl"" seen previously crying in photos from Aurora, Boston, and Sandy Hook. (Presumably, the high-level false flag planners didn't have access to social media and remained unaware their schemes had been unraveled and revealed months earlier): The same technology that enabled people to compile and spread the photo set shown above also allowed anyone interested in the rumor to quite quickly determine whether the ""same girl"" was indeed depicted in all four images included in the meme. The claim was bizarre partly because the individuals involved were not nameless, faceless mourners of whom no trace was found shortly after the respective tragedies. The largest of the images was also the most iconic and heartbreaking: the photograph (taken at Sandy Hook Elementary) that captured the moment during which Carlee Soto learned her sister Victoria Soto was among those killed. The image was not the only one available of Carlee Soto crying, but similar, easily discovered images didn't fit the meme: To the right of Soto in the photo collection (which in several iterations is inaccurately labeled as being from ""Boston"") is Amanda Medek . Medek's sister Micayla Medek was among the dead in the 20 July 2012 Aurora, Colorado, theater shooting, and the image of Medek sitting on steps was one of several captured of her that day: Photographs taken during happier times definitively show that Medek (at the far right) and Soto look nothing alike (save for the moments during which each respectively learned their sisters had been murdered): Pictured to the left of Soto is Emma McDonald , who (unlike Soto and Medek) appeared to be connected to the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings solely by her presence at a vigil for the victims. As such, McDonald's link to that tragedy was more fleeting (and photographs of her were harder to come by). The young woman shown at the bottom (after the Roseburg shooting) was identified as Jessica Vazquez , seen crying and hugging aunt Leticia Alcaraz . (Alcaraz's daughter Lucero Alcaraz was among the dead at Umpqua Community College): Following a mass shooting in San Bernardino on 2 December 2015 an iteration of the rumor held the ""same girl"" was again spotted amid news coverage of the event, albeit this time in a larger crowd shot: While all the young women seen in the photographs had long, brown hair (initially), that factor alone didn't make a strong case for a massive government conspiracy encompassing law enforcement agencies at several levels in multiple states (and eventually, multiple countries). In May 2017, the conspiracy theory popped up again after 22 people were killed in a bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. The ""same girl"" was purportedly photographed in Manchester but unlike the earlier photos, the depicted individual was blonde. She was not identified in the Reuters image, a caption for which indicated it was taken at a crisis center in Manchester City's Etihad Stadium: The similarities ended with hairstyles and grief-stricken expressions (and in the latter case, the depicted woman was not a brunette). Four of the six women depicted were identified by name at the time they were photographed (the fifth appeared to be a bystander, and the sixth unidentified) and none was transient to the tragedies with which they were associated or disappeared afterwards: Medek and Soto (relatives of victims in tragedies that were not exceptionally recent) went on to appear in multiple photographs and interviews about the respective incidents. In subsequent iterations in Paris and Manchester, the conspiracy broadened in scope to suggest the ""same girl"" was jetted around the globe to visit the scenes of attacks and shootings. Shortly after the Umpqua tragedy, Soto remarked that the continued use of the photograph seen above in the media exacerbated her pain tremendously, and all four of the women initially depicted were likely deeply distressed by the appropriation of their personal mourning for the purposes of advancing a conspiracy narrative.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1133
e0377bb7-9aa1-445e-b425-b082482a3519,"Fact Check Among the copious false claims about election fraud that U.S. President Donald Trump made after losing the 2020 presidential election to challenger Joe Biden was the assertion that the state of Pennsylvania had found they recorded ""205,000 votes more than they had voters"": The apparent source of the misinformation amplified by Trump was a news release issued by Pennsylvania State Rep. Frank Ryan on Dec. 28, maintaining that a comparison of ""county election results to the total number of voters who voted"" in Pennsylvania revealed a discrepancy of over 203,000 ballots: A comparison of official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3, 2020 as recorded by the Department of State shows that 6,962,607 total ballots were reported as being cast, while DoS/SURE system records indicate that only 6,760,230 total voters actually voted. Among the 6,962,607 total ballots cast, 6,931,060 total votes were counted in the presidential race, including all three candidates on the ballot and write-in candidates. The difference of 202,377 more votes cast than voters voting, together with the 31,547 over- and under-votes in the presidential race, adds up to an alarming discrepancy of 170,830 votes, which is more than twice the reported statewide difference between the two major candidates for President of the United States. However, the Pennsylvania Department of State (DoS) issued a statement noting that the numbers obtained from the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors (SURE) system by Ryan were not accurate because they were based on incomplete data. As the DoS observed, ""a few counties have not completed uploading their vote histories,"" and that those as-yet-unreported numbers ""would account for a significant number of voters"": In today’s release Rep. Ryan and others rehash, with the same lack of evidence and the same absence of supporting documentation, repeatedly debunked conspiracy theories regarding the November 3 election. State and federal judges have sifted through hundreds of pages of unsubstantiated and false allegations and found no evidence of fraud or illegal voting. Now, the legislators have given us another perfect example of the dangers of uninformed, lay analysis combined with a basic lack of election administration knowledge. For instance, it is quite common to have significant ""undervotes"" for down-ballot races in a presidential election, particularly when there isn't a U.S. Senate race on the ballot. In 2000, Sen. Santorum received 200,000 more votes than President Bush, but the US Senate race still had more than 100,000 fewer votes than the presidential race. We are unclear as to what data the legislators used for this most recent “analysis.” But the only way to determine the number of voters who voted in November from the SURE system is through the vote histories. At this time, there are still a few counties that have not completed uploading their vote histories to the SURE system. These counties, which include Philadelphia, Allegheny, Butler and Cambria, would account for a significant number of voters. The numbers certified by the counties, not the uploading of voter histories into the SURE system, determines the ultimate certification of an election by the secretary. This obvious misinformation put forth by Rep. Ryan and others is the hallmark of so many of the claims made about this year’s presidential election. When exposed to even the simplest examination, courts at every level have found these and similar conspiratorial claims to be wholly without basis. To put it simply, this so-called analysis was based on incomplete data. According to the final tally released by the DoS, a total of 6.96 million Pennsylvania voters actually voted in the 2020 election, amounting to 76.5% of registered voters.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,675
0980f8f0-f2d5-4683-8fcc-a99a99ad8b7b,"Origin The myth that a single volcanic eruption puts more CO 2 into the atmosphere than all of mankind to date, let alone 10,000 times more, is one of the most pervasive as well as one of the most demonstrably false climatological claims out there. It stems, ultimately, from a geologist named Ian Rutherford Plimer, infamous for writing a widely discredited book titled Heaven and Earth , which attempted to argue that humans have had an insignificant effect on global climate. In a 2009 editorial written for Australia’s ABC news, he echoed a sentiment he had argued with similar inelegance in his book by providing the following statement, widely spread nearly word-for-word in climate skeptic circles, without any supporting citation: ""Over the past 250 years, humans have added just one part of CO 2 in 10,000 to the atmosphere. One volcanic cough can do this in a day."" This brief statement — a mere 28 words — yields a remarkably dense buffet of spurious claims and outright falsehoods. It also is rife with ambiguity. What numbers is he actually comparing? What is a volcanic “cough”? From a fact-checking standpoint, there are no interpretations of Plimer’s second sentence that can produce a factual assertion. The only way to make the first sentence work is with a scientifically useless comparison. All other interpretations fall well short of reality. That useless comparison would be the total mass of carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere by human activity (roughly calculated here by taking the roughly 120 ppm rise in CO 2 since pre-industrial times converted into 936.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide gas) compared to the total mass of the entire atmosphere ( estimated to be around 5,100,000 gigatons). This yields roughly 1 part post-industrial CO2 rise in 10,000 parts of the entire atmosphere. As CO 2 , in total, makes up only about 0.06% by mass of the atmosphere and 0.04% by volume, this is not exactly revelatory. The question is not about how much other stuff is in the atmosphere. Rather, the question is about how much stuff humans are adding that wouldn't already be in the atmosphere, and, as a result, what the the potential for that amount would be to affect climate — a topic for which there is a wide scientific consensus. The erroneous interpretation that many have made from Plimer’s statement would be the assertion that the total amount of carbon released by humanity throughout all time (represented here as gigatons or petagrams of carbon, not carbon dioxide) represents only 1/10,000th (0.01%) of the total mass of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. These numbers do not check out, even when checked against collected data that ends in the year 2000, according calculations provided by the federally-funded Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center: According to Houghton and Hackler , land-use changes from 1850-2000 resulted in a net transfer of 154 PgC to the atmosphere. During that same period, 282 PgC were released by combustion of fossil fuels, and 5.5 additional PgC were released to the atmosphere from cement manufacture. This adds up to 154 + 282 + 5.5 = 441.5 PgC, of which 282/444.1 = 64% is due to fossil-fuel combustion. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations rose from 288 ppmv in 1850 to 369.5 ppmv in 2000, for an increase of 81.5 ppmv, or 174 PgC. In other words, about 40% (174/441.5) of the additional carbon has remained in the atmosphere, while the remaining 60% has been transferred to the oceans and terrestrial biosphere. The 369.5 ppmv of carbon in the atmosphere, in the form of CO2, translates into 787 PgC, of which 174 PgC has been added since 1850. From [...] above, we see that 64% of that 174 PgC, or 111 PgC, can be attributed to fossil-fuel combustion. This represents about 14% (111/787) of the carbon in the atmosphere in the form of CO2. A more scientifically valid approach, perhaps, would be to compare annual volcanic emissions fluxes to annual anthropogenic fluxes , as the carbon cycle is an ever-shifting network of sources and sinks of CO 2 that need to be accounted for. A 2013 review attempted to estimate the annual contribution of CO 2 emitted from all volcanoes (active and passive) and other tectonic sources on Earth per year, coming up with a figure of 540 megatons per year ( note that these measurements, unlike the ones above, represent the total mass of CO 2 not solely the carbon component): [CO2 from the plumes of actively erupting volcanoes]: Using the available data from plume measurements from 33 degassing volcanoes we determine a total CO2 flux of 59.7 Mt/yr. Extrapolating this to ~150 active volcanoes produces a total of 271 Mt/yr CO2. [CO2 passively vented by active volcanoes]: Extrapolation of the measured 6.4 Mt/yr of CO2 emitted from the flanks of 30 historically active volcanoes to all 550 historically active volcanoes produces a global emission rate of 117 Mt/yr. [CO2 from other volcanic sources]: Perez et al. (2011) calculated the global emission from volcanic lakes to be 94 Mt/yr CO2. The sum of these fluxes produces an updated estimate of the global subaerial volcanic CO2 flux of 474 Mt/yr. Emissions from tectonic, hydrothermal and inactive volcanic areas contribute a further 66 Mt/yr to this total [...], producing a total subaerial volcanic emission of 540 Mt/yr. While the authors of this study note that this is an exceedingly rough estimate, they also point out that it is orders of magnitude lower than estimates of the annual flux of CO 2 added to the atmosphere through human activity, currently estimated to be around 35,000 Mt/year: The global subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr. Once again, the actual numbers bear no resemblance to Plimer’s claims. It would have to be a pretty heavy volcanic “cough” from a “single volcano” to, by itself, increase Earth’s annual volcanic CO 2 flux by a factor of 65. Absurdity notwithstanding, numerous online claims reference specific volcanic eruptions purported to have added more than the total emission of anthropogenic carbon ever released (a value, estimated above, to be more than 282 Gt of carbon). The most commonly cited are the 15 June 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo and the 18 May 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens. According to the United States Geological Survey ( USGS ), Mount St. Helens released 0.01 Gt to the atmosphere and Mount Pinatubo released 0.05 Gt. Put another way: There is no question that very large volcanic eruptions can inject significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens vented approximately 10 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere in only 9 hours. However, it currently takes humanity only 2.5 hours to put out the same amount. While large explosive eruptions like this are rare and only occur globally every 10 years or so, humanity's emissions are ceaseless and increasing every year. A more accurate rendering of Plimer's claim would be something like “3500 Mount St Helens-scale volcanic 'coughs' in a single day might be able to produce as much CO 2 as humans have added to the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels to date.” Such a headline would be unlikely to have the same effect as the original one, however.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1393

One of his soliders asked how? Hitler replied, “The day mankind finds out what I was trying to defend this nation, Germany, from then thats the day World War 3 will start. For on that day, mankind will learn that I was trying to save my Nation from The Free Masons, the Illuminati, the jews. For if the Americans wins the war, then they will conquer the world and forever be a slave to the jews and they will try to conquer God. Do you know who America has in its posession? “NO,” the solider replied. The Americans has the jewels of God. The Americans have stolen God’s precious jewels. “What do you mean his precious jewels?” THE SOLIDER asked. Hitler said, “America has stolen the jews. The Jews of God. His jewelry. The negros. They are the true hebrews. What a foolish move and a direct challenge to God. And they plan on moving these false white jews into a state of Israel. America is desperate in its attempt to win this war using atom bombs on Japan. America will destroy the whole world in its attempt to conquer it. When America and its jewish slave masters conquer the world and the world realize I was right, then all nations will begin a third world war to dethrone America of its rule. Every nation will soon possess atom bombs of their own. It will be the end of most of the world as we know it. “Why will the jews control America?” the solider asked Hitler said, “because the white jews knows that the negros are the real children of Israel. And to keep Americas secret, the jews will blackmail America. The jews will extort America Their plan for world domination wont work if the negros knew who they were. The white citizens of America will be terrified to know that all this time they’ve been mistreating and discriminating and lynching the childen of Israel. They will fear God will destroy them as he destroyed Egypt for doing the same thing. So the elite, the Illuminati keeps this a secret at all cost. After I die, I will one day cause World War 3 just by this message which will be like planting a seed in people minds until it sprouts once they nurture that seed and seek more truth and learn Hitler was right. I did the world a favor by killing the false jews before they designated a false state of Israel. But I fear I have failed. The world will fall into the hands of Satan. Although the clickbait site provided no citation for when Hitler allegedly made these statements, commenters on the page directed those curious about the quote's authenticity to the book The Nazis World War II by Robert Edwin Herstein. Other dubious sites immediately picked up on this claim and uncritically re-shared the completely bogus Adolf Hitler quote along with its alleged source — clearly without doing even the barest minimum of research, such as opening the book in which the quote supposedly appears. Needless to say,, this passage does not appear in Herzstein's book. We could not find this passage in either the digital copy available via Google Books, nor the hard copy we examined. Page 132 of Herzstein's book The Nazis features a photograph of Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and others watching a propaganda film, a description of what this film depicted, as well as a few stills from the production: The page, like the rest of the book, does not contain an argument suggesting that Adolf Hitler was not racist (given his actions in the historical record, a case for his lack of prejudice would be difficult to make indeed) or that he was kind toward black people. (The hoax quote also appears to miss that racism can exist toward different ethnic groups.) Instead, it describes a propaganda film that linked Jewish people to other groups — including black people: Goebbels and Hitler personally appraise a new German movie. When the Fuhrer complained that the films espousing the Nazi line were too scarce, Goebbels rushed a pair of anti-semitic pictures into production. In one segment of a Nazi ""Instructional"" film (right), the genetic heritage of the Jew is purportedly traced to Oriental, Negro, Near Asian and Hamitic peoples. Hence, the film concludes, ""the Jew is a bastard."" Below, the villainous title character of Jud Suss, a violently anti-Semitic melodrama, spins chemes with his crony, Rabbi Loew. MOVIES HINTING AT HORRORS TO COME To Joseph Goebbels, films were ""one of the most modern and scientific means of influencing the masses"" Though the German film industry remained largely in private hands, every movie needed the imprimatur of the Propaganda Ministry before it reached the screen, and Goebbels became notorious for meddling with scripts, directors, and actors. In 1938, he set movie studios to work producing anti-Jewish films. In addition, a special team was assembled at the ministry itself to undertake a project called The Eternal Jew. The result, a virulent 45-minute harangue billed as a documentary, was shown to audiences throughout Europe. The film featured a lingering look at kosher animal slaughter, imputing sadism and bloodthirstiness to the ""Jewish race."" Jews were likened to rats and other vermin: ""They carry disease,"" warned the narration. Such films, which depicted the Jews as a plague to be eradicated, hinted darkly at the real-life horrors to come. The propaganda film described in this book attempted to trace Jewish ancestry to other groups of people, most likely to demonize other cultures outside of the Aryan race — not to absolve any groups or make anti-racist arguments. An article published by the United States Holocaust Museum explained that although black people were not targeted in the same way as Jews, they were still persecuted, and Germany produced propaganda that painted black soldiers as chronic rapists and a threat to the ""purity"" of the German race: The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder. However, there was no systematic program for their elimination as there was for Jews and other groups. [...] Following World War I and the Treaty of Versailles (1919), the victorious Allies occupied the Rhineland in western Germany. The use of French colonial troops, some of whom were black, in these occupation forces exacerbated anti-black racism in Germany. Racist propaganda against black soldiers depicted them as rapists of German women and carriers of venereal and other diseases. The children of black soldiers and German women were called “Rhineland Bastards.” The Nazis, at the time a small political movement, viewed them as a threat to the purity of the Germanic race. In Mein Kampf (My Struggle), Hitler charged that “the Jews had brought the Negroes into the Rhineland with the clear aim of ruining the hated white race by the necessarily-resulting bastardization.” The rumor that Adolf Hitler said that World War III would begin when the United States realized that black people were the ""true Hebrews"" originated in an unsourced article published by a disreputable web site, and which appears to loosely string together an entire ecosystem of impossibly farfetched and completely unsourced conspiracy theories. Although the quote in the meme was attributed to a legitimate publication, the briefest and most cursory research shows that it appears nowhere in the book cited.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1524
61a8bdec-1400-4117-a94f-3af02feecadc,"Origin On 22 August 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted criticism of the South African government for their plans to redistribute land to black South Africans who were institutionally disenfranchised under that country's apartheid system: I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. “South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers.” @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2018 The ""large scale killings"" phrase included in Trump's tweet was an invocation of ""white genocide,"" a conspiracy theory popular among white supremacists who have for years been attempting to advance the baseless claim that white South African farmers are being systematically murdered en masse . The ""white genocide"" conspiracy theory is sometimes referred to as the ""Great Replacement Theory,"" as the Anti-Defamation League pointed out . It is an idea that until now has existed mainly on the fringes, fostered by proponents including white nationalist and former Klansman David Duke -- who jubilantly responded to Trump's tweet: Russia has already agreed to take in 15,000 White South Africans—your move, Mr. President. Thank you! https://t.co/gpBaU0fdhr — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) August 23, 2018 ""What particularly pleased [white supremacists like Duke] was the notion that if Trump said it, lots of conservatives would start to believe it, whereas they themselves have been having trouble getting widespread support for this notion,"" said Mark Pitcavage, senior research fellow for the ADL. Sure enough, white supremacist Richard Spencer also tweeted his support for Trump's ""opening up"" the conversation about ""the plight of White South Africans"": That said, opening up space to talk about White South Africans--giving his base the permission to seriously discuss White dispossession--is a monumental achievement. — Richard ? Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) August 23, 2018 The ""white genocide"" claim started gaining popularity among fringe groups around 2012, according to research conducted by the ADL, who released a statement characterizing Trump's tweet as ""disturbing"": White supremacists in the United States have made such claims for years. In early 2012, ADL’s Center on Extremism documented how white supremacists in the United States were gearing up for protests as part of something they termed the “South Africa Project (SAP).” The goal of the organizers, which included representatives from major neo-Nazi, racist skinhead, ""traditional white supremacist,"" Christian Identity groups, as well as racist prison gangs, was to stop the alleged ‘genocide of Whites’ in South Africa. The protests originated in 2011 at the hands of Monica Stone, a long-time member of the Louisiana-based white supremacist Christian Defense League and immigrant from South Africa. Since then, white supremacist references to “genocide” in South Africa have been common. Richard Spencer, for example, focused on the plight of the “Boers” [white settlers] in South Africa in his March speech at Michigan State University, suggesting the United States might see something similar. That's not to say that farm attacks and farm killings do not happen in South Africa — they do, every year. But Pitcavage pointed out that although such events are tragic and reprehensible, they have been spun into a twisted story that proponents imagine to be representative of what's in store for whites in the United States, Pitcavage said: Don’t get me wrong, any death like that shouldn’t happen, but it’s part of the endemic problem South Africa has with violent crime with victims of all races in all of their cities. But white supremacists are not much for accurate context. They started taking these incidents and essentially built out these anecdotes into a dark fantasy of ongoing white genocide and they use that phrase over and over in South Africa. Their twisted vision is South Africa is the canary in the coal mine. Despite President Trump's directive to Secretary of State Pompeo, no evidence documents an epidemic of murders targeting white South African farmers because of their race. The number of farm murders in South Africa hit a 30-year low point in 2017-18, according to a report released by the South African Agricultural Industry (AgriSA) that cited South African police data. Overall, farm attacks have also been on a general decline after spiking in 2001-02 at 1,069, although since hitting a low point in 2013-14 that figure has been on the rise. (Recorded incidents include ""murder, rape, robbery and causing bodily harm"" and also ""all violence aimed at destroying farm infrastructure and property with a view to disrupting legitimate farming activities,"" according to AgriSA.) The AgriSA report did not account for the race of perpetrators or victims, and independent fact checking organization Africa Check reported that South African police don't track crime statistics by race. Some 19,016 killings were recorded in South Africa between April 2016 to March 2017, an increase over the previous year's number. The most hideous cases of farm murders have, of course, drawn the most media scrutiny. Writing for the publication Quartz Africa , journalist Lynsey Chutel noted that the seclusion and perceived wealth of the farms could explain why their owners are targeted, although she noted that the brutality of some of the crimes may be attributed to racial animosity: Isolated and believed to be wealthy, South African farmers have historically been the targets of attacks in South Africa. In some cases the attacks and murders have been so brutal that many believe there is an element of race-based vengeance for apartheid. White farmers’ vulnerability has increased along with the rest of the country as South Africa struggles to contain crime, especially violent crime. Kobus Visser, director of AgriSA's Rural Safety and General Affairs Chamber, also observed that: National crime statistics of the previous year show that murders in South Africa have increased for the fifth consecutive year, while robbery with aggravating circumstances, including home and business burglaries and vehicle hijackings, has also increased. The latter three, known as trio-crimes, are probably the most feared by the public and to which the farming community is exposed on an ongoing basis. The same trend was also observed with the increase in farm attacks during the past two financial years. People who live on farms in rural areas are particularly vulnerable to armed farm attacks where response times are lengthy because of the remoteness of farms. This offers the attackers an opportunity to linger on the premises for longer, with a greater chance of the victim being subjected to a high degree of violence and brutality, compared to crimes in urban areas where the police, security companies and neighbours arrive sooner to render assistance. President Trump's remark appeared to have been inspired by a 22 August 2018 Fox News segment in which Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson blasted a controversial initiative by the South African government to redistribute land, the vast majority of which is owned by a small white minority as a holdover of racial inequality standards that existed under apartheid. Although Carlson did not address the ""large scale killing"" of farmers in that segment, he did discuss it in May with a guest from the South African white minority lobbying group AfriForum. ""Tucker Carlson is incredibly popular among white nationalists because the rhetoric and subjects of discussion on his program frequently reflect the conversations happening in the white nationalist movement,"" Jared Holt, a researcher for Right Wing Watch, told us in an email, adding: Conspiracy theories about “white genocide” are harmful because the people that believe them become convinced that non-white people, particularly black people and immigrants from majority-Muslim countries, are to be seen as enemies on the sole basis of their race. We have also seen “white genocide” conspiracy theories inspire their believers to radical violence.

02b31b05-3c2b-4083-9b05-d38f74c44fe2,"In 1996, columnist Thomas Friedman came up with what is known as the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention , the notion that no two countries with McDonald's franchises have ever gone to war with each other. People in McDonald's countries, he said, ""don't like to fight wars. They like to wait in line for burgers,"" and ""countries with middle classes large enough to sustain a McDonald's have reached a level of prosperity and global integration that makes warmongering risky and unpalatable to its people."" Although Friedman's idea was somewhat tongue-in-cheek and not necessarily meant to be taken literally and absolutely, it does not seem to have held true in all cases. Some may disagree over which armed conflicts truly constitute ""wars,"" but a look to the Balkans disproves the McDonald's theory. The first McDonald’s in what was then Yugoslavia opened up to much fanfare on 24 March 1988 in Belgrade, now the capital of Serbia: Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack today as McDonald's opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches. I just wanted to taste genuine American hamburgers,"" said Milica Nikolic, a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first Big Mac. People curiously examined the renovated restaurant's plush interior and the back-lit signs depicting the hamburgers, french fries, milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the West. It also featured amber-colored tables and floors, pastel-colored upholstery, modern art paintings and discreet illumination. As tensions mounted between different national and ethnic groups within Yugoslav society, the existence of a McDonald’s was actually a point of conflict within the fracturing federation: As the franchise spread throughout Eastern Europe, having a McDonald’s became a source of national pride. Some of the earliest manifestations of the mounting tensions between Croatia and Serbia were evident in songs about McDonald’s [which] Serbs sang at football matches. Some late-1980s chats went “we have a McDonald’s, McDonald’s, McDonald’s, we have a McDonald’s, and where is yours?” A series of bloody conflicts in the 1990s resulted in the piecemeal dissolution of Yugoslavia and led to the Kosovo War , which was waged between February 1998 and June 1999 and pitted the forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (an entity comprising Montenegro and Serbia) against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) rebel group, the latter supported by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the air and the Albanian army on the ground. It was the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose capital was Belgrade, that U.S.-led NATO forces bombed during the Kosovo War between 24 March 1999 and 10 June 1999. Several McDonald’s-containing countries, including the United States, participated in this campaign, which can accurately be described as pitting several McDonald’s countries against the McDonald’s-containing country known then as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: All nineteen NATO countries [contributed] to Operation Allied Force. The countries include[d] Belgium, Canada, Czech Rep, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. In fact, a Belgrade McDonald's was used as a bomb shelter during those air strikes, which were dubbed Operation Allied Forces by the United States military: Despite Belgrade’s early euphoria about the arrival of their own McDonald’s, a decade later, some of the city’s hooligans demonstrated their anger with American foreign policy by attacking the franchise. During the first days of the 1999 NATO bombing campaign, McDonald’s main store was attacked and badly damaged by an angry mob. Franchise owners responded by producing posters and lapel buttons showing the golden arches topped with a traditional Serbian cap called the sajkaca. They also converted the lower-floor seating area of one McDonald’s restaurant into a bomb shelter. Several other examples of military conflicts between McDonald's-containing countries could be proffered as exceptions to the Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention, including the following: The 1989 U.S. invasion of Panama , during which U.S. military forces battled Panamanian Defense Forces in a successful attempt to oust and arrest Panamanian military dictator Manuel Noriega. The 1999 Kargil War , during which India and Pakistan clashed over Kashmir. The 2008 Georgian War during which independent Republic of Georgia (formerly a republic of the USSR) fought with Russia and Russian-backed separatists in the regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

4cfe3940-f88d-4b8c-a1af-3d90cd072759,"In January 2019, as political tensions rose over funding for President Donald Trump's proposed border wall, reports emerged that an undocumented immigrant had been responsible for four killings in Nevada. On Jan. 21, 2021, President Trump himself tweeted that ""Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country,"" and used the case in support of his argument for the enhanced security infrastructure along the southern border, adding ""We need a powerful Wall!"": Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2019 President Trump and some of his supporters have consistently talked up the supposed risk to public safety from immigration across the southern U.S. border. However, studies have repeatedly shown that undocumented immigrants actually commit crimes, including violent crimes, at a lower rate than native-born U.S. citizens, as we have outlined in greater detail previously. The day after Trump's tweet, the conservative ""Constitution Club"" Facebook page posted a widely-shared meme featuring a photograph of an elderly Nevada couple alleged to have been killed by the ""illegal immigrant"" in question: ""REST IN PEACE: Gerold [sic] (81) and Sharon David (80), shot and killed by an illegal immigrant during a home invasion/robbery in Reno on 1/10/19."" In October 2021, nearly three years after this fact check was originally published, Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman pleaded guilty to several charges, including the murders of Gerald and Sharon David, just as the meme claimed. Federal immigration officials confirmed for Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an unauthorized immigrant in the United States. As a result, we have changed the rating on this fact check from ""Unproven"" to ""True."" Background On Jan. 19, 2019, the Carson City Sheriff's Office arrested Wilber Ernesto Martinez-Guzman, a citizen of El Salvador, in connection with a series of burglaries and homicides in Washoe and Douglas Counties in January 2019. Initial police statements described the suspect as being 19 years old, but Carson City Sheriff's Office records list his age as 20. Martinez-Guzman was suspected of being responsible for the shooting deaths of 56-year-old Connie Koontz on Jan. 10, 2019, 74-year-old Sophia Renken on Jan. 13, and Gerald David (81) and his wife Sharon David (80) on Jan. 16. A spokesperson for the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) confirmed to Snopes that Martinez-Guzman is an undocumented immigrant, writing in an email to us that: ""Mr. Martinez-Guzman is a citizen of El Salvador who entered the United States unlawfully on an unknown date and location. He has no prior criminal or immigration history. ICE has lodged a detainer."" ICE files a detainer request with a local law enforcement agency when they have reason to believe that an individual is eligible to be deported from the United States, and ICE formally asks that agency to notify ICE in advance of the individual's release from custody (for example, after serving a prison sentence) so that ICE can then immediately take the person into custody and begin the deportation process. Martinez-Guzman was initially charged in Carson City with burglary and possession of stolen property in relation to his alleged actions at the David household in South Reno, as well as immigration offences. At the time this fact check was originally published, in January 2019, he had not been charged with murder, but local law enforcement officials said they were ""confident [they] have evidence that will link him to all four homicides."" On Jan. 24, 2019, the Carson City District Attorney added several additional charges. According to KOLO-TV , those new charges included: 12 new counts of possession of a stolen firearm, including rifles, shotguns and one handgun belonging to Gerald and Sharon David. Two counts possession of stolen property – an Apple watch belonging to Connie Koontz, plus golf club and tools belonging to another Carson City burglary victim. Twelve counts of prohibited person in possession of a firearm. Two misdemeanor counts of possession of stolen property, rings belonging to Connie Koontz. Three misdemeanor counts of obtaining money under false pretenses for the sale of two rings belonging to Connie Koontz, one belonging to Gerald David. On Oct. 21, 2021, after a series of delays, Martinez-Guzman pleaded guilty to several charges against him in Washoe County, Nevada, including the murders of Gerald and Sharon David. In return, prosecutors there have agreed not to request the death penalty at sentencing, but instead will ask the court to hand down a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The Washoe County District Attorney's office provided Snopes with a copy of the guilty plea memo signed by Martinez-Guzman. In it, he agreed to plead guilty to six felonies including burglary and first degree murder, and also committed to pleading guilty to similar crimes in Douglas County, where he is being prosecuted for the shooting deaths of Koontz and Renken. If Martinez-Guzman fails to also plead guilty to the murders of Koontz and Renken in Douglas County, under the terms of his plea agreement he would once again leave himself open to the death penalty in both jurisdictions.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1022
21e23539-09fa-46a1-989c-b9f93b5c8e75,"This piece about Congressional pensions and Social Security contributions has been circulating in various forms since at least April 2000: [Collected via e-mail, 2003] 2004 Election Issue !! GET A BILL STARTED TO PLACE ALL POLITICIANS ON SOC. SEC. This must be an issue in ""2004."" Please! Keep it going. SOCIAL SECURITY: (This is worth reading. It is short and to the point.) Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions during election years. Our Senators and Congresswomen do not pay into Social Security and, of course, they do not collect from it. You see, Social Security benefits were not suitable for persons of their rare elevation in society. They felt they should have a special plan for themselves. So, many years ago they voted in their own benefit plan. In more recent years, no congressperson has felt the need to change it. After all, it is a great plan. For all practical purposes their plan works like this: When they retire, they continue to draw the same pay until they die. Except it may increase from time to time for cost of living adjustments. For example, former Senator Byrd and Congressman White and their wives may expect to draw $7,800,000.00 (that's Seven Million, Eight-Hundred Thousand Dollars), with their wives drawing $275,000.00 during the last years of their lives. This is calculated on an average life span for each of those two Dignitaries. Younger Dignitaries who retire at an early age, will receive much more during the rest of their lives. Their cost for this excellent plan is $0.00. NADA.... ZILCH.... This little perk they voted for themselves is free to them. You and I pick up the tab for this plan. The funds for this fine retirement plan come directly from the General Funds; ""OUR TAX DOLLARS AT WORK""! From our own Social Security Plan, which you and I pay (or have paid) into, — every payday until we retire (which amount is matched by our employer) — we can expect to get an average of $1,000 per month after retirement. Or, in other words, we would have to collect our average of $1,000 monthly benefits for 68 years and one (1) month to equal Senator Bill Bradley's benefits! Social Security could be very good if only one small change were made. That change would be to jerk the Golden Fleece Retirement Plan from under the Senators and Congressmen. Put them into the Social Security plan with the rest of us ... then sit back and watch how fast they would fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe good changes will evolve. How many people can YOU send this to? Keep this going clear up thru the 2004 election!! We need to be heard [Collected via e-mail, 2002] Hillary for President- NOT! Just yesterday I saw her on the senate floor speaking against the high salaries of company CEO's..... Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a New York State Senator, now comes under this fancy ""Congressional Retirement and Staffing Plan,"" which means that even if she never gets reelected, she STILL receives her Congressional salary until she dies. If Bill outlives her, he then inherits HER salary until HE dies. He is already getting his Presidential salary until he dies. If Hillary outlives Bill, she also gets HIS salary until she dies. Guess who pays for that? WE DO! It's common knowledge that in order for her to establish NY residency, they purchased a million dollar-plus house in upscale Chappaqua, New York. Makes sense. They are entitled to Secret Service protection for life. Still makes sense. Here is where it becomes interesting. Their mortgage payments hover at around $10,000 per month. BUT, an extra residence HAD to be built within the acreage to house the Secret Service agents. The Clintons charge the Federal government $10,000 monthly rent for the use of that extra residence, which is just about equal to their mortgage payment. This means that we, the taxpayers, are paying the Clinton's salary, mortgage, transportation, safety and security, as well as the salaries for their 12 man staff - and this is all perfectly legal! When she runs for President, will you vote for her? [Collected via e-mail, 2000] Something to think about. So that those who don't know, may. Our Senators and Congressmen don't pay in to Social Security, and, of course, they don't collect from it. The reason is that they have a special retirement plan that they voted for themselves many years ago. For all practical purposes, it works like this: When they retire, they continue to draw their same pay, until they die, except that it may be increased from time to time, by cost of living adjustments. For instance, former Senator Bradley, and his wife, may be expected to draw $7,900,000, with Mrs. Bradley drawing $275,000 during the last year of her life. This is calculated on an average life span for each. This would be well and good, except that they paid nothing in on any kind of retirement, and neither does any other Senator or Congressman. This fine retirement comes right out of the General Fund: our tax money. While we who pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security. Imagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so desirable that people would have extra pay deducted so that they could increase their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that works so well, that Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who aren't in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security could be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the Golden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen, and put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast they fix it. If enough people receive this, maybe one or some of them along the way, might be able to help. How many can YOU send it to? Nothing is worth more than this day (In May 2001 someone combined the ""Congressmen don't pay into Social Security"" alerts with an existing screed about the Clintons' charging the Secret Service rent .) Virtually all of it is outdated, inaccurate, or misleading: It is not true that Congressmen do not pay into the Social Security fund. Since 1984 they have been required to pay into Social Security just as most everyone else does. (A few odd exceptions to the Social Security program still exist, both inside and outside of government, but not for members of Congress.) It was true prior to 1984 that Congressmen did not pay into the Social Security fund because they participated in a separate program for civil servants (the Civil Service Retirement System, or CSRS), but that program was closed to government employees hired after 1983 : In 1983, Public Law 98-21 required Social Security coverage for federal civilian employees first hired after 1983 and closed the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to new federal employees and Members of Congress. All incumbent Members of Congress were required to be covered by Social Security, regardless of when they entered Congress. Members who had participated in CSRS before 1984 could elect to stay in that plan in addition to being covered by Social Security or elect coverage under an 'offset plan' that integrates CSRS and Social Security. Under the CSRS Offset Plan, an individual's contributions to CSRS and their pension benefits from that plan are reduced ('offset') by the amount of their contributions to, and benefits from, Social Security. It is not true that Congressmen ""continue to draw their same pay, until they die."" The size of their pensions is determined by a number of factors (primarily length of service, but also factors such as when they joined Congress, their age at retirement, their salary, and the pension options they chose when they enrolled in the retirement system) and by law cannot exceed 80% of their salary at the time of their retirement. It is not true that Congressmen ""paid nothing in on any kind of retirement,"" and that their pension money ""comes right out of the General Fund."" Whether members of Congress participate in the older Civil Service Retirement System or the newer Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS), their pensions are funded through a combination of general tax provisions and contributions from the participants. Members of Congress in the FERS plan must pay 6.2% of their salaries (up to the Social Security wage base of $106,800) into Social Security, as well as 1.3% of their full salary into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. It is true that, if current pension levels and cost-of-living adjustments (COLA) for Congress members continue to apply in the future, some former members of Congress could conceivably collect millions of dollars in annuities over the course of their lifetimes. However, the huge dollar amounts bandied about in e-mails like the ones quoted above are based upon extreme cases: those of politicians who entered Congress at relatively early ages, served for several decades, and retired while still young enough to potentially live for another several decades. These cases are the rare exceptions, based upon the hypothetical assumption that a few long-serving members of Congress who retired while in their mid-50s would live well past the age of 80. (Even the person who collects a modest salary/pension of $40,000 per year stands to take in a million dollars over the course of 25 years.) As of 2007, the average annuities for retired members of Congress were $63,696 for those who retired under CSRS and $36,732 for those who retired under FERS. Those figures are quite good (about ""2-3 times more generous than what a similarly-salaried executive could expect to receive upon retiring from the private sector,"" according to the National Taxpayers Union), but not quite the lavish endowments these e-mails make them out to be.

4f3c2a29-6b5f-4121-9e26-29a70b4f79ce,"First lady Melania Trump unveiled a newly renovated White House Rose Garden on Aug. 22, 2020, posting images to Twitter of a neatly manicured space. The news sparked a backlash among those unhappy with the new design. People shared their opinion about the renovation on social media, alongside images showing the garden before and after the renovation. The ""before"" images were more colorful, showing spring flowers and crab apple trees in bloom. The ""after"" images featured more green with white and pastel blooms, and the crab apple trees were gone. The images prompted some people on social media to express passionate opinions about the garden's appearance. Some claimed Trump had "" ruined "" what amounted to a national legacy, and others expressed that they liked the new look. The hubbub over the Rose Garden renovation prompted Snopes readers to write in and ask about resulting internet rumors, namely that Trump had "" ruined "" the garden by ripping out trees planted by former first ladies. ""Did Melania Trump dig up all the roses in the White House rose garden and have the trees planted by Kennedy’s removed?"" one reader asked. Other readers asked about social media posts claiming that Melania Trump had dug up historic rose bushes planted by every first lady since 1913. Here is an example of one such meme posted to Facebook: Both of these claims were misleading. It's true that the garden designed and planted during the Kennedy administration contained crab apple trees. But the trees removed in the renovation unveiled in August 2020 were not the same trees as the ones originally planted in the garden. And it's not true that the garden contained roses planted by every first lady since 1913. Landscape historian Marta McDowell, author of ""All the Presidents' Gardens,"" told us in a phone interview that the crab apple trees have been replaced three times since the original planting in the 1960s, and the tree type changed from one called Katherine to another called Spring Snow. Although the trees were pretty, McDowell said, they have always been problematic because as they grew they shaded out the roses, and ""if you want roses, you can't grow them in the shade."" ""I'll miss the crab apple trees because they look good in the winter, but that's like saying, 'I like chocolate and you like vanilla,'"" McDowell said. In terms of the claim about Trump's removing rose bushes planted by every first lady since 1913, McDowell pointed to a landscape report completed in 2020 by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, noting that flower plants in the garden have continually been removed and replaced. ""Is the garden outside your back door the same as it was 60 years ago? That's what people are suggesting,"" McDowell said, adding, ""Roses don't live that long."" McDowell also stated that although the idea that current first lady Melania Trump dug up the Rose Garden planted by former first lady Jackie Kennedy made for good internet outrage, that was false framing of the conversation. It was former U.S. President John F. Kennedy who designed the Rose Garden when it was renovated in 1962, although he tapped his wife's close friend, horticulturalist Bunny Mellon, to accomplish the task. Mellon recounted that Kennedy approached her about the project after returning from a trip abroad: He and Mrs. Kennedy had just returned from a state visit to France, followed by stops in England and Austria. The President had noted that the White House had no garden equal in quality or attractiveness to the gardens that he had seen and in which he had been entertained in Europe. There he had recognized the importance of gardens surrounding an official residence and their appeal to the sensibilities of all people. He wanted to start, in the greatest haste, to remake the area near his office at the west end of the White House, known as the Rose Garden, into an area both useful and attractive. Would I design it for him? It was a startling request to say the least. Melania Trump said that the 2020 renovation ""returned the garden to its original 1962 blueprint designed by Bunny Mellon during the Kennedy Administration."" Trump also said that the renovation improved utilities, infrastructure, and added a paved path, increasing access to the garden for people with disabilities. Photo: The White House The crab apple trees removed from the garden in 2020 were placed in the White House greenhouse and will be replanted elsewhere on the grounds. We sent questions to the White House about where those trees will be replanted and when. We also asked for records showing the original 1962 design referenced in Trump's statement but haven't yet received a response. As of April 30, 2021, more than 55,000 people have signed a Change.org petition urging first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff to ""Restore Jackie Kennedy's Rose Garden."" ""Jackie's legacy was ripped away from Americans who remembered all that the Kennedy's meant to us,"" the petition reads. ""We want Jill Biden and Doug Emhoff to take this on and restore the Rose Garden to Jackie's oriiginal (sic) design.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,983
7ec53a60-d08c-48e2-826f-8507ec60441a,"In July 2020, Snopes received numerous inquiries from people who said they had heard U.S. President Donald Trump's administration issued a proposal to change federal law governing homeless shelters and that that memo included an explanation for how to spot some transgender people so the facilities could deny them housing. Many readers included a link to an LGBTQ Nation article published July 20, 2020. People on social media circulated the same claim and link, criticizing the alleged memo as yet another example of the Trump administration's discriminatory tactics to oppress a population that's already at high risk of homelessness. The LGBTQ Nation story alleges the federal memo ""says homeless shelters can use 'factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam's apple' to spot trans women"" during the intake process. Yes, a proposal sponsored by U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson did list those physical attributes verbatim (see below): Now, let's investigate why — was the language intended to help homeless shelters spot transgender people seeking services? First, to explore that question, we researched the circumstances under which the Trump administration was most likely to have written the alleged document. We learned via a July 1, 2020, HUD press release Carson had recently written a proposal to amend existing guidelines that govern how federally funded homeless shelters operate, and we deemed that initiative to be the most likely source of the claim's inspiration. The press release stated: Carson today announced a proposed modification to the 2016 portion of the Equal Access rule. The Equal Access rule requires all HUD funded housing services to be provided without discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The new rule allows shelter providers that lawfully operate as single-sex or sex-segregated facilities to voluntarily establish a policy that will govern admissions determinations for situations when an individual’s gender identity does not match their biological sex. Some context: Housing officials under former U.S. President Barack Obama originally established the Equal Access rule, which requires homeless shelters and other facilities that receive money through the HUD's Office of Community Planning and Development to give Americans equal access to services, regardless of their gender identity or other characteristics. Carson's proposal primarily targeted homeless shelters and facilities within that group that keep beds, bathrooms or other spaces separate for men and women for both emergency and longer-term stays. His measure would have given those places the legal authority to establish rules so only people whose biological sex corresponds with that of what the shelter serves would be granted access to services, no matter how people identify. Next, we obtained the memo to which the LGBTQ Nation headline and press release were referring: a 29-page document on HUD's official website titled ""Making Admission or Placement Determinations Based on Sex in Facilities Under Community Planning and Development Housing Programs."" The docket was signed by Carson, a former neurosurgeon whom Trump appointed to lead HUD in 2016. The document details the specifics of his proposal, as well as his rationale for introducing it, amid a series of unrelated initiatives by the Trump administration to weaken federal protections for transgender Americans. The in-question measure would have changed existing guidelines that, the document alleged, Obama's administration enacted in violation of administrative law and ""minimized local control, burdened religious organizations, manifested privacy issues, and imposed regulatory burdens."" The proposal read: If a single-sex facility permissibly provides accommodation for women, and its policy is to serve only biological women, without regard to gender identity, it may decline to accommodate a person who identifies as female but who is a biological male. Conversely, the same shelter may not, on the basis of sex, decline to accommodate a person who identifies as male but who is a biological female. A different shelter may choose not to make placement decisions or accommodations based on biological sex and there remains no mandate that shelters take biological sex into account. At one point, the document implied that the existing Equal Access rule — requiring facilities nationwide to provide housing, regardless of incoming residents' gender identities — posed a danger to shelter residents; an argument that appeared to be rooted in the unsubstantiated and transphobic claim that men with nefarious intentions might pose as trans women and gain access to female facilities to stalk or harass women. However, the document did not explain how or under what circumstances HUD came to that assumption, nor did it provide verifiable instances of that happening, aside from a pending lawsuit in Fresno, California, that alleges a shelter there allowed such behavior. The HUD proposal stated: [The] current rule makes it impracticable for some shelters to, after admitting a biological male, adequately protect the privacy interests of their biological female clientele who do not want to shower, undress, and sleep in the same facilities as biological men. Pending whatever shelters decide for their entry policies under the proposal, the document stated, staff at facilities that are designed to exclusively serve men or women would ask incoming residents their gender identities before giving them beds. In those cases, if intake workers had ""good faith"" to believe someone was presenting as male or female but that gender did not correspond with their birth sex — which is literally the definition of being transgender — and that birth sex was not served by the shelter, the staff could turn them away. It was at that point in the docket HUD wrote: HUD believes that reasonable considerations [for determining whether a person is transgender] may include, but are not limited to a combination of factors such as height, the presence (but not the absence) of facial hair, the presence of an Adam’s apple, and other physical characteristics which, when considered together, are indicative of a person’s biological sex. In sum, it is accurate to state that under the leadership of Trump, HUD issued a memo in July 2020 that outlined steps for staff at federally funded homeless shelters to determine whether or not incoming residents were transgender, and given the language — it listed masculine physical features and how to notice them, presumably in circumstances when trans women are seeking housing at female-only shelters — we rate this claim ""True."" However, this fact was key: The measure regarding homeless shelters' entry guidelines never took hold at facilities. Federal leaders were still debating the proposal at the time of the November 2020 election. And after voters elected Democratic candidate Joe Biden over Trump, Biden's HUD Secretary, Marcia Fudge, withdrew the Trump-era measure from consideration. Fudge said in an April 2021 statement : Unfortunately, transgender and gender non-conforming people report more instances of housing instability and homelessness than cisgender people. Today, we are taking a critical step in affirming HUD’s commitment that no person be denied access to housing or other critical services because of their gender identity.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1298
53094482-15f5-4766-8ab1-3a482e3a4eae,"In July 2020, readers asked us to examine the accuracy of news articles that claimed 20-year-old Ohio man Isaiah Jackson had been arrested in connection with a photograph, shared widely online, which showed a Black man kneeling on a white toddler's neck, along with the caption ""BLM now mf."" On July 23, the New York Post published an article with the headline ""Ohio Man Seen Kneeling on 2-Year-Old Boy's Neck Arrested."" The article reported that: ""An Ohio man seen kneeling on the neck of a 2-year-old boy on social media has been arrested, authorities said Thursday. Isaiah Jackson, 20, was booked into jail on a probation violation after the Clark County Sheriff’s Office launched an investigation Tuesday into the photo, which depicts a man with his knee on the back of a white child neck’s along with a caption, 'Blm now mf.' A second person is also seen behind the child holding the youngster’s hands behind his back."" Similar articles were published by the Washington Times and local news channels WHIO and WKEF/WRGT . The core claim in those reports -- that Jackson was identified by police as the man in the photograph, and that he had been arrested in connection with it -- was accurate. When this fact check was first published in July 2020, Jackson had not been charged or convicted in relation to the incident shown in the photograph. However, since then, prosecutors in Clark County, Ohio, charged Jackson with third-degree felony abduction, to which he pleaded guilty. In October 2020, a judge sentenced Jackson to three years of community control probation. Technically speaking, police originally arrested Jackson on the basis of an alleged unrelated parole violation, though they sought him out and located him during their investigation into the photograph, and Jackson subsequently pleaded guilty to a third-degree felony abduction charge in relation to the actions shown in the photograph. This fact check's rating was originally ""Mostly True,"" but in light of developments that took place after the article was originally published, we are changing the rating to ""True."" Analysis Internet users began sharing the photograph on July 21, 2020. It appears to have originally been posted to an unidentified Snapchat account. The image shows a man posing for the camera while kneeling on the back of the neck of a toddler who appears to be crying and is lying face down while a second adult holds the toddler's hands behind his back. At the bottom of the photograph, a banner caption reads ""Blm now mf"" (""Black Lives Matter now, motherfucker."") The photograph may be disturbing to some readers, but it can be viewed here . On July 23, the Clark County Sheriff's Office announced in a statement that its investigations into the photograph had led them to identify 20-year-old Isaiah Jackson as the man seen kneeling on the toddler, and that he had been arrested on the basis of an outstanding parole detainer, meaning he was alleged to have violated the conditions of his parole in relation to a separate case. The statement read: On July 21, 2020, the Clark County Sheriff's Office was made aware of a posting on social media displaying a photo of an adult male in a kneeling position, with one knee on the neck of a 2 year old child. Appended to the photo was a 'banner' containing language that indicated that the image was related to ongoing racially-oriented protests and other activity taking place in various cities around the nation. Two divisions of the Clark County Sheriff's Office immediately began an investigation to determine the location of the incident and the identities of the individuals involved. Patrol units were able to determine the location where the incident took place, and were able to make contact with both the mother and the child, as well as the male subject seen kneeling in the image. The male was determined to have a Parole Authority holder from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, and he was taken immediately into custody and incarcerated in the Clark County Jail. The child was taken to the local hospital for examination, where he was found to have no injuries related to the incident. Subsequent interview with the mother revealed that she was unaware of the photo having been taken, or its contents, until she had been informed by other parties while the Sheriff's Office was en route to her home to begin the investigation into this incident. Detectives continue to investigate, and are continuing to compile evidence related to several other persons who were directly involved. The Investigations Bureau of the Clark County Sheriff's Office has prepared the case against the male subject shown in the photo, Isaiah Jackson, 20, and is awaiting the Office of the County Prosecutor to provide a determination on the scope and breadth of the felony charges that will be supported by that office for presentation in court. Clark County Sheriff's Office records showed that Jackson was arrested at 10:50 a.m. on July 21 and booked into the county jail some 15 minutes later. Those records indicated that he was arrested on the basis of a probation violation but it was, in fact, an alleged parole violation, according to the Sheriff's Department's news release. As of July 27, Jackson was still incarcerated in the county jail. It's unclear what the nature of Jackson's alleged parole violation was, or what conviction it related to. However, Clark County Court of Common Pleas records show that in January 2019, Jackson pleaded guilty to charges of third-degree felony burglary and first-degree misdemeanor domestic violence. He was sentenced to six months in prison on the domestic violence charge, to be served concurrently with an 18-month sentence on the burglary charge, with credit for time already served. According to Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction records , Jackson was released from the Madison Correctional Institution on May 17, 2020, but placed under Adult Parole Authority supervision for a period of three years. Snopes asked the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction for the details surrounding the alleged parole violation that prompted Jackson's arrest in Clark County, and we will update this fact check if and when we receive a response. Jackson's domestic violence conviction related to an incident in September 2018 in which he was found to have deliberately rammed his truck into a car he knew was being driven by a woman with whom he has a daughter in common. The arresting officer in the case testified that the woman had said Jackson was ""becoming [increasingly] aggressive and violent with her, threatening her and her family."" The photograph and Jackson's arrest quickly became the subject of intensive, racially tinged outrage and discussion because the caption that accompanied the photograph mentioned the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, and due to the perceived racial dynamics at play (Jackson's race was listed as ""Black"" in Clark County Sheriff's Department records, and the toddler was widely described as being white, although we could not verify that claim). However, it's unknown whether the pose was intended as an earnest gesture of anti-white bias or antipathy on Jackson's part, as opposed to a distasteful attempt at humor. Our examination of a Facebook profile that appears to belong to Jackson did not reveal further evidence of racial antipathy on his part. Despite a rush, from some quarters, to condemn the Black Lives Matter movement by association with Jackson, our research did not uncover evidence of any earnest involvement in, or even commentary on, the broader Black Lives Matter movement, racial injustice or police brutality, on the part of Jackson. After this fact check was published, Snopes obtained a copy of police reports from the Clark County Sheriff's Office investigation into the incident. They showed that a third party, not Jackson himself, had claimed responsibility for posting the photograph online, and adding the ""Blm now mf"" caption. In addition, Jackson told investigating officers that his actions were intended only as a joke, but acknowledged that the pose shown in the photograph was an allusion to the death of George Floyd, in Minneapolis, in May 2020. In that incident, police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on the back of Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes, despite the pleas of Floyd and onlookers. Two autopsies concluded that Chauvin's actions led to Floyd's death, which sparked renewed nationwide and international protests against police brutality and racial injustice led by the Black Lives Matter movement. In April 2021, a jury in Hennepin County, Minnesota found Chauvin guilty of three charges : second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. After the conclusion of the police investigation, Clark County prosecutors charged Jackson with third-degree felony abduction in August 2020, citing an Ohio statute which states that: No person, without privilege to do so, shall knowingly... (2) By force or threat, restrain the liberty of another person under circumstances that create a risk of physical harm to the victim or place the other person in fear... In Ohio, that offense carries a maximum prison sentence of up to three years. Jackson pleaded guilty, and on Oct. 30, 2020, Judge Douglas Rastatter sentenced him to serve 101 days in prison, as well as three years of community control probation. Since Jackson had already been in prison for 101 days between July and October 2020, he was released on probation on Oct. 30, 2020.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1773
6e133f53-30e9-4a4f-8a8c-8232b7567b42,"On Aug. 24, 2019, a 23-year-old Black man named Elijah McClain was walking home from the store when he was stopped by police officers in Aurora, Colorado (part of the Denver metropolitan area), after they received a report of a ""suspicious person"" wearing a ski mask. The encounter escalated, McClain was put in a chokehold, and a few days later he was dead. The Denver Post reported : Elijah McClain, 23, was walking home from a store around 10:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening when authorities contacted him near Billings Street and Colfax Avenue in Denver. Someone had called 911 to report a “suspicious person” who was wearing a ski mask and waving his arms. McClain routinely wore masks when he was outside because he had anemia — a blood condition — and became cold easily, according to his family. [...] After a struggle, McClain was handcuffed and officers requested medical assistance. Aurora Fire Rescue later injected him with ketamine in an attempt to sedate him, police said. He suffered cardiac arrest during the ambulance ride to a nearby hospital. [...] The following Friday McClain was declared “brain dead” and was expected to be taken off life support that afternoon, family members said. He died later that day. McClain's family called for the police officers involved in his death to be prosecuted, but it was announced in November that they would not face criminal charges. McClain's case did not receive the same national attention as other similar incidents, but it was thrust back into the spotlight after George Floyd's death in May 2020, when protests against racial injustice and police violence spread across the United States. In June 2020, an image of text supposedly relaying McClain's ""last words"" started going viral on social media : This message reads: I can't breathe. I have my ID right here. My name is Elijah McClain. That's my house. I was just going home. I'm an introvert. I'm just different. That's all. I'm so sorry. I have no gun. I don't do that stuff. I don't do any fighting. Why are you attacking me? I don't even kill flies! I don't eat meat! But I don't judge people, I don't judge people who do eat meat. Forgive me. All I was trying to do was become better. I will do it. I will do anything. Sacrifice my identity, I'll do it. You all are phenomenal. You are beautiful and I love you. Try to forgive me. I'm a mood Gemini. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Ow, that really hurt. You are all very strong. Teamwork makes the dream work. Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't trying to do that. I just can't breathe correctly. This is a largely accurate transcript of what McClain said in a video recording of his encounter with police in August 2019. These remarks can be heard on the body cam footage of one of the police officers involved in the incident. An official copy of this video from the Aurora Police Department can be seen below (the relevant portion of the video starts at around the 12:30 mark). The text in the viral transcript has been slightly edited to remove repeated phrases and inaudible moments (McClain says ""I'm just different"" multiple times), but none of the edits are misleading. The text describing actions in the viral post — at one point noting that McClain was crying, at another noting that he vomited — are also accurate. This viral transcript does omit at least one phrase uttered by McClain during this encounter. A few moments after the final words of this viral transcript, McClain says ""I can't fix myself"" before vomiting again. NPR reported : Someone picks up a body camera and McClain can be seen lying on his side with both hands restrained behind his back, and one officer jamming his knee on the man's torso. When McClain attempts to roll over to vomit, they shout at him to ""stop fighting us."" ""If you keep messing around, I'm going to bring my dog out here and he's going to bite you,"" says an officer standing over McClain. McClain proceeds to vomit. ""I can't fix myself,"" he says weakly. McClain's body goes limp and he passes out. Eventually one officer asks, ""Are you OK?"" But he's not asking McClain. He's speaking to the officer on top of him. ""Yeah, I'm good,"" the officer says shifting his weight. When paramedics arrived, McClain was injected with ketamine ( described by Aurora Police as ""a standard medication routinely utilized to reduce agitation"") and then loaded into an ambulance where he suffered cardiac arrest. On August 30, McClain was pronounced brain dead, removed from life support, and died. In February 2021, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found that police officers did not have legal basis to stop McClain. The Denver Post reports : Aurora police officers did not have a legal basis to force Elijah McClain to stop walking, to frisk him or to use a chokehold on him, an independent investigation commissioned by the city found. The initial investigation into the incident led by the department's detectives in the Major Crimes Unit was also deeply flawed, the investigators found. The detectives failed to ask basic, critical questions of the officers involved in McClain's death and instead ""the questions frequently appeared designed to elicit specific exonerating 'magic language' found in court rulings,"" the report states. [...] Aurora city officials on Monday morning released the 157-page report on the death of McClain at the hands of city police and paramedics. The city hired a panel of investigators to examine the officers' and paramedics' decision and make policy recommendations ""to lessen the chance of another tragedy like this one from happening again,"" the report states.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1151
02fbd65d-4488-4bdc-ba2d-c33491aa7296,"The remote Rocky Mountain city of Casper, Wyoming, was rumored to be the home of a so-called “wind turbine graveyard,” a large swath of land where retired, non-recyclable wind turbine blades are buried in mass quantities. A social media post that was shared on Facebook nearly 2,000 times in early October 2020 claimed to bring attention and “open your eyes to the environmental issues with windmills” that had been “wasted and decommissioned.” Snopes readers asked our team to investigate the legitimacy of the Wyoming ""wind turbine graveyard,"" which we found to be real and reported on by a number of credible publications in 2020, including Bloomberg and NPR , as well as other publications that have more obvious agendas aimed at stopping the so-called “ great wind power fraud .” (The photos shared in the social media post are also real and can be found on Getty Images here and here .) It is true that there is a landfill in Casper, Wyoming, that does accept decommissioned and damaged wind turbine blades and motors, both of which are not recyclable. However, it is important to highlight that up to 90% of a wind turbine is recyclable. That one-tenth of a windmill is not recyclable does not necessarily negate its overall green energy production over the course of its 20- to 25-year lifetime . Nearly an entire wind turbine can be recycled with the exception of its blades, which are largely made of composite and fiberglass materials and built to withstand some of nature’s most destructive forces, making them very difficult to recycle or crush in the first place. Because the average wind turbine in the United States measures about 280 feet tall , they are prone to environmental and natural damage, such as normal weathering from storm systems with high winds and hail, lightning strikes, and birds. Many wind farms will employ blade service technicians to repair damaged blades. However, when the cost of a repair outweighs its benefit — or the blade is simply not salvageable — they are disposed of in a variety of ways, including being buried. “Wind farms repurpose and recycle 90% of all the materials in a wind turbine; the only material not recyclable is fiberglass; the blades and motor housing are the only fiberglass components,” note Casper city records . City documents published in August 2020 outlined the Casper Regional Landfill (CRL) Wind Turbine and Motor Housing Project, which contains a construction and demolition cell built for special waste projects to generate revenue and keep landfill fees low for regional users. One of the uses of that cell is to house turbine fiberglass blades and motor housing units that are to be disposed of and buried in order to minimize landfill space above ground. CRL first began accepting decommissioned blades in May 2019 and expects to run until spring 2021. According to a Sept. 22, 2020, fact sheet (page 7) submitted to the city by Casper Public Services Director Andrew Beamer and Solid Waste Division Manager Cynthia Langston, the solid waste facility had received 1,124 turbine blades from three neighboring wind farms as of Sept. 16, 2020, totaling approximately $444,000 dollars in revenue for the fiscal year 2020. In the 2021 fiscal year, 250 shorter turbine blades have been received and another 250 are expected, for a total of $35,000 in anticipated revenue. Fiberglass is inert and considered nonhazardous when buried. To save space, the city said that 120-foot-long turbines are cut into three 40-foot lengths and the smaller sections placed within the larger pieces. Each turbine blade is then buried within a cell that measures a maximum of 44 cubic yards, or about the size of about three concrete mixer trucks. As of October 2020, the city of Casper only accepts waste from the state of Wyoming and any out-of-state customer wanting to dispose of blades in CRL would require a permit amendment filed with the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,728
beee74a3-0215-4372-8389-247e5032daa2,"The nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett by U.S. President Donald Trump to the U.S. Supreme Court on Sept. 26, 2020, sparked political discourse, debate, and a slew of internet memes and rumors arguing both in favor of and against the conservative legislator. As the Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation heated up in mid-October, Snopes readers asked us to verify the authenticity of a letter that was reportedly written by more than 80 Notre Dame colleagues of Barrett asking her to ""halt"" the nomination process in advance of the Nov. 3, 2020, presidential election. A link to the letter was shared by a number of public figures on Twitter, including journalist Elizabeth Vargas and MSNBC Anchor Katy Tur , as well as others. This letter is indeed real. The Oct. 10, letter , which was signed by 88 professors at Notre Dame University with disciplines in law, sociology, economics, theater, and political science, among others, expressed concerns over the timing of Barrett's nomination. Barrett is a law school alumna and has taught as a member of the law school's faculty since 2002. Published in Teacher-Scholar-Activist , an online community for American educators to share “local moves that matter in our communities,” the authors went on to say the following: We write to you as fellow faculty members at the University of Notre Dame. We congratulate you on your nomination to the United States Supreme Court. An appointment to the Court is the crowning achievement of a legal career and speaks to the commitments you have made throughout your life. And while we are not pundits, from what we read your confirmation is all but assured. That is why it is vital that you issue a public statement calling for a halt to your nomination process until after the November presidential election. The authors cited three reasons for their request. The first was that the general election is currently underway between Trump and his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, noting the “rushed nature” of Barrett’s nomination process. Trump’s announcement of Barrett’s nomination less than a week after the death of former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an “exercise in raw power politics” that “may effectively deprive the American people of voice in selecting the next Supreme Court Justice.” Secondly, the authors highlighted that Ginsburg’s ""dying wish was that her seat on the court remain open until a new president was installed"" — a request she made in the days preceding her death in which she said that her ""most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed."" Finally, the professors wrote that the nomination comes at a highly politicized era in American politics that includes violence in the streets. Barrett’s confirmation would ""inflame our civic wounds, undermine confidence in the court, and deepen the divide among ordinary citizens."" Though the authors do not explicitly go into detail describing this “violence,” the 2020 election season coincides with months of civil unrest and nationwide protests following the d eath of George Floyd , a Black man who died in Minnesota while being held in police custody, and rising concerns over white supremacy dividing the nation. Supreme Court justices are nominated by the president and are then confirmed by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee through a sometimes lengthy and contentious nomination process. The U.S. Constitution does not specify any qualifications for a justice other than that the candidate must have been trained in law. Once confirmed, a justice will serve until death, as was the case with Ginsburg, who died on Sept. 18, 2020, after serving 27 years on the High Court. Justices have the potential to interpret laws in the country at the highest degree, which some argue may be influenced by their political affiliations, particularly on the heels of the 2020 general election. In her legislative career, Barrett has upheld high-profile court decisions during her time as a circuit judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit , which resides over Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin, that some publications contend are controversial and may hinder her ability to be impartial, pushing “the Supreme Court to the right.” Others have argued that her religious ties to a conservative Christian group called People of Praise suggest that she may be swayed in some of her court opinions — particularly those involving access to abortion and women’s rights . Democratic members of the Senate committee argued that the hearings should have been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic and growing concerns over infection rates in the Republican party, particularly within the president’s cabinet . Republican members, on the other hand, highlighted Barrett’s credentials and intellect. In a Twitter thread , White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany countered the Note Dame letter by sharing letters written by ""elected-officials, colleagues, clerks, students and countless others inspired by her work and character."" Oct. 15 marked the fourth and final day of hearings. Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to confirm Barrett’s confirmation and the full Senate voted on Oct. 26 to confirm the new justice to the Supreme Court.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,961

In October 2020, an image supposedly showing a meme that was posted to Twitter by U.S. President Donald Trump started to circulate on other social media sites, such as Facebook, where some viewed it with skepticism. One reader asked, ""did Trump tweet this?"" in reference to a meme that featured a digitally manipulated image of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a nursing home above the words, ""Biden for President"" with the ""P"" crossed out, so it read ""Biden for Resident."" Trump posted the ""Biden for Resident"" meme to his Twitter page on Oct. 13, 2020. Trump did not provide any additional text when he shared this image. While Trump, 74, truly shared a doctored image of his political rival Biden, 77, sitting at a nursing home, it doesn't appear that the president created this meme. The ""Biden for Resident"" image was circulating on social media for a few days — at the least — before it appeared on Trump's timeline. We're not sure who created this meme, but we do know that it was created from a photograph taken by Jeff Greenberg at a nursing home in Morristown, New Jersey circa 1989-90.

In October 2020, a piece of text supposedly written by a person who had just ""finished poll manager training"" was copied and pasted across social media. The text warned readers to be on the lookout as they cast their votes in the upcoming presidential election for poll workers who might write something on their ballots such as a star, a checkmark, a letter, etc. This, according to the viral message, would invalidate their vote. One popular early version of this text claimed that this recently trained poll manager was stationed in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina: ****Myrtle Beach Pay Attention*** Just finished Poll Manager training! I passed all the classes. I want you all to know something...if you are checking in at the polls and they happen to write anything on your ballot...a letter, a checkmark, a star, any writing of any kind...please request a new ballot. Your ballot will not be counted if it is written on. Please be on the lookout for this type of behavior. I know someone in Myrtle Beach who asked me about this during the primaries and I did not understand what it might have meant. Now I know. It disqualifies your ballot. BE ON GUARD!!! This claim, in general, is unfounded. Poll workers have practically no reason to mark ballots, and in the rare instance where they might, this would not invalidate a person's vote. Angela Westmoreland, a poll training manager for Horry County, where Myrtle Beach is located, commented below this post that ""this is not correct information."" Westmoreland wrote: ""Where did you train? I am the Training Coordinator for Horry County Elections and we have not even started training. Which county do you work for? This is not correct information."" The fact-checking website LeadStories managed to contact officials in Horry County, who also disputed the claims in this post. Chris Whitmire, the director of public information for the South Carolina state election commission, said: ""There's no truth to it at all. A poll manager is not going to write anything on your ballot and if they did it's not going to result in your ballot not being counted."" While the above-displayed Facebook post specifically mentioned Myrtle Beach, subsequent versions of this text were circulated without a specific location attached. These posts were often prefaced by a sentence claiming that the poster had received this information from a friend or relative. In other words, the vast majority of people sharing this post didn't seem to have any firsthand knowledge about the issue. States are responsible for running their own elections, so it's difficult to make a blanket statement covering all poll-worker training sessions across the country. However, we did reach out to election officials in various states for their interpretation of this post, and they, like the officials in Myrtle Beach, agreed that poll workers have little reason to write on ballots. If they did, it wouldn't invalidate the person's vote. Debra O’Malley, a spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth in Massachusetts, told us: There is no reason any poll worker would ever mark anything on a ballot, with the very rare exception of a challenged ballot. If a ballot is challenged for legal cause, the voter’s name and address, as well as the challenger’s, are written on the ballot to be reviewed only in the case of a recount or court order. Again, this is very rare. Ballots are not disqualified at the polling place. If a tabulator cannot read a ballot, the voter is offered a new ballot. If they do not want to spoil their ballot, it is set aside to be counted by hand at the end of the night. A spokesperson for the Maryland State Board of Elections provided a similar statement, explaining that poll workers in that state would have little reason to ever mark (or even be momentarily in possession of) a person's ballot, but if it did occur, it would not invalidate that person's vote. The spokesperson also explained some of the security measures that are in place to ensure a person's vote gets counted: A poll worker should never have possession of a voter's voted ballot. If a poll worker ever did have a voter's voted ballot and made a mark, it would not disqualify the ballot. It's possible that the mark could impact the ballot's ability to be scanned, but the voter would be present when the scanner rejected it and the voter would be issued a replacement ballot to vote. The only time a poll worker may write on a voted ballot is if the voter made a mistake on the ballot and needed a replacement ballot. The poll worker instructs the voter to ""overvote"" every contest on the ballot and write ""Spoiled"" on the ballot, but if the voter didn't write ""spoiled"" on the ballot, the poll worker may need to write it. This is unlikely to occur as the poll worker is with the voter and instructing the voter on each step. A spokesperson for Maine's Bureau of Corporations, Elections and Commissions told us: ""The State of Maine does not reject ballots because of a stray mark on the ballot."" North Carolina's representative also confirmed that a poll worker writing on a person's ballot would ""absolutely not"" cause that vote to be rejected. However, it is commonplace (in fact, it's required), for a poll worker to mark a ballot. The spokesperson explained that poll workers in North Carolina must write the voter's ""one-stop"" number on their ballot, saying: In North Carolina, poll workers must write the voter’s one-stop (OS) number on the ballot. This is part of the process in NC that allows us to retrieve ballots if challenged, etc. They also write the voter’s precinct on the ballot so that one-stop early voting ballots can be sorted back into the proper precincts after the election for reporting and data purposes. Early voters can cast their ballot at any early voting site in their county. In short, this text does not appear to have originated with a person who recently completed poll-manager training, and the vast majority of people sharing this message are doing so without any firsthand knowledge of this issue. It should also be noted that poll workers have practically no reason to write on a person's ballot. In the rare circumstance where it is warranted, this would not invalidate a person's ballot.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1282
e00b7931-5cba-4148-ad74-8d4ef0a6876f,"In September 2020, conservative commentators claimed to have uncovered damning evidence of journalistic dishonesty and partisan bias on the part of ""CBS Evening News"" by claiming that the network had taken a photograph of Latino supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, and with wanton disregard for the truth, presented it to their viewers as an illustration of Latino support for Trump's Democratic opponent Joe Biden. On Sept. 16, 2020, Arizona businesswoman Tracy DuCharme, who describes herself as a field organizer for the Trump Victory Committee, posted two similar images to Twitter along with the caption: "" CBS stole a Photo from Latinos for Trump in Phoenix and tagged it as a Biden event. #fakenews"" The two images from DuCharme's tweet can be viewed separately here and here . The claim that CBS had misleadingly presented Trump's followers as Biden's was further promoted by Brad Parscale , a senior adviser to the president's reelection campaign; Kelli Ward , chairperson of the Arizona Republican Party; and Drew Sexton , Arizona state director for the Trump Victory Committee. DuCharme's tweet formed the basis of a subsequent article on the unreliable right-wing conspiracy website Gateway Pundit, whose headline read, ""Fake News CBS Caught Using Photo From Latinos For Trump Event in Phoenix and Tagged [sic] it as Biden's Florida Event,"" and a similar piece on the website Red State Nation. That claim was false. It relied on the juxtaposition of two factors: the use, by ""CBS Evening News,"" of a still image from a ""Latinos for Trump"" event in Phoenix, Arizona; and the chyron (or caption) at the bottom of the screen in that moment, which read ""Biden Pitches Crucial Latino Voters During Florida Campaign Stop."" The photograph was authentic . It was taken in Phoenix, Arizona, on Sept. 14, 2020, by Associated Press photographer Andrew Harnik with the caption: ""Supporters react as President Donald Trump speaks at a Latinos for Trump Coalition roundtable at Arizona Grand Resort & Spa ..."" The screenshot from ""CBS Evening News"" was also authentic, and apparently undoctored. It originated in the Sept. 15, 2020, episode of the program, which can be watched in full here . The chyron can be seen throughout the segment in question, which is available to watch, below: https://youtu.be/KxMrgxAf5Vc?t=150 DuCharme's claim was that CBS had, through its use of the chyron, presented the photograph as depicting a Biden event, but that omitted one crucial element of any television news segment — audio. During the report, CBS correspondent Ed O'Keefe was, in a voiceover, discussing concerns among Biden supporters that his campaign had not done enough grassroots outreach among Latino voters in Florida, and that the Trump campaign had been doing more. At the moment when the Phoenix ""Latinos for Trump"" photograph shows up on screen, O'Keefe says: ""The president has cut into Biden's advantage by wooing conservative Latinos ..."" So ""CBS Evening News"" actually used the ""Latinos for Trump"" photograph for the exact opposite reason to the one falsely claimed by DuCharme and others: It showed up at a point in the report when O'Keefe was mentioning Trump's support among Latino supporters — an entirely appropriate usage of that photograph. A considerable degree of irony exists in the fact that the false claim that CBS misrepresented the photograph by taking it from its original context, was itself perpetrated by taking the screenshot from the ""CBS Evening News"" report, and removing it from its proper context by stripping away the voiceover narration. It's true that the chyron ""Biden Pitches Crucial Latino Voters During Florida Campaign Stop"" remained present at the bottom of the screen during the moment in question, but it causes no confusion when viewed in its proper context, along with the voiceover. It's also standard practice for the same chyron to remain present throughout the course of a cable news segment, even if it doesn't describe or relate to each and every image shown. For example, it could hardly be reasonably claimed that ""CBS Evening News"" engaged in dishonesty by having the chyron at the bottom of the screen while the following image of Trump showed up, on the basis that the image showed Trump, and not ""Biden pitching to Latino voters"": After this fact check was published, Gateway Pundit completely overhauled their article, changing the headline to ""Trump’s Cut into the Hispanic Vote Leaves Democrats Panicked,"" removing DuCharme's tweet and stripping away any substantive mention of the CBS Evening News segment until the final line in the revised article, which read: ""CBS News had to use a photo from a Trump rally because virtually NO ONE was at Joe Biden’s Latino event!"" Despite the radical edit to the article, and the substantially reduced word count, Gateway Pundit still managed to mislead readers with that claim. CBS News was not forced to use a photo from a Trump rally because a comparable Biden event had been poorly attended, the network used the ""Latinos for Trump"" photograph because, as we have made clear, they were illustrating Trump's support among Latinos during that portion of the report.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,983
3830a340-6d39-4f24-a3f9-634ff88ac91a,"In the lead-up to the 2020 general election, the internet was rife with political memes criticizing many candidates and campaigns. Among them was a widely shared photograph of U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, at a September GOP event pictured wearing a T-shirt that read, “Kill ‘em all. Let God sort ‘em out.” The above meme was shared to Facebook in a post by Texas Rural Voices , a group that describes itself as rural Texans and has supported Democratic platforms. Readers asked Snopes if the photograph of Buck's shirt was real, and it was. The images were shared by the Colorado GOP’s official Twitter account on Aug. 29, 2020, which we have archived here for reference. ""To be honest, this isn't really a story or newsworthy,"" Joe Jackson, communications director for the Colorado Republican Party, wrote to Snopes in an email. ""The saying on the shirt is well known as being associated with the Marines and Green Berets and the t-shirt was a gift to the Congressman from his son, who is a veteran and went to West Point,"" he added. Jackson included links to Twitter posts shared here , here , here and here to support this claim. Maj Salinas, branch head of media operations for the U.S. Marine Corps, told Snopes that the phrase was “never adopted as an official motto or slogan for the U.S. Marine Corps.” Notably, Buck's T-shirt contains no direct references to the Marine Corps, but it does appear to feature a U.S. Army Special Forces crest insignia . The phrase, ""Kill 'em all. Let God sort 'em out,"" reportedly comes from the Latin saying, ""Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius,"" which translates to, ""Kill them. For the Lord knows those that are His own."" The Latin version of the phrase reportedly dates back to the Albigensian Crusade of the 13th century when Pope Innocent III launched a 20-year military campaign against the Cathari, a religious sect deemed heretics, that is described in an article published in the Annals of Burns and Fire Disasters . When the crusaders asked how they might distinguish true Christians from the heretics, a papal legate reportedly replied with the above phrase, according to a collection of writings known as a sourcebook that was published by Fordham University . The U.S. Marine Corps is thought to have unofficially adopted the saying during the Vietnam War. However, Snopes was unable to independently verify whether the phrase is associated with the branch. Some social media users argued that Buck's wearing the shirt was in bad taste after months of clashes around the nation between police forces and protesters of racial injustice. Supporters of Buck countered that his wearing of the shirt showed solitary with U.S. military forces. Buck's office did not respond to requests for comment at the time of publication. It is not clear at what event Buck wore the shirt, but a look at the Colorado GOP event calendar for the month of August 2020 revealed party events held in Delta County on Aug. 3, Montrose County on Aug. 13, and Mesa County on Aug. 21. The images were shared once again with Colorado constituents in a Sept. 1 email campaign led on behalf of Ike McCorkle , a Democrat from Colorado who is running for the state's 4th Congressional District — Buck’s seat. A spokesperson with the McCorkle campaign confirmed that the photo was taken by a photographer attending a GOP event and that to the best of his staff’s knowledge, the image was authentic. ""The image captured of Ken Buck was from a ‘Guns and BBQ’ rally held in Grand Junction,"" said Samuel Banick, the communications director for McCorkle's campaign. As for the other two candidates mentioned in the meme, Lauren Boebert , a Republican candidate for Colorado’s 3rd congressional district, has made several references to QAnon , a fringe theory that has been connected to dozens of congressional candidates. In September, U.S. Sen.

Before the official announcement was made, a meme (see above) began circulating on Facebook highlighting a supposed list of featured speakers ranging from the absurd to the plausible. The meme included names of people who have gained prominence over the past few years for their connection to right-wing movements and conspiracy theories. We went through the real list — available here — and learned that only a few of these people are actually going to speak at the RNC, which begins on Monday, Aug. 24. Firstly, the student often described as ""the MAGA hat kid from Covington Catholic” will indeed be speaking at the second day of the convention. Nicholas Sandmann was a high school student at the center of a viral video from early 2019. In the video, Sandmann was wearing a Make America Great Again hat and was in Washington, D.C., for the March for Life rally. The video appeared to show him staring down a Native American activist who played a drum. Mainstream and social media commentators accused Sandmann of harassing the activist, but a longer version of that video contradicted the notion. Sandmann sued CNN and The Washington Post for defamation surrounding their coverage of the incident, in cases that were later settled for undisclosed amounts. Next up is Mike Lindell , the CEO of MyPillow, a pillow manufacturing company, and Trump’s friend. He has been promoting oleandrin, a toxic botanical extract, as a treatment for COVID-19, despite a lack of proof that it works. He does not appear to be on the speaker’s list, though he will be speaking at a Republican fundraiser in September. (Update: Though he was not a featured speaker, Lindell did speak briefly during the roll call portion of the convention.) Third on the list is Dr. Stella Immanuel, nicknamed “The Demon Sperm Doctor” in the meme. Immanuel gained notoriety after Trump himself pushed her theories that face masks were not necessary to stop the spread of COVID-19. She has also said that a range of medical issues usually occurring in women are caused by demonic sperm after having sex with demons. She is not speaking at the convention. Actor Scott Baio spoke at the 2016 RNC, while musician Kid Rock was being considered for a performance at this year's convention before the pandemic struck in 2020. Neither appear to be on the official speaker’s list for 2020. Finally, Mark and Patricia McCloskey (dubbed ""the racist gun couple” in the meme) are, in fact, speaking on the first day of the RNC. The duo brandished their firearms at Black Lives Matter protesters in St. Louis in June 2020 in the wake of police custody deaths of Black men that resulted in nationwide demonstrations. Only three people — including a couple — named in this meme will actually be speaking at the RNC. As such, we rate this claim ""Mostly False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,597
5e3e8a64-05d4-485c-ab75-0a385b5c3e1b,"On Aug. 24, 2020, a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, was captured on cellphone video shooting Jacob Blake, a Black man, multiple times as he tried to enter his vehicle. Demonstrations against police brutality erupted in Kenosha on Aug. 25, in reaction to Blake's shooting. These protests spiraled into chaos when white, armed agitators appeared on the streets. Some, like teenager Kyle Rittenhouse, were accused of shootings. Memes emerged online comparing law enforcement's treatment of Rittenhouse — who is white — to that of Tamir Rice — a Black boy shot and killed by police in 2014 after his toy gun was mistaken for a real one. Snopes readers shared versions of these posts with us and asked us to look into their accuracy. While the two scenarios are glaringly different, especially in their outcomes, most of the claims aligned with the facts in each case. What Happened to Tamir Rice? On Nov. 22, 2014, 12-year-old Rice was fatally shot by a police officer in Cleveland, Ohio. Rice had been playing in a park and posing with a toy gun that fired plastic pellets, according to The New York Times . Police received a 911 call that day that there was a ""guy in here with a pistol."" But the caller’s complete message that the gun was ""probably fake"" and the person holding the gun was ""probably a juvenile"" was never conveyed to the officer involved in the shooting. Within seconds of arriving at the park, the police officer shot Rice in the abdomen at point-blank range. The officer later said that he warned the boy three times to raise his hands, a claim many have doubted. What Happened to Kyle Rittenhouse? On Aug. 25, 2020, footage showed 17-year-old Rittenhouse firing at protesters with an AR-15-style firearm after being chased in Kenosha. He was not legally old enough to wield an assault rifle in that state. Video footage showed police tossing bottles of water to Rittenhouse and other armed white people, telling them: ""We appreciate you guys."" This occurred shortly before the shootings he was later implicated in. After Rittenhouse allegedly shot three people (two fatally), The New York Times reported that ""police vehicles remained stationary during the gunfire."" Rittenhouse then walked with his hands up towards the police, while bystanders called out to them that he had just shot people. But the police drove by without stopping in order to assist victims. Rittenhouse then drove to his home town of Antioch in Lake County, Illinois, about 20 miles from Kenosha. We can't confirm if Rittenhouse went home to sleep, but according to reports , he was arrested the next day — on Aug. 26 — at his mother's house. He was charged with two counts of reckless intentional homicide and one count of attempted reckless intentional homicide. He was also charged with reckless endangerment and possession of a deadly weapon by a person under the age of 18, according to a criminal complaint . At the time of writing this, Rittenhouse was being held in a juvenile facility in Illinois, while authorities planned to extradite him to Wisconsin. Conclusion While the majority of the statements presented in the meme are accurate, the contexts are very different. We also could not prove what Rittenhouse did when he returned to his home town before getting arrested. We thus rate this claim as ""Mostly True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,643
06046c55-f2a6-4a6d-87e8-f68195dde7b5,"Although the custom is sometimes more honored in the breach than in the observance, the U.S. Flag Code states that ""During a rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart."" Given how finely-attuned candidates for high office usually are to the importance of symbolism, Illinois senator (and Democratic presidential hopeful) Barack Obama caused something of a stir in September 2007 when he was seemingly spotted not observing the hand-over-heart protocol during a playing of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" at an Indianola, Iowa, steak fry attended by the six top Democratic presidential candidates: Boy, that's exactly who we need as President! Does this man not cross his heart when the National Anthem is playing, or when the flag is raised or lowered? OR, was this an accident on his part? Photo shows 4 of them, including the infamous Hillary... Senator Barack Obama, Governor Bill Richardson, Senator Hillary Clinton and Ruth Harkin during the national anthem. Barack Hussein Obama's photo (that's his real name). The article said he REFUSED TO NOT ONLY PUT HIS HAND ON HIS HEART DURING THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, BUT REFUSED TO SAY THE PLEDGE. How in the hell can a man like this expect to be our next Commander-in-Chief? The photograph itself is real, one of several images of the Iowa steak fry event published by Time , and shows then-Senator Barack Obama standing with his hands clasped just below his waist, while New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, New York senator Hillary Clinton, and Ruth Harkin (wife of Iowa senator Tom Harkin) stand with their hands held over their hearts. It's difficult to establish context from a single still image, but other accounts (including ABC News video of the event) documented that the picture was as described: (It's not clear from the photograph or the video just what the candidates were looking at. The Flag Code advises that they should be ""standing at attention facing the flag,"" but none of them is facing the flag displayed behind the platform on which they're standing. Presumably another flag was in place off to the right of the platform, since most of the candidates were facing that direction.) As we noted earlier, although the U.S. Flag Code still specifies that those present should stand ""with the right hand over the heart"" during the playing of the U.S. national anthem, that particular form is one that has generally come to be observed less and less consistently among the general public over the decades: Experts on the national anthem say the law seems a bit out of date, given its reference to a man's ""headdress."" Yet it's still cited in several military manuals found on the Web. Modern custom does not require a hand over the heart, said Anne Garside, director of communication for the Maryland Historical Society, home of the original manuscript of The Star-Spangled Banner. ""I think the bottom line is that you show respect with your demeanor,"" she said. ""Whether you put your hand over your heart, hold your hat at shoulder level or waist level, is really in this day and age irrelevant."" As for whether this incident was an ""accident,"" whether Senator Obama habitually declines to perform the hand-over-heart gesture, or whether there's any particular meaning to the (non-)action, an Obama campaign spokesperson responded: ""Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn't. In no way was he making any sort of statement, and any suggestion to the contrary is ridiculous."" The senator himself said that ""My grandfather taught me when I was two. During the Pledge of Allegiance, you put your hand over your heart. During the national anthem, you sing."" When television's Inside Edition ran a segment on this issue, they included some images (supplied by the Obama campaign) of the senator standing with his hand over his heart during other playings of the national anthem: The text accompanying some versions of the e-mailed photograph claimed that Senator Obama ""refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance."" The activity taking place during the scene in the photograph involved the playing of the U.S. national anthem, not a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The following video clip shows Barack Obama reciting the Pledge during the opening of U.S. Senate sessions: During the Democratic candidates' debate on 15 January 2008, Senator Obama directly refuted the three primary rumors about him that were then circulating via e-mail: that he is a Muslim, that he was sworn in to Congress on the Quran, and that he refuses to say the Pledge of Allegiance: This item saw renewed interest in April 2017, when First Lady Melania Trump seemingly had to nudge her husband, President Donald Trump, to place his hand over his heart during the playing of the national anthem while celebrating the annual White House Easter Egg Roll: A spoof article about Barack Obama's stance on the U.S. national anthem was later circulated via e-mail as a genuine statement the then-senator.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,969
050810ee-16b5-4a36-8eff-90429daa7211,"Shortly after presumptive U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden announced Sen. Kamala Harris of California as his running mate, Snopes readers asked us to verify a number of rumors and claims surrounding the Democratic ticket and their respective campaigns. Among them was the question of whether the URL antifa.com automatically redirects to the official campaign website of Biden and Harris. A quick search by Snopes confirmed this rumor to be based in truth (our initial search from Aug. 12, 2020, is recorded in the video clip shown below). As of that date, the URL redirected internet users to joebiden.com . However, by the next day (Aug. 13), the antifa.com site and its redirect had been removed entirely. Since our initial publication of this story, the antifa.com redirect continued to change, pointing users once again to the official Biden campaign website at some point in late August 2020, according to readers. On Aug. 25, the URL redirected at least some users to a site called It’s Going Down (itsgoingdown.org), which described itself as a “community center for anarchist, anti-fascist, autonomous anti-capitalist and anti-colonial movements.” By Aug. 31, the antifa.com URL once again redirected the majority of users to joebiden.com. There was no apparent link between either of the websites and the Biden campaign. https://media.giphy.com/media/d6FEL2SQxYaC9pxTfG/giphy.gif Snopes contacted the Biden campaign for comment regarding any potential involvement with the redirect but did not hear back at the time of publication. In an Aug. 31 Tweet, Rob Flaherty, digital director for the Biden campaign, denied involvement with the redirect and blamed it on internet trolls. Flaherty also noted that antifa.com was registered to an entity located in Russia, which is partly true. An investigation of internet domain search engine Whoxy confirmed that antifa.com was previously registered through a domain privacy service located in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but a cross-reference with WhoIs , an online domain registry record found that the URL was registered under the privacy service “Namecheap Inc” using “WhoisGuard Protected” with a geolocation in Panama. It appeared that antifa.com was last updated on Jan. 1, 2021, but because the domain used a privacy service to hide its registration data, our team was not able to verify the location of the URL owner. Rumored associations with the political protest movement antifa, short for anti-fascists, have plagued Biden’s campaign. In June 2020, the politician was falsely accused of having called the far-left network a “courageous group of Americans.” According to the Anti-Defamation League , antifa is not a unified group but rather a “loose collection of local/regional groups and individuals” that many civil rights organizations have deemed “dangerous and counterproductive” for their use or endorsement of intimidation and violence. As of the most recent update of this article, it is unknown who implemented the web redirect. Anyone who owns or has access to a domain can establish either a temporary or permanent URL redirect, which essentially tells a search engine that the page has moved. As such, a redirect simply directs site visitors to a different URL when they click a particular link, according to website hosting platform Squarespace . According to Whois , antifa.com was registered on April 24, 2002, and was last updated on Oct. 23, 2019. We dug through the internet archives to establish a timeline of the domain in order to determine when the redirect was created. Here’s what we found: The earliest archive of the URL listed the domain as for sale on Nov. 21, 2008 . The domain remained available for sale until Jan. 30, 2020 , according to our analysis of the archives. The first archived version of the URL that directly associates it to the antifa political group is dated May 31, 2020 . On July 23, 2020 , the most recent version of the ""antifa” website was available with a note that an updated website would be coming soon. An Aug. 12, 2020, archived version of antifa.com confirmed that a redirect from antifa.com had been established to send users to the joebiden.com official campaign website (see below). At this time, the URL redirected internet users to joebiden.com. Later on Aug. 12, antifa.com showed a “500 — Internal Server Error” message. At that time, the website was listed as unavailable . At the time of this story’s initial publication (Aug. 13), the antifa.com site and its redirect had been removed. Starting Aug. 21, antifa.com started redirecting to kamalaharris.org , which itself had already been redirecting to joebiden.com since Aug. 12. On Aug. 25, the joebiden.com URL redirected at least some users to a site called It’s Going Down (itsgoingdown.org), a self-described anarchist website. By Aug. 31, antifa.com once again redirected most users to the official Biden campaign website. It’s not the first time Biden’s website has been the target of internet hoaxes. In 2019, Republican consulting firm Vici Media Group created joebiden.info , a mock website for the presidential hopeful that featured pictures, videos, and animated GIFs of Biden appearing to kiss and touch young women and girls. The marketing group also created fake websites for other Democratic candidates, including Sens. Bernie Sanders , Elizabeth Warren , and Kamala Harris .",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,981
ab6a1e91-1ab5-4991-8bae-27c1be5f51af,"In modern warfare it's rather uncommon for very high-ranking U.S. officers to be killed by enemy action. Nonetheless, such was the case when a two-star general, U.S. Army Major General Harold Greene, the deputy commanding general for the Combined Security Transition Command-Afghanistan, died on Aug. 5, 2014 after an Afghan army soldier emerged from hiding in a bathroom at Marshal Fahim National Defense University outside Kabul and opened fire on a delegation of U.S. and European military officers, fatally hitting Greene (who was making a routine visit to a training facility) in the back of the head. Gen. Greene was the highest-ranking American servicemember killed by hostile action since Lieutenant General Timothy J. Maude died a result of the terrorist airliner attack on the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, and he was the first U.S. general killed in combat since Maj. Gen. John A.B. Dillard died after his helicopter was shot down in Vietnam on 12 May 1970. Shortly after Greene was interred at Arlington National Cemetery on Aug. 14, 2014, political rumors began circulating claiming that not only had President Obama broken precedent by failing to attend the funeral himself (Presidents Nixon and Bush supposedly having attended the funerals of Gen. Dillard and Adm. Robinson, respectively), but that he had declined to send even a token ranking member of his administration to represent the executive branch at the ceremony. Such rumors were wrong on both counts, including this one received in email in August 2014: ""Is this true? 'Obama bucked tradition of Nixon who attended MG Dillard's funeral in 1970 & Bush who attended LTG Maude's in 2001.' Back on August 5th, Major General Harold Greene was killed in Afghanistan, the victim of an insider attack. He was the first general killed in a combat zone since the Vietnam War. Insider attacks are on the rise in Afghanistan, as tens of thousands of Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters have infiltrated the Afghan National Security Forces. Such a rare occurrence as a high-ranking officer's death should have warranted a great deal of attention from our Commander-in-Chief, but Obama has yet to make any public comments regarding his death. Not only has Obama been unable to make any comment about the General's sacrifice, he also was unable to find the time to make it to General Greene's funeral, held in Arlington National Cemetery.  Obama himself was conspicuously absent, but so were the Vice President and the Secretary of Defense.  The highest ranking and most senior member of Obama’s administration that found the time to pay respects to the General that was murdered by the enemy was Army Chief of Staff Ray Odierno. This is beyond outrageous, and should be taken as a blatant slap in the face of every military member and civilian that knows and understands the tradition, honor, and respect that comes with military service.  In what can only be a gross oversight, or else a belligerent middle-finger, Obama hasn't even ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, like he did for the deaths of singer Whitney Houston, as well as the former communist and South African President Nelson Mandela. There are no words to describe the amount of disrespect that was on display by Obama’s deliberate absence from the General's funeral."" Although neither President Obama nor Vice President Joe Biden attended Gen. Greene's funeral, a high-ranking Obama administration official was present. As the military publication Stars and Stripes noted in its reporting of the funeral, U.S. Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel attended the ceremony and met with Greene's family: ""A cannon boomed across the hallowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery as a two-star general killed in an insider attack in Afghanistan was buried with full military honors. The somber ceremony for Maj. Gen. Harold J. Greene included a riderless horse following the caisson — an honor given to an Army or Marine Corps officer ranked colonel or above — and was attended by more than 100 mourners. U.S. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno presented the flag that had covered Greene’s casket to his widow, Susan Myers, a retired Army colonel. Odierno then presented three more flags to Greene’s son, Matthew, a first lieutenant in the Army; his daughter, Amelia; and his father, also named Harold. The burial was preceded by a chapel service that was closed to media. Lt. Col. Juanita Chang, an Army public affairs officer, said the 650-seat chapel at Arlington was filled beyond capacity. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel attended and met with the family ."" As for President Obama's allegedly breaking precedent by not attending the funeral himself, Byron York, one of the journalists who passed along some of the misinformation related to this issue, noted in a mea culpa Washington Examiner follow-up that: ""[Morris Davis, a retired Air Force colonel] stated definitively that Nixon had attended the Dillard funeral in 1970 and Bush had attended the Maude funeral in 2001, a 'tradition' of presidential attendance that Obama 'bucked' by ignoring the Greene funeral. As it turned out, none of that was true, and Davis, a retired U.S. Air Force colonel who played an important role in the War on Terror and who today teaches law at Howard University, knew it when he wrote it. Curious about what Davis had said, I looked for any sign that Nixon had attended the Dillard funeral. I went to the Nixon Library website, which has posted the minute-by-minute White House logs of Nixon's activities. They're very detailed; if Nixon had gone to the general's funeral, it would have been listed. I looked through the month after Dillard's death and found no evidence Nixon had attended. Likewise, it turned out Bush did not attend the Maude funeral."" In regards to the coda of the example reproduced above, which claims that President Obama ""hasn't even ordered flags to be flown at half-staff, like he did for the deaths of singer Whitney Houston, as well as the former communist and South African President Nelson Mandela,"" President Obama did issue a proclamation ordering that U.S. flags on government buildings be flown at half-staff in December 2013 after the death of Nelson Mandela, the anti-apartheid politician who served as president of South Africa in the late 1990s. (That was a relatively uncommon gesture of respect for a deceased foreign head of state: the last dignitary whose death had been so honored in the U.S. was Pope John Paul II in 2005.) However, the claim that President Obama ordered U.S. flags on government buildings be flown at half-staff after the death of singer Whitney Houston in April 2012 is a long-running piece of political misinformation : the president issued a statement of condolence through his press secretary and nothing more; the gesture of flag-lowering was undertaken only at a state level by Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, Houston's home state. In March 2015, actor Charlie Sheen referenced this item in a rant about President Obama's appearance on ESPN for his annual tradition of filling out his NCAA tournament bracket.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1313

It's unclear what exactly is meant by the phrase, ""what you pay AARP."" The organization has an estimated 38 million members, all of whom typically pay annual dues at $16 per year. As a 501(c)4 tax-exempt organization, it also accepts charitable donations. Either way, any money paid to AARP through membership dues or donations does not go ""directly"" to the Democratic party. The AARP lobbies the government on behalf of causes that affect people aged 50 and older. Those activities may include taking a stand on health care and Social Security . In terms of candidates and political parties, however, AARP's official position is that it is non-partisan. The organization states it ""does not support, endorse or contribute to political candidates or parties."" Instead, per AARP, the organization's role in terms of election politics is ""connecting voters to information about where the candidates stand on issues most important to them including the future of Social Security and other critical issues related to financial security, health and well-being."" We checked the AARP's federal campaign finance data using the website Open Secrets , a project operated by the government accountability organization The Center for Responsive Politics. We found no contributions to any political candidates or parties, Democratic or otherwise, from AARP, the organization. However, contributions from individuals who work for AARP is another matter. ""AARP does not have any record of direct contributions to political parties or candidates based on my review of federal campaign finance and tax filings covering recent years, but AARP’s officers [executives] and employees can still make political donations in a personal capacity, and contributions from donors listing AARP as their employer in Federal Election Commission records have primarily gone to Democratic candidates in recent years,"" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher for The Center for Responsive Politics. AARP policy prohibits employees or officers from engaging in any personal political activity using AARP resources or during work hours. According to campaign finance data tracked by Open Secrets, individual donors associated with AARP made a total of $96,381 in political contributions as of this writing in the 2020 federal election cycle, the majority (87.45%) of those donations going to Democratic candidates. Massoglia said that as a 501(c)4 organization, the AARP is allowed under U.S. tax code to engage in some political campaign activity. But their activities have been issue-oriented and bipartisan. For example, a 2018 AARP ad praised U.S. President Donald Trump on drug pricing policy. The organization has also supported upholding the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care law signed by Trump's Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. AARP spokesperson Jason Young told us by phone that the organization, as a 501(c)4 non-profit, is prohibited by law from making political contributions. ""Not only does AARP not make donations of this sort, we never have and we don't have a PAC,"" Young added. Young said that although some AARP employees have made political contributions in a personal capacity, the sum of donations is relatively small. ""It's fair to say we are largely absent form this type of political engagement, and that's because AARP as an organization is focused on policy, not politics,"" Young stated. Although it's true that individuals who work for AARP have donated primarily to Democratic candidates, individual donations are not the same as contributions by an organization. Because AARP as an organization has not contributed to the Democratic party or its candidates, we rate this claim, ""False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,723

In a viral video posted to the social media platform TikTok in August 2020, user Christian Grech stated that the brand of hand sanitizer he held in the video had been recalled because it contained the dangerous chemical methanol. The video racked up hundreds of thousands of views not long after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had cautioned that a large and growing list of hand sanitizer brands were toxic. It's true that Born Basic Anti-Bac hand sanitizer products that were manufactured by Real Clean Distribuciones SA de CV in Mexico were recalled in 2020 by Born Basic. The product is on the FDA's searchable list of hand sanitizers that are either contaminated or potentially contaminated. The bottles of Born Basic Anti-Bac Hand Sanitizer 70% alcohol that were manufactured at the facility in Mexico were found to contain methanol. On Aug. 13, 2020, the Born Basic brand published a press release detailing that steps have been taken by the company to remediate the issue: The company’s CEO wants to ensure that consumer knows that only the Born Basic sanitizer manufactured in the Real Clean Mexican facility with lot numbers identified on the FDA’s list was impacted. All impacted lots have been removed from market. Aside from issuing a voluntary recall on the affected products, the company halted production at the affected manufacturing facility in Mexico, hired a crisis management company to issue refunds to customers who bought recalled products, and reached out by email and social media to inform the public. A spokesperson for Born Basic said in an Aug. 16, 2020, email that hand sanitizer products currently on store shelves are safe. According to the FDA , ""Substantial methanol exposure could result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death."" Starting in June 2020, amid a buying frenzy of the products during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA warned the public to avoid a growing list of hand sanitizers that were contaminated with methanol. As The Associated Press reported in July 2020, ""The active ingredient that kills germs in legitimate sanitizers is ethyl alcohol, which is consumable. But some Mexican companies have been replacing it with poisonous methanol, or wood alcohol, which is used in antifreeze."" In a statement released July 2, 2020, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said : All Americans should practice good hand hygiene, which includes using alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not readily available. Unfortunately, there are some companies taking advantage of the increased usage of hand sanitizer during the coronavirus pandemic and putting lives at risk by selling products with dangerous and unacceptable ingredients. Consumers and health care providers should not use methanol-containing hand sanitizers. The list of hand sanitizer brands the FDA is warning against has ballooned to more than 130 brands.

2e3d5793-897a-46a0-aac5-907f0553903b,"Rumors are surging in the wake of George Floyd's death and resulting protests against police violence and racial injustice in the United States. Stay informed. Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here . Viral videos showing what appeared to be protesters in Portland, Oregon, burning American flags and Bibles made waves over the first weekend of August 2020, following more than two straight months of protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd , a Black man who died in Minneapolis in May 2020 while in police custody. Snopes readers asked us to investigate whether these allegations were factual. After speaking to an eyewitness and police, we conclude that the claim about Portland protesters is true. Tweets shared by Danny Peterson , a reporter with CBS station KOIN 6 , showed several videos and photos of protesters burning American flags and open books that resemble the Bible, as well as several other items, including newspapers and a pizza box. Although videos show items being tossed into a fire and burned, it was not obvious which protest group was affiliated with those actions and whether the books being burned were, in fact, Bibles. Snopes spoke with Peterson, who said that he had seen a truck handing out free Bibles earlier in the day and confirmed with protesters that the book he saw burning was a Bible. The videos were captured outside the Mark O. Hatfield U. S. Federal Courthouse, the epicenter of a months-long clash between federal agents and Black Lives Matter protesters. Peterson described the fires as having happened organically and began after most of the peaceful protesters had left the area. Conservative publications and social media users laid blame on “anarchists,” the “radical left,” and Black Lives Matter protesters for allegedly burning the flags and Bibles, but officials did not confirm which group the culprits were affiliated with. The groups burning Bibles and American flags did not self-identify with any particular group, Peterson told us. ""Many of these protests have been a non-homogeneous mixture of people with greatly varying political ideologies, and this night was no exception, from what I could tell,"" he said. According to his accounts, there wasn't ""much violence in the area,"" but the burning of Bibles and American flags seemed intentional and appeared to be a political expression of some sort and were not just ""coincidental objects that people burned in order to make a fire."" Weekend protests began the night of July 31 and were largely peaceful before escalating the following morning, according to a statement released by the Portland Police Bureau (PPB). The agency noted that protesters ""lit fires, climbed the fence outside the federal courthouse, threw objects and chanted.” The statement read, ""On August 1, 2020, at about 1:30 a.m. people started a bonfire in the middle of Southwest 3rd Avenue in front of the federal courthouse. People brought plywood and other flammable material to keep it going. Over the next hour, the number of people dwindled to a few dozen.” In an email to Snopes, PPB Sgt. Kevin Allen wrote that he was unable to confirm whether Bibles and flags were among the items burned, and that the fires were not considered an immediate threat. In the interest of de-escalation, police did not interact with the crowd. The fire was reportedly put out by members of Moms United for Black Lives Matter, and the crowd had largely dispersed by 2:30 a.m. on Aug. 2. A video clip of the Portland Bible burning circulated by the Kremlin-backed news agency Ruptly appeared to be among the first viral Russian disinformation campaigns in advance of the 2020 presidential election, according to an Aug. 10 report by The New York Times . The publication likened this form of “information laundering” to money laundering in which Russian news outlets elaborate upon a “kernel of truth” to spin the event into larger, more polarizing issues that exacerbate already tense issues to further separate American voters and political parties.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,753

From April 10, 2020, to June 27, 2020, 13 sisters from the same convent in Michigan died from COVID-19, prompting Snopes readers to ask if that particularly concentrated pandemic tragedy was true. Sadly, it is true. Twelve sisters from Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Convent in Livonia, Michigan, died within 30 days of each other during an outbreak of the coronavirus disease between April 10 and May 10. Another sister died on June 27. Suzanne English, executive director of mission advancement for the Felician Sisters of North America — the congregation that the sisters belonged to — told us in a statement that although not all 13 sisters were tested, their symptoms were ""inline with COVID"" amid the outbreak at the convent. In the case of the final fatality on June 27, English said, ""the Sister had been COVID-positive and while she had passed the 28-day quarantine, we believe it was the lingering effects that caused her death."" Although some news reports referred to the women as ""nuns,"" English pointed out that because the Felicians are monastic (living under religious vows), they are correctly referred to as ""sisters.""

Seventeen recovered, English said in an email, citing Sister Noel Marie Gabriel, director of clinical health services for the Felicians. According to Global Sisters Report, a news publication focusing on Catholic sisters and current events, the 13 sisters who passed were heavily involved in their community, performing services like working as nurses, educators, and librarians. ""That was our most tragic time,"" Sister Gabriel told the publication. ""It was a month of tragedy and sorrow and mourning and grieving.""

Snopes readers asked us to look into one such gathering on the Fourth of July, when a group of heavily armed Black militia members allegedly marched on a Confederate monument in Georgia’s Stone Mountain Park: News reports and statements from park officials confirm that this rally did indeed take place, though social media posts such as the above misrepresented significant details of the event. Around 1,000 predominantly Black militia members, wearing paramilitary-style clothing and wielding rifles, gathered at the Stone Mountain sculpture of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and military leaders Robert E. Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson. White nationalist rallies have taken place there in the past, and the monument has historical ties to the Ku Klux Klan. The group behind the march, known as the Not Fucking Around Coalition (they have no known affiliation with the Black Panther Party, contrary to what is stated in the tweet above), identifies as an all-Black militia, and said they were also not connected to the Black Lives Matter movement. Speakers at the rally challenged white supremacists to face them, and called for the monument's removal. While the majority of attendees were Black, Reuters reported that individuals of other ethnicities were also spotted in the crowd. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZgH-x_UWcw&feature=emb_title The group also had a police escort , and the march was peaceful. John Bankhead, a spokesperson for the Stone Mountain Memorial Association, the organization that operates the park, said: It's a public park, state park. We have these protests on both sides of the issue from time to time. We respect people's First Amendment right to exercise those rights. We understand the sensitivity of the issues here at the park and the dark past so we respect that and allow them to come in. As long as it's peaceful, which it has been, then that's fine. Snopes reached out to the park's association for more information, and will update this article if we hear back. Given the ample media coverage, footage of the Black militia, and statements from park officials confirming that such a march did take place, we rate this claim as “True.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,455

In July 2020, as America's total of confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed 3.3 million, U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the advice of public health experts on how to safely reopen the country's K-12 school system during the pandemic, and campaigned in full force for in-person classes to resume nationwide . The push by the Republican president included threats to withhold federal funding to school systems that did not agree with his approach (see the July 8, 2020, tweet here ), unsubstantiated claims that state Democrats had political motivations to keep schools closed ahead of the November 2020 election, and several media appearances in which he and ally Betsy DeVos, the secretary of education, emphasized how opening K-12 classrooms would jump-start the country's distressed economy. And during that parade of public events, critics of the country's top education official and the president claimed that DeVos had nonchalantly stated the cost of young American's lives should schools fully reopen during the pandemic. Facebook statuses and tweets went viral among educators, parents and activists, stating: It's unclear from where, exactly, the claim originated. And first, to measure its legitimacy, we did some back-of-the-napkin math. According to the National Center for Education Statistics , the federal government prepared for 56.6 million K-12 students in fall 2019 (50.8 million in public schools and 5.8 million in private education). That means 11,320 — not 14,740 — is .02% of the country's student population. Apart from the statement's inaccuracy, our analysis of DeVos' public appearances found no evidence to show she made the comment. We deemed several speeches at the White House, as well as televised interviews on CNN's "" State of the Union "" and "" Fox News Sunday "" on July 12, 2020, as the likely sources of inspiration for the rumor, considering the timing and content of those events. In the first of those appearances, which took place on July 7, 2020, for instance, DeVos said: It’s clear our nation’s schools must fully reopen and fully operate this school year.  Anything short of that robs students, not to mention taxpayers, of their futures — and their futures represent our nation’s future. So it’s not a question of 'if'; it’s just a question of 'how.' The following day, after a meeting of the White House coronavirus task force, she made similar remarks, and praised several school systems for their quick transition to remote learning in the early weeks of the outbreak, including New York City's Success Academy Charter Schools and Miami-Dade County Public Schools . Simultaneously, she claimed, other local school districts were ""doing next to nothing"" to teach students during the unprecedented rules against in-classroom learning. Three days later, DeVos addressed CNN's audience via an interview on why she believed schools should fully reopen in the fall, even though the country's daily spike in COVID-19 cases was on the rise and did not show signs of a decline. There, DeVos mostly re-emphasized talking points she made during the White House briefings and downplayed the health risks to students should schools fully reopen, essentially affirming the underlying sentiment to critics' claim about the projected death toll. DeVos stated, referring to ""data"" that she did not define: There's nothing in the data that would suggest that kids being back in school is, is dangerous to them — in fact, it's more a matter of their health and well-being that they be back in school. In both the CNN and Fox News interviews, DeVos pointed to research that suggests children are less likely to suffer severe symptoms due to COVID-19 compared to adults. While people of any age with certain underlying conditions are at higher risk of serious illnesses should they catch COVID-19, children are more likely than adults to have mild illnesses, and patients over the age of 18 may have different symptoms than youth, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). According to a study of U.S. children infected with COVID-19 between February and April 2020 by the CDC, for instance, the youth population made up less than 2% of the country's cases, totaling 150,000. Additionally, three COVID-19 patients under the age of 18 died during that time frame, compared to roughly 5,450 fatal cases among adults. The study stated: [Relatively] few children with COVID-19 are hospitalized, and fewer children than adults experience fever, cough, or shortness of breath. ... Social distancing and everyday preventive behaviors remain important for all age groups because patients with less serious illness and those without symptoms likely play an important role in disease transmission. In other words, the CDC says : ""If children meet in groups, it can put everyone at risk. Children can pass this virus onto others who have an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19."" DeVos said school systems should consider those recommendations on a case-by-case basis, and urged local leaders to consider ""granular data"" that depicts COVID-19's impact on their community, specifically. However, at no point during the broadcast interviews or the previously-mentioned White House speeches in July 2020 did the education secretary make the alleged statement about a percentage of students dying as a result of COVID-19 when schools fully reopen. Additionally, there was no evidence that she had made the statement on social media accounts, nor via press releases, around the time the claim went viral. For those reasons, we rate this claim ""False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1122

62b89579-f9d9-4c0a-b00d-8c36b89c330b,"In July 2020, some social media users accused the furniture store Wayfair of trafficking children. This gravely serious accusation was not based on police reports, firsthand accounts, financial records, or deep investigative reporting. Rather, it was based on the fact that some items on Wayfair were listed at exorbitant prices compared to other, similar items. This rumor appears to have originated on the ""conspiracy"" section of Reddit on July 9, 2020. That post noted that Wayfair was selling utility closets from WFX that were priced at more than $10,000, and offered child trafficking as a possible explanation. That post, like so many other conspiracy theories, offered this notion as a mere possibility and said that it would be stomach churning ""if ... true."" Is it possible Wayfair involved in Human trafficking with their WFX Utility collection? Or are these just extremely overpriced cabinets? (Note the names of the cabinets) this makes me sick to my stomach if it’s true :( This post led to other users combing the Wayfair website in search of other oddities. One Twitter user, for instance, found a set of pillows and shower curtains that were listed for $9,999. As similar items on the website were listed for only $99, this person assumed that the only logical explanation was that the higher priced item was being used to traffic children. The Twitter user wrote : If you search bungalow rose a bunch of shower curtains and pillows show up priced at $9,999. Wayfair is fucking trafficking children what the FUCK Same with other things. They all have big price jumps to like 10 grand. Wayfair also supplies the furniture at ICE detention centers, where children are going MISSING from Generally speaking, the images showing expensive cabinets and large price differentials on pillows, shower curtains, and other items on Wayfair's website are real. However, it takes quite a leap in logic to arrive at the conclusion that this is evidence that the store is engaged in child trafficking. In fact, the more we pondered this claim, the more nonsensical it appeared. Would a large business really use their official website to allow people to purchase children online? As these items are available to anyone with internet access, wouldn't it be possible for someone to accidentally become involved in child trafficking? Why would a child trafficking operation use a method that would be so easy to track? This claim is largely based on the idea that $10,000 is simply too expensive for a cabinet, and that there has to be some other explanation — child trafficking — to justify its cost. In a statement to Newsweek, however, Wayfair noted that these were industrial grade cabinets, and that they had been accurately priced. Wayfair said that they temporarily removed these items, as the accompanying descriptions did not accurately explain the reason for the price point. Wayfair told Newsweek in a statement: ""There is, of course, no truth to these claims. The products in question are industrial grade cabinets that are accurately priced. Recognizing that the photos and descriptions provided by the supplier did not adequately explain the high price point, we have temporarily removed the products from site to rename them and to provide a more in-depth description and photos that accurately depict the product to clarify the price point."" We reached out to Wayfair for more information about the expensive pillows and shower curtains, but have yet to receive a response. As this rumor circulated on social media, people chimed in with additional ""evidence"" of Wayfair's supposedly nefarious activities. For instance, some claimed that searching for the stock keeping unit number (SKU) associated with these items preceded by the term ""src usa"" on the Russian search engine Yandex returned images of young female children. This is, bizarrely, true. However, searching for just about any random string of numbers preceded by the “src usa” returns similar results. It's possible that these search results are connected to the Russian image hosting website ""Imgsrc,"" which has previously hosted child pornography images. We reached out to Yandex for more information about these search results, and will update this article accordingly. Others claimed that these products carried the names of children who had gone missing. One cabinet, for instance, appeared on Wayfair as the ""Anabel 5-shelf storage unit."" This, according to proponents of this theory, corresponded with an Anabel Wilson who had gone missing in Kansas. While this may seem suspicious to those seeking a pattern, it should be noted that there were more than 400,000 entries for missing juveniles in the FBI’s National Crime Information Center in 2019. In other words, the fact that some of these product names were the same as the first names of children who had gone missing could easily be nothing more than a coincidence. Furthermore, some of the missing children cases this theory attempted to connect to Wayfair have already been solved. The ""Alyvia"" shelf, for example, was supposedly connected to Alyvia Navarro. This autistic child went missing at the age of 3 in 2013 and, unfortunately, was found dead shortly after she went missing, having drowned in a nearby pond. On July 13, 2020, proponents of this theory started sharing a mugshot of a man in a Wayfair shirt and claimed that he had recently been arrested as part of a trafficking ring. This is a genuine photograph of Fredrick Walker Jr. who was arrested on June 21, 2020, during a prostitution sting in Barnesville, Georgia. However, those sharing this image as ""proof"" of this Wayfair conspiracy theory failed to mention that this person was just one of nearly two dozen people who were arrested during this sting, that none of the other people arrested were wearing Wayfair shirts, that news reports about the arrest made no mention about any connection to the store, and that there's no evidence that the victims in this case were children. The claim that Wayfair is trafficking children is based almost entirely on one person's confusion over an expensive cabinet. This conspiracy theory, like so many conspiracy theories, started with a wild and unfounded assumption that would be sickening if it were actually true. As of this writing, absolutely no credible evidence has been offered to back up this accusation. But the conspiracy theory did have real impact. According to a July 20 press release from Polaris, its National Human Trafficking Hotline (1-888-373-7888) received such an ""extreme volume"" of reports related to this rumor (none of which contained information beyond what was already reported online) that it struggled to respond to other calls from people potentially in need. The statement encouraged callers to learn more about "" what human trafficking really looks like .""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1274
bf17e093-4620-4af1-8e68-3acfa6d18a0d,"In June 2020, a meme supposedly showing a picture of 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Joe Biden's great-grandfather, Joseph J. Biden -- including a piece of text claiming that he was a Confederate soldier who owned slaves in the 1800's -- was widely circulated on social media: This is not a photograph of Joe Biden's great-grandfather, and the claim that ""Joseph J. Biden"" was a Confederate soldier who owned slaves is unfounded. While this meme went viral in June 2020, it's actually been circulating for more than a decade. The earliest iteration we could find was posted to the Blogspot blog Truth First back in 2008, when Biden was running for vice president alongside then-presidential candidate Barack Obama. That posting included no supporting information to back up its claims, and in the 12 years since its posting, no sources to support this claim have emerged. We were also unable to find any mention of a great-grandfather named Joseph J. Biden in any of the material we examined while researching Biden’s family tree. In 2016, the Irish Family History Research Center traced the Irish side of Biden's family tree back six generations. On his side, then-vice president Biden's great-grandfathers were James Finnegan, born in Ireland in 1840, and Edward Francis Blewitt, born in 1859. The Irish Family History Research Center writes : The Vice President’s great-great grandfather, Owen Finnegan, left in the late 1840's for America. Previous research undertaken by genealogist Megan Smolenyak identified Owen’s marriage in 1839 to Jean Boyle in county Louth. Owen and Jean’s first four children were born here, including the Vice President’s great-grandfather, James Finnegan born 1840. The Vice President’s earliest traceable direct ancestor is his great-great-great grandfather Edward Blewitt (ca. 1795-1872), born in north county Mayo, Ireland. Our first documentary evidence for Edward Blewitt is in the parish records for Kilmoremoy, in the picturesque town of Ballina. The town’s name is derived from the Irish ‘mouth of the river or ford’ and it is located at the head of the river Moy overlooking Killala Bay. It was here that we know that at least three children were born to Edward Blewitt and Mary Mulderg, including the Vice President’s great-great grandfather, Patrick Blewitt baptised in 1832, when the couple were living in Patrick Street, part of Garden Street, in the heart of the town. It is disappointing that parish registers for Kilmoremoy only start in 1823 for baptisms and marriage's preventing us from determining Edward Blewitt's exact year of birth. Details about the other side of Biden's family are less clear. Still, there's no evidence to suggest that Biden's great-grandfather was a Confederate soldier and slave owner. Biden's father's family came from England, and they arrived in America (specifically in Baltimore, Maryland) sometime in the 1840s. A passage from David Hagan's ""No Ordinary Joe: The Life and Career of Joe Biden"" gives some insight into Biden's family history: Biden's father's family has been traced back to an Englishman from Sussex, William Biden, who was born around the same time as Edward Blewitt and who died in Baltimore in the 1840s. Elsewhere on that side of the family, there were more Irish and French ancestors, which explains Biden's unusual middle name, Robinette. According to family folklore, the Robinettes, Joe Biden's grandmother's family, crossed the Atlantic with Lafayette, the young Frenchmen who served as a General in the American army during the War of Independence, and never returned. Biden's paternal grandfather, Joseph H. Biden, was from Baltimore and worked as a salesman in the oil industry. USA Today identified Biden's great-grandfather as George T. Biden , not Joseph J. Biden as claimed in the meme, who was born in 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War. Biden's great-great grandfather was named Joseph H. Biden (some genealogy sites list him as Joseph J.H. Biden,) and he lived during the Civil War. However, Biden's great-great grandfather was on a draft registration list for the Union Army, not the Confederacy, and the Maryland State Archives (where Biden's great-grandfather and great-great grandfather lived) do not list any Bidens as slave owners. The Maryland State Archives ""Legacy of Slavery"" website does list a few ""Robinettes"" who owned slaves during the 1830s. However, it's unclear how (or if) this family is related to the Bidens. The former vice president's middle name, Robinette, is the same as his grandmother's maiden name, Mary Elizabeth Biden (Robinette). However, we've been unable to trace a direct line from Biden's grandmother to the Robinettes on Maryland's Legacy of Slavery website. While it's possible that the former vice president's mother's mother's parents' parents' are listed on this website, it's also possible that the two-generation gap between Mary Elizabeth Biden (Robinette) and the Robinettes on this list of slave owners is filled with non-paternal or maternal ancestors. Regardless, this image does not show the former veep's great-grandfather ""Joseph J. Biden,"" a confederate soldier who owned slaves. So who does this image show? What About the Image? The image at the center of this meme does not show a member of the Biden family. We reached out to Kurt Luther, an associate professor of computer science at Virginia Tech and founder of "" Civil War Photo Sleuth ,"" an online tool that helps users identify soldiers in old Civil War photographs, for help unmasking the individual in this photograph. The man in this photo is not Biden's great-grandfather ""Joseph J. Biden."" This image actually shows a man named Richard Young Bennett , a Confederate soldier who served with Mississippi's 2nd Infantry during the Civil War. Furthermore, Luther was unable to find any Confederate soldiers with the surname ""Biden"" in various Civil War soldier databases he examined. ""I don't know anything about Joe Biden's ancestry,"" he said, ""but I can confirm by searching a couple of Civil War soldier databases that there was no Confederate soldier with the surname Biden."" To sum up The viral meme claims that an image shows Joseph J. Biden, former Vice President Joe Biden’s great-grandfather, slave owner, and confederate soldier. But, that isn’t the case. The man in this photograph is actually a Civil War soldier named Richard Young Bennett who has no connection to the Biden family. Furthermore, Biden’s paternal great-great grandfather was George T. Biden, not Joseph J. Biden, and we found no “Bidens” in the databases examined regarding Civil War soldiers or slave owners. While there are members of the “Robinette” family listed in Maryland’s database of slave owners from 1830, it’s unclear how this family is related (if at all) to the former vice president.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1321

Generally speaking, these posts made inflammatory and violent claims, then falsely attributed them to BLM. For example, one such hoax held that BLM protesters were going to ""assassinate white families."" In June 2020, Snopes came across yet another flyer falsely attributed to Black Lives Matter that labeled white men, women, and children as ""the enemy"": But this is not a genuine flyer issued or endorsed by Black Lives Matter. This is a piece of racist propaganda that was created in an apparent attempt to smear BLM and heighten racial tensions. It isn't clear who created this fake poster. The earliest posting that we could find was from June 11, 2020, from a Twitter account devoted to QAnon , a wide-ranging and far-right conspiracy theory based almost entirely on anonymous social media posts that claim a “deep state” plot exists against President Donald Trump. From there, it was shared to the Russian site Aftershock.news ; an All Lives Matter account; and an account adorned with British flags, where it received thousands of retweets. While we've found several accounts sharing this flyer along with messages denigrating Black Lives Matter, we've yet to see any accounts connected to the Black Lives Matter movement sharing this flyer in earnest. In addition to the fact that this flyer originated with posters critical of BLM — and not with BLM accounts spreading this message in earnest — the statements on this flyer are also contrary to the positions of the Black Lives Matter movement. Nowhere on the Black Lives Matter website are white people identified as ""enemies,"" and the website is void of any calls to violence against white people. BLM has also not called for ""re-education camps,"" for ""Black power"" to run the government, or for white people to stop dating outside their race. The official Black Lives Matter website has put out a list of ""demands,"" but that list has practically nothing in common with the viral hoax shown above. The official list from Black Lives Matter calls for an end to systematic racism and for the national defunding of police: We call for an end to the systemic racism that allows this culture of corruption to go unchecked and our lives to be taken. We call for a national defunding of police. We demand investment in our communities and the resources to ensure Black people not only survive, but thrive. If you’re with us, add your name to the petition right now and help us spread the word. The ""demands"" on the hoax flyer did not originate with BLM. The items on this list are examples of what someone who is unfamiliar with the Black Lives Matter movement may fear are central tenets of this group. When a similar fake flyer was found in England, a local BLM activist told Scotland's Evening Telegraph : Joy Gansh, a local BLM activist, believes the display was created by people trying to discredit the movement. She said: “Things like that, after what happened with the George Floyd mural being defaced, I think that’s something that a white supremacist would put up to discredit us. “Nobody that I’ve seen advocating for the BLM movement would think that that is appropriate. My personal opinion is that this is people being framed. This is a way to make us seem in the wrong.” The art student, who plans to organise a BLM march in Dundee soon, believes that “white supremacists” are using false posters to encourage violence. “People that hold those kinds of beliefs aren’t part of this movement,” she added. ""This seems like a way to stop us in our tracks and make us seem violent so they can come back with violence. We aren’t here for violence, we’re just here for justice and equality in all aspects of life.” This fake flyer, as well as similar items, have been pushed on internet forums such as 4chan in an explicit attempt to smear the Black Lives Matter movement. In one post, for example, a 4chan poster states that ""people are falling for this [hoax flyer], let's kick it into overdrive."" In another thread , users exchange various fake BLM posters and encourage each other to share them. In another thread , a user gives instructions on how to make and spread this racist propaganda: The only thing maintaining the completely bizarre state of affairs the USA and the world is in right now is the fact that some white people still think they can be on the ""right side of history"" by kneeling for the Noseberg-controlled BLM movement. We can destroy their whole plan. Make propaganda posters and spread them around. If enough whites realize that blacks will never ever feel that anything is ""enough"", they'll abandon the movement.

It's true that Lowe's has created a $25 million grant for minority-owned small businesses trying to reopen after being forced to close due to the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic. As CNBC reported on May 20, 2020: Lowe’s is dishing out the funds to help small businesses, especially home improvement professionals, in need of masks, personal protective equipment and other supplies to operate safely. The new funds follow $340 million of support the home improvement retailer provided for Covid-19 response activities in the first quarter. “These are going to be minority businesses and other businesses that are now starting to reopen,” CEO Marvin Ellison told CNBC’s Jim Cramer in a “Mad Money” interview. “So we just want to continue to not only run a good business but also be a great corporate citizen in all of the communities that we operate in.” It is also true that Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus donated $7 million to U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. He vowed to again support Trump in his 2020 run against presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Marcus, a philanthropist who gives billions of dollars away to various causes, is generally a large-ticket financial supporter of Republican politicians and organizations. But he also retired from his position as Home Depot's company chairman in 2002. (Home Depot's other co-founder, Arthur Blank, who is also retired from the company, appears to donate primarily to Democrats.) The Home Depot political action committee on the other hand has contributed a total of $1,495,000 to both Democratic and Republican federal candidates in 2020, with 44% of those contributions going to Democrats and 56% to Republicans, according to the campaign transparency tracking tool Open Secrets. Meantime the political action committee for Lowe's donated a total of $540,500 to federal candidates in both parties, with 30% going to Democrats and 70% to Republicans, per Open Secrets. Political action committees (PACs) associated with corporations are separate organizations that are funded by employees or owners of the company (but not the company itself). These PACs donate money to political candidates and organizations they believe to be ""aligned with their financial goals,"" explains Open Secrets. Given the meme leaves out important context about political contributions and Marcus' current involvement with Home Depot, we rate this claim ""Mostly true.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,476
38802d7b-3636-47c4-8813-a85f647daa90,"On June 3, 2020, a video supposedly showing two segments from Laura Ingraham's Fox News show ""The Ingraham Angle"" dealing with athletes expressing their political opinions started to circulate on social media. Both of the clips featured in this video are genuine. The first segment aired on Ingraham's show in February 2018 and shows the Fox News host telling NBA stars LeBron James and Kevin Durant, both black men, to ""shut up and dribble"" after they criticized U.S. President Donald Trump and spoke out about racism in the United States. Ingraham said at the time : Must they run their mouths like that? Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids: This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid $100 million a year to bounce a ball. Oh, and LeBron and Kevin? You're great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, shut up and dribble. Here's a longer version of the clip: The second clip comes from June 3, 2020, and shows Ingraham defending Drew Brees after the NFL star, a white man, said that he would ""never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag"" when he was asked about football players kneeling during the National Anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice. Ingraham said: Well he's allowed to have his view of what kneeling and the flag means to him. I mean, he's a person. He has some worth, I would imagine. This is beyond football though. This is totalitarian conduct. This is Stalinist. And by the way on the streets of New Orleans they are shouting 'F Drew Brees.' That's what this moment has done to the beautiful team spirit of the New Orleans Saints... He's giving $5 million to charity by the way. A longer clip of this segment is viewable at The Daily Beast . While Ingraham defended Brees' remarks, the NFL player later apologized to his teammates, his fans, and the people of New Orleans, writing: ""I would like to apologize to my friends, teammates, the City of New Orleans, the black community, NFL community and anyone I hurt with my comments yesterday. In speaking with some of you, it breaks my heart to know the pain I have caused. In an attempt to talk about respect, unity, and solidarity centered around the American flag and the national anthem, I made comments that were insensitive and completely missed the mark on the issues we are facing right now as a country."" Ingraham addressed the controversy stemming from comparisons of her comments on Brees and James in a follow-up segment on June 5, in which she noted a ""nuance between the two instances"" and said, ""Every American, every American has the God-given right to speak his mind on any issue.""

Read our special coverage, contribute to support our mission, and submit any tips or claims you see here . On May 25, 2020, a video surfaced online showing a white Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of a black man, George Floyd, who pleaded he couldn't breathe and who later died. Two days later, social media users claimed the officer ⁠— whom news reports had identified as Derek Chauvin ⁠— had shared a stage with U.S. President Donald Trump at a Minneapolis rally in October 2019, where the president supposedly praised Chauvin for his service. The claim — which spread online simultaneously with a photograph that users believed to show Chauvin wearing a ""Make Whites Great Again"" hat ( here's our fact check of that claim ) — spurred Americans' outrage over what they described as the senseless killing of Floyd by police. One person said on Twitter in reference to Chauvin's alleged support for Trump: ... I keep telling folks, this is what’s at stake in 2020, these are the people who the President gives a wink and a nod to when it comes to murdering black people Multiple sources told the Star Tribune newspaper that Chauvin, 44, was the officer seen in the viral video kneeling on and pinning down Floyd before his death at a local hospital. Four officers involved in the case (including Chauvin) were fired from the city's police department on May 26, and the FBI was investigating under what circumstances, exactly, Floyd died. The photos in the above-mentioned claim are indeed from a Trump rally at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis on Oct. 10, 2019. But they do not show Chauvin. Here's what happened at the rally: Led by Lt. Bob Kroll, the head of the Minneapolis police union, a group of about a dozen people wearing red ""Cops for Trump"" T-shirts shared the stage with the president for about three minutes during the hours-long event. Kroll addressed the crowd, thanking Trump for his support for law enforcement, and each member of the group shook hands with the president, with some of them giving him a hug. ""I came right here to Minnesota, and I pledged to address this really important issue, and it’s the issue of law enforcement,"" Trump told the crowd. ""The respect that we have for law enforcement is unbound."" Among the people who hugged Trump was a man who at one point held a sign that read ""LAW & ORDER VOTE TRUMP"" above his head on stage with a big smile. He was the person at the center of the May 2020 online buzz. In a phone interview with Snopes early May 27, 2020, Sgt. John Elder, a spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department, essentially debunked the assertion, while emphasizing that whoever was photographed at the rally was not on duty and, therefore, not covered by parameters on which the department would comment. Asked explicitly if the man photographed on stage with Trump at the Minneapolis rally is Chauvin, Elder said: I don’t think it is. I think it’s one of our retired officers. … The people that were front and center were federation folks and some were retired federation folks, and he (the officer involved in Floyd’s death) doesn’t fall anywhere in that category. It could be, but I’ll tell you, I certainly don’t think it is. My official comment is: Whoever it is, is off duty. Later that day, journalists with TV station FOX9 contacted Kroll, the leader of the ""Cops for Trump"" group at the rally, who also said the officer in question was not Chauvin. Then, on May 28, 2020, Kroll went further with his comments and identified the man in question as Bloomington Police Federation President Mike Gallagher. “Can you put a stop to the false narrative please?” Kroll told the AP . “None of the officers in the incident were near the Trump rally.” In sum, given the differences in appearance between the Minneapolis police officer shown in the video kneeling on Floyd and the person on stage with Trump, the Minneapolis Police Department's spokesman's belief that it was not Chauvin photographed front and center at the rally, and Kroll's comments to journalists, we rate this claim ""False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,855

In early May 2020, various websites and commentators claimed that Kansas City, Missouri, was ordering churches to turn over lists of attendees to the government. The commentary posted by evangelical groups implied that the measures persecuted Christians, with one of the more sensational takes gaining online traction. ""Never in our wildest dreams could we have imagined Nazi-like measures designed to surveil, track and spy upon what was once a FREE American people,"" wrote Matt Staver, founder and chairman of Liberty Counsel, a non-profit legal organization that advocates for evangelical causes, in a blog post dated May 1, 2020. The comparison of Kansas City's public health policy amid the COVID-19 coronavirus disease pandemic to the tactics of the genocidal, fascist Third Reich was echoed on the website for conservative radio host Todd Starnes , which ran a headline reading, ""'NAZI-LIKE MEASURES' Kansas City Orders Churches to Turn Over Membership Lists."" These characterizations of Kansas City's rollout of reopening measures for establishments closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic were based on a version of Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas’s stay-at-home order that ultimately never went into effect. The policy, announced April 29, 2020, stipulated that beginning May 6, non-essential businesses and other establishments previously closed due to COVID-19 safety precautions could reopen but would be expected to observe social distancing practices and, depending on crowd size, implement record-keeping measures ""to ensure adequate confidential public health tracing"" while in operation. In a statement, Lucas said the information would be used so that the organization itself or the city's health department ""can advise people who may have been exposed to an ill person, and so that we can limit community spread to their friends or family."" The mayor stated that the city is asking establishments ""like many church gatherings on Sundays, restaurants with reservations, or stylists with appointments,"" to keep those records on hand for 30 days in the event that the establishment turns out to be the location of a COVID-19 cluster. The version of the order signed by Lucas on April 30 (archived here ) contained language that appeared to make such record-keeping mandatory. It said that non-essential businesses, for example, “must maintain a record of time of service for customers on the premises in a seated capacity for more than ten (10) minutes.” And it appeared to condition the resumption of religious gatherings on a similar record-keeping requirement: Religious gatherings, including, but not limited to, weddings, funerals, memorial services, and wakes, of ten (10) persons inside or ten (10) percent of building occupancy (whichever number is greater) and fifty (50) people outside may resume, provided social distancing is maintained and event organizers maintain a record of attendees. Data obtained by the Department of Public Health, pursuant to this provision, shall, to the extent allowed by law, remain confidential in accordance with professional public health standards and may be used only to address public health concerns. That specific language never went into effect, however, because Lucas signed a new version of the order on May 4 clarifying that such record-keeping, for both business and religious gatherings, would be strictly voluntary. This was the revised language applicable to religious gatherings: In the interest of public health and to avoid a Covid-19 outbreak in the community, event organizers should consider maintaining a record of attendees where appropriate. Attendees are not required, however, to provide their names or contact information at any religious gathering. In the event of a Covid-19 outbreak connected to a religious gathering, a religious gathering may contact those potentially exposed and, subject to confidentiality, provide the names and other relevant information voluntarily provided at the gathering to the Department of Public Health. Liberty Counsel noted this change in a follow-up blog post on May 5, attributing the revision to an “overwhelming public outcry.” A city spokesperson released the following statement regarding the updated guidance: After issuing last week’s Order (April 29), Mayor Lucas understood this recommendation to be one that would continue to be backed primarily by voluntary self-compliance – like many of our orders and regular ordinances. Late last week and over the weekend, the mayor felt guidance expressing the voluntary nature of the requirement would be helpful, so the City could discuss the core public health needs addressed by allowing for contact tracing, rather than engaging in ad nauseum political debate. He was able to sign the updated language Monday (May 4). For us, it’s more about contact tracing than issuing ordinance violations, but we thought guidance was vital to support public health and contact tracing capabilities. The city's measures were drawn from guidance issued by various public health and planning organizations, including Kansas City Health Director Rex Archer, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Wisconsin Department of Health Services, American Planning Association, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), according Kansas City Health spokeswoman Michelle Pekarsky. The current version of an FAQ published by the city states: One of the primary means for transmission of COVID-19 is in-person interactions that last more than a few minutes. While not required, by recording customer names, businesses will enable the Kansas City Health Department to more quickly trace, test, and isolate individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 if an employee or customer had the virus at the time they frequented the business. All data will remain confidential and will be used only to address public health concerns and contact individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19. Kansas City is not requiring establishments, including churches, to keep lists of attendees for mandated government surveillance purposes but is instead instructing that they should consider doing so in the interests of public health. An early, unimplemented version of the mayor’s order did contain wording indicating that such record-keeping would be required, but it didn't single out churches and ultimately never went into effect as written. We therefore rate this claim “False.”",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1222

In early March 2020, amid the COVID-19 coronavirus disease outbreak that would later grow into a pandemic, the massive retail and delivery company Amazon launched the Amazon Relief Fund, which among other things, offers grants to contract and seasonal workers so they can receive sick pay if they contract the coronavirus. The $25 million fund established by Amazon sparked an online backlash after a liberal newsletter pointed out that seasonal and contract workers would have to file an application to receive the funds, and that Amazon, a behemoth corporation whose founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is the richest person in the world, solicited public donations for the program. Anger over the idea that a famously profitable corporation was soliciting donations from the public to fund sick leave for some of its workforce during a pandemic was initiated by reporting from Popular Information, described as a ""newsletter about politics and power."" The letter's founder, Judd Legum, posted this Twitter thread on March 24, 2020: We reached out to Amazon for comment and received the following statement: We are not and have not asked for donations and the Amazon Relief Fund has been funded by Amazon with an initial donation of $25 million. The structure to operate a fund like this, which hundreds of companies do through the same third-party, requires the program to be open to public contributions but we are not soliciting those contributions in any way. Amazon truly did launch a $25 million fund to provide sick leave for contract workers and seasonal employees through a grant program to which those workers must file applications before receiving benefits. Although the wording on the page has since been updated to indicate that donations are not expected, initially the language did indicate that Amazon was seeking — or at the very least suggesting — donations. An archived version of the page from March 19, 2020, included this statement (shown in the screen capture below): ""The Fund relies primarily on individual donations from individuals and support from Amazon.com Services LLC to fund this program."" The page has since been updated . The highlighted sentence above was removed and the page now explicitly states that donations from the public are not expected, as follows: We reached out to Legum, who told us via email that he believed Amazon changed the wording on the relief fund page ""because the optics were clearly bad and the company is trying to cover up its actions."" Legum added that in his view, ""Amazon has ample resources to simply pay their contractors while they are out sick during this pandemic."" According to Amazon's announcement , the Amazon Relief Fund will provide their delivery partners and drivers ""the ability to apply for grants approximately equal to up to two-weeks of pay if diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon."" Additionally, the statement reads, ""this fund will support our employees and contractors around the world who face financial hardships from other qualifying events, such as a natural disaster, federally declared emergency, or unforeseen personal hardship. Applicants can apply and receive a personal grant from the fund ranging from $400 to $5,000 USD per person."" The company also announced it is offering unlimited unpaid time off for hourly staff during the month of March. Whether or not Amazon actively solicited donations, the original wording on its Amazon Relief Fund page did call for individuals to donate to the fund. Even though the wording has been updated to state explicitly that no donations from the public are expected, a ""Donate"" button still exists on the page, which could be interpreted as an invitation to do so. We therefore rate this claim ""True.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,775
9e63c460-0674-4f1b-99eb-ad5e85c17ad3,"In March 2020, shortly after Democratic candidates Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren all announced that they were dropping out of the U.S. presidential race, a message started to circulate on social media which claimed that the three previous presidents, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, would all be the youngest candidates in the 2020 presidential race if they were to, hypothetically, jump into the contest: This tweet is largely accurate. Obama, Clinton, and Bush are all younger than President Donald Trump, former Vice President Joe Biden, and Sen. Bernie Sanders. However, as of this writing, there is one other person in this race: Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is the youngest candidate in the field by far at just 38 years old. (Gabbard, however, is long shot for president as she has only secured a single delegate, compared to the 500+ already won by Sanders and Biden each.) Other than Gabbard, the youngest candidate in the 2020 presidential race is Trump , who was born on June 14, 1946, and is currently 73 years old. Biden would be the next youngest candidate at age 77 (he was born on Nov. 20, 1942), while Sanders is the oldest at age 78 (he was born Sept. 8, 1941). Ages of the current 2020 presidential field: Sanders is 78. Biden is 77. Trump is 73. Gabbard is 38. Obama, Bush, and Clinton are all constitutionally prohibited from running for a third term as president. Hypothetically speaking, however, if they did enter the race they would all be younger than the current field of candidates, excluding Gabbard. Bush is the oldest of these three and is only younger than Trump by a month. Bush was born on July 6, 1946, and is currently 73 years old. Clinton , too, is also 73 but he's a few months younger than both Bush and Trump. Clinton was born on Aug. 19, 1946. Obama is the youngest on this list at 58 years old (he was born Aug. 4, 1961). Ages of the previous three presidents: Bush is 73. Clinton is 73. Obama is 58. Who is the oldest president in U.S. history? When Trump took office in January 2017, he became the oldest person in the history of the United States to win a presidential election at age 70. The previous person to hold this title was Ronald Reagan, who was approaching his 70th birthday when he took office in 1981. While Trump is the oldest person to win a presidential election, he isn't the oldest person to serve as president. Reagan still holds that title, as he left office at the age of 77. If Trump wins reelection and serves out his full four-year term, he will surpass Reagan as the oldest president in history. Sanders and Biden would both start their terms as president as the oldest people to win elections and the oldest people to serve. Biden would be 78 when he takes office, and Sanders would be 79. As of this writing, we've never had an octogenarian as president of the United States. Who is the youngest president in U.S. history? While the 2020 presidential election will likely be won by somebody in their seventies, the U.S. has been led by some relatively young chief executives. Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest person to hold the office when he succeeded William McKinley at age 42 after the latter was assassinated in 1901. John F. Kennedy was 43 when he took office in 1961. Clinton and Obama are both among the top five of youngest presidential candidates (3rd and 5th), taking office at ages 46 and 47, respectively. The fourth youngest was Ulysses S. Grant who took office at age 46 in 1869. If Gabbard wins the 2020 election, she would become the youngest president in history, taking office before her 40th birthday.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,749
2c1a3218-8b13-4c0b-96e8-00dc2ad4baf8,"In February 2020, readers asked us about 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's claims that he was arrested in South Africa during the 1970s during an attempt to visit the imprisoned Nelson Mandela. On Feb. 11, Biden held a campaign rally in Columbia, South Carolina, ahead of that state's primary election on Feb. 29. There, the former vice president said: This day 30 years ago, Nelson Mandela walked out of prison and entered into discussions about apartheid. I had the great honor of meeting him. I had the great honor of being arrested, with our U.N. ambassador, on the streets of Soweto, trying to get to see him on Robbens [sic] Island. When he came to the United States, when he came to the White House — to the Senate, I was chairman of the committee, and he walked in, the most incredible thing I've ever felt in my life. He walked across in that private room with the big table we have in the executive room, and he walked over. And I said ""Mr. President,"" and he leaned out and he said ""Thank you, thank you for trying to come and see me."" According to The New York Times , Biden made the ""South Africa arrest"" claim a second time on Feb. 16, while speaking at a Nevada Black Legislative Caucus event, adding on that occasion that Mandela had, years later, thanked him specifically for the efforts to visit him in prison: “After he got free and became president, he came to Washington and came to my office. He threw his arms around me and said, ‘I want to say thank you.’ I said, ‘What are you thanking me for, Mr. President?’ He said, ‘You tried to see me. You got arrested trying to see me.’” The next day, Feb. 17, Biden appeared at a campaign event in Las Vegas, Nevada. At one point, he spoke in a lighthearted way about the difficulty he had had in persuading Jill Biden to accept his marriage proposal. Eventually she agreed, Biden said, after he returned from a visit to South Africa, where he was ""trying to see Nelson Mandela and getting arrested for trying to see him, on Robbens [sic] Island."" (Relevant section begins around 25:00). After a Democratic primary debate in South Carolina on Feb. 26, Biden's Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield explained to reporters that Biden had been separated from his traveling group at the airport during a visit to South Africa in the 1970s. In doing so, Bedingfield effectively stated that Biden's claim of having been arrested was false. On Feb. 28, Biden himself admitted ""I wasn't arrested,"" claiming that instead, police at an airport in South Africa had stopped him from entering a walkway with his black Congressional colleagues. Even before those admissions, considerable evidence existed to dismiss the veracity of the former U.S. vice president's anecdote. Analysis Firstly, it wasn't clear when his visit to South Africa took place, and when his supposed arrest came. In his recent accounts, Biden didn't specify the year in which he claimed to have been arrested, but he did frame the incident as having taken place during a trip when he was waiting for his future wife Jill to respond to his marriage proposal. Based on accounts provided previously by both Bidens, that would date the trip in question to 1977. In his 2007 book ""Promises to Keep: On Life and Politics,"" Biden wrote : ""Jill says I must have asked her to marry me five more times, and she kept saying she needed more time. I was as patient as I knew how to be. But in 1977, as I prepared to leave on a ten-day trip to South Africa, I finally broke: 'Look,' I told her, 'I've waited long enough. I'm not going to wait any longer ...'"" That account was reflected in Jill Biden's 2019 book ""Where the Light Enters: Building a Family, Discovering Myself."" There, she dated the senator's marriage ultimatum to ""one afternoon in the spring of 1977,"" and wrote that her then-boyfriend was ""heading out on a congressional delegation to South Africa."" However, we found no evidence that Biden visited South Africa at all in 1977, and it appears that both Bidens might have arrived at a confused timeline of events. According to several contemporaneous news reports , Biden did visit southern Africa in late 1976. In December of that year, he was one of around a dozen members of Congress to attend an African-American Institute conference in the small nation of Lesotho, which is located within the territory of South Africa. If the group did not take a direct flight to Lesotho, it is likely they would have flown to a city in South Africa, potentially Johannesburg, and traveled through South African territory to arrive in Lesotho. Among the members of Congress with whom Biden traveled to Lesotho in 1976 were Rep. Charles Diggs, D-Michigan, and Rep. Andrew Young, D-Georgia. In 2013, Biden spoke after the death of Mandela, and stated that he had traveled to South Africa in 1977, along with Diggs and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. In his February 2020 speech in Columbia, South Carolina, Biden specified that he had been arrested along with ""our U.N. ambassador."" That person was Andrew Young, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1976, but appointed ambassador to the United Nations by President Jimmy Carter after his inauguration in January 1977. Based on those facts, a strong possibility exists that Biden, over the course of the intervening decades, has mistakenly dated his December 1976 Africa trip to 1977. His destination during that trip was actually Lesotho (the location of the African-American Institute conference), but due to that country's unusual geographic situation, the visiting Congress members would likely have traveled through South Africa to get there, and so Biden might also have become confused in his recollection of his destination during the 1976 trip. It's not clear why or how Jill Biden recalled the trip taking place in the spring of 1977, specifically. Young, by then U.N. ambassador, did take a high-profile trip to South Africa in late May 1977, but Biden certainly did not join him, based on several news reports that placed the Delaware senator in the United States at that time. We asked Biden's campaign to clear up those significant discrepancies, but we received no response. Two other details provided by Biden undermined the credibility of his claim that he was arrested while trying to visit Mandela, even before his spokesperson walked it back. Firstly, the former vice president claimed in South Carolina to have been arrested along with the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, a reference to Young, a Georgia congressman who traveled to Lesotho with Biden in December 1976 before he became U.N. ambassador (and who later served as mayor of Atlanta during the 1980s). In February 2020, Young told both The New York Times and The Washington Post that he himself had never been arrested in South Africa, and he said he did not think Biden was either. Secondly, in the same South Carolina speech, Biden said he was arrested with Young ""on the streets of Soweto"" while trying to visit Mandela on Robben Island (Biden repeatedly and mistakenly referred to the place where Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years as ""Robbens Island""). On its face, this claim appears utterly implausible since Soweto, a township of South Africa's largest city Johannesburg, is located nearly 900 miles northeast of Robben Island, which is off the coast of Cape Town — the two locations are effectively on opposite ends of the country. It might make more sense if Biden claimed to have been arrested in an airport while attempting to board a flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town in an effort to visit Mandela, but an arrest ""on the streets of Soweto"" does not stack up. Conclusion Snopes asked Biden's campaign to provide any evidence or documentation that might support his claim of having been arrested in South Africa in the 1970s, and we asked the campaign to clarify significant discrepancies in the timeline presented by both Bidens in their respective books. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response of any kind. On Feb. 26, after a Democratic primary debate in South Carolina, Biden's deputy campaign manager spoke to reporters and fielded a question about the veracity of the arrest anecdote. In response, she effectively admitted that Biden's claim that he was arrested while trying to visit Mandela was false. Slate reported as follows: “He took a trip with a CODEL [congressional delegation] in the ’70s, he was separated from the CBC [Congressional Black Caucus] members that he was traveling with at the airport when he landed,” Biden’s deputy campaign manager and communications director, Kate Bedingfield, told the reporter. “When making that remark, he was talking about his long record of fighting apartheid.” So he wasn’t arrested? “He was separated from the group he was with at the airport,” she said. On Feb. 28, Biden himself admitted in a CNN interview ""I wasn't arrested."" Instead, Biden claimed, he was referring to an incident in which he was separated from his black congressional colleagues at an airport in South Africa, where police stopped him from using the same airport walkway as them. Biden said, ""When I said 'arrested' I meant I was not able to move. Cops, Afrikaaners were not letting me go with them [the Congressional Black Caucus members], made me stay where I was. I guess I wasn't arrested, I was stopped. I was not able to move where I wanted to go."" As such, we are issuing a rating of ""False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1897

Amid warnings from public health officials that a 2020 outbreak of a new coronavirus could soon become a pandemic involving the U.S., alarmed readers asked Snopes to verify a rumor that U.S. President Donald Trump had ""fired the entire pandemic response team two years ago and then didn't replace them."" The claim came from a series of tweets posted by Judd Legum, who runs Popular Information, a newsletter he describes as being about ""politics and power."" Legum's commentary was representative of sharp criticism from Democratic legislators (and some Republicans) that the Trump administration had ill-prepared the country for a pandemic even as one was looming on the horizon. Legum outlined a series of cost-cutting decisions made by the Trump administration in preceding years that had gutted the nation's infectious disease defense infrastructure. The ""pandemic response team"" firing claim referred to news accounts from Spring 2018 reporting that White House officials tasked with directing a national response to a pandemic had been ousted. Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer abruptly departed from his post leading the global health security team on the National Security Council in May 2018 amid a reorganization of the council by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, and Ziemer's team was disbanded. Tom Bossert, whom the Washington Post reported ""had called for a comprehensive biodefense strategy against pandemics and biological attacks,"" had been fired one month prior. It's thus true that the Trump administration axed the executive branch team responsible for coordinating a response to a pandemic and did not replace it, eliminating Ziemer's position and reassigning others, although Bolton was the executive at the top of the National Security Council chain of command at the time. Legum stated in a follow-up tweet that ""Trump also cut funding for the CDC, forcing the CDC to cancel its efforts to help countries prevent infectious-disease threats from becoming epidemics in 39 of 49 countries in 2018. Among the countries abandoned? China."" That was partly true, according to 2018 news reports stating that funding for the CDC’s global disease outbreak prevention efforts had been reduced by 80%, including funding for the agency’s efforts in China. But that was the result of the anticipated depletion of previously allotted funding, not a direct cut by the Trump administration. And as the CDC told FactCheck.org , the cuts were ultimately avoided because Congress provided other funding. On Feb. 24, 2020, the Trump administration requested $2.5 billion to address the coronavirus outbreak, an outlay critics asserted might not have been necessary if the previous program cuts had not taken place. Fortune reported of the issue that: The cuts could be especially problematic as COVID-19 continues to spread. Health officials are now warning the U.S. is unlikely to be spared, even though cases are minimal here so far. ""It's not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country any more but a question of when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a press call [on Feb. 25]. The coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, in the winter of 2019, and cases spread around the globe. The U.S. had 57 confirmed cases as of this writing, while globally, roughly 80,000 patients had been sickened with the virus and 3,000 had died. As of yet , no vaccine or pharmaceutical treatment for the new coronavirus.

But his reasoning for doing so appeared to contradict his public commentary on the strength of the economy, prompting several Snopes readers to ask if the proposal was real. It was. In the message , Trump stated that federal law ""authorizes me to implement alternative plans for pay adjustments for civilian Federal employees covered by the General Schedule and certain other pay systems if, because of 'national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare,' I view the increases that would otherwise take effect as inappropriate."" Congress approved a 3.1% raise for federal workers, which went into effect in 2020. It was the largest pay increase in a decade. Legislation introduced for 2021 calls for for a 3.5% increase. Trump on the other hand proposed a 1% raise that will go into effect unless Congress approves an alternate amount, confirmed Tim Kauffman, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest employee union representing federal workers. It's not unusual for presidents to make efforts to prevent full pay raises for federal workers from going into effect, Kauffman said. What is unusual is that Trump is using the economy to justify cuts even as he has been outspoken about the strength of the economy. One day after his message to Congress, Trump tweeted , ""BEST USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY!"" We sent a question to the White House Press Office asking for an explanation for the seeming contradiction but got no answer. ""If the economy is doing so well, then why can’t we afford to provide a pay raise to the federal workers, a third of whom are veterans, who ensure our democracy is working every day and ensure services are delivered,"" Kauffman said. ""Currently federal employees make about 4% less today than they did at the start of the decade, counting for inflation."" Federal employee raises fall under the purview of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990, a law that is intended to ensure that government worker compensation is on par with the salaries of their peers in the private sector. But ""every single president except maybe the first year [the law was in effect] under [George H.W. Bush], they have used national economic concerns to prevent the full raise from taking effect,"" Kauffman said.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,466
b02f32d0-d5aa-487a-aa8d-45c9c274b30e,"In February 2020, a text meme concerning Sen. Bernie Sanders' health care plan and his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour was circulated on social media. The meme contained several arithmetic equations that supposedly showed how the pay increase for minimum wage workers would be negated by the hike in taxes needed to pay for Sanders' ""Medicare for All"" plan: Bernie Sanders said at the debate last night he wants minimum wage to be $15 an hour. 15$ x 40 hr work week = $600 600$ x 52 weeks per year = $31,200 Bernie Sanders wants free healthcare for all and was asked how he would pay for it. His answer was to raise taxes 52% on anyone making over $29,000 per year. 52% of $31,200 = $16,224 in tax $31,200 - $16,224 = $14,976 is your pay $14,976 ÷ 52 weeks = $288 per week $288 ÷ 40 hr week = $7.20 per hour But there's no need to check the arithmetic in this meme. The general claim here — that Sanders' health care plan would raise the tax rate to 52% on everyone making over $29,000 per year — is egregiously false. Does Sanders' Medicare for All plan raise taxes to 52% on incomes over $29,000? In short, no. One proposal offered by Sanders would raise the tax rate to 52% on earnings over $10 million . Sanders also proposed that the first $29,000 of a person's income would be exempt from taxes, and a 4% income-based premium would be applied to earnings over $29,000. The meme asserts that Sanders made this claim ""at the debate last night."" As this meme started circulating in mid-February 2020, we'll assume that timing refers to the Democratic presidential debate held in Las Vegas on Feb. 17, 2020. Although Sanders did say that he wanted to raise the minimum wage to $15 during that debate, he did not say that he would pay for his health care plan by raising ""taxes to 52% on anybody making over $29,000 a year."" Former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg did maintain that ""taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000"" under Sanders' tax plan, but Buttigieg did not claim that the tax rate would increase to 52% for these individuals. Sanders disputed Buttigieg's claim during the debate, saying the latter was ""not being honest"" and that any tax increase for low-wage workers would be offset by lower health care costs. Here's an excerpt of the exchange between the two men (a full transcript of the debate is available here ): BUTTIGIEG : [Sanders] was a congressman at the time. And the qualities I admired then are qualities I still respect a great deal. I never said that I agree with every part of his policy views, then or now. But I appreciate that at least he's straightforward and honest about them. He's honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than $29,000 to fund his health care plan, although, again, a little bit vague about how the rest of that gets ... SANDERS : You're not being honest. Premiums would be eliminated. BUTTIGIEG : But you're still raising those taxes. And when you do it... SANDERS : But we're saving people money because they don't pay any premiums, out-of-pocket expenses, co-payments, or deductibles. They're going to be much better off. [applause] BUTTIGIEG : But where is — where is the other $25 trillion supposed to come from? At a certain point, you've got to do the math. SANDERS : Well, we got it all up there on the internet. It's a payroll tax — a payroll tax... [crosstalk] BUTTIGIEG : Well, no, but even after the payroll tax, you still have a hole. [crosstalk] SANDERS : Because we have a wealth tax. Elizabeth [Warren] has a good one. Ours is a little bit tougher on Mr. Bloomberg than hers. We're going to raise it in a progressive way, which deals with income and wealth inequality, and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege. Although Sanders did not reference it during that debate, we did find mention of a 52% tax rate on a document he released to explain various ""options to finance Medicare for All."" That document stated that the 52% tax rate would be applied to earnings over $10 million, not $29,000 as claimed in the meme. Here's the relevant excerpt from that document (emphasis ours): Another option is to reform the personal income tax system by strengthening progressive income tax rates, taxing capital gains and dividends the same as work income, limiting deductions for the wealthy, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, and requiring derivatives to be marked to market. Progressive income tax rates. Under this plan the marginal income tax rate would be: 40% percent on income between $250,000 and $500,000. 45% percent on income between $500,000 and $2 million. 50% percent on income between $2 million and $10 million. (In 2014, only 136,000 households, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers, had income between $2 million and $10 million.) 52% percent on income above $10 million. (In 2014, only 16,700 households, just 0.02 percent of taxpayers, had income exceeding $10 million.) Sanders mentioned the $29,000 figure in another document entitled "" Financing Medicare for All ."" This documented listed a few additional ways to pay for Medicare for All, including a 4% income-based premium on incomes over $29,000. Here's an excerpt from that document (emphasis ours): As the wealthiest country in the world, we have a variety of options available to support a Medicare for All, single-payer health care system that guarantees high quality, affordable health care as a right, not a privilege, to every man, woman, and child in this country. Those options include, but are not limited to: Creating a 4 percent income-based premium paid by employees, exempting the first $29,000 in income for a family of four; Imposing a 7.5 percent income-based premium paid by employers, exempting the first $2 million in payroll to protect small businesses; Sanders elaborated on this portion of his plan during a September 2019 appearance on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"": Sanders made a similar statement during a town hall in New Hampshire in November 2019. Sanders again said that the first $29,000 of an individual's earnings would be exempt from taxes and then a 4% tax rate would apply on earnings over $29,000: “What we will do — what we will do is have a four percent tax on income exempting the first $29,000,"" Sanders told his supporters. ""All right, good. You — you’re better at arithmetic than I am. Because what that means is if you are that average family in the middle who makes $60,000 a year, that means we’re going to tax you on $31,000 at four percent.” We were unable to find any instance of Sanders' proposing a 52% tax rate on ""anybody making over $29,000"" per year, something that appears to be an erroneous conflation of Sanders' proposing a 4% tax rate on earnings over $29,000 and a 52% tax rate on earnings over $10 million. A counter-meme offered a more accurate (although still not entirely accurate) look at Sanders' actual expressed plans: This meme, too, makes a mistake. Sanders' tax proposal uses a marginal tax rate (or a progressive tax rate), which means that a different tax rate is applied to different portions of a person's income. The percentage taxed starts relatively small, but grows as income increases. In Sanders' case, the first $29,000 of a person's income would be exempt from taxes. When a person's income crosses the $29,000 threshold, a 4% tax will be applied to earnings OVER $29,000. This tax rate continues to grow as income increases. Income over $10 million, for instance, would be taxed at 52%. But the above-displayed meme applies a 4% tax rate to ALL $31,200. Under Sanders' plan, however, the first $29,000 would be exempt and the 4% tax rate would only apply to the remaining $2,200. We reached out to Sanders' campaign for comment on the claim that the candidate was planning to raise the tax rate to 52% on everyone making over $29,000 per year. A spokesperson told us ""the meme is false.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1686
41cf6a36-c5bb-4780-8b43-eff0dc2528ad,"In February 2020 readers asked us about an opinion column written by Fox News host Tucker Carlson, which claimed that a new bill proposed by U.S. House Democrats would, if passed in its current form, protect immigrants from deportation even if they commit crimes. The op-ed , published on Feb. 7, bore the headline ""Criminals Would Be Protected From Deportation Under Bill AOC and Other House Democrats Back."" The piece included the following: Under current U.S. law, legal U.S. immigrants can be deported if they commit an “aggravated felony” or a “crime of moral turpitude” – that is, a vile, depraved act, like molesting a child. Under the New Way Forward Act, “crimes of moral turpitude” are eliminated entirely as a justification for deportation. And the category of “aggravated felony” gets circumscribed too. What does that mean? Consider this: Under current law, immigrants who commit serious crimes – such as robbery, fraud, or child sexual abuse – must be deported, regardless of the sentence they receive. Other crimes – less severe ones like racketeering – require deportation as long as the perpetrator receives at least a one-year sentence. But if this bill passes the House and Senate and is signed into law by the president, there will no longer be any crimes that automatically require deportation. None. And one crime – falsifying a passport – will be made immune from deportation, no matter what. Because apparently 9/11 never happened, and we no longer care about fake government documents ... Under the proposed legislation, the minimum prison sentence for crimes that still require deportation would rise from one year to five... The bill would grant sweeping new powers to immigration judges, allowing them to nullify a deportation order. Carlson's op-ed, and a subsequent segment on his Fox News show, featured numerous specific claims about the legislation, but the one that drew the most inquiries from Snopes readers was the same one Fox News included in its headline — that the New Way Forward Act would ""protect criminals from deportation."" As a result, that claim is the focus of this particular fact check. What the bill proposes If it were signed into law and implemented, the New Way Forward Act would bring about a number of changes to U.S. federal law on deportations. The following is a summary of those changes, as found in the version of the legislation published in December 2019 (the most up-to-date version at the time of Carlson's article and at the time of this fact check): Removes crimes of moral turpitude and crimes carrying a sentence of at least one year as a grounds for deportation (deportable offenses) Removes drug crimes, drug abuse and drug addiction as deportable offenses Stipulates that ""aggravated felonies"" such as murder, rape, child sexual abuse and drug trafficking must have carried a sentence of at least five years in order to qualify as deportable offenses Redefines an aggravated felony -- which includes theft, racketeering, bribery, obstruction of justice and certain crimes of violence -- so that only offenses which carry a sentence of at least five years would be labelled as aggravated felonies and thereby liable to form the basis of a deportation order Removes the forging of a passport as a deportable offense Changes the definition of ""conviction"" to exclude cases where a criminal conviction has been overturned, expunged, vacated, and so on, cases where only probation has been ordered, and cases where a judgement of guilt is currently under appeal. Stipulates that the sentence imposed in a given conviction can only be regarded as including the period of the sentence to be served, and cannot include suspended portions of sentences Stipulates that only an aggravated felony that came with a sentence of at least five years can be treated as a ""particularly serious crime,"" thereby entitling the U.S. Attorney General to reject any asylum application filed by the offender in question. Another section of the New Way Forward Act would give immigration judges significant new discretionary powers in deciding whether to issue a deportation order. Under existing law , judges are only allowed to consider ""the evidence produced at the hearing,"" before making their determination. Under the proposed legislation, judges would be able to weigh that evidence, including the existence of prior deportable offenses, against other factors. This means that even if an immigrant has been convicted of a deportable criminal offense, an immigration judge could, under the bill, decline to order their deportation ""in pursuit of humanitarian purposes, to assure family unity, or when it is otherwise in the public interest.” Analysis Clearly, the provisions of the New Way Forward Act would make it more difficult to deport immigrants who have committed certain crimes, most notably the removal of lower-level drug crimes as a deportable offense, and the proposed requirement that aggravated felonies be redefined as carrying at least a five-year prison sentence in order to form the basis of a deportation order. Giving immigration judges the ability to exercise discretion and decline to order a deportation for humanitarian reasons is also likely to lower the deportation rate by a certain degree, though it should be noted that the legislation would not impose any legal requirement on judges to be more lenient in their decisions. The headline of the article -- ""Criminals Would Be Protected From Deportation Under Bill AOC and Other House Democrats Back"" -- risked giving some readers the mistaken impression that the New Way Forward Act would entirely protect immigrants who have violated U.S. criminal law from being deported. That would not be the case -- such offenders could and undoubtedly would continue to be deported under the proposed legislation. Rather, the bill would mean certain offenses could no longer form the sole basis of a deportation order, and the sentencing threshold for ""aggravated felonies"" would be increased from one year to five years, thereby enhancing the protections against deportation available to immigrants who were convicted of such crimes and sentenced to between one and five years in prison. The body of Carlson's article outlined those facts with greater nuance than the headline did.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1135
90b9704e-784d-44aa-b5ab-175b4bdc7f79,"On Jan. 15, 2020, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump. The signing ceremony was historic — it was only the third time in U.S. history that a president has been impeached. And, according to critics, the event was bit unusual because Pelosi used multiple pens to sign the documents and then handed the writing utensils out as souvenirs. A rumor soon started to circulate on social media positing that the pens Pelosi had used had cost an obscene amount of money. One Twitter user, for instance, claimed that each pen Pelosi used cost $2,025. A message on Facebook held that Pelosi had used a total of $15,000 worth of pens to sign these documents. This number was exaggerated even further by another Facebook user who claimed that each pen cost $15,000, and that the signing ceremony used a total of $450,000 pens: The most prominent claim, and one that was re-shared verbatim by several different accounts, stated: ""Pelosi uses $15,000.00 worth of bullet pens to impeach the president. President Trump uses $1.99 Sharpie to sign $2 billion trade deal with China. That's the difference in a business man and a worthless professional."" While this claim was widespread, it was not supported by evidence. We have encountered no news reports, budget statements, or any other credible information to support the claim that Pelosi used $15,000 worth of pens (or $450,000 worth of pens or $2,025 per pen) to sign the articles of impeachment against Trump. Furthermore, these claims appear to have originated with random social media users who would not have been privy to this sort of information. As these users appear to have been making this information up out of whole cloth, it isn't surprising that the alleged cost of these pens varies from one claim to the next. Drew Hammill, Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, told us that the pens Pelosi used to sign the articles of impeachment cost just under $15 apiece, and that they were the same type of pen used to sign other pieces of legislation. At $15 a piece, that means the total cost for these pens was about $450, well under the $15,000 (or $450,000) amount claimed in those baseless social media posts. Does Trump use a $2 Sharpie to sign legislation? In 2017, the Trump administration placed an order with long-time pen supplier A.T. Cross for 150 ""Century II"" pens to be used for signing executive orders. A.T. Cross has been supplying pens to the White House since at least the 1970s. While the cost of these pens vary by model, the Century II pens that Trump used at the start of his administration (this model was also used during President Barack Obama's administration) cost a little over $100 a piece at retail. However, Trump has since switched from the Century II pen to a Sharpie pen. While Sharpie pens can certainly be purchased in the $2 range, Trump doesn't use a Sharpie that you can purchase at a school-supply store. The Commander-in-Chief reportedly uses a custom Sharpie with his signature inscribed down the side. You can see an image of the pen Trump uses to sign executive orders here . We reached out to the White House and Newell Brands, the company that manufacturers Sharpies, for more information on Trump's pen. While we can't say exactly how much Trump spends per pen, it seems reasonable to assume that this custom pen is worth more than a $2 generic Sharpie, but well under the $100 pens used at the start of his administration. The ""Official Donald J. Trump Fine Point Markers"" available via the Trump campaign shop are sold for $15 for a five-pack (which works out to $3 piece). Is it unusual to use multiple pens to sign important legislation? In addition to claiming that Pelosi used obscenely expensive pens to sign the articles of impeachment against Trump, many social media users were upset that the House Speaker used multiple writing utensils and then handed them out as souvenirs to mark the occasion.  However, this isn't an unusual practice. In fact, on the same day Pelosi handed out the impeachment pens to various lawmakers, Trump performed a similar ritual in the Oval Office after signing a trade deal with China. The photograph above is available via Getty Images with the following caption: ""WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 15: U.S. President Donald Trump, accompanied by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer (2nd L) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin (R), hands out pens to Senators after he and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, signed phase 1 of a trade deal between U.S. and China, in the East Room at the White House, on January 15, 2020 in Washington, DC. Phase 1 is expected to cut tariffs and promote Chinese purchases of U.S. farm, and manufactured goods while addressing disputes over intellectual property. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)"" Time Magazine explained that this tradition — using multiple pens to sign a document and then to give those pens to various people involved — dates back to at least the 1930s when Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office: The pen used to sign historic legislation itself becomes a historical artifact. The more pens a President uses, the more thank-you gifts he can offer to those who helped create that piece of history. The White House often engraves the pens, which are then given as keepsakes to key proponents or supporters of the newly signed legislation. When Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964, he reportedly used more than 75 pens ... and gave one of the first ones to Martin Luther King Jr. Senators Hubert Humphrey and Everett McKinley Dirksen also received pens for their aid in shuttling the bill through Congress. And in 1996, President Clinton gave the four pens he used to sign the Line-Item Veto bill — which allowed Presidents to veto individual sections of legislation rather than the entire thing — to those most likely to appreciate the bill's impact: Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. The U.S. Senate also provided souvenir pens in 1999 during the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton. According to a contemporary report in the Akron Beacon, senators used silver Parker Vector pens (worth about $10 a piece) to sign the oath book after they were sworn in and were allowed to keep the pens as a memento: Unfortunately, the pens used during Clinton's trial contained a typo (the term ""United States Senator"" on the pen was misspelled ""Untied States Senator"") and had to be replaced . Did Pelosi Use $15,000 Worth of Pens to Sign the Articles of Impeachment? In summary, no evidence exists to support the claim that Pelosi used $15,000 worth of pens to sign the articles of impeachment. This claim originated with random social media accounts and was not supported with documentation. Furthermore, Pelosi's chief of staff refuted the claim, saying the pens cost just under $15 a piece. While some may find it objectionable to hand out souvenir pens after signing such a grave document, it isn't unusual. The tradition of using multiple pens to sign important documents, and then giving those pens away to the people involved, can be traced back decades.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1386

After leaving the U.S. Congress, Gowdy -- once a vocal proponent of congressional oversight of the executive branch -- was slated to join a team of outside lawyers representing President Trump as he faces an impeachment inquiry, according to a statement sent to news outlets by Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow. The statement, published by The New York Times on Oct. 9, 2019, reads: ""I have known Trey for years and worked with him when he served in Congress.

On Jan. 5, 2020, the team made it official with an article on the Dallas Cowboys website reporting that the team opted to part ways with Garrett: Team owner/general manager Jerry Jones confirmed the news in an official statement. “We are extremely grateful to Jason Garrett for his more than 20 years of service to the Dallas Cowboys as a player, assistant coach and head coach,” Jones said. “His level of commitment, character and dedication to this organization has been outstanding at every stage of his career.” The news gives some clarity to a story that has gotten quite confusing since the Cowboys were eliminated from the postseason last weekend. Following that win against Washington, Jones declined to comment on Garrett’s future, stating he had no timetable for a decision. According to a press release issued by the NFL on Jan. 6, 2020, the Cowboys are expected to hire former Green Bay Packers Coach Mike McCarthy.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,273
91d3eb3f-d24d-4530-b8c1-2b77e1d59ce5,"On Aug. 22, 2019, TMZ first reported that former U.S. President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama were “locking down [an] incredible Martha's Vineyard estate.” The gossip website cited several local sources, reporting that the Obamas were in escrow for a Vineyard property currently owned by Boston Celtics owner Wyc Grousbeck: Multiple island sources tell us the Obamas are in escrow for the estate owned by Boston Celtics owner, Wyc Grousbeck. The former Prez and First Lady have been renting the house this summer and loved it so much, we've learned they made an offer. The property is listed at $14,850,000. Our sources say they're paying less, but we don't know how much. The details of the potential sale were not made public at the time and, as TMZ reported, “it's not a done deal just yet. We're told there are contingencies so it's possible it could fall apart.” The property in question in the affluent Massachusetts community was listed at just shy of $15 million and does have waterfront access. As of Sept. 6, 2019, no sales report of the purchase had been logged with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds. We reached out to the Obama family press office to inquire about the status of the transaction but have not received a response. All major reporting on the topic, at that point, stemmed from TMZ’s ""multiple island sources."" Neither the realtors nor representatives for Grousbeck provided statements to the news media. In December 2019, the Martha's Vineyard Gazette reported that the sale had been completed and that the new deedholder is a nominee trust representing the Obamas: Former President Obama and his family are now permanent homeowners on Martha’s Vineyard, after completing the purchase this week of a large home situated on nearly 30 acres in the coastal perimeter of Edgartown. The purchase price, recorded at 3:31 p.m. Wednesday with the Dukes County Registry of Deeds, is listed at $11.75 million. The buyer is a nominee trust representing the former First Family. The sellers are Wycliffe Grousbeck and Corinne Basler Grousbeck. Mr. Grousbeck is a private equity investor and owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team. The deed lists the buyer as ""James F. Reynolds, as trustee of The 79 Turkeyland Cove Road Nominee Trust."" Multiple news reports have identified Reynolds as a longtime friend of the former first family, but none of the documents available through the Dukes Country Registry of Deeds mentioned the Obamas by name at the time. In August 2021, however, news coverage of plans for Obama's 60th birthday party made clear he is the owner of the property. As such, the claim is true.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,511
1c327e22-faea-47b4-bd98-238e0fb49e61,"During his 2016 presidential campaign, Republican candidate Donald Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, vowed that if elected he would forgo the $400,000 annual presidential salary. So far as president Trump has stuck to that promise, handing over checks every three months for various projects overseen by different government departments. 0:00 / 0:00 In the first quarter of 2017, for example, President Trump donated $78,333 (his $100,000 salary for that quarter, after taxes) to the Department of the Interior, specifically for the National Park Service's maintenance of an historic Civil War site. His contribution was put towards two projects at Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland. In July 2017, the White House announced in a press release that President Trump had donated his second-quarter salary to a science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) camp for children, overseen by the Education Department. He signed over his third-quarter salary to the Department of Health and Human Services for a public awareness campaign about opioid addiction , and the last of his 2017 salary went towards an infrastructure grant program overseen by the U.S. Department of Transportation. As the Washington Post has pointed out, some of the initiatives President Trump donated to were at uncertain stages of development or did not yet exist at the time he made his contribution, which prompted some additional scrutiny, but President Trump has nonetheless stayed true to his word and handed over a check representing his presidential salary every three months. Trump continued this tradition in 2018, donating his first-quarter salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs , a sum which then-Acting VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said had been earmarked for ""caregiver support in the form of mental health and peer support programs, financial aid, education training, and research.""  The president donated another quarter's salary to the U.S. Small Business Administration for the purpose of establishing an “Emerging Leaders” program focused ""on helping veterans start small businesses after military life."" And the third quarter of his 2018 salary went to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, according to the Associated Press . On 18 March 2019, Trump announced on Twitter he was donating a quarter of his salary to the Department of Homeland Security. On 26 November 2019, Trump announced he was donating again, this time to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health in order to help battle the nation's opioid crisis. 'Military Cemeteries' In late July and early August 2018, scattered social media posts and memes claimed that the president had donated his entire $400,000 salary to the Department of the Interior, for the purpose of rebuilding military cemeteries. Many of these posts criticized the news media for not having reported on this purported donation. On 31 July 2018, for example, conservative radio host Mark Simone wrote, in a tweet that has since been deleted: White House sent their spending report to Congress. This was in it: ""Instead of taking his salary, Trump donated all $400,000 to the Department of the Interior where it will be used for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries!"" Media gave this no coverage. Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and founder of the Turning Point USA organization, followed suit: News the media didn’t report today: Today @realDonaldTrump donated his $400,000 salary to rebuilding military cemeteries — Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) August 1, 2018 One Facebook user garnered almost 150,000 shares within three days for a 31 July post which made similar claims: And on 2 August, ""Uncle Sam's Misguided Children"" posted a widely-shared meme on Facebook, which was almost identical to Charlie Kirk's tweet: These social media posts were accompanied by articles published by various right-wing web sites including the Gateway Pundit , the Right Scoop , and the viral content web site Social News Daily . Analysis There were two immediate problems with this set of claims. First, President Trump could not possibly donate his entire $400,000 annual salary for 2018 for the purpose of rebuilding military cemeteries, because he has already donated the first quarter's worth of that salary to the Department of Veterans Affairs for an entirely separate initiative. So he only had three-quarters of his salary left to distribute, a mathematical fact that undermines the credibility of these claims. Second, the social media posts and articles making this claim were very thinly sourced, to say the least. Neither the viral Facebook post nor meme that we highlighted above cited any source, and the three news articles we mentioned all relied on the two tweets from Charlie Kirk and Mark Simone. Kirk's tweet cited no source whatsoever. Simone claimed that the information came from a White House ""spending report"" sent to Congress, which he asserted contained the following statement: ""Instead of taking his salary, Trump donated all $400,000 to the Department of the Interior where it will be used for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries!"" Simone did not include a link to that report in his tweet, and neither he nor Kirk responded to our requests for clarification or documentation. The White House did send a somewhat related report to Congress a month before these claims emerged online. The White House Office's Annual Report to Congress on White House Personnel lists the names, titles and salaries of White House employees, and the 2018 report , published on 29 June, made no mention of President Trump's salary, nor his donations from that salary. Furthermore, we did not find the quotation that Simone included in his tweet in any official White House document or report to Congress. We did, however, find it in several online postings from the summer of 2017. As posted to the web site MyCrazyEmail.net on 25 July 2017, the message typically read as follows: The Trump administration released their annual report to Congress on White House Office Personnel. It includes the name, status, salary and position title of all 377 White House employees. The report also said that Trump decided not to take a dime of his salary, instead he donated it to an amazing cause. ... It’s what the report said Trump did with this salary that has everyone talking! Instead of taking his salary, Trump donated all $400,000 to the Department of the Interior where it will be used for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries! AMAZING! It’s so great to have a President who loves our brave military men and women so much! Oh, and where’s the media coverage of this? Oh that’s right, they don’t cover anything good that the President does. So the claim that Trump donated his entire $400,000 annual salary for rebuilding military cemeteries actually comes from online rumors posted in 2017. This means the vast majority of claims made in July and August 2018 are false on this basis alone, since they stated that Trump's donation had happened ""today."" However, the claim was as false in 2017 as it was in 2018. As we outlined at the beginning of this article, President Trump distributed his 2017 salary in four separate chunks, to four separate projects, none of which involved military cemeteries. The White House had already announced two of those donations by 26 July 2017, so the viral rumor was demonstrably false even as it first emerged online, twelve months before Mark Simone and Charlie Kirk's viral tweets. The 2017 rumor, which was the source of Simone's tweet, claimed that the 2017 White House Office Personnel report had described President Trump's intention to donate his whole salary for repairs on military cemeteries. That official report, which can be viewed here , did not mention the president's salary, his donations from that salary, nor cemeteries of any kind. The original source of this flurry of inaccurate rumors appears to have been a 2 July 2017 article in Forbes magazine, about that year's White House Office Personnel report. The rumor which spread online later that summer plagiarized whole sections of the article, indicating that the Forbes piece provided a template for subsequent distortions and falsehoods -- particularly the section that read as follows: While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump vowed to forego his paycheck. However, Article II of the United States Constitution mandates a presidential salary. In the first quarter, President Trump donated his pay to the Dept. of Interior for construction and repair needs at military cemeteries. The president did donate his first-quarter 2017 salary to the Department of the Interior, but not for the reconstruction of military cemeteries. This inaccuracy was then compounded in the subsequent online rumor, which took Forbes' accurate description of the donation as being ""in the first quarter,"" and simply replaced it with ""all $400,000"" (i.e., the entire yearly salary). According to a Department of the Interior press release , President Trump's $78,333 donation formed part of a larger $263,545 fund which was used by the National Park Service to make repairs at Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland, site of the Civil War Battle of Antietam (or the Battle of Sharpsburg, as it was commonly known in the South). A press release described the project in detail: The donation will restore the historic Newcomer House on the Antietam battlefield, and will underwrite the replacement of 5,000 linear feet of deteriorated rail fencing along the Hagerstown Turnpike where some of the most intense fighting of the battle occurred. There is a cemetery at Antietam National Battlefield, but President Trump's donation had nothing to do with it. Conclusion The claim that President Donald Trump decided either in 2017 or 2018 to donate his entire $400,000 salary to the reconstruction of military cemeteries, and that a blinkered, biased news media refused to report this, is false. Each of President Trump's actual salary donations (executed in quarterly disbursements, not once a year) has been reported by major news media, including some of the nation's biggest and most widely-read news outlets. The news media has not reported on the president's donation of his entire $400,000 annual salary for the reconstruction of military cemeteries due to the plainest reason of all: because it hasn't happened.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1913
8a13e94c-3cdc-489f-9634-406ca726bc89,"A frequent political talking point — when issues of tax law and corporate governance are concerned — is the lack of income taxes Amazon pays to the federal government. In 2018, Snopes rated “True” the claim that the online retailer had paid no such taxes in the 2017 tax year. Readers raised the same question for the 2018 tax year, and once again our rating is ""True."" Though Amazon’s actual U.S. tax filings are not public, a broad overview of their overall tax burden can be found in their SEC 10-K filing. In 2018, the company made over $200 billion in sales, but paid no money to the U.S. government in the form of income tax (in fact, the government actually owed the company some $129 million as noted in parentheses in the chart below): However, the company did pay taxes abroad and at the state level: ""Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in February 2019. As we discussed in our previous Amazon tax fact check, the methods employed to make that extremely reduced tax burden a reality are only vaguely described by the company, but the process involves taking as many tax credits as possible under the law. ""We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income,"" the company wrote in their SEC filing . Stock-based compensation refers to the fact that publicly traded corporations, like Amazon, can list the stock options they grant to employees as a business cost in their accounting, and if an option-receiving employee makes over $1 million a year in salary, the profits from the sale of those stocks can then be counted as a federal income tax deduction for the corporation. With respect to the other tax credits or deductions? ""It’s hard to know exactly what they’re doing,"" Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy for the non-partisan Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, told Yahoo. ""Their public documents ... don’t lay out their tax strategy. So it’s unclear exactly which breaks [Amazon is taking advantage of].""

2b91175b-9850-4c1d-ae38-14a86b8c5853,"In December 2018, social media users shared a story on the self-publishing site auxx.me bearing the headline, ""Drone Footage Reveals Over 100 Whales Trapped in Secret Underwater 'Jails,'"" with many questioning whether the report was real. Aside from the fact that the cages are hardly ""secret,"" the story is sadly true. The information was originally reported by the independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta on 30 October 2018. The paper revealed that more than 100 whales were caged in small enclosures off Russia's Pacific coast near the city of Nakhodka, possibly in violation of an international ban on commercial whale hunting. The account has since been picked up by reputable English-language news outlets including CBS News and the UK's Telegraph . According to news reports, 90 belugas and 11 orcas are being held in small enclosures that reporters have dubbed ""whale jails"" or ""whale prison."" Some of the animals have been held there since July 2018 and many suspect they will be sold for entertainment in a burgeoning marine park industry in China, as The Telegraph reported: ""An Orca whale can reportedly fetch more than $6 million in the booming ocean theme park industry in neighbouring China. There are more than 60 marine parks in China, and at least a dozen more are under construction."" Although Russian prosecutors are investigating the capture and export of the animals by four companies, identified by Novaya Gazeta as LLC Oceanarium DV, LLC Afalina, LLC Bely Kit and LLC Sochi Dolphinarium, the fate of the animals is currently unclear. Thomas Henningsen, a marine biologist who is head of the Russia program for the international environmental activist organization Greenpeace, confirmed to us via email that as of 19 December 2018 the whales were still in the cages and that the conditions there were ""disastrous and cruel."" Experts cited by The Telegraph also opined that many of the whales were likely infants, based on the sheer number of them packed into pens -- ""even though the capture of whale calves is categorically forbidden."" News reports included an apparent cell phone video that captured the moment one of the whales was lifted by crane and placed into a tank for transport: Drone footage posted to social media by the Russian government-controlled news outlet RT also stoked public anger, showing whales crowded into small pens: ‘Whale prison’ discovered by drone in Far East Russia pic.twitter.com/gkZBVmYwVp — RT (@RT_com) November 8, 2018 According to the animal-oriented web site The Dodo, the process for capturing the whales is harrowing and potentially deadly due to the stress and exhaustion the animals endure: “The capture operators are apparently using ‘purse seining,’” Naomi Rose, a marine mammal scientist at the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), told The Dodo. “They encircle a group of spooked whales with small chase boats. One of these boats drops a net into the water when the whales are huddled together and draws it around the group. The bottom of the net has a line attached and is pulled closed. This is ‘pursing’ — turning the net into a big bag, basically, with the whales inside.” Once the animals are caught, the operators will pick and choose which animals they want to keep. They’re particularly interested in juveniles between 3 and 4 years old, Rose explained. “They then pull the top of the net tighter and tighter until they have corralled off the whale they want … wrestle it onboard with the net or a stretcher, and release the rest,” Rose said. “Sometimes animals get entangled in the net and drown. Or they may exhaust themselves trying to ram through the net and suffer from capture myopathy, a condition that is essentially being exhausted to death — their hearts can simply stop beating.” “The trauma and distress these animals experience during captures is not opinion or emotion — it is fact,” Rose added. “They suffer intense stress-related reactions and their mortality risk spikes sharply soon after capture and then again after transport — they don’t get accustomed to the process. The decimated pods may experience similar stress and trauma — their offspring are being taken from them.” The whales' situation has caused something of an international outcry. Thousands of people have signed a petition demanding the release of the whales. Orcas are renowned for their intelligence, capacity to feel grief, and complex social and family relationships, and their well-being has been a point of evolving controversy . With many local populations endangered or threatened in the wild, the 2013 documentary Blackfish stoked a national backlash in the United States against marine parks such as Sea World for the treatment of captive animals. The matter has reached the highest office in Russia. On 19 December 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the state-operated news agency RIA Novosti that Putin was leaning on the local governor in an effort to resolve the issue. In late April 2019, the Russian government enlisted the help of French ocean explorer Jacques-Michel Cousteau of the Ocean Futures Society to help figure out how to safely release the animals in the summer. Criminal charges have been levied against the four companies that have held the whales captive. Reuters reported that as of June 2019, eight of the ten whales, two orcas and six belogas, had been released. However wildlife activists criticized the Russian government for lack of transparency and rushing the process, thus placing the animals at risk. In November 2019, Reuters reported that the release of the remaining whales had been completed, according to a statement from the Russian Research Institute for Fisheries and Oceanology.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1053
d400b93c-d5b2-4cd2-8141-2cf99cc83e12,"In late October 2019, we received multiple inquiries from readers about the accuracy of social media posts that claimed members of the family of U.S. President Donald Trump had been barred from operating charities in New York state, after they were found to have ""stolen"" from a children's cancer non-profit. The running of Trump family-related businesses and charities has been the subject of intense scrutiny, and even legal action, for several years. However, some of the allegations got a new lease on life in October 2019 after widespread sharing of one tweet, which read: ""Never Forget. The Trump family was disallowed from operating ANY charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity."" Never Forget. The Trump family was disallowed from operating ANY charity in the State of New York because they stole from a kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. A kids cancer charity. https://t.co/AwwbgWYDzB — Bruno Amato (@BrunoAmato_1) October 5, 2019 Those claims were further promulgated a few days later, when a screenshot of Bruno Amato's tweet was posted to Facebook by a user who goes by the name Donald Shirley: Were Trump family members banned from running charities in New York? In June 2018, then-New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood sued the president, his son Eric and daughter, Ivanka, along with the Donald J. Trump Foundation charity. Underwood wrote that: ""For more than a decade, the Donald J. Trump Foundation has operated in persistent violation of state and federal law governing New York State charities. This pattern of illegal conduct by the Foundation and its board members includes improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law."" As a result, Underwood asked the New York State Supreme Court to ""dissolve the Foundation for its persistently illegal conduct, enjoin its board members from future service as a director of any not-for-profit authorized by New York law, to obtain restitution and penalties, and to direct the Foundation to cooperate with the Attorney General in the lawful distribution of its remaining assets to qualified charitable entities."" Specifically, the attorney general asked the court to bar the president from running any New York-based charities for 10 years, and the other directors for one year. In December 2018, the attorney general and the defendants reached an agreement to dissolve the Trump Foundation and distribute its assets to a list of agreed charities. However, that agreement did not include Underwood's request that President Trump, along with Eric and Ivanka, be barred from operating a New York-based non-profit organization in the future, for varying periods of time. In January 2019, Letitia James took over as New York attorney general and continued the state's case against the Trumps. On Nov. 7, the state's Supreme Court published a final resolution of the case, one which did not bar either President Trump or his children Eric and Ivanka, from running charities in the state of New York. However, President Trump was forced to agree to certain stipulations involving governance, leadership structure and record-keeping, in the event that he wishes to become a non-profit director or board member within the state, in future. As part of the final settlement, Eric and Ivanka Trump were required to undergo (and have already undergone) ""an in-person, interactive board training session pertaining to charitable organizations and the fiduciary responsibilities of those organizations' directors and officers."" The final resolution of the case, published on Nov. 7, made it clear that the New York Supreme Court had not barred members of the Trump family from operating or running charities within the state, and so this element of the claim contained in Amato's viral tweet was false. However, it should be emphasized that at the time Amato posted his tweet (Oct. 5), that final resolution had not yet been published, and it was released only after this fact check was published. When Amato made his claims, a realistic possibility still existed that the court might indeed accept the Attorney General's request to bar the family members outright from running charities in the state, for various time periods. On that basis, we originally issued a rating of ""Mostly False."" However, the case was subsequently resolved without those outright bans being implemented, and therefore we have change the rating to ""False."" Did Trump family members steal from a children's cancer charity? The allegations involving members of the Trump family and a children's cancer charity are separate from the New York lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that sought to bar some of the family from running charities in that state. Amato's viral tweet inappropriately conflated the two sets of allegations by claiming that the charity ban (which was requested by the New York attorney general, but not granted by the court) was the result of Trump family members ""stealing"" from a children's charity. Investigations by both the Associated Press in 2016 and Forbes in 2017 found that the Eric Trump Foundation had misled donors and mismanaged funds, funneling money into Trump-owned businesses or other charities linked to the Trump empire. The Associated Press, for example, wrote that: ""A charity operated by one of Donald Trump’s sons flouts philanthropic standards by financially benefiting charities connected to the Trump family and members of the charity’s board, an Associated Press investigation shows. The AP found that Eric Trump has exaggerated the size of his foundation and the donations it receives. At the same time, the charity’s payments for services or donations to other groups repeatedly went to one of Donald Trump’s private golf clubs and to charities linked to the Trumps by corporate, family or philanthropic relationships ..."" Among other claims, the Associated Press alleged that: -- The Eric Trump Foundation failed to report multiple conflicts of interest by supposedly independent board members who work for The Trump Organization or Eric Trump’s winery, as required by the IRS. -- Based on its revenue and giving, the Eric Trump Foundation is a small-to-medium-sized charity. Eric Trump has repeatedly overstated its size. In 2015, for example, he said his group was “one of the largest foundations anywhere in the country, anywhere in the world.” Told of the claim, Associate Dean Patrick Rooney at Indiana University’s Center on Philanthropy said, “That’s just silly.” -- Though public charity boards are supposed to represent the public, Eric Trump has loaded his board with friends, relatives and Trump employees. They include two Trump company executives who served as senior presidential campaign aides: former Westchester golf club manager Dan Scavino and special Trump counsel Michael D. Cohen. The charity’s executive director, Paige Scardigli, was a close college friend of Eric Trump at Georgetown University. The 2017 Forbes article , which was included in Amato's widely shared tweet as a source, made similar claims about the operations of the Eric Trump Foundation. Those allegations haven't been tested in court and have not resulted in any legal action or prosecution. It should also be noted that nobody involved is accused of ""stealing,"" as such, with that word being understood in the conventional sense of meaning theft or embezzlement of funds. What is alleged is that the foundation engaged in misleading practices and that it inappropriately used donated funds to pay Trump businesses — practices that could be regarded as "" self-dealing ,"" rather than theft or embezzlement. In June 2018, a spokesperson for then-New York Attorney General Underwood told the Associated Press that her office had opened an investigation looking specifically at the affairs of the Eric Trump Foundation and St. Jude's Research Hospital.

On Nov. 5, Newsweek published an article with the headline, ""Russia Says Trump Once Offered to Help Putin Fight Wildfires -- Now He's Threatening to Withdraw Aid to California."" The article reported that: President Donald Trump seems more willing to help Russia fight wildfires than California, considering he just threatened to cut off federal aid to the state months after offering to aid Russia in battling blazes in parts of Siberia. On Sunday, Trump slammed California Governor Gavin Newsom for his handling of the wildfires and vaguely warned that he would end the federal funding. Newsom declared a statewide emergency last week in an effort to mobilize resources. ""Every year, as the fire's rage & California burns, it is the same thing—and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don't see close to the level of burn in other states,"" Trump wrote on Twitter... The president's remarks about California's governor come after he offered last summer to help Russia fight a similar battle against wildfires. According to the Kremlin, Trump made the offer to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a phone call in early August. At the time, the wildfires were so large that Greenpeace Russia said they were creating an ""ecological catastrophe."" Putin reportedly expressed his ""sincere gratitude"" to Trump for the offer and said that if necessary he would take him up on it. What Trump said about California Trump has a history of publicly criticizing officials in California (in particular Democrats such as Gov. Gavin Newsom) and attributing wildfires in the state to purportedly bad ""forest management."" He has repeatedly threatened to withdraw federal emergency assistance for the state, including in November 2018, when he tweeted ""Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more [federal] payments!"" There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 10, 2018 Two months later, he declared on Twitter: ""Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!"" Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2019 On Nov. 3, as the 2019 California wildfire season developed, Trump criticized Newsom in a series of tweets that read: ""The Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must 'clean' his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers...Every year, as the fire’s [sic] rage & California burns, it is the same thing -- and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don’t see close to the level of burn in other states...But our teams are working well together in...putting these massive, and many, fires out. Great firefighters! Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don’t pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now! [ Emphasis added ]."" In those tweets, Trump clearly indicated that continued federal financial assistance to California (specifically to Newsom) would be contingent upon state officials changing their approach to forest management. That constituted a threat to withdraw federal aid to California for wildfires, and Newsweek was right to describe it as such. What Trump said about Russia In August 2019, the Russian government published a statement about a phone call between Trump and Putin on July 31. That statement read as follows: ""Vladimir Putin had a telephone conversation with US President Donald Trump this evening at the American side’s initiative. The US President offered help in putting out wildfires in Siberia. The President of Russia expressed sincere gratitude for the kind attention and the offer of help and assistance. Vladimir Putin said he will accept the offer if it becomes necessary. He also told his American colleague that a powerful group of aircraft had been formed in Siberia to fight the wildfires. According to the Emergencies Ministry, solutions have been found to problems with the refuelling and deployment of airplanes and helicopters. ""The President of Russia regards the US President’s offer as a sign that it is possible that full-scale bilateral relations will be restored in the future. The presidents of Russia and the United States agreed to continue contacts in the form of telephone conversations as well as personal meetings."" We asked the White House whether they could corroborate, even broadly, the Russian government's characterization of the call. Unfortunately, we did not receive a response. At the time, a White House spokesperson did not contradict that version of events and told news outlets that, during his conversation with Putin, Trump had ""expressed concern over the vast wildfires afflicting Siberia."" This characterization, combined with the Russian description of an offer to help, means it's perfectly plausible that Trump did make such an offer. We found confirmation that he did in a video of an Aug. 1 press conference during which Trump said the following when reporters asked him about the phone call: ""Mostly we discussed the forest fires in Siberia, and other parts of Russia. And I said, look, we have the greatest equipment, if we could help you let us know. Large sections are burning, and so I said to President Putin, if we can help you, let me know.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1279
15c252c5-ca5f-401c-a235-822144d9971c,"On Nov. 13, 2016, the Center on Human Rights Education posted a message on their Facebook page announcing the passing of one of their colleagues, Monica Petersen: MONICA PETERSEN I am heartbroken to report that Monica Petersen died today in Haiti. She was a recent graduate of the Korbel School, a Research Fellow and an Assistant Director at the Human Trafficking Center, and had moved to Haiti to teach and start an NGO. Monica was a scholar-activist committed to serving the dispossessed and a clear and critical voice in the human trafficking field. She was also a dear friend and colleague to many of us. I will post the time and date of a memorial service soon. --Prof. Claude d'Estrée The location of Petersen's death (Haiti) and the scope of her work (human trafficking) seemingly added fuel to the prominent conspiracy theory that the Clintons have been quietly killing off their political foes for the last three decades. That conspiracy was then tied into criticisms of the Clinton Foundations' work in Haiti (which, whatever its flaws, has never been credibly linked to a child sex trafficking ring). Still, Petersen's death was presented as the "" smoking gun "" that connected everything together. A thread on the r/the_donald section of Reddit collected the ""evidence"" in an attempt to prove that Clinton was responsible for Peterson's death, including a link to a blog post critical of the Clinton Foundation which Petersen reportedly shared on Facebook (a screenshot of the message shows that it wasn't actually posted by her, but rather it was attributed to her), an alleged message from one of Petersen's friends claiming that she died of suicide, and a Facebook message Petersen allegedly wrote (again, a screenshot of the message shows that it wasn't actually shared by Petersen, but was attributed to her) stating that ""Hillary Clinton is just as bad as Donald Trump."" Although the purported Facebook friend stated that Petersen died of a suicide, an official cause of death has not been announced as of this writing. Monica Petersen may have been critical of the Clinton Foundation's work in Haiti (although the evidence presented comes from secondary sources and not from Petersen herself), but there's no evidence linking the Clintons to her death. On Nov. 18, several people took to Facebook to ask the Human Trafficking Center if Petersen had been killed by the Clintons. The organization has deleted most of those messages, but they did respond to at least one by saying that such messages should be ignored because giving their posters attention ""will only feed the flames of their craziness"": On Dec. 6, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler reported that Claude d’Estree, the executive director of the Human Trafficking Center, had confirmed that Petersen committed suicide in Haiti. ""D’Estree said Petersen had gone to Haiti a number of times, but she was not there to research human trafficking and was not investigating the Clinton Foundation,"" Kessler wrote. In sum, although no details of the circumstances of Petersen's death (apart from its being self-inflicted) have been made public, there is zero evidence linking the Clintons or Clinton Foundation to sex trafficking, or to Peterson's suicide. We therefore rate this rumor ""False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,618

The claim that Girl Scout Cookie sales fund Planned Parenthood became popular in mid-2015 and early 2016, likely due in part to a series of questionable viral videos targeting the latter organization circulated in the summer of 2015.  However, the rumor had previously spread widely in 2012, after Fox News reprinted a (since-deleted) opinion piece from LifeSiteNews that stated (in part): When our sweet little neighbor in her brown camp uniform came knocking on our door this year, we had to say no. I told her mother that I didn’t want to hurt Katie’s feelings, but I couldn’t support the Girl Scout cookie sale anymore because I’d learned too much about the organizers’ agenda, primarily their support for abortion and partnership with Planned Parenthood ... Several years ago. a quarter of the Girl Scout councils nationwide admitted to partnering with Planned Parenthood, the nation’s abortion giant. When questioned about the affiliation on NBC’s “Today Show,” Girl Scout CEO Kathy Cloninger had no compunction in confirming it. In fact, what then-Girl Scout CEO Kathy Cloninger said on NBC's Today show back in 2012 was that Planned Parenthood was one of several organizations (including church communities and YMCAs) that the Girl Scouts worked with ""to bring information-based sex education programs to girls.  Cloninger did not state (or imply) that any financial support relationship existed between the two organizations. We contacted the Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA) to determine whether any portion of the rumor was true. They responded to say that no proceeds have ever been donated from the sale of Girl Scout Cookies to Planned Parenthood. The Girl Scout Cookies section of the Girl Scouts website's FAQ declares that all revenue raised from cookie sales goes to the local Girl Scout councils and troops, not outside organizations: Q: Does any part of Girl Scout Cookie Program revenue support organizations other than the local Girl Scout council? A: One hundred percent of the net proceeds from Girl Scout Cookie sales is retained by the originating council and troop to power amazing experiences for girls and influential girl-led community projects. Girl Scout troops set goals for how to spend their proceeds on program-related activities, such as paying their own way to a community event or museum or funding other program outings. Girl Scout troops may also choose to use proceeds to purchase materials for a Take Action or service project to benefit the community. The Social Issues portion of the FAQ also states that GSUSA ""does not have a relationship or partnership with Planned Parenthood"": A 12 March 2015 New York Times compendium piece addressed the rumor and found it lacking: In recent years, conservative groups have challenged the organization — even held “cookiecotts” — over critics’ claims that it supports abortion. One Indiana lawmaker in 2012 went so far as to say the Girl Scouts were “quickly becoming a tactical arm of Planned Parenthood.” The Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. does have a legislative agenda. Reducing bullying and increasing girls’ involvement in science, technology, engineering and math are among issues on its website. Not on the list: abortion, or any social issues . Anna Maria Chávez, the chief executive of the national group, responded to critics last year, denying any relationship with Planned Parenthood. “A box of Girl Scout cookies is not a political statement,” she said. As Girl Scouts of the United States of America is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, their financial statements are by law made freely available to the public, along with their annual report .",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,840
12399048-a536-45ac-99f5-efb64bbf7357,"In May 2018, survivors of the Parkland school shooting massacre, and many others both on and off social media, responded with horror at reports of a video game in which players could assume the role of a school shooter. Jaclyn Corin, a survivor of the Feb. 14, 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, called the game (which is titled Active Shooter ) ""disgusting"" in a tweet and urged others to sign a petition calling for the game not to be released. (The online petition garnered almost 100,000 signatures within four days.) Ryan Petty, whose 14-year-old daughter Alaina was killed in the shooting rampage, accused Valve Corporation (the Bellevue, Washington, company that runs the Steam platform on which the game would be distributed and run) of ""trying to profit from the glamorization of tragedies affecting our schools across the country"" and also called the game ""disgusting."" The game was indeed real: it was published by a Russian company called Acid and developed by Revived Games (featuring games such as Furry , Tyde Pod Challenge , and White Power: Pure Voltage . which carries the following description: ""The Underworld is an alternate dimension existing in parallel to the human species world. It contains the same parts of the Universe as humanity does, but much more in a darker, colder and hostile manner."") Active Shooter ' s descriptive entry on Steam's web site read as follows: Pick your role, gear up and fight or destroy! Be the good guy or the bad guy. The choice is yours! Only in ""Active Shooter"", you will be able to pick the role of an Elite S.W.A.T member or the actual shooter. A video preview of the game showed a shooter armed with a rifle, handgun, and knife stalking the classrooms and corridors of a school, shooting at both police and civilians while a ""kill counter"" shows the number of ""cops"" and ""civ"" (civilians) the player had murdered. Every civilian shown in the preview video appeared to be female: In a difficult-to-follow post on May 23, 2018, the game's publisher claimed that Active Shooter ""does not promote any sort of violence, especially any soft [sic] of a mass shooting."" The publisher went on to note that the game will probably not allow players to assume the role of the shooter by the time the game is released: After receiving such high amount of critics and hate, I will more likely remove the shooters role in this game by the release, unless if it can be kept as it is right now. We asked Valve Corporation whether Active Shooter would still be released on June 6, 2018, and if so, whether it would still feature the shooter mode. We did not receive a response to our query, but shortly afterwards we noticed that Acid's games were no longer listed among Steam's offerings. Subsequently, the gaming news web site PC Gamer reported that both the publisher and developer of the game -- Acid and Revived Games -- had been removed from the Steam platform. PC Gamer quoted what it called a ""Valve rep"" as saying that the publisher and developer were the same person: This developer and publisher is, in fact, a person calling himself Ata Berdiyev, who had previously been removed last fall when he was operating as '[bc]Interactive' and 'Elusive Team'. Ata is a troll, with a history of customer abuse, publishing copyrighted material, and user review manipulation. His subsequent return under new business names was a fact that came to light as we investigated the controversy around his upcoming title. We are not going to do business with people who act like this towards our customers or Valve. In mid-June, Acid announced plans to offer Active Shooter for purchase via its own platform. On June 26, they posted a notice to that effect on the Steam community board, noting that Active Shooter had been renamed Standoff .

0afa08eb-201e-4d5d-86be-37be40f14fdd,"As teenage environmental activist Greta Thunberg found herself in the global spotlight in September 2019, climate-change deniers sought to discredit her with a series of false rumors and doctored photographs . Perhaps the most preposterous of these claims was that Thunberg was actually an Australian actress named Estella Renee who was delivering speeches on environmental issues not because she was concerned about the planet, but because she was a deep state crisis actor and paid to shill. While researching this article we found at least three variations of the ""Greta Thunberg is an actress"" claim. They are as follows: Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee. Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page and this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous. Actress Estelle Renee is a crisis actor who portrayed a crying teenager (not Greta Thunberg) during a climate protest. We'll take a deeper look at each of these items individually. Greta Thunberg is actually Australian actress Estelle Renee? Several social media users have claimed that Thunberg is actually an Australian actress named Estelle Renee. Facebook user Jack A. Schulman, for instance, wrote : Aspiring Actress impersonates crying child climate activist at UN, impersonator is a sham. Screams ""How dare you!"" from acting class. Estella Renee is a very talented shakespearian actress from Australia. She can do Scandinavian accents. She can break down and cry. She can scream ""How dare you!"". She deserves an Academy Award not a Nobel for impersonating Heidi looking Greta Thunberg, a fictional Character before the UN yesterday, a fake climate activist, a child actor age 15 and 1/2 screaming ""How dare you!"" straight out of "" Streetcar named Desire! "". Otherwise, she's a sham and a fraud! Her publicist refused to respond to our calls, but NY customs identified her as Estrella Renee, here ""to see the sights"" at her entry from Australia. Her adult accompaniment signed her into her hotel room as Greta Thungren, but we confirmed she is Estelle Renee. We turned over her illegal false identity to DHS who has confirmed her dual identity, but is still investigating. They are not sure impersonation is a crime. Yet, what a fraud!! This claim is nonsensical. Thunberg didn't appear out of thin air in September 2019 to deliver a speech to the United Nations. She's been on the public radar since at least September 2018 when she started staging climate protests in Sweden. Thunberg has also been nominated for numerous awards (including the Nobel Peace Prize), has met with several world leaders, and took a highly publicized voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, we know the identity of Thunberg's parents, Svante Thunberg and Malena Ernman, as well as her grandfather, Olof Thunberg, and her sister, Beata. In other words, Greta Thunberg is not a ""fictional character."" Her journey to becoming a global environmental activist has been well documented. Greta Thunberg has an IMDB page. Is this is proof that her environmental activism is disingenuous? A slightly less far-fetched version of this claim holds that Thunberg is listed as an ""actress"" on her IMDB page. While this is true , many have shared this screenshot as if it was somehow damaging to Thunberg's reputation as an environmental activist: Thunberg has one acting credit to her name. She lent her voice to a short film titled ""Ave Paraíso"" that was released in Spain in 2019. The remainder of her IMDB page simply lists appearances she's made on television programs (such as ""The Daily Show"") or in environmental documentaries where she is credited as herself. The fact that Thunberg has an IMDB page is often shared along with the insinuation that her environmental beliefs are not sincere. However, it should be noted that being an actor does not automatically disqualify someone from having an opinion, being an activist, or having a political career. Oscar-winner Leonardo DiCaprio , for instance, often lends his voice to environmental causes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Ronald Reagan were both actors before embarking on political careers. Even U.S. President Donald Trump is listed as an ""actor"" on his IMDB page: The website Michael Smith News noted one additional detail about Thunberg's IMDB page that seemingly hinted at the notion that she was a paid actress looking for new gigs. The website wrote that ""you can talk to her agent if you'd like to book her for acting work"" and then linked to an IMDB Pro link. However, it doesn't appear that Michael Smith News has access to IMDB Pro. When we checked Greta's listing on IMDB Pro, we found no listing for Thunberg's alleged agent. Does the viral video of a young climate protester crying feature actress Estelle Renee? Thunberg wasn't the only environmental activist to be accused of being an actor. The websites TeaParty.org , The Gateway Pundit , Joe for America , and the aforementioned Michael Smith News all published articles about how it was ""all a hoax"" and that the ""little girl seen crying in viral video"" at the Global Warming rally was really a child actress, ""a prop for the left,"" named Estelle Renee: The international left used innocent children last weekend to push their climate change extremism. Tens of thousands of children were let out of school so they could go protest against capitalism and global warming. As we reported on Monday — One terrified little girl in Australia couldn’t even talk to reporters about climate change without crying... ...But that was not your typical emotional teen. The girl in the video is an Aussie child actress. These articles are referring to a viral video from May 2019 of a young protester who broke down in tears while talking to reporters about climate change. The video in question can be seen in the second of the following tweets: This young girl is so terrified about ""climate change"" she can’t even speak to a journalist about her fears without breaking down in tears. So sad. The Marxists have gotten their hands on our children and we have allowed it to happen. #ClimateStrike pic.twitter.com/YN2xAjGvIj — Oh boy what a shot (@ohboywhatashot) September 20, 2019 The young protester in this video, whose real name is Estella Brasier, does have a profile on the talent website Star Now . However, these websites provided no evidence that this person was paid to appear at this protest or to ""act"" that they were concerned about the environment. And as we noted above, the fact that a person has acted or is an actor does not disqualify them from having personal beliefs. Brasier's father spoke to Maarten Schenk of the debunking website LeadStories about this rumor: The events of that day are in the public domain and were on every TV station. The ideas and concerns expressed by Estella depicted in that video are entirely genuine, not paid for, she was not acting... ...Estella was not expecting to be interviewed by the media that day: it could have been her, it could have been anyone else. She was just standing closest to the cameras. It is possible to be both worried about climate-change and a child actress at the same time.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1360

But that isn't the case. For starters, the sign notes that this wage is ""based on position and availability."" In other words, this wage isn't available to all new hires. Furthermore, Chick-fil-A restaurants are individually owned, meaning wages vary depending on location. While some Chick-fil-A franchises may offer similar wages to those featured on this sign, the wage is not a company-wide policy. This photograph was taken at a Chick-Fil-A in Pleasanton, California. In July 2019, this Chick-fil-A location posted a similar flyer to their Facebook page: This isn't the only Chick-fil-A restaurant that is offering close to $17 an hour. Another Chick-fil-A restaurant in Sacramento, California, raised its starting wage to $17 hour. Eric Mason, owner of the Sacramento Chick-fil-A, told a television station in June 2019 that he was hoping to attract ""hospitality professionals"" with his new wage offer. According to a CBS News report : The owner of a Chick-fil-A location in Sacramento, California, calls it a ""living wage."" In Eric Mason's view, that would be $17 or $18 an hour, which is what he vows he'll be paying his workers, starting Monday, June 4. The rate represents a sizable increase for employees now making $12 to $13 an hour. ""As the owner, I'm looking at it big-picture and long-term,"" Mason told a local news station. ""What that does for the business is provide consistency, someone that has relationships with our guests, and it's going to be building a long-term culture."" While at least two Chick-fil-A restaurants are truly offering starting wages close to $17 an hour, this pay is not available at all Chick-fil-A locations. According to Payscale , a company that surveys employees and employers for information about wages, the average hourly rate for a Chick-fil-A employee is about $10 an hour. A spokesperson for the company told us that because Chick-fil-A restaurants are individually owned, franchise owners set their own wages: Chick-fil-A restaurants are individually owned and operated, so wage decisions are made at the local level. With that said, Chick-fil-A strives to create a compelling employment value proposition including competitive wages, leadership development opportunities and scholarships.

The subjects started struggling with the troopers and were able to disarm Trooper Foerster. One of the men opened fire, killing Trooper Foerster and wounding the other trooper. Despite the wounds, the other trooper was able to return fire and killed of the subject. The three subjects were members of the Black Liberation Army. During her trial, Shakur denied any involvement in either Foerster's death or the shooting of his fellow trooper, James Harper: [Chesimard's] testimony ended suddenly when Mr. Ball asked her, “On that night of May 2nd, did you shoot, kill, execute or have anything to do with the death of Trooper Werner Foerster?” “No,” she replied, shaking her head. “Did you shoot or assault Trooper James Harper?” “No.” The state's case against Mrs. Chesimard, presented over eight weeks through a number of witnesses including Trooper Harper, tells how the trooper stopped white Pontiac bearing Vermont license plates because it had a faulty tail light at about 12:30 A.M. on May 2, 1973. Trooper Harper radioed for back‐up support and Trooper Foerster arrived as Mr. Harper began to question the occupants of the car. Mr. Squire, who was driving, went to the back of the car with Mr. Foerster and soon began scuffling with the trooper. Mr. Harper testified that Mrs. Chesimard reached down toward the floor of the car and the next thing he knew he was shot through the left shoulder. He testified that he had exchanged shots with both occupants of the car and made his way on foot back to the turnpike headquarters nearby. Trooper Foerster's body was found about an hour later. Mr. Squire drove Mr. Costan and Mrs. Chesimard five miles south on the toll road, carried them from the car to grassy spot off the road shoulder and fled when additional state troopers arrived. He was captured the following day. Mrs. Chesimard was wounded and Mr. Costan was dead when the police arrived Shakur was found guilty but escaped from prison in late 1979 and eventually made her way to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum and has lived ever since. Colin Kaepernick's donation to Assata's Daughters was part of a pledge the quarterback made in September 2016 to give a total of $1 million to charity. That donation was not recent news in September 2018, as it had been made more than a year earlier, in April 2017. Kaepernick's official website lists the donation and specifies what the funding was earmarked for: AMOUNT: $25,000 Assata’s Daughters is a Chicago group that focuses on black female empowerment in the tradition of Asaata Shakur. This donation will specifically pay for: $2,500 Cop Watch $2,500 for Garden $5,000 Library $15,000 Teen Workshops.

Assata's Daughters states on their website that the organization ""carries on the tradition of radical liberatory activism encompassed by Assata Shakur,"" adding that ""We grew out of a critical gap in Chicago of programming for young women to get trained up in the radical political tradition of Black feminism, and to learn how to organize around the demand of abolition."" As part of their ""cop watch"" program, the group also offers recommendations for people seeking to record police encounters, advising that those who record such incidents should not interfere with officers as they perform their duties and should ""try to de-escalate the situation, not escalate it.""

Days earlier, CNN reported that Melbourne City police found a brick of cocaine on a beach after a beach-goer reported it as a ""suspicious package."" The officer had the package's contents tested and confirmed that they were cocaine: A beachgoer found the drugs, pointing out a ""suspicious package"" to a patrol officer monitoring the beach, Melbourne city spokeswoman Cheryl Mall told CNN. The officer took the package into custody, and the contents were tested, confirming the cocaine. This brick of cocaine was found a few days after law enforcement discovered another stash of cocaine on Cocoa Beach. Local news outlet Florida Today reported that officers found a duffel bag containing 15 kilos of cocaine worth about $300,000: Cocoa Beach police are asking beachcombers in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian to be cautious about suspicious packages after a duffel bag stuffed with 15 kilos of cocaine washed ashore over. The find — worth at least $300,000 — came before Dorian’s violent stirrings in the Atlantic led to a single brick of cocaine being found along a beach in Melbourne. “There is a possibility that more will come onshore. Especially now with these conditions. It could be coming from anywhere,” said Manny Hernandez, spokesman for the Cocoa Beach Police Department. “We’re telling people to be cautious and not to grab or handle it because if there is an opening, it can go into your pores and you can overdose,” he said. Cocoa Beach Police Sgt. Manny Hernandez told us that this duffel bag of cocaine was found ""pre-Hurricane Dorian"" on Aug. 30, 2019. It's unclear if these two packages were connected. However, as some of the cocaine washed ashore prior to the hurricane, we've marked this article as ""Mostly True."" Here are the facts regarding the cocaine that washed up in Cocoa Beach (Pre-hurricane Dorian): On Friday, August 30, 2019 (pre-hurricane Dorian) at approximately 17:16 (5:16pm), Cocoa Beach Police responded to the Beach End of S. 6th St, Cocoa Beach, FL., in reference to a suspicious package that washed up on shore. The red, travel style duffle bag, was noticed by a beach goer who immediately contacted the police department as the bag appeared suspicious. Responding officers believed the duffle bag contained illegal substance and properly removed it from the beach and transported the bag to the Cocoa Beach Police Department. Upon further inspection, the bag contained 15 small ""bricks"" that were tightly packaged. However, it was believed the packages may contain an unknown narcotic, possibly cocaine. Cocoa Beach Police contacted the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency and notified them of the suspicious bag and contents. A representative/Agent with the agency responded to the Cocoa Beach Police Department the same evening. U.S. Custom and Border Protection Agent inspected the packages and after removing several layers off one of the ""Bricks"", the Agent informed the substance to be cocaine. It is unknown who the duffle bags belongs to and unknown where the cocaine is from. There were no further incidents involving the duffle bag. The bag and the 15 ""Bricks"" (1 Kilo per brick) was turned over to U.S Custom & Border Protection Agent. The street value in the central Florida area is approximately $20K - $30K per ""Brick"" (Kilo). While these news reports may seem unusual, these incidents were not the first time drugs had washed ashore in Florida.

The segment in question was aired on 7 September 2018, during NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch's show ""Relentless."" The episode is no longer available, though clips are included in the following video: 0:00 / 0:00 Loesch was addressing a recent development on Thomas and Friends which saw two female characters (one of them from Africa) added to the show to bolster its international appeal and give more prominence to female characters: Announcing a new direction for the Thomas and Friends TV show, Mattel said that several changes to the 30-year-old show would help to update the brand’s image and popularity, particularly in Africa and Asia, where the characters and stories were hugely popular. Changes include some new female characters, including Nia, a train engine from Kenya, and Rebecca, a strong-willed, outspoken electric locomotive. Other female characters include an aeroplane from Australia and an Indian train yard controller. The changes are all an effort to modernise the Thomas brand and give it a distinctive international flavour. “We have added new female characters before, but I think, with a show like Thomas , they tend to fall into the background after initial introduction,” said Thomas and Friends producer Ian McCue. “What we wanted to do here was really bring these two female characters to the forefront.” Another of the show’s producers, Micaela Winter, said gender equality was important to the creators in the new series and going forward. Here are the relevant excerpts from Loesch's monologue on the subject, along with the imagery shown on screen along the way: Anyway, [the producers of Thomas and Friends] have decided that the next stop is ""virtue town."" Thomas the Tank is now bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains. Seriously. One of those trains, Nia, will be from Kenya to add ethnic diversity to the show. By the way, that's where it gets really strange to me because I've looked at Thomas and Friends, at their pictures, and they seem grey and blue. Am I to understand this entire time that Thomas and his trains were white? Because they all had grey faces. How do you bring ethnic diversity? I mean they had to paint what I guess they thought was some kind of African pattern on the side of Nia's engine? I mean, how do you bring ethnic diversity to a show that literally has no ethnicities, because they're trains! They don't even have skin pigmentation! Was there some concern that the show had racist undertones? Because, I mean, Sir Topham Hatt clearly is white, but the trains? I'm looking at this picture, and I'm really really struggling to understand how in the world there isn't any diversity in any of this ... [Reacting to Ku Klux Klan hoods on screen] Oh. Was it because? I see it. It was the white hoods and the burning train tracks. Ok fine, fair point, I get it. Thomas the Tank Engine has been a blight on race relations for far too long. Clearly, this is overdue, right? So the segment was structured as a joke: Loesch expressed outrage and bafflement about the introduction of female characters, including one from Kenya, then questioned whether the producers of Thomas and Friends were compensating for some previous racism on the show. The fake ""Ku Klux Klan"" image provided a punchline of sorts, with Loesch then theatrically ""accepting"" that there was, in fact, a need for greater diversity on the show. Loesch made some notable omissions and errors in her monologue. First, although she claimed that the show's producers were ""bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains,"" Thomas and Friends (and its spin-offs) have featured female characters (including trains) for many years. Some of those characters, including Gina and Frieda, were introduced in the 2016 film The Great Race , but others have been a part of the Thomas universe for much longer. Emily first appeared on the show in 2003, and Annie and Clarabelle (a pair of passenger coaches) were in the original 1946 book Thomas the Tank Engine and the subsequent television series. Second, Loesch failed to mention that the new initiative was part of a collaboration between the United Nations and Mattel, the toy company that own sthe Thomas the Tank Engine brand, to promote five of the U.N.'s 17 ""Sustainable Development Goals"": ﻿ In a press release , Mattel said that newest season of the show would see the characters travel beyond the fictional world of Sodor, to locations in China, India and Australia, and would see the introduction of several new (mostly female) characters from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and nationalities: The series will feature characters from around the world, including the new African steam engine from Kenya called Nia, Ashima from India, Yong Bao from China, and Shane from Australia, as well as host of new female characters ... including Isla, an Aussie flying doctor plane, Noor Jehan, a royal express engine from India, and Hong-Mei, a Number 1 Blue Tank Engine from China. In response to NRATV's ""Ku Klux Klan"" segment, Mattel issued a statement saying that ""We are not associated with images that promote hate and denounce any images of our brands that are being used to convey a message not in line with the values of the company.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1080
1ef3ff26-4b2f-4454-bfa9-4a1b365859e6,"On July 15, 2019, Kentucky TV station WAVE asked U.S. Sen. Rand Paul about controversial tweets directed at Rep. Ilhan Omar and other progressive Democratic congresswomen from President Donald Trump. In those tweets, President Trump had suggested those members of Congress should “go back” to the countries they came from. Rep. Omar, a representative for Minnesota’s 5th Congressional District, is a refugee from Somalia. As part of his response, Sen. Paul, R-Ky., suggested Omar was “unappreciative” of the U.S., stating that: I’m sort of dumbfounded how unappreciative she is of our country. She says this is terrible, a place without justice and all this. She’s a congresswoman. She got here as a refugee 20 years ago. She’s elected to congress. I can’t imagine a better country that elected her to congress and she badmouths our country. ... I know this Somali family that came about the same time [as Omar] to Bowling Green, and it’s just this dramatic story of hope and wonder … Those are the stories, but it’s not this angry story ... She has this bitterness and anger toward the country. Paul also was quoted in WAVE’s reporting as declaring, “I think she does deserve a rebuke over trying to say we have a rotten country.” The suggestion that Omar literally stated America is a “rotten country” made it into the headlines of several publications, including a Washington Examiner article shared by, among others, former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle and retweeted over 10,000 times. Social media shares and commentary related to these headlines indicated readers believed Omar had literally described America, the country, as “rotten”: We reached out to Sen. Paul’s office for clarification on his comment, asking which statement or statements of Omar's he was referencing, and if he was alleging that she literally called America a “rotten country” or if he was characterizing remarks she made as saying as much. Finally, we asked which of Omar’s remarks Paul believed amounted to a description of America as a ""rotten country."" A spokesperson for Paul did not provide the requested clarification but instead reiterated via email that the senator viewed Omar’s “continued criticism” as “unfair considering how much Rep. Omar has achieved”: Senator Paul believes that Rep. Omar’s continued criticism is unfair considering how much Rep. Omar has achieved. In what other nation can you arrive as a refugee and get elected to one of the highest national offices in such a short time? We found no public statements made by Omar in which she described America as ""rotten."" A spokesperson for Omar told us he had ""no record of her ever saying that."" Omar has written publicly about her pride in America and its democratic processes, especially those that allow for criticism. In a July 25, 2019, New York Times op-ed, for exampled, Omar wrote : The beauty of this country is not that our democracy is perfect. It’s that embedded in our Constitution and democratic institutions are the tools to make it better. It was in the diverse community of Minneapolis — the very community that welcomed me home with open arms after Mr. Trump’s attacks against me last week — where I learned the true value of democracy. I started attending political caucuses with my grandfather, who cherished democracy as only someone who has experienced its absence could. I soon recognized that the only way to ensure that everyone in my community had a voice was by participating in the democratic process. Today, that basic promise is under threat. Our democratic institutions have been weaponized. The Trump administration has sought to restrict people from exercising their voting rights. It has sought to undermine the basic checks and balances of our Constitution by not respecting subpoenas from Congress. And the president has used overtly racist rhetoric to strike fear and division in communities of color and religious minorities across the country ... The proudest moments in our history — from the Emancipation Proclamation to the civil rights movement to the struggle against fascism — have come when we fight to protect and expand basic democratic rights. Today, democracy is under attack once again. It’s time to respond with the kind of conviction that has made America great before. The suggestion that Omar described America as a “rotten country,” as portrayed in news headlines, appears to stem from words Paul — not Omar — used. We therefore issue a rating of ""false"" for this claim.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,865
09e87b01-d3cb-4e83-9db0-136163db3647,"Editors' Note This article discussed the potential implications of a case that was, at the time of writing, undecided by the Supreme Court. On 17 June 2019 the Supreme Court decided that case, rejecting arguments that could have resulted in a stronger presidential pardon. Far from Kavanaugh's being a deciding vote on the case, the court ruled 7-2 against the notion that Federal and State prosecution for the same crime violates the so-called “double jeopardy clause” of the Constitution. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil M. Gorsuch dissented. On 29 November 2015, a motorist named Terance Gamble , who had been convicted of second degree robbery seven years earlier, was pulled over by an Alabama police officer because of a faulty headlight on his vehicle. Upon searching the car, the officer found a handgun, among other items. It is illegal under both Alabama law and United States law for convicted felons to possess firearms, and Gamble was eventually sentenced to one year in prison on that charge by the state of Alabama. During Gamble's prosecution under Alabama law for possession of a firearm as a felon, the Federal Government also charged him with the same crime. Gamble’s lawyers argued that this second conviction was a violation of the U.S. Constitution’s ban on “double jeopardy,” which is intended to protect people from being prosecuted for the same crime more than once. The double jeopardy clause is found in Fifth Amendment to the U.S. constitution, which states (in part) that ""No person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” Specifically, the clause has been interpreted to be a prohibition on: Retrials after an acquittal; Retrials after a conviction; Retrials after certain mistrials; and Multiple punishments for the “same offense.” Gamble has been in federal prison since entering a guilty plea on 18 October 2016 that allowed him to appeal his case. In June 2018, the Supreme Court agreed to hear his argument that he has been unconstitutionally punished multiple times for the same crime. While the case is about the constitutionality of a man being charged twice for the same gun possession incident in a narrow sense, the case more broadly has the potential to significantly alter 150 years of Supreme Court precedent. Since the 1850s, the Supreme Court has allowed for one explicit exception to the Constitution’s double jeopardy protections: cases of dual sovereignty (or “separate sovereigns”) which stem from view that the federal government and state governments are distinct entities with occasionally overlapping jurisdictions. (Exceptions to this exception exist which seek to limit double prosecutions at the federal level, but as this case shows they do not always have that effect.) This ”separate sovereigns” exception to double jeopardy, though built on several previous rulings, was made most explicit in a 1920s bootlegging case, United States v. Lanza , which allowed a man to be charged with bootlegging crimes by both the state of Washington and the federal government. With respect to that case, Chief Justice William Howard Taft argued: We have here two sovereignties, deriving power from different sources, capable of dealing with the same subject matter within the same territory. Each may, without interference by the other, enact laws to secure prohibition, with the limitation that no legislation can give validity to acts prohibited by the amendment. Each government, in determining what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity, is exercising its own sovereignty, not that of the other. How Can a Case Overturn a Precedent? The separate sovereigns exemption has for much of its history been a controversial precedent which critics maintain is not rooted in the original text of the Constitution but is instead cobbled together from different partially relevant Supreme Court decisions -- decisions rooted in a time when the federal government was less powerful and whose questions never directly sought to address the explicit matter of double punishment for the same crime in state and federal jurisdictions. This argument is reflected in Gamble’s filing . The government argues in this case that the precedent is well-established through myriad Supreme Court cases and consistent with the Founding Fathers' vision of state and federal government duality: The dual-sovereignty principle has been “long held”, and “consistently endorsed” by this Court, which has recognized its soundness as a matter of “[p]recedent, experience, and reason alike,” The Court explained the roots of the principle more than 150 years ago. And in 1959, the Court described a challenge to the dual-sovereignty doctrine as “not a new question,” having been “invoked and rejected in over twenty cases"" ... Each sovereign is entitled to “exercis[e] its own sovereignty” to “determin[e] what shall be an offense against its peace and dignity” and prosecute the offender “without interference by the other.” Under petitioner’s interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, one sovereign’s efforts (successful or not) to enforce its own laws would vitiate the other sovereign’s similar law-enforcement prerogatives. But that cannot be squared with the Constitution’s bedrock structure of governance. In this case, Gamble has explicitly asked the Supreme Court to rule on a single specific question: “Whether the Court should overrule the “separate sovereigns” exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause.” Why Would President Trump Be Interested in the Outcome of This Case? The reason Gamble v. United States is generating buzz from people other than constitutional law scholars is that the separate sovereigns exception also prevents President Trump from pardoning people for state crimes. Under current Supreme Court precedent, a presidential pardon of an individual does not prevent that individual from being prosecuted for the same or similar crimes under state law. “Under the dual sovereignty doctrine,” Adam J. Adler wrote in the Yale Law Review , “as long as two offenses are defined by different jurisdictions, they cannot constitute the ‘same offense.’” The Congressional Research Service issued an August 2018 report on the potential ramifications of the case, and this report included a discussion of its possible effect on the presidential pardon power: The Gamble case may nevertheless have significant collateral legal effects ... A win for Gamble could also indirectly strengthen the President’s pardon power, by precluding a state from prosecuting an already-pardoned defendant who has gone to trial on an overlapping offense. What Does This Have to Do with Brett Kavanaugh? Some pundits have speculated that the reason why certain politicians seem to be in a rush to seat Judge Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is that is that he has a notably strong view of presidential powers and therefore would be a vote in favor of Gamble and for an expansion of presidential pardon powers -- and the Supreme Court announced they would be hearing this case the day after Justice Kennedy’s retirement. This temporal proximity has prompted some commenters to opine that the rush might be motivated by a desire to limit the president’s legal liability in the Russia probe and other investigations: While we cannot speculate on the motives of politicians who are supporting Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, The Atlantic reported that prominent political legal scholars agree in a general sense with the view of this case’s having importance with regard to President Trump’s pardon power: Within the context of the Mueller probe, legal observers have seen the dual-sovereignty doctrine as a check on President Donald Trump’s power: It could discourage him from trying to shut down the Mueller investigation or pardon anyone caught up in the probe, because the pardon wouldn’t be applied to state charges. Under settled law, if Trump were to pardon his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for example -- he was convicted in federal court on eight counts of tax and bank fraud -- both New York and Virginia state prosecutors could still charge him for any crimes that violated their respective laws ... If the dual-sovereignty doctrine were tossed ... then Trump’s pardon could theoretically protect Manafort from state action. If Trump were to shut down the investigation or pardon his associates, “the escape hatch, then, is for cases to be farmed out or picked up by state-level attorneys general, who cannot be shut down by Trump and who generally -- but with some existing limits --can charge state crimes even after a federal pardon,” explained Elie Honig, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New Jersey. The Atlantic also reported that at least one member of the Senate Judiciary Committee who approved Kavanaugh for a floor vote before the full Senate, Orrin Hatch, has publicly weighed in on the topic (unmotivated, he says, by the implications for the pardon power), filing an Amicus Curiae brief in favor of Gamble which argued that “the pervasive federalization of criminal law to cover conduct that traditionally was prosecuted and punished by the states, and that falls within the states’ core legislative interests, threatens to undermine the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause unless the dual sovereignty doctrine is overruled in this context.” Oral arguments for the case have not been scheduled but will occur during this Supreme Court term. If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh could become a deciding vote in the case.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1731
0175222c-968e-4ccc-81cb-15afe9fdae80,"Origin During a 27 April 2019 political rally in Wisconsin, U.S. President Donald Trump made a false and incendiary remark, claiming that doctors and pregnant women confer with each other to decide whether to ""execute"" newborn babies. There is no truth to this statement. In a speech in Green Bay, Trump stated, ""The baby is born. The mother meets with the doctor. They take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully. And then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they will execute the baby."" The comment is similar to one Trump made in February 2019 on Twitter when Senate Democrats at that time blocked the ""Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,"" a bill that would require doctors to provide the same degree of care to a baby born alive after a failed abortion as they would to any other child of the same gestational age. Citing the similarly-titled ""Born Alive Infants Protection Act,"" which has been on the books since 2002 , Democratic lawmakers called the new bill an attempt to discourage abortion providers from performing legal procedures. In his Wisconsin speech, Trump was referencing a veto by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of a state-level law that mirrored the federal ""Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,"" which Wisconsin's GOP lawmakers had advanced. (Evers blasted Trump's remarks, stating, ""To say that doctors in the state of Wisconsin are executing babies is just a blasphemy."") ""It is not at all true,"" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the University of California at San Francisco, in regards to the president's comments about ""executing"" babies. Doing so would be illegal, as illustrated by the infamous case of Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted of murder in 2013 for delivering babies of unwanted pregnancies and ending their lives by severing their spinal cords at his Philadelphia abortion clinic. Stories about babies surviving abortions and either being killed or callously left alone to die is a common pro-life trope, as are over-representations about the frequency and legality of late-term abortions. Grossman says a fetus likely could not survive an abortion, and if it did, the law requires that it be cared for in the same manner as any other baby of its same gestational age. (Although there's no bright line, fetuses are generally considered viable outside the uterus sometime between the 24th and 26th week of gestation, depending on its health, Grossman said.) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), only 1.3 percent of all abortions occurred at 21 weeks or more of gestation in 2015 (the latest figures available). Cases after 24 weeks are a small minority of that 1.3 percent, Grossman said. The majority of second-trimester abortions are done surgically , while the majority of terminations after 24 weeks are done with medication . Injections are used first to induce fetal demise, and then medications are given to induce delivery, Grossman told us. In rare cases a pregnancy must be ended to save the life of the pregnant woman. And those cases sometimes involve a delivery in which the fetus can't survive outside the uterus or would suffer severe disabilities if it did, Grossman added. Conditions can include preeclampsia , a deadly condition that can occur as early as 20 weeks into pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and organ damage in the woman. It can only be treated by delivering the fetus. Those cases result in painful decisions that the parents and their medical care team must make — either take what's known as "" heroic measures "" to intervene aggressively in an effort to save the baby's life, or to instead provide comfort care as the baby's life ends naturally. ""That's a very difficult and personal decision that family has to make with their care team,"" Grossman said. It's also important to note that ""heroic measures"" in these cases can be painful, not just futile, as they involve starting intravenous (IV) lines in tiny, fragile blood vessels to push drugs; multiple blood draws' and sticking a breathing tube down the baby's windpipe to force air into the lungs. ""These are really severe cases involving severe malformation [and/or] extreme prematurity, where really the chance [of survival] is close to zero if not zero, and it just doesn't make sense to put both the baby and the family through that,"" Grossman added. Grossman told us that Trump's most recent remarks are worrisome because while the physical safety of abortion providers has always been an immediate concern , the statement widens the target to include regular providers. ""What he said most recently, that wasn't really just talking about abortion providers. He was kind of implying that regular OB-GYNs might do what he described."" In a statement released by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Dr. Lisa Hollier, the organization's president, called Trump's comments inflammatory and offensive, saying, ""The rhetoric used to describe the delivery of abortion care was offensive, wrong, and dangerous. Claims of this sort undermine the public’s trust in OB-GYNs and stigmatize necessary health care for women. Politicians must never use inflammatory language that can contribute to or encourage hostility or violence toward doctors, other medical professionals or individuals seeking or receiving health care.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1011
d5318b52-3919-4b7b-9e19-119d650722cf,"Origin In March 2019, right-leaning and pro-life websites criticized the Girl Scouts of the USA in response to reports about a member in Southern Arizona who planned to achieve the organization's ""Gold Award"" with a project about women's reproductive health. On 5 March, the website LifeNews.com published an article with the headline ""Girl Scouts Gives Its Highest Award to Teen Who Organized Campaign Promoting Abortion,"" which continued: The Girl Scouts’ support of abortion is growing increasingly apparent in the information age. Its materials, social media accounts and more point to the organization’s pro-abortion bias. One of the groups exposing it, MyGirlScoutCouncil.com, posted more evidence Friday on its Facebook page. Breitbart reports the group discovered that the Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona recently honored a teen for her volunteer work on ""reproductive health justice"" – an umbrella term that includes abortion on demand. Meghna Gopalan, recently profiled in a Tucson publication, received the Gold Award, the Girl Scouts highest honor, for her work. Her project involved working with the pro-abortion Women’s March and its affiliate in Tucson. She said her goal was to ""educate people about and destigmatize access to women’s healthcare"" — euphemisms for abortion. The right-leaning website Daily Wire published an article with a headline that similarly claimed ""Girl Scouts Give Highest Award to Girl Who Organized a Pro-Abortion Campaign."" Also, MyGirlScoutCouncil.com, a pro-life website that publishes criticisms and concerns about the iconic civic group, posted to Facebook, describing the controversy as follows: ""A project to “educate people about and destigmatize access to women’s healthcare” earns Girl Scouts Gold Award, its highest award. Completing this Girl Scout project for “reproductive health justice” began by joining the Women’s March."" The original source of these outraged responses was a November 2018 article published by the website ""This is Tucson,"" which featured a brief interview with Gopalan. The article read: ""In the last few years, Meghna Gopalan has found her voice. The 2016 election sparked her interest in civic engagement, and earlier this year she participated in March for Our Lives. Then, while working on her Girl Scout Gold Award , the Basis Tucson North sophomore decided to speak up about women's healthcare. Now, she's helping with media outreach for the Tucson Women's March."" Of her Gold Award project, Gopalan said: ""I'm planning on hosting an event to educate people about and de-stigmatize access to women's healthcare. I've been working with El Rio Reproductive Health Access Project, and they offered ideas on reproductive health justice which would broaden the scope of the project a little bit."" Analysis It's true that a Girl Scout in Arizona discussed in an interview her plans for a Gold Award project involving an event associated with ""women's healthcare"" and ""reproductive health justice."" However, the claim that she achieved the Gold Award for 'promoting abortion' falls down on two grounds. Firstly, a spokesperson for the Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona clarified, in response to our questions, that as of 8 March 2019, Gopalan had not yet completed her Gold Award project, and therefore had not yet risen to the rank of ""Gold Award Girl Scout."" Secondly, after this fact check was originally published, a spokesperson for the Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona provided additional details and clarification about Gopalan's planned Gold Award project. Whereas previously there had been uncertainty over whether Gopalan intended to promote access to abortion or present a pro-choice viewpoint, the spokesperson definitively clarified that Gopalan's project ""will not cover abortion in any way,"" and would focus instead on issues such as the HPV vaccine and domestic violence, and that it had never been her intention to examine the issue of abortion in her Gold Award project. In a statement, the spokesperson wrote: In the case of Girl Scout Meghna Gopalan, her passion is healthcare. Her Gold Award proposal was accepted, after undergoing the rigorous process of attending our Gold Award Workshop, meeting with our Highest Awards Coordinator and Gold Award Committee, forming community connections to support her project, and ensuring that her project met the standards of the Girl Scout Gold Award. The capstone of her Gold Award project is a community health fair, where attendees will learn about topics within women’s health: the HPV vaccine, how to seek help in response to intimate partner violence, and the basics of keeping their bodies healthy, from pap smears to breast self-examinations. Experts from El Rio Health and Emerge! Center Against Domestic Violence will serve as speakers. Meghna’s health fair will not cover abortion in any way, and it has never been her intention to broach the subject. Her goal is, and has always been, to educate, and to combat the stigma she sees among girls her own age when it comes to seeking personal health information and resources. In her own words: “Reproductive justice to me means making sure that all girls and women—regardless of our background, education, income, or age—have access to education and information about healthcare. We all have bodies, but we don’t all know how to keep them healthy.” This means that the reports by LifeNews.com and The Daily Wire were without factual basis not only because they inaccurately claimed that Gopalan had already achieved the Gold Award (when she had not), but also because they had conflated ""women's healthcare"" and ""reproductive health justice"" with abortion, when in fact, Gopalan had never mentioned abortion in her interview and had never intended to address abortion in her project, but was focusing instead on some of the many other issues relating to women's healthcare. My Girl Scout Council's Facebook post, which formed the basis of articles by LifeNews.com and The Daily Wire, was also inaccurate in claiming that Gopalan had already achieved the Gold Award. In our original fact check, we signalled this as a possibility, pointing out that LifeNews had inaccurately described ""access to women's healthcare"" as a ""euphemism for abortion,"" whereas in reality women's reproductive healthcare encompasses much more than merely abortion services and includes access to contraception and birth control, among other matters. We also pointed out that the El Rio Reproductive Health Access Project ( RHAP ), the initiative with which Gopalan said she had been working, is part of the Tucson, Arizona El Rio Health Center, a federally-qualified health center that is legally barred from providing abortion services. As a result, a spokesperson confirmed, the El Rio RHAP is also barred from providing abortion services and does not even give direct referrals for such services, instead focusing on sex education, contraception and birth control and STI testing. Although it was inaccurate to claim that Gopalan's planned project would give expression to a pro-choice viewpoint on abortion, it seems likely that the Girl Scouts organization would not object to such a Gold Award project. We asked the Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona whether they encourage scouts to avoid certain topics or issues in their Gold Award projects. Their answer strongly indicated that neither that Girl Scouts organization nor its guidelines would prove to be an obstacle if a Girl Scout proceeded with a project that promoted a pro-choice viewpoint on abortion: ""Regarding content: neither our staff nor our volunteer Gold Award committee determine the topics, causes, or issues that girls choose to address through their Gold Awards. At Girl Scouts, we don’t seek to censor girls or dictate to them what they must feel strongly about—and we support all girls regardless of their personal beliefs. Instead, we seek to give girls the tools and skills to take action on any issue they choose. That’s what it means to be girl-led."" Following confirmation from the Girl Scouts of Southern Arizona that Gopalan's project ""will not cover abortion in any way,"" and that it had never been her intention to address that issue in her project, we have changed our rating from ""Mixture"" to ""False"" in relation to the claim, reported by LifeNews and the Daily Wire, that the Girl Scouts had given the Gold Award to a project which promoted abortion.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1546
cdbb0eed-3dd3-439d-88b4-aaa537fc9e77,"In January 2019, California state senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) introduced a bill ( SB-145 ) to modify the state penal code to allow certain individuals convicted of sex offenses involving minors to apply for discretionary relief from having to register as sex offenders. The bill was passed by the legislature on Aug. 31, 2020, and signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sept. 11. The aim of the revised statute, according to a 2019 press release from Wiener's office, is to redress the disparity between how heterosexual and LGBT sex offenders were treated under existing law: Currently, for consensual yet illegal sexual relations between a teenager age 15 and over and a partner within 10 years of age, “sexual intercourse” (i.e., vaginal intercourse) does not require the offender to go onto the sex offender registry; rather, the judge decides based on the facts of the case whether sex offender registration is warranted or unwarranted. By contrast, for other forms of intercourse — specifically, oral and anal intercourse — sex offender registration is mandated under all situations, with no judicial discretion. This distinction in the law — which is irrational, at best — disproportionately targets LGBT young people for mandatory sex offender registration, since LGBT people usually cannot engage in vaginal intercourse. For example, if an 18 year old straight man has vaginal intercourse with his 17 year old girlfriend, he is guilty of a crime, but he is not automatically required to register as a sex offender; instead, the judge will decide based on the facts of the case whether registration is warranted. By contrast, if an 18 year old gay man has sex with his 17 year old boyfriend, the judge *must* place him on the sex offender registry, no matter what the circumstances. A Feb. 21, 2019 article on The Washington Pundit website put a decidedly different spin on the proposal and foreshadowed the tone of the debate to follow. That article, entitled ""CA Democrats Introduce LGBTQ Bill that would Protect Pedophiles who Rape Children,"" claimed: SB-145 would allow a sex offender who lures a minor with the intent to commit a felony (i.e. a sex act) the ability to escape registering as a sex offender as long as the offender is within 10 years of age of the minor. SB-145 would add a section to the state’s penal code (Section 290.55) stipulating that as long as the offender is “not more than 10 years older than the minor,” they are not automatically mandated to register as a sex offender. There is no age limit or range specified, except for existing law which already excludes lewd acts with children under 14. SB-145 appears to allow adults to victimize minors by luring them with the intent to have sex, and then shields the predator from being automatically registered as a sex offender, as in the case of a 25 year old luring a 15 year old for sex, or a 22 year old luring a 12 year old. SB-145, as currently written, appears to allow certain sexual predators to live among the population without anyone being aware. These claims were at best misleading and at worst false, beginning with the headline. The new law does not, under any reasonable interpretation, ""protect pedophiles who rape children."" Although the crimes addressed in SB-145 fall under the heading of statutory rape (given that the victims are under 18, the statutory age of consent), they do not include forcible sex crimes of any kind, as a spokesperson for Sen. Wiener, Victor Ruiz-Cornejo, explained in an email: Currently, there are several non-forcible, “consensual” sexual offenses involving minors which require lifetime sex offender registration. These cases involve minors who are having a sexual relationship with someone over the age of 18. Although minors cannot legally consent to sexual activity, the cases are viewed as “consensual” because the sexual activity is not forced and the minor is a willing participant. SB 145 does not apply for anyone 14 years or younger. Moreover, it is not the case that the new law would, per the article's claim, ""allow a sex offender who lures a minor with the intent to commit a felony (i.e., a sex act) the ability to escape registering as a sex offender as long as the offender is within 10 years of age of the minor."" The law doesn't allow anyone to ""escape"" registering. Rather, it allows people found guilty of unforced oral or anal intercourse with a minor 14 or older, if there is no more than 10 years' age difference between them, to apply to the court for the same discretionary relief from mandated sex-offender registration that is already afforded to those found guilty of vaginal intercourse with a minor. That is to say, a court will decide whether the offender must register, based on the facts of the case. Also, according to Ruiz-Cornejo, ""luring a minor"" for purposes of sex is not one of the crimes covered in the bill. ""Senate Bill 145 does not protect anyone from luring children (under 14 years old) or teenagers (above 15 years old) with the intent to commit sexual assault,"" he told us. ""Luring a minor is treated differently and does not fall under the consensual relationships this bill is addressing."" We asked Ruiz-Cornejo for further clarification on this, given that the text of the bill did state that it applies to Section 288.3 of the Penal Code, which addresses contacting a minor with intent to commit a felony (including certain sex offenses), but he didn't elaborate. We followed up with Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Dan Felizzatto, who confirmed what Ruiz-Cornejo told us and explained that when a defendant is prosecuted for luring a minor (including children under 14) ""they would be charged with [Penal Code] Section 272 because that is the luring section."" Conviction under Section 272 requires mandatory sex offender registration if it involves lewd or lascivious conduct (with no provision for discretionary relief). Additional charges are often filed in such cases, which could include, for example, a violation of Section 288.3 (contacting a minor with intent to commit a felony) or any substantive sex offense that would be appropriate, but any discretionary relief from mandatory registry provided for under Section 288.3 would not apply to the luring charge under Section 272. Nothing in SB-145 precludes a district attorney from filing a case in such a way as to prevent an individual who commits a sex offense against a minor under 14 from taking advantage of the discretionary relief provision, Felizzatto said. ""Those types of sex offenders are predatory and would not benefit from the changes in SB-145."" Given that the second quoted paragraph of the Washington Pundit piece references ""existing law which already excludes lewd acts with children under 14,"" the paragraph that follows contains a blatant falsehood, citing the example of ""a 22-year-old luring a 12-year-old"" to show how the proposed legislation supposedly ""shields"" child predators. ""The bill does not apply to anyone under 14 years old,"" Ruiz-Cornejo said when we showed him the passage. ""Nor does the bill shield anyone, it simply grants the judge discretion."" (The Washington Pundit deleted the example and noted the correction after we contacted them to point out its inaccuracy.) Finally, the sentence ""SB-145, as currently written, appears to allow certain sexual predators to live among the population without anyone being aware"" simply repeats the erroneous claim that discretionary relief will be granted to sexual predators. We sought comment on the discrepancies in the article from The Washington Pundit's publisher, who defended the website's overall characterization of the bill. ""By eliminating the different treatments for vaginal vs oral and anal assaults, it doesn’t change the nature of the bill,"" he said in an email. ""It actually expands on it and applies more protection to the pedophile. (Our definition of pedophile is an adult who sexually preys on children)."" He also stood by the claim that the bill would ""protect pedophiles who rape children,"" citing California's age-of-consent law as a reason to ignore the distinction between forcible rape and ""consensual"" sex acts such as those that fall under the heading of statutory rape: When an adult takes advantage of the innocence of a child, they are raping them. That’s why we don’t believe in having consensual sex with a drunk, adult woman. She may have consented but she wasn’t in the right state of mind to give actual consent. When a guy knowingly has sex with a drunk woman, he knows she isn’t in her normal state of mind. We believe any pursuit to engage in sexual acts that isn't respectful and misleading the woman’s or child’s state of mind is immoral and equal to rape. Now, your definition of rape may be different. According to our definition, and the definition of our audience, it fits the description of rape. The title is not misleading. The title may be interpreted differently depending on who is reading it. In March 2019, Wiener's office issued an amended version of SB-145 to clarify its intent and allay public confusion about which types of offenses were and were not included in the bill. After the bill finally became law in September 2020, its provisions were once again widely misrepresented and assailed as ""pro-pedophilia."" Wiener called these claims ""grossly disingenuous.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1807
5b305e72-4c71-4780-8e52-afe4d253d701,"Verizon Wireless admitted that they made a ""mistake"" after fire officials in nothern California revealed the company had stifled their data usage amid a historic wildfire in July 2018. According to Santa Clara County Fire Chief Anthony Bowden , the data service provider failed to live up to their policy of lifting data caps in emergency situations when Bowden department asked for help while they battled the Mendocino Complex Fire. As of late August 2018, the fire had consumed more than 400,000 acres of land, making it the largest wildfire in California history. The complaint came to light as part of a lawsuit filed by attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia, as well as the County of Santa Clara, the Santa Clara County Central Fire Protection District, and the California Public Utilities Commission, seeking to overturn the Federal Communication Commission's move to repeal net neutrality rules. Bowden made his allegation in an addendum to an amicus brief filed by the complainants: Verizon representatives confirmed the throttling, but rather than restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they indicated that County Fire would have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the cost, and they would only remove throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new data plan. Bowden said the data throttling primarily affected one specific vehicle, OES 5262, which his department employed to ""track, organize, and prioritize routing of resources from around the state and country to the sites where they are most needed"" during the blaze. The department's plan called for their data speeds to be slowed if they used more than 25 gigabytes a month. ""In the midst of our response to the Mendocino Complex Fire, County Fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262 was being throttled by Verizon, and data rates had been reduced to 1/200, or less, than the previous speeds,"" he wrote. Verizon released a statement conceding that they ""made a mistake"" in discussing the department's plan: Regardless of the plan emergency responders choose, we have a practice to remove data speed restrictions when contacted in emergency situations. We have done that many times, including for emergency personnel responding to these tragic fires. In this situation, we should have lifted the speed restriction when our customer reached out to us. This was a customer support mistake. We are reviewing the situation and will fix any issues going forward. Verizon rejected the department's contention that the incident could be connected to the repeal of net neutrality rules. However, officials in Santa Clara County said that Verizon's actions during the fire represent conduct that is being encouraged by the repeal. ""Verizon's throttling has everything to do with net neutrality -- it shows that the ISPs will act in their economic interests, even at the expense of public safety,"" said county counsel James Williams.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,541
a2a75329-f9ba-468e-9a97-a8fcef9694d0,"Many conservatives in the United States have long perceived and presented the Democratic party and liberals as being ambivalent or even hostile towards organized religion, especially Christianity. In January 2019, a Fox News report added to fears held by some on the right that the new Democratic majority in the U.S. House of Representatives would attempt to impose its purportedly progressive, secular agenda on that body, including by removing references to ""God"" from the oath required of individuals who testified before one particular House committee: A key committee in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives is moving to eliminate the God reference from the oath administered to witnesses testifying before the panel, as part of a new rules package expected to be approved this week, according to a draft obtained exclusively by Fox News. The draft shows that the House Committee on Natural Resources would ask witnesses to recite only, ""Do you solemnly swear or affirm, under penalty of law, that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"" The rules proposal places the words ""so help you God"" in red brackets, indicating they are slated to be cut. The words ""under penalty of law"" are in red text, indicating that Democrats propose to add that phrasing to the oath. The Fox News report linked to a document that appeared to be a draft of proposed changes to the rules of the House Natural Resources committee, whose chairperson and vice chairs are indeed Democrats. On 30 January, the Natural Resources committee convened and unanimously agreed to re-insert the words ""so help you God"" into the witness oath. After this article was originally published, the committee formally published the earlier draft rules, thus confirming the authenticity of the document Fox News posted online on 29 January. As a result of this authentication, we have changed the rating in this fact check from ""Unproven"" to ""True."" Although the committee subsequently abandoned the plan to remove the phrase from the oath, that took place after Fox News first published its report, which was therefore accurate at the time it was posted. What the document said It is standard procedure for congressional committees to revise and change the rules under which they operate after the swearing-in of a new Congress every two years. The rules of the House Natural Resources Committee for the 115th Congress (from January 2017 to January 2019) contained a section governing how committee hearings should be conducted. As part of those rules, section (e) of Rule 4 set out the oath that was to be sworn by individuals who testified before a hearing of the House Natural Resources Committee: ""(e) Oaths. — The Chairman of the Committee, the Chairmen of the Subcommittees or any Member designated by the Chairman may administer oaths to any witness before the Committee. All witnesses appearing in hearings may be administered the following oath by the Chairman or his designee prior to receiving the testimony: 'Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?'"" According to the draft document originally produced by the same committee (and first published by Fox News), the proposed rules for the same committee in the 116th Congress (which is currently sitting) would have changed the section on oaths by removing the phrase ""so help you God,"" among other alterations: ""(e) Oaths. - The Chair of the Committee, the Chairs of the Subcommittees or any Member designated by the Chair may administer oaths to any witness before the Committee. All witnesses appearing in hearings may be administered the following oath by the Chair or his designee prior to receiving the testimony: 'Do you solemnly swear or affirm, under penalty of law, that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?'"" The phrase ""so help you God"" was explicitly labelled for deletion, rather than being accidentally left out. This is because the document included an introductory note that ""All changes [are] shown in red, with text proposed to be deleted placed in brackets."" And in the original document, ""so help you God"" was placed within brackets and was in red. The following graphic shows Rule 4 (e) from the House Natural Resources Committee rules under the 115th Congress (top) and the draft proposed changes for the 116th Congress (bottom): On 30 January, after this article was published, the Natural Resources committee formally published the original draft of proposed rule changes, which had deleted ""so help you God,"" thus authenticating the document posted by Fox News and confirming the accuracy of the network's report. The committee also posted the "" Manager's Amendment ,"" tabled by Committee Chair Rep. Raúl Grijalva, which proposed re-inserting ""so help you God"" into the text of the witness oath.

a19e3fb2-7028-4ef9-8491-a7f8a9507bf0,"As any victim of 2017’s Fyre Festival would surely tell you, just because someone posted something on Instagram does not mean that post was in any way a representation of reality. Case in point: a post from an Instagram user published on 20 January 2019 alleging that President Ronald Reagan, at some indeterminate point in time, had described Nancy Pelosi as “extremely evil”: Displaying a flawed understanding of both the constitutional power granted to United States presidents as well as standard punctuation, the poster suggested “it’s time Trump exercises his right of reduction in force and get rid of this b****”, referring to Pelosi. The post, which included hashtags such as “#endtimes”, “#islam” and “#libtards”, was the earliest reference we've found to this alleged Reagan quote. The meme has since been shared by numerous other accounts that promote the QAnon conspiracy theory. We found no record of Reagan's ever making such a statement in any public forum. We reached out to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to ask if there was any possibility the 40th president ever uttered anything close to these words, and Michael Pinckney, an archivist with the library, told us in response that ""I couldn't find any source for this quote. I researched President Reagan public speeches and Nancy Pelosi doesn't even show up. [I] also researched our open papers and again, her name doesn't come up."" “On a personal level,” Pinckney told us via email, “this doesn't sound like something President Reagan would say.” Joanne Drake, the Chief Administrative Officer for the Reagan Foundation, concurred. Via email, she told us ""President Ronald Reagan never spoke those words at any time – and never would."" Although Nancy Pelosi’s time in national politics began in 1987, at the tail end of Reagan’s presidency and political career, the Pelosi family and the Reagan family (both from California) have enjoyed cordial relations. At the unveiling of a Ronald Reagan statue in June 2009, for example, Nancy Reagan and Nancy Pelosi shared these words : Pelosi ... noted [President Reagan’s] civility, a quality that has since all but vanished in Washington. ""Ever a gentleman, he never questioned the motives of the person because he knew people in public office loved our country and acted on behalf of the American people,"" Pelosi said. Former first lady Nancy Reagan, 87, whose last visit to the Rotunda was when her husband lay in state there five years ago, singled out the speaker among the many dignitaries gathered. ""I'm very grateful to her,"" she said. ""Everybody else, too, but particularly Nancy."" Her voice breaking, Nancy Reagan added, ""It's nice to be back under happier circumstances,"" With that, the two women, both dressed in white, warmly embraced and turned to unveil the enormous bronze likeness. It is true that Nancy Pelosi hails from a powerful family of Baltimore Democrats. Her father , Thomas D'Alesandro Jr., “served 22 consecutive terms in public office, from state delegate to city councilman to U.S. congressman to Baltimore mayor, followed by a low-level appointment from President John F. Kennedy to something called the Federal Renegotiation Board.” Pelosi’s brother , Thomas D'Alesandro III, has also served as mayor of Baltimore. Because this quote only emerged 14 years after Reagan’s death as an unattributed, unsourced Instagram meme for “#libtards,” because we found no evidence to support the notion that Reagan ever said anything close to these words, and because the sentiment expressed does not sound like something Ronald Reagan would say, we rate this claim as false.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,716
100406c5-aedf-4f41-bac0-44cc41b3bdf7,"On 30 December 2018, News Punch , a junk news website with a long history of spreading misinformation , published an article reporting that 10,800 American children had been raped by illegal immigrants during 2018: ""The number of U.S. children raped by illegal immigrants in 2018 was a staggering 10,800, according to data compiled by NCFIRE (North Carolinians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement)."" This claim has multiple dubious aspects, starting with the NCFIRE data. NCFIRE purports to compile ""monthly child rape reports"" covering sexual assaults committed by illegal immigrants in North Carolina. Our inspection of their data, however, turned up a number of issues. For starters, while the data were compiled under the title ""monthly child rape reports,"" the supporting documents actually included a variety of sex-related crimes, such as possession of child pornography and ""indecent liberties with a child,"" that aren't rape. We also found one individual who was included in the 2018 report even though he raped a child in 2011. That person presumably was included in the 2018 report because of an arrest that year for failing to report an address change. In addition to including outdated charges and crimes other than rape in the ""monthly child rape reports,"" NCFIRE also appears to be counting arrests, not convictions. In other words, a number of individuals included in these reports have only been accused of crimes, and the charges against them may be dropped or found to be unsupported at trial. Furthermore, while some entries on this list link to genuine reports from ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the majority of entries include links to news reports or mugshot pages that make no mention of immigration status. Although this group claims that they ""verify the illegal alien status of each individual we post in our Monthly Child Rape reports through the arresting agency of each individual,"" a spokesperson for the Raleigh Police Department told us that they ""were not familiar"" with NCFIRE. Despite the multiple problems with the rape reporting, News Punch used these statistics to come up with their 10,800 figure: Meanwhile, data compiled by NCFIRE (North Carolinians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement) reveals that the state of North Carolina has arrested an average of 18 illegal aliens every month this year for the crime of child rape. Statistically, this means that the 50 states in America are on track to arrest 10,800 illegal aliens for raping children in 2018. And that 10,800 figure is a bare-minimum, super-generous, giving-the-illegal-alien-child-rapists-the-benefit-of-the-doubt number. A total of 10,800 arrests assumes that each illegal alien child rapist only rapes one child in America. Many will rape three, four, or a dozen before they are caught, so the ""true"" number could be in the 30,000 to 40,000 raped children range. The claim that 10,800 children in the U.S. were raped by illegal immigrants did not originate with a law enforcement agency, government body, or other reputable crime-tracking source. Rather, an average figure pulled from questionable data compiled by one group in one state was extrapolated to the entirety of the U.S. without basis. That number also doesn't square with what we know about the criminal activities of illegal immigrants or the statistics for sexual abuse against children. Although the 2018 ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Report does not specifically list crimes against children, it does shed some light on the number of sexual crimes committed by illegal immigrants. According to the ICE report, 5,350 charges or convictions of sexual assault were levied against illegal immigrants during the 2018 fiscal year. Another 6,888 charges or convictions relating to sexual offenses (not involving assault) were also recorded: Table 1 tallies all pending criminal charges and convictions by category for those aliens administratively arrested in FY2018 and lists those categories with at least 1,000 combined charges and convictions present in this population. These figures are representative of the criminal history as it is entered in the ICE system of record for individuals administratively arrested. Each administrative arrest may represent multiple criminal charges and convictions, as many of the aliens arrested by ERO are recidivist criminals. The claim that 10,800 American children were raped by illegal immigrants in 2018 is also implausible due to the fact that the vast majority of sexual crimes against children are committed by parents or relatives, as the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network ( RAINN ) reported in 2016: Out of the yearly 63,000 sexual abuse cases substantiated, or found [by] strong evidence, by Child Protective Services (CPS), the perpetrator was most often the parent: 80% of perpetrators were a parent 6% were other relatives 5% were ""other"" (from siblings to strangers) 4% were unmarried partners of a parent",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,881
850ddbf1-b737-4f6d-a0d1-cea98ba17fb4,"In 2018 an apparently defunct Instagram page highlighted the criminal charges against Cardinal George Pell, as contrasted with a controversial remark he made years earlier. A graphic showed Pell, described as ""the third-highest ranking official in the Vatican and currently charged with multiple counts of child sex abuse,"" above a statement attributed to him holding that ""Abortion is a worse moral scandal than priests sexually abusing young people"": In this case, the graphic is accurate on all counts. Pell made the infamous statement during a World Youth Day event in July 2002, in reply to an American youth minister's asking him how Catholics should respond to questions regarding the findings of systematic sexual abuse committed by church officials. When asked to explain his rationale, Pell (who at the time was the Archbishop of Sydney) said, ""Because [abortion] is always a destruction of human life."" The following month, Pell maintained that while the original reporting on his comment did not mention his condemnation of sexual abuse, he would not backtrack on the original statement: I ... mentioned that the church is being attacked for [sex abuse] sometimes by elements that are a bit anti-Christian ... I said there are other scandals, such as abortion which are under-reported and because abortion destroys innocent life you could say it's a worse scandal. On 24 February 2014, Pell (who was by that point a cardinal) was appointed by Pope Francis to oversee the newly-created Secretariat for the Economy, granting Pell ""authority over all economic and administrative activities"" in the Vatican. Since then he has been described by multiple news outlets as being the Vatican's third-highest ranking official. Allegations of sexual abuse against Pell date to 2002 , when he was accused of having molested a 12-year-old boy in 1961. An inquiry commissioned by the National Committee for Professional Standards, a group overseen by the Catholic Church of Australia, determined that the allegations were ""unsubstantiated."" But in June 2017, Pell was charged with historical sexual assault, a term used to an identify alleged offense that took place in the non-recent past. While some of those charges have been dismissed, on 1 May 2018 Pell was ordered to stand trial on other counts. He pleaded not guilty. Coverage of the trial in Australia was suppressed under a court-imposed order, but on 11 December 2018 Pell was reportedly convicted of abusing two choir boys in the country during his tenure as archbishop of Melbourne in the 1990s. In 2019, Pell will be tried for separate accusations of sexual abuse.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,478

Had this measure passed, it would have been the basis for negotiating a final bill with the House of Representatives. Not all of the non-returning legislators who cast votes against the ACA were ""voted out"" in a literal sense, as some ""retired"" (i.e., didn't run for re-election) and saw their seats go to Democrats: House of Representatives Jason Lewis Erik Paulson Kevin Yoder Pete Sessions Steve Russell Rod Blum David Young Randy Hultgren Peter Roskam Bruce Poliquin Keith Rothfus Mike Bishop Jeff Denham Steve Knight Mimi Walters Dana Rorbacher Mia Love Claudia Tenney Tom Macarthur Carlos Curbelo Dave Brat Scott Taylor John Faso John Culberson Rodney Frelinghuysen (retired, seat flipped) Martha McSally (ran for U.S. Senate, seat flipped) Mark Sanford (retired, seat flipped) Dave Trott (retired, seat flipped) Darrell Issa (retired, seat flipped) Steve Pearce (retired, seat flipped) Ed Royce (retired, seat flipped) U.S. Senate Jeff Flake (retired, seat flipped) Dean Heller On the other hand, seven GOP House Members did not vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act yet still saw their seats lost to Democrats: Barbara Comstock Leonard Lance Dan Donovan Mike Coffman Ryan Costello (retired, seat flipped) Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (retired, seat flipped) Frank LoBiondo (retired, seat flipped) Some commenters who went through the photograph used in the meme in microscopic detail to try to discern the identities behind the tiny faces obscured with red X's noted that they didn't all correspond to the (unnamed) members of Congress whose seats were lost after they voted to repeal the ACA: Kinda steps on your point when you get this many wrong.

41c88de5-2162-4d13-8111-19c3fd377401,"The fate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh hung in the balance in early October 2018 as the Senate Judiciary Committee awaited the results of an FBI investigation into allegations that he had committed a sexual assault some 30 years before -- allegations that Kavanaugh angrily denied in his Senate testimony. The Senate was already sharply divided along party lines on the urgency of pushing ahead with the confirmation, with Democrats demanding a full and unimpeded investigation into the charges and Republicans accusing the Democrats resorting to delaying tactics and attempting to destroy Kavanaugh's reputation. Public opinion was divided as well, with 45 percent of Americans saying they believed Kavanaugh's accuser (Professor Christine Blasey Ford) and 33 percent saying they believed Kavanaugh in an opinion poll taken four days after their testimonies. This clash of opinions played out on social media as uncivil debates raged in which each faction claimed the moral high ground and accused the other of lies and hypocrisy. A meme shared on 1 October took aim at Kavanaugh by calling out a GoFundMe account supposedly established in his and his family's name: The implication, of course, is that as a presumably wealthy and privileged member of the Washington elite, Judge Kavanaugh doesn't need a fundraising account. Other social media users made the same point: Yes, a gofundme page has raised over $100,000 for ‘poor’ Brett Kavanaugh.

The most successful of these had raised more than $600,000 by 5 October. It was opened by John Hawkins of North Carolina, who runs a partisan news and opinion website called Right Wing News . In an introductory note on the GoFundMe page, Hawkins explained the thinking behind it as follows: Like many decent people from both parties, I have been disgusted by the unsubstantiated 36 year old smears aimed at Brett Kavanaugh. We live in a country where innocent until proven guilty is supposed to mean something; yet Brett Kavanaugh's reputation is being dragged through the mud while his family is facing non-stop death threats. This is a horrible way to treat a good man who has dedicated his life to public service. So many unethical people are giving unprovable 36 year old accusations the same weight as 6 FBI background checks, hundreds of hours of hearings and testimony under oath. It is disgraceful. What I'd like to do is raise money for Brett Kavanaugh's family to use for security or however they see fit. All of the money collected will go to Brett Kavanaugh's family or alternately, if they refuse to accept it, to a charity of their choice. I have already reached out to a contact who should be able to put me in touch with Brett Kavanaugh's family. If he can't do it, I have plenty of other contacts who should be able to make it happen. I will update this page after I have talked with his family. I hope you will show your support for a good man who has been treated very, very badly. Hawkins posted updates chronicling his efforts to get in touch with the Kavanaugh family to discuss disbursing the funds. After many unsuccessful attempts he finally spoke to one of the judge's staffers, who told him that although the family is aware of the GoFundMe account and ""extremely appreciative"" of the donations, it would be a while before they could address the question of whether or not Kavanaugh, as a political appointee, can accept the money. On 30 October, Hawkins posted an update which included an ""official statement"" from Kavanaugh's representatives saying he would not accept the funds: ""Justice Kavanaugh did not authorize the use of his name to raise funds in connection with the GoFundMe campaign. He was not able to do so for judicial ethics reasons. Judicial ethics rules caution judges against permitting the use of the prestige of judicial office for fund-raising purposes. Justice Kavanaugh will not accept any proceeds from the campaign, nor will he direct that any proceeds from the campaign be provided to any third party. Although he appreciates the sentiment, Justice Kavanaugh requests that you discontinue the use of his name for any fund-raising purpose."" GoFundMe accounts were also started for Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford. The most successful of those had accumulated more than $540,000 in donations as of 5 October. A note from Ford posted on the GoFundMe page expressed her appreciation to all those contributing: I feel like all of you who have made a contribution are on this journey with me, which is very heartening. And some journey it has been and continues to be. We have already had to move four times, our movements are limited even with security, and the threats are ongoing. Thanks to you, I am able to feel safe, my family can be together, and my children can continue to go to school. On 21 November, Ford announced the closure of the GoFundMe account, pledging to donate any unused funds to trauma survivors: The funds you have sent through GoFundMe have been a godsend. Your donations have allowed us to take reasonable steps to protect ourselves against frightening threats, including physical protection and security for me and my family, and to enhance the security for our home. We used your generous contributions to pay for a security service, which began on September 19 and has recently begun to taper off; a home security system; housing and security costs incurred in Washington DC, and local housing for part of the time we have been displaced. Part of the time we have been able to stay with our security team in a residence generously loaned to us. With immense gratitude, I am closing this account to further contributions.

But across the continent Macron wants to bind closer together, there's a stark pattern: German Chancellor Angela Merkel also has no children. British prime minister Theresa May has no children. Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni has no children. Holland's Mark Rutte has no children. Sweden's Stefan Lofven has no biological children. Luxembourg's Xavier Bettel has no children. Scotland's Nicola Sturgeon has no children. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, has no children. This is too remarkable to ignore. While Macron is young -- 39 years old -- the rest of Europe is being governed by childless Baby Boomers. Breitbart News amplified this list in a post on the same topic two months later: The list goes on ... Latvia’s childless president is Raimonds Vējonis, Lithuania’s childless president is Dalia Grybauskaitė, and Romania’s childless president is Klaus Werner Iohannis. Breitbart highlighted these leaders to make a deep-state conspiracy talking point: “They are not part of a family and have come to see all their attention focused on one dominant and all-powerful social unit to which they pay obeisance and give their complete and devoted attention: The State.” The Examiner posited a different but equally unsubstantiated thesis: “contemporary childless leaders, however ascendant they feel today, may be the last gasp of secularism ... The future is won by those who show up, and only the religiously orthodox are having children.” Without addressing these speculative claims, we note first that both articles’ accounting of European leaders’ children is not 100% accurate; second, their lists are written to exclude the stepchildren of those leaders; and third, their lists ignore, for the sole purpose of making a faulty point, the majority of European leaders with multiple biological children. Below is a table of the leaders mentioned in those articles (which includes Jean-Claude Juncker, who doesn't actually head any country), along with the number of biological or stepchildren each has in their family: Leader Country / Gov. Body Biological Children Stepchildren Emmanuel Macron France 0 3 Angela Merkel Germany 0 2 Theresa May United Kingdom 0 0 Giuseppe Conte* Italy (*as of 2018) 1 0 Mark Rutte Holland 0 0 Stefan Lofven Sweden 0 2 Xavier Bettel Luxembourg 0 0 Nicola Sturgeon Scotland 0 0 Raimonds Vējonis Latvia 2 0 Dalia Grybauskaite Lithuania 0 0 Klaus Werner lohannis Romania 0 0 Jean-Claude Juncker European Commission 0 0 Posts such as the Examiner ’s and Breitbart’s entirely ignore stepchildren, even in cases (like Macron's) when those leaders are reportedly quite close with a spouse's children. For example, Angela Merkel has two stepchildren from her husband’s first marriage, but her husband has made it a stated point to avoid news media coverage of their family life. In other cases, the reports are factually incorrect or outdated. Breitbart made the claim that Raimonds Vējonis was the “childless president” of Latvia, despite the fact that he is married with two children . References from 2017 were correct in stating that previous Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni had no children, but in 2018 Giuseppe Conte took office, and he has a son from a previous marriage. Additionally, these posts cast leaders' childless statuses as intentional, discounting cases in which those persons have tried unsuccessfully conceive children. In September 2016, for example, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon opened up to the BBC about having a miscarriage while deputy first minister of Scotland: “Sometimes ... having a baby just doesn't happen -- no matter how much we might want it to,"" she said. Furthermore, Europe includes far more countries than the 13 chosen to make a point about the continent's supposedly “barren elite.” While Breitbart did say “the list goes on” before incorrectly introducing the president of Latvia as childless, their list really did not “go on”. Below is a table of the 18 remaining European Union countries ignored in these posts, as well as the numbers of their leaders' copious progeny: Leader Country Biological Children Stepchildren Alexander Van der Bellen Austria 2 0 Charles Michel Belgium 2 0 Rumen Radev Bulgaria 2 1 Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović Croatia 2 0 Nicos Anastasiades Cyprus 2 0 Miloš Zeman Czech Republic 2 0 Lars Løkke Rasmussen Denmark 3 0 Kersti Kaljulaid Estonia 4 0 Sauli Niinistö Finland 3 0 Prokopis Pavlopoulos Greece 3 0 János Áder Hungary 4 0 Leo Varadkar Ireland 0 0 Marie-Louise Coleiro Preca Malta 1 0 Andrzej Duda Poland 1 0 Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa Portugal 2 0 Andrej Kiska Slovakia 5 0 Borut Pahor Slovenia 1 0 Pedro Sánchez Spain 2 0 The assertion that most European leaders are childless is false, and the claims presented by the Washington Examiner and Breitbart News cherry-picked countries, misstated facts, and ignored stepchildren in order to make dubious speculative points.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,987
3a174df2-052b-4e69-9175-8f4edb91b3e4,"At least one account of generosity stemming from the devastating Camp Fire in California in November 2018 can be verified as true. As the Grass Valley Union newspaper and other news outlets reported , the Paradise Adventist Academy girls' volleyball team arrived to compete in a California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) playoff game on 10 November 2018 to find that their opponents at Forest Lake Christian High School had provided them with both material and financial support. After the game, Forest Lake athletic director LaRon Gordon announced that local parents and students had donated around $16,000 as well as shoes, clothes, and toiletries to their opponents as well as gift cards for each individual player. Gordon's team also gave Paradise Adventist new jerseys, shorts, and knee pads to use for the contest, which was a semifinal match in the Northern California Division VI regional tournament. Forest Lake also received permission from the CIF to forego charging admission to the game in favor of donating all tickets sales to help victims of the fire. ""I've never been so overwhelmed by so many things I would have never thought possible, and this is one of the most amazing things I could ever have thought would happen,"" Paradise Adventist head coach Jason Eyer said following the announcement. ""Your community is awesome. We will be forever grateful."" Gordon's announcement was also captured in a video posted online: Forest Lake won the game in four sets, though they lost the Division IV regional final to Stone Ridge Christian out of Merced, California, three days later. (We contacted Eyer seeking further comment about his team's memorable away game but did not receive a response prior to publication.) The fire, which erupted on 8 November 2018, had killed 77 people as of 18 November 2018, with another 1,276 people listed as missing in its aftermath. It consumed nearly the entirety of the town of Paradise, a small community in Butte County in northern California, and forced evacuations in several other cities including: Paradise; Centerville; Yankee Hill; Concow; and Butte Creek Canyon. It was also the cause of another disagreement between President Donald Trump and California Gov. Jerry Brown: while Brown cited the fire as a consequence of climate change, the president blamed what he called poor management for the blaze, eliding the fact that some 60 percent of California state forests are under management by federal agencies. More than 50,000 people were reportedly displaced by the blaze, and air quality across the Bay Area decreased as a result of smoke produced by the fire. However, meteorologists predicted that the region would receive some rainfall to alleviate that situation in mid-November 2018.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,500
5294086b-cd42-4b0c-83c2-bb75a019ed39,"On 1 November 2018, the Trump administration's senior adviser on drug pricing reform, Daniel Best, was found ""unresponsive"" near the garage door exit of a Washington, D.C., apartment building. He was pronounced dead at the scene by first responders. A statement released the same day by Health and Human Services Secretary (HHS) Alex Azar mourned Best as a ""friend and colleague"" but addressed neither the circumstances nor the cause of his death. No other details were released to the public. Two weeks later, on 15 November, the office of Washington, D.C.'s chief medical examiner announced that Best had died of ""multiple blunt force injuries."" His death was ruled a suicide. No other information was provided. Internet conspiracy theorists questioned that ruling. Noting the pharmaceutical industry's objections to the very task Best was hired to accomplish (i.e., lowering prescription drug costs), not to mention President Trump's announcement days before Best's death of a plan to reduce Medicare drug prices and the fact that Best died of blunt force injuries, the theorists took to social media to float the idea that Best was the victim of foul play and not suicide: BREAKING: Death of Trump HHS official, Daniel Best, tasked with getting lower drug prices from pharmaceutical companies is ruled a suicide, even though he died from ""multiple blunt force injuries."" Nothing to see here folks. pic.twitter.com/qiWNH0epeQ — Mike Tokes (@MikeTokes) November 17, 2018 Another ‘suicide’ the Media is ignoring. RIP Daniel Best. #ma4t pic.twitter.com/Gt1wojG3eM — Mike Allen (@AMike4761) November 17, 2018 Far-right conspiracist websites followed suit. An 18 November article on Neon Nettle suggested that the the public was being asked to believe that Best had beaten himself to death: The Chief Medical Examiner’s verdict raised questions among the health community, with many people refusing to believe Best killed himself by repeatedly hitting himself with a blunt object until he died. Erin Elizabeth of HNN [Health Nut News] described the ruling of Best's death as ""confusing,"" saying: “How does one kill themselves by hitting themselves with a blunt object? Repeatedly?” Another conspiracy-mongering website, Uncle Sam's Misguided Children, posed the same sarcastic question: So did he lie down under a garage door and let it hit him “multiple times” or did he beat himself to death with a baseball bat? How does that work? Add to the very few actual articles on his death -- this man was described as one of Trump’s “senior” HHS officials working with Alex Azar. Things that make you go hmmmm. There's a fallacious assumption underlying this notion, however: namely, that blunt force injuries can only be sustained in the course of a physical attack by an assailant (or oneself). But that isn't how forensic pathologists define ""blunt force injury."" According to Prahlow and Byard's Atlas of Forensic Pathology , a blunt force injury is any ""resulting from impact with a blunt object, i.e., one that does not possess any sharp edges"": Examples of blunt objects include hammers, baseball bats, fists, the interior surfaces of vehicles, roads, trees, floors, walls, furniture, and even fluid objects such as bodies of water (if the speed of impact is sufficiently high). Medical University of South Carolina pathology professor Nicholas I. Batalis observes in ""Forensic Autopsy of Blunt Force Trauma"" ( Medscape , 2016) that blunt force injuries can be caused in myriad ways that have nothing to with assault and battery (emphasis added): Deaths resulting from blunt force trauma are some of the most common cases encountered by the practicing forensic pathologist. Whereas other forms of traumatic death (e.g., gunshot wounds, sharp force injuries) occur under a relatively limited number of circumstances, deaths resulting from blunt force trauma occur in a variety of scenarios. For instance, almost all transportation fatalities -- including those involving motor vehicle collisions, pedestrians being struck by vehicles, airplane crashes, and boating incidents -- result from blunt force trauma. Other deaths resulting from blunt force trauma involve jumping or falling from heights, blast injuries, and being struck by a firm object, such as a fist, crowbar, bat, or ball. Bite wounds and chop injuries may be considered variants of blunt force trauma, sharp force trauma, or a class of injuries unto themselves. Blunt force trauma is routinely involved in cases classified as accidents, as well as in cases of suicide and homicide. Finally, we put the known facts of the case to Thomas Sporn, M.D., Chief of the Section of Pulmonary and Thoracic Pathology at Duke University Medical Center, and asked him if a ruling of suicide makes sense. He responded via e-mail to say: Jumping off a building and striking the (blunt) pavement would result in blunt force injuries, as would, say, darting into traffic, and of course most aviation and motor vehicle fatalities are from blunt force injuries. So it's definitely possible to sustain self-inflicted blunt force injuries, depending on the circumstances. To date, we aren't privy to a full account of how Daniel Best sustained his injuries, nor their precise nature, nor any other evidence (such as a suicide note, if one exists) that prompted medical examiners to conclude that he killed himself. But there is clearly nothing contradictory about his having suffered blunt force injuries during the commission of a suicide. Given the facts at hand, there is no reasonable basis for speculation to the contrary.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1057
d5e69c7a-56f7-40e9-ab4b-d844c8905865,"Following President Trump’s return on 11 November 2018 from a controversial visit to France in which he did not attend a memorial commemorating the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I, the White House announced that Trump would not be traveling to Arlington National Cemetery the next day, as reported by Fox News: President Trump is spending Monday at the White House and had no plans to visit Arlington National Cemetery in northern Virginia as America observes the Veterans Day holiday. The White House announced a so-called travel lid at 10 a.m. ET, meaning that the president is not expected to hold any public events or leave the executive mansion. Trump returned to Washington on Sunday evening after a weekend in France, where he attended events commemorating the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War I ... On Saturday, Trump was criticized for failing to visit a second American cemetery about 60 miles outside of Paris because bad weather grounded the helicopter he planned to take. A handful of senior administration officials, including White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, went in the president's place. While controversial on its own, the announcement gained more attention on social media when the French Embassy in the United States tweeted photos of French officials taking part in the Arlington National Cemetery wreath-laying ceremony, which had taken place the day before: Yesterday we participated in a ceremony at @ArlingtonNatl to honor the sacrifices of soldiers during #WWI by laying a wreath on the tomb of the #UnknownSoldier . #VeteransDay pic.twitter.com/ZQPbZwMSf6 — French Embassy U.S. (@franceintheus) November 12, 2018 Trump was returning from France during this event, and Mike Pence did not attend in his place.

52ab0ae5-1e92-42b1-b887-4abf175119ba,"The power for states to deny voting rights to persons convicted of crimes has been inferred as constitutional based on section two of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states (emphasis ours): [W]hen the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime , the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State. The inference that it would be constitutional for a state to disenfranchise an individual “for participation in rebellion, or other crime” was affirmed most recently in the 1974 Supreme Court case Richardson v. Ramirez . As a result, the power to take away and restore voting rights on the basis of criminal history belongs to the individual states and varies significantly from state to state, as explicated by the National Conference of State Legislatures: In Maine and Vermont, felons never lose their right to vote, even while they are incarcerated. In 14 states and the District of Columbia, felons lose their voting rights only while incarcerated, and receive automatic restoration upon release. In 21 states, felons lose their voting rights during incarceration, and for a period of time after, typically while on parole and/or probation. Voting rights are automatically restored after this time period. Former felons may also have to pay any outstanding fines, fees or restitution before their rights are restored as well. In 13 states felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for some crimes, or require a governor’s pardon in order for voting rights to be restored, or face an additional waiting period after completion of sentence (including parole and probation) before voting rights can be restored. A person convicted of a felony who resided in one of the states that maintain strict felony disenfranchisement laws (such as Florida ) could be barred from regaining voting rights indefinitely. The felony disenfranchisement issue received renewed attention after conservative political commentator Dinesh D’Souza, controversially pardoned by President Donald Trump, took to social media to boast about what he implied were his recently restored voting rights: Felons can’t vote. But pardoned ones can @realDonaldTrump @tedcruz pic.twitter.com/5G7SPelalw — Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) October 30, 2018 D’Souza pled guilty in September 2014 to federal campaign finance law violations and was sentenced to five years of probation, eight months living under supervision in a “community confinement center” in San Diego, and a $30,000 fine. In May 2018, President Trump pardoned D’Souza based on his view that D’Souza had been treated “unfairly.” According to this timeline, D’Souza was still serving his sentence at the time of the pardon. The question at hand, then, is did D’Souza ever actually lose his voting rights in the first place? As explained above, that would depend on where he was registered to vote. According to Vanity Fair , D’Souza has maintained residences in both California and New York. California requires “the Legislature to provide for the disqualification of electors while mentally incompetent or imprisoned or on parole for the conviction of a felony.” D’Souza was neither imprisoned nor released on parole , so he presumably would not have been disenfranchised by California as a result of his probationary status. In New York, the state bars persons “in prison or on parole for a felony conviction” from voting in elections, but it does not bar persons on probation for felony convictions. In fact, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order in April 2018 granting parolees the right to vote (although that order may still be challenged in court). If D’Souza had been planning on voting in New York, he likely would have been able to do so even if President Trump had not pardoned him. The shoutout to Senator Ted Cruz in D’Souza's tweet was likely a reference to Cruz's role in suggesting a pardon of D’Souza to President Trump. However, if D’Souza were claiming to be a voter in Texas -- where felons are barred from voting until their sentences (including probation) are fully served -- or in one of the other states where all felons are disenfranchised for the entirety of their sentences and probationary periods, he could be correct in suggesting his rights were restored via President Trump’s pardon. Update: On 6 November 2018, the State of Florida approved Amendment 4, which restored voting rights to felons (excluding cases of murder or felony sex crimes) who have completed their sentences, as reported by Vox: Florida voters during Tuesday’s midterm elections approved Amendment 4, automatically restoring voting rights in the state for people previously convicted of felonies. Florida’s Amendment 4 restores voting rights for people in the state convicted of felonies as long as they have completed their sentences, although anyone convicted of murder or felony sex offenses would be excluded. Based on the Sentencing Project’s 2016 estimates, this benefits more than a million people. The organization estimated in 2016 that nearly 1.5 million people in Florida have completed felony sentences but can’t vote — about 9.2 percent of the voting-age population in Florida. The total, though, includes some people convicted of murder and felony sex offenses, so not every one of those people benefits under Amendment 4.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1081

The strictest definition of ""campaigned for"" would mean Obama's appearing in person with the candidate in question at one or more campaign events. Under this definition, the former president campaigned for numerous candidates who won their races. On 22 October 2018, for example, Barack Obama appeared at a Las Vegas campaign rally with Jacky Rosen, who would go on to flip a Senate seat in Nevada from red to blue by beating incumbent Republican Dean Heller: And he’s here: @RosenforNevada just introduced @BarackObama , who told the crowd to “sit down because I’ve got a lot to say.” Someone shouted “we miss you!” “I miss you too,” he said. pic.twitter.com/2HUY3L5cVq — Ramona Giwargis (@RamonaGiwargis) October 22, 2018 As another example, on 5 November 2018 Barack Obama made a campaign appearance on behalf of Virginia Senate candidate Tim Kaine, who won his bid for reelection, and Virginia House candidate Jennifer Wexton, who also won her race and flipped Virginia’s 10th district from red to blue: Former Pres.

Most notably, Obama campaigned in Georgia for Stacey Abrams, who has likely been defeated by Brian Kemp, and he campaigned for Florida's Andrew Gillum, who lost to Ron DeSantis. A broader definition of ""campaigned for"" would include candidates who received an endorsement from the former president. Barack Obama issued two waves of endorsements, first in August 2018 and then in October 2018. In total, Barack Obama offered 342 endorsements for the 2018 midterm elections, with many of these endorsements resulting in substantive victories for Democrats. As an example, we will analyze the outcome of the endorsements Obama made for Congress. For the U.S. Senate, Obama endorsed five candidates: Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona, Senator Bill Nelson in Florida, Senator Tina Smith in Minnesota, Jacky Rosen in Nevada, and Senator Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin. Smith, Rosen, and Baldwin each won their respective races. For the U.S. House of Representatives, Obama endorsed 69 candidates, including 20 of the 28 candidates responsible for snatching up GOP-held seats and securing Democratic control of the House: Jennifer Wexton (VA-10), Mary Scanlon (PA-05), Susan Wild (PA-07), Jason Crow (CO-06), Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (FL-26), Sharice Davids (KS-03), Dean Phillips (MN-03), Max Rose (NY-11), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), Colin Allred (TX-32), Sean Casten (IL-06), Haley Stevens (MI-11), Antonio Delgado (NY-19), Lizzie Pannill Fletcher (TX-07), Cindy Axne (IA-03), Abby Finkenauer (IA-01), Lauren Underwood (IL-14), Tom Malinowski (NJ-07), Angie Craig (MN-02), and Abigail Spanberger (VA-07). In terms of endorsements , an analysis by the Brookings Institute found that President Donald Trump’s Congressional picks underperformed relative to those of Barack Obama: As we can see from the bar graph below, Trump endorsed 75 House and Senate candidates, of whom 42 or 55 percent won. With this rate, Trump performed better than Vice President Mike Pence, for whom nearly 50 percent won, but fell behind Obama’s and Biden’s endorsees. Because multiple individuals with whom Barack Obama appeared with at campaign events did win their races, the claim that ""everyone"" Obama campaigned for lost their races is self-evidently false.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,792
10e8371f-195b-491c-9657-9730abbf5006,"A popular November 2018 U.S. election night Twitter thread, created by writer and Twitter user Ally Maynard, followed a collection of candidates President Trump had supported on Twitter for the 2018 midterm elections. Each time an endorsed candidate lost, she tweeted a picture of the President’s endorsement of that candidate: Trump has endorsed 11 Republicans running for Governor, 31 House candidates and 13 Senate candidates and I've screenshot every one of them and will let him know every one that loses. — Ally Maynard (@missmayn) November 7, 2018 Based on this Twitter thread, the website “Gritpost” did some back-of-the-envelope-calculations to derive a headline claim that “71 Percent of Trump-Endorsed Candidates Lost Their Elections Last Night”: Twitter user Ally Maynard painstakingly compiled a list of 55 House, Senate, and gubernatorial candidates President Trump either held rallies for or endorsed on Twitter, and found that 39 of them lost, meaning 70.9 percent of candidates President Trump endorsed were defeated. While this figure might be accurate if limited exclusively to Twitter endorsements (though we have not investigated that approach), the headline claim regarding “71 percent of Trump-endorsed candidates” is false, as it implies that 71 percent of all the candidates President Trump endorsed lost their election bids. If we consider “House, Senate, and gubernatorial candidates” as the pool of endorsements, Donald Trump issued 93 endorsements of candidates running in U.S. Senate , U.S. House , and gubernatorial races. (This figure does not include endorsements for primary elections or for non-gubernatorial positions in state governments.) Of that endorsement pool, as of 9 November 2018 some 50 candidates had won their election bids, 37 had lost, and six remained in races still too close to call. Conservatively speaking, that means Trump’s endorsements won at least 54% of their races and at most lost 41% of them: a far cry from the 71% the headline suggested.

According to Charles Seife, a journalism professor at New York University who tracks the spread of online disinformation, this rumor originated with the Twitter account ""Republican Lives Matter."" That tweet was also deleted but a screenshot can be glimpsed below: The rumor that the Borderline Bar shooter had been identified as a Middle Eastern man named Abu al-Hom Kreuzi did not originate with law enforcement officials or a credible news report. This claim was made up out of whole cloth by a group of internet trolls in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting that left 13 people (including the shooter) dead. The actual suspect identified by police was a 28-year-old U.S. Marine Corps veteran named David Long: Ian David Long, 28, has been identified as the suspected gunman in the mass shooting at a Thousand Oaks nightclub. The shooting happened inside Borderline Bar & Grill. At least a dozen people were killed, including a sheriff's sergeant, Ron Helus. None of the other victims have been identified. Thursday morning, authorities said the gunman was found dead inside the nightclub. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean said investigators believe Long fatally shot himself. A motive for the shooting is still unclear. Neighbors told investigators that Long was a veteran and may have suffered from PTSD: Investigators knocked on doors of surrounding residents to find out what they may know about Long. One neighbor who knew Long said he was a veteran who suffered from PTSD. She said, ""I don't know what he was doing with a gun."" Others said Long lived at the home with his mother.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,424
ca5381c5-ce5b-41b4-b463-27be07e75fc9,"Officials in Jefferson County, Georgia, faced allegations of racially-motivated voter suppression in October 2018 in response to an incident in which a voter registration group was ordered to return a group of African-American seniors to a county-run senior center, after those seniors boarded a bus to cast ballots during early voting for the November elections. The liberal web site ThinkProgress reported of the incident that: Seniors in rural Georgia were dancing in the street, preparing to board Black Voters Matters bus to cast their ballots Monday, the first day of the state’s early voting period. But the county administrator ordered the senior center to take the 40 or so elderly African Americans off the bus — an act organizers described as “live voter suppression.” In a Facebook video about the incident, which took place on 15 October, the group's co-founders LaTosha Brown and Cliff Albright characterized the county's decision as racially-motivated voter suppression, with Albright saying: Somebody called the County Commission to complain because they saw all these black folks get on this big black bus -- it's the blackest bus in America -- somebody drove past, saw that, got nervous, got mad, called the County Commission's office, which then called the center. And the bottom line was, all the folks who had just got on the bus -- and the bus was full, this is a 50-passenger bus full of folks -- had to come off the bus. There's not a candidate on this bus, there's not a party symbol on this bus, but I'm going to tell you what is on this bus -- a whole bunch of black fists in the air with the word ""power"" underneath it. That's what scared them and made them say ""Those folks have to come off that bus."" However, Jefferson County administrator Adam Brett insisted that the event constituted ""political activity,"" something that the county purportedly does not allow on county property or at county-sponsored events. Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans was on the bus in question and helped organize the visit to the senior center in the first place, as revealed in email correspondence published by Augusta television station WJBF . Furthermore, Brett said he had not ""vetted"" Black Voters Matter, and that allowing the senior citizens to leave with an unfamiliar outside group could have been a ""liability"" for the county, which operates the senior center in Louisville and also organizes its own chartered buses for seniors to get to polling stations. In a statement sent to us, Brett wrote: The Jefferson County Board of Commissioners has a practice of not allowing political activities during normal business hours on County property or at County sponsored activities. On October 15th, the Senior Center staff declined to allow a third party and unknown bus operator to pick County residents on County property for political purposes. The Senior Center staff routinely arrange Jefferson County Public Transit to transport senior citizens to vote. In an email, Albright rejected Brett's ""liability"" argument, calling it ""paternalistic"" and pointing out that the Louisville senior center is an activities center, not a residential center: Seniors can come [and] go when they please and with whomever they choose to leave with. If they want to leave with a family member, an Uber driver, or an organization they trust, that is their own choice. These are grown adults who decided who they wanted to leave with, and despite Mr. Brett’s paternalistic need to feel comfortable with that decision, he has no control over those choices, nor liability [for them]. We asked Brett what the legal basis was for his order (carried out by staff at the senior center) not to ""allow"" the seniors to travel to the polling station with Black Voters Matter and requested that he clarify Jefferson County's legal authority and liabilities relating to people who use the senior center. We did not receive a response to those questions. Albright told us that staff at the senior center had given advance permission for Black Voters Matter to visit the center and hold an event there, but not for them to escort seniors to polling stations. However, he maintained this was because the group had not initially planned to take the bus trip, which he said the seniors themselves had asked for, spontaneously: The seniors requested to ride the bus to go vote after they saw it and were excited. The center director approved/supported the request, which is why the seniors even got on the bus. It was not until the county administrator called the center director that it became a problem. Albright also questioned the sincerity of Brett's invocation of county policy on ""political activities,"" pointing out that Jody Hice, a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives, is scheduled to host an event at the senior center on 27 October. (Albright emphasized that he thought the event in question was very worthy and should be allowed to take place at the center, but he saw it as an example of a double standard.) In fact, on the same day that the seniors were prevented from travelling with Black Voters Matter to a polling station, the Jefferson County Board of Commissioners actually promoted Congressman Hice's event at the senior center on their Facebook page, in a post that was taken word-for-word from Hice's earlier press release : We asked Brett to explain why the county had forbidden an event in which a bus carrying a local Democratic party official -- but no elected politician or candidate -- was to escort seniors to a polling station away from the center itself, but allowed a sitting Republican Congressman, who is actively campaigning for re-election , to host an event in the center itself. We also asked why the Board of Commissioners had promoted that event. We did not receive a response to those questions. In a separate Facebook post , the Board of Commissioners explained that the bus trip had been forbidden because it ""was led by the President of the Jefferson County Democratic Party [Diane Evans] and as such was considered a political event."" However, the Black Voters Matter's visit had been organized with the assistance of Evans, and yet it was still allowed to take place. We asked Brett why the Black Voters Matter visit was allowed to go ahead despite the involvement of Evans, but the bus trip was not, and asked whether he had considered requesting that Evans disembark the bus (given that her involvement was purportedly the source of the county's objections) rather than ordering the seniors to return to the center. Again, we did not receive a response to these questions. Conclusion It is true that on 15 October 2018, staff at the Jefferson County senior center in Louisville enacted the instructions of County Administrator Adam Brett by insisting that a group of seniors return to the center after they voluntarily boarded a bus operated on behalf of Black Voters Matter, a voter registration group. The leaders of that group characterized the incident as racially-motivated voter suppression, but Brett insisted otherwise, stating that the reasons for his order were twofold: the involvement of Jefferson County Democrats Chair Diane Evans meant that the bus trip constituted ""political activity,"" something the county could not allow, and county officials had not vetted Black Voters Matter or the bus operator, creating a potential liability for the county which Brett was unwilling to assume. However, it must be acknowledged that significant problems exist with the coherence of the twofold rationale outlined by Brett. First, it is not clear that Jefferson County actually has any legal liability for anything that happens to those who use the center once they have left the center. Likewise, it's not clear that Brett had any legal authority to ""not allow"" seniors to travel to the polling station or Black Voters Matter to escort them there. Second, the consistency with which Jefferson County enforces their prohibition on ""political activities"" at the senior center is questionable. On the one hand, Brett forbade the bus trip to the polling station on this basis due to the involvement of a local Democratic official, even though the bus trip would have taken the seniors away from the senior center, and even though the county allowed a visit to the senior center which had been organized with the help of that same Democratic official. But Jefferson County's Board of Commissioners also sanctioned a forthcoming event to be hosted by Jody Hice, a sitting Republican Congressman and active election candidate, which is scheduled to take place in the center itself, and the Board of Commissioners has promoted that event on Facebook in a post taken word-for-word from Hice's earlier press release.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1628

Conspiracy mongers circulated miscaptioned photographs allegedly linking Dr. Ford to prominent liberals. They also asserted, falsely , that Ford had filed similar sexual misconduct accusations against a previous Trump appointee, Neil Gorsuch. They shared images that supposedly showed Ford attending an anti-Trump rally and exhibiting drunken behavior at parties. During the week of her scheduled testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, they made a concerted effort to demonstrate so-called ""close family ties"" between Ford and former FBI agent Peter Strzok, who was fired in mid-2018 for sending anti-Trump text messages. Far-right bloggers have portrayed Strzok as a ""deep state"" operative ""planted"" in the FBI to undermine Trump's presidency. 0:00 / 0:00 One version of the family-ties scenario held that Strzok's sister-in-law (identified in the video below as ""Jill Strzok"") works with, or used to work with, Christine Blasey Ford's brother, Thomas Blasey: Should we even be surprised anymore?

Isn’t it interesting how all these scumbags know each other? Almost like a little club. For the record, Jill Strzok is not Peter Strzok's wife. Peter is married to Melissa Hodgman, an attorney who works , as of this writing, at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C. As will be confirmed shortly, Jill isn't Peter Strzok's sister or sister-in-law, either. Interestingly, all these variants based their claims on the same documentation, a patchwork genealogical chart supposedly connecting the dots between the Strzok and Blasey families: MORE BREAKING!

According to the diagram, Peter Strzok's grandfather and the grandfather of Jill Strzok's husband (Sidney Strzok) were siblings, which, if true, would mean that Sidney and Peter are second cousins, and Jill Strzok would be Peter's second cousin-in-law : But the chart has a crucial detail wrong: Peter and Sidney Strzok's grandfathers were not, in fact, siblings. According to published obituaries, Sidney's grandfather ( Thomas Charles Strzok ) was the son of Charles and Frances Mary Strzok. Peter's grandfather ( Michael John Strzok ) was the son of John and MaryAnne Strzok. We can't tell, based on the information at hand, what familial connection (if any) the grandfathers may have had, nor how far back one has to trace these separate branches of the Strzok family tree to find a point of intersection. At best, Peter and Sidney Strzok could be distant cousins, which would make Jill Strzok Peter's distant cousin by marriage . Another area of the chart indicates, correctly, that Christine Blasey Ford has a brother named Thomas Blasey, whom the Washington Post confirmed is a Washington-area lawyer. According to his LinkedIn profile , Blasey currently holds the position of assistant general counsel at Northrop Grumman Corporation in Falls Church, Virginia. It's alleged that Thomas Blasey and Jill Strzok currently or formerly worked for the same company, Exelis Inc., an aerospace and defense contractor. Blasey's LinkedIn profile confirms he was employed by Exelis Inc. from 2011 to 2015. Although Jill Strzok's LinkedIn profile doesn't list Exelis by name, it does list ITT Corporation as one of her ongoing employers from 2005 to the present. Exelis Inc. was a division of ITT until it was spun off as a separate company (still branded ""ITT Exelis) in 2011. We found evidence that Strzok was an employee of Exelis Inc. in the form of an undated document naming ITT Exelis as the prime contractor for a military software design project and Jill Strzok as the ""procuring contract officer"" on behalf of Exelis. We have not been able to determine the exact period of time during which Strzok worked specifically for Exelis, however. A popular ""people search"" website, Radaris.com, says she worked there between 2005 and 2007, though that information is unvetted and possibly unreliable. In any case, it scarcely matters whether Strzok and Blasey worked for the company at the same time. Strzok is a subcontracts manager who worked out of Exelis's Colorado offices; Blasey is an intellectual property lawyer who worked out of the company's office in McLean, Virginia. It's unlikely their paths ever crossed. More to the point, the notion that Jill Strzok and Thomas Blasey (who conceivably have never met one another) represent ""three degrees of separation"" between alleged ""deep state"" conspirator Peter Strzok and Christine Blasey Ford depends on Jill and Peter Strzok being close relatives, which they demonstrably are not.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1267
dd07aade-5d28-43a5-88d8-dffcd4bbd273,"On 19 September 2018, Bust magazine highlighted the disturbing fact that doctors and medical students regularly, and legally, give anesthetized patients non-consensual pelvic exams. The practice was described in detail in an account critical of the practice written by then-medical student Shawn Barnes and published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology in 2012: In obstetrics and gynecology, I encountered the first act of medical training that left me ashamed. For 3 weeks, four to five times a day, I was asked to, and did, perform pelvic examinations on anesthetized women, without specific consent, solely for the purpose of my education. Typically this would unfold as follows: I would be assigned a gynecologic surgery case on which to scrub in. I would be required to go meet the patient beforehand and introduce myself as “the medical student on the team” or some such vague statement of my role in the procedure, without mentioning a pelvic examination. I then would follow the patient into surgery. Once anesthesia was administered and the patient was asleep, the attending or resident would ask me to perform a pelvic examination on the patient for educational purposes. To my shame, I obeyed. An essay published on the XOJane website recounted the unease one woman felt attempting to find out if someone had performed such an exam on her during a recent surgery: I called my gynecologist’s office, and I tried to calm my rising panic as I explained my concerns that I had been given pelvic exams by random medical students while I was unconscious in the operating room. The receptionist seemed as alarmed as I did, and she reassured me that my doctor would never have allowed such a thing and that he would contact me as soon as possible. I scoured the papers I’d received from the hospital to see if anything hidden in the fine print gave them permission to do such things without express informed consent, which they did not ... A few hours later, [the doctor] called me back. He asked me what my concerns were, so I explained that I was concerned that a med student or two or three had performed non-consensual pelvic exams on my unconscious body. As I recounted, I tried to stay as calm as possible, fighting back the tide of hysteria that threatened to drown my sanity. As soon as I finished speaking, he responded brusquely that he does so many surgeries that he could not say for sure whether or not it had happened ... Okay, I said, then I have one final question: have you done this in the past? Have you had medical students perform pelvic exams on unconscious patients? Yes, he replied gruffly, and it’s a commonly accepted practice. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association, and the Association of American Medical Colleges has each condemned the practice, but it remains legal in the vast majority of American states. While teaching hospitals do provide consent forms indicating that medical students may be involved with their care, these forms do not necessarily require the explicit disclosure of pelvic exams, and often times multiple students will perform the same exam on a patient or perform it in cases when is medically unnecessary: Ordinarily, consent forms at teaching hospitals will include language to inform the patient that medical students may be involved in their care. Patients are informed that (1) they are receiving care from a teaching hospital and (2) that medical students may be involved in their care ... But there are cases where an instructor or attending doctor wants more than one student to examine the same patient or to have students examine patients for whom the particular pelvic examination is not indicated. According to a 2018 review paper , several scholarly efforts have demonstrated that the practice is common: In 2003, Ubel et al surveyed 400 medical students from five medical schools in Philadelphia, 90% of whom admitted to having performed a pelvic exam on an anesthetized woman, although it was not clear how many of the women had consented to the exam. A similar survey at the University of Oklahoma in 2005 found that a large majority of medical students had given pelvic exams to gynecologic surgery patients who were under anesthesia, and that in nearly three quarters of these cases the women had not consented to the exam. Coldicott et al published findings from a medical school in the United Kingdom in which students anonymously reported that at least 24% of intimate examinations they performed on anesthetized patients occurred without any consent and that ‘on many occasions, more than one student examined the same patient’. The practice is explicitly outlawed in Hawaii, California, Illinois, Virginia, and Oregon , but it is legal in the remaining 45 states.  In 2019, however, multiple states introduced legislative bills aimed at requiring that women undergoing gynecological surgeries give explicit approval to  pelvic exams beforehand",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,913
c0e5b4a4-4a14-4993-8dc3-d40a30539c35,"In September 2018, Nike's announcement of a commercial deal with free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick prompted fierce debate over the national anthem protests led by Kaepernick, as well as widespread calls for a boycott of Nike products. Kaepernick began to ""take a knee"" during the playing of the national anthem in 2016 as a protest against racial injustice and police brutality and was at the forefront of such protests among National Football League players and staff. In the days following the announcement, we received multiple enquiries from readers about a letter purportedly written by the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) which called upon its members to boycott Nike. The letter is authentic and was issued by NAPO president Michael McHale, addressed to Nike CEO Mark Parker. NAPO is a law enforcement union founded in 1978 and described as representing 241,000 officers from more than 1,000 police organizations. The letter , dated 4 September, read as follows: On behalf of the more than 241,000 law enforcement officers represented by our Association across the country, I write to you to condemn in the strongest possible terms your selection of Colin Kaepernick for Nike’s “Just Do It” ad campaign. Mr. Kaepernick is known, not as a successful athlete, but as a shallow dilettante seeking to gain notoriety by disrespecting the flag for which so many Americans have fought and died ... In featuring Mr. Kaepernick in the “Just Do It” campaign, Nike grossly insults the men and women who really do make sacrifices for the sake of our nation. We are calling on all our member officers, their families and friends to join in boycotting all Nike products. NAPO was joined in critizing Nike and Kaepernick by the National Fraternal Order of Police, whose president, Chuck Canterbury, issued a press release addressing (but not calling for) a boycott of Nike: Press Release on Nike ""Since 2016, 381 cops have been killed in the line of duty. They believed in something and sacrificed everything as did the families they left behind. All of the men and women in law enforcement believe in something and are prepared to sacrifice everything"" pic.twitter.com/j4OkjUxR4S — National FOP (@GLFOP) September 5, 2018 The Fraternal Order of Police has been called upon to boycott Nike for capitalizing on this former professional football player because he attracts controversy. In our experience, boycotts and similar exercises do not succeed and often serve only to enrich the company -- which is not what we want to do. Our members and, for that matter, any American citizen understands when the law enforcement profession is being insulted -- we have no doubt they will make their purchases with that insult in mind. These vehement criticisms sparked something of a controversy among police unions, with the National Black Police Association (NBPA) issuing a strong rejection of McHale's letter. On 5 September, NBPA chairperson Sonia Y.W. Pruitt wrote a letter of her own to Nike's CEO, offering the support of her organization's members: The National Black Police Association is not in agreement with NAPO on this matter, and we strongly condemn their call for police officers and their families to boycott Nike and its products ... NAPO believes that Mr. Kaepernick's choice to openly protest issues surrounding police brutality, racism and social injustices in this country makes him anti-police. On the contrary, the NBPA believes that Mr. Kaepernick's stance is in direct alignment with what law enforcement stands for -- the protection of a people, their human rights, their dignity, their safety, and their rights as American citizens ... The NBPA proudly supports Nike and your use of Mr. Kaepernick in you new ""Just Do It"" advertising campaign...We will likely be buying and wearing Nike products in the near future.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,701
63827123-f971-4911-8639-1171ceba2abb,"Dec. 10, 2019 Update: The regulations discussed in this fact check went into effect on June 24, 2019 . For more information on why we dispute the EPA's characterization of their “Significant New Use Rule” for asbestos, please read this additional September 2018 article on the topic. On 1 June 2018, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics announced a proposed “Significant New Use Rule” (SNUR) for asbestos, a mineral once widely used in the construction of buildings due to its flame-retardant properties but now uncontroversially considered a carcinogen . The necessity for such a rule, in general, stems from the fact that not all uses of asbestos are currently banned; some of them remain unregulated thanks to a 1991 court ruling. The asbestos uses the 2018 SNUR applies to are ones that had not been banned by earlier regulations and remained in active use at the time of the 1991 court ruling , but are no longer in use due to users' desires to avoid contracting cancer or liability for causing cancer in others. The EPA refers to these uses as ""currently unregulated former uses."" SNURs are a mechanism within the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that mandate specific EPA approval when a chemical is used in a significantly new way or in a significantly new mixture that “might create concerns.”: For asbestos, [the] EPA is proposing a SNUR for certain uses of asbestos (including asbestos-containing goods) that would require manufacturers and importers to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos. This review process would provide EPA with the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of asbestos and, when necessary, take action to prohibit or limit the use. The TSCA is currently undergoing a major overhaul that began under the Obama administration and was reinterpreted in radically divergent ways under the Trump administration. When former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt (a Trump appointee who resigned amid accusations of misconduct) explained the proposed SNUR for asbestos, he described it as part of an “unprecedented” set of new protections against the dangers of asbestos which require manufacturers ""to receive EPA approval before starting or resuming manufacturing, and importing or processing of asbestos"". In their correspondence with us, the EPA stated that the proposed rule serves ""to ensure that the manufacture, import, or processing for the currently unregulated former uses of asbestos identified in the rule are prohibited unless reviewed and approved by EPA."" According to critics, the problem with this position is twofold. The first problem concerns the way in which the current EPA has written the SNUR, which EPA staffers have privately worried does not allow for the ban of all currently inactive unregulated uses but instead only concerns 15 specific uses the EPA ""believes"" to be comprehensive and thus could allow for the continued legality of some now dormant uses. The second problem concerns the way in which the EPA has proposed to evaluate the risk of these ""currently unregulated former uses"". In May 2018, the EPA published a document known as the “Problem Formulation of the Risk Evaluation for Asbestos,” which establishes the scientific approach the EPA will take in evaluating these new uses. Significantly, their approach will not include information from existing (or “legacy”) uses of asbestos, despite the significant body of work around health risks stemming from those uses: In the case of asbestos, legacy uses, associated disposals, and legacy disposals will be excluded from the problem formulation and risk evaluation ... These include asbestos containing materials that remain in older buildings or are part of older products but for which manufacture, processing and distribution in commerce are not currently intended, known or reasonably foreseen. EPA is excluding these activities because EPA generally interprets the mandates under section TSCA § 6(a)-(b) to conduct risk evaluations and any corresponding risk management to focus on uses for which manufacture, processing or distribution is intended, known to be occurring, or reasonably foreseen, rather than reaching back to evaluate the risks associated with legacy uses, associated disposal, and legacy disposal, and interprets the definition of conditions of use in that context. E&E News reported that this approach may serve to severely limit the types of exposures the EPA will consider when formulating the potential risk of new uses for asbestos: Public health advocates believe EPA is inappropriately limiting its health reviews of chemicals to avoid considering the impacts of those already in the environment. But the agency hasn't been swayed by their pushback ... That means the agency won't consider the dangers posed by, for example, asbestos-containing tiles, adhesives and piping in millions of homes and commercial buildings nationwide. According to the New York Times , the new rules will serve to narrow the ways in which asbestos itself is defined as well: Other changes identified in the E.P.A. documents narrow the definitions of certain chemicals, including asbestos. Some asbestos-like fibers will not be included in the risk assessments, one agency staff member said, nor will the 8.8 million pounds a year of asbestos deposited in hazardous landfills or the 13.1 million pounds discarded in routine dump sites. Three former EPA officials, including the former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, told the New York Times that such stipulations would necessarily create flawed analyses of the threat posed by any chemical currently being re-evaluated by the EPA: Three former agency officials, including a former supervisor of the toxic chemical program, said that the E.P.A.’s approach would result in a flawed analysis of the threat presented by chemicals. “It is ridiculous,” said Wendy Cleland-Hamnett, who retired last year after nearly four decades at the E.P.A., where she ran the toxic chemical unit during her last year. “You can’t determine if there is an unreasonable risk without doing a comprehensive risk evaluation” ... The most likely outcome of the changes will be that the agency finds lower levels of risks associated with many chemicals, and as a result, imposes fewer new restrictions or prohibitions, several current and former agency officials said. Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico, argued that former EPA head Scott Pruitt was undermining a bipartisan push to reform the TSCA that began under President Obama. “Congress worked hard in bipartisan fashion to reform our nation’s broken chemical safety laws, but Pruitt’s E.P.A. is failing to put the new law to use as intended,” he said in a statement. President Trump spoke on the topic of asbestos long before his election to the White House. In his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback , Trump argued that the chemical is actually safe once applied and suggested that the link to health problems was manufactured by mob-connected companies which perform asbestos removal: ""I believe that the movement against asbestos was led by the mob, because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal. Great pressure was put on politicians, and as usual, the politicians relented."" While it is true that the uses of asbestos discussed in the 2018 SNUR are currently legal, their health and litigation risks have rendered them effectively dead . The current administration has established a process for some of those uses to be granted formal approval by the EPA if they pass a safety review many scientists find flawed. For these reasons, we concur with the leaked opinion of EPA lawyer Mark Seltzer, an attorney advisor to the EPA Chemical Risk and Reporting Enforcement Branch who worked on the SNUR and concluded that: “This new approach allows asbestos-containing products that are not currently used to be used in the future.”",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1436
4550f8ae-edd4-4391-9e8d-88e364b784fd,"In July 2018, an investigation by the conservative Middle East Forum think tank hit the headlines, after it appeared to reveal that an office within the U.S. Treasury Department had in 2015 signed off on the transfer of $125,000 to the Islamic Relief Agency, a Sudan-based group listed as a funder of terrorism by the Treasury itself. The 25 July Middle East Forum (MEF) report , which was accompanied by an article in the conservative National Review , reported: The Middle East Forum has discovered that the Obama administration approved a grant of $200,000 of taxpayer money to an al-Qaeda affiliate in Sudan — a decade after the U.S. Treasury designated it as a terrorist-financing organization. More stunningly, government officials specifically authorized the release of at least $115,000 of this grant even after learning that it was a designated terror organization. The report gave rise to coverage by the right-wing Daily Wire web site, which attributed the funding decision to former president Barack Obama personally in a headline reading ""Obama Knowingly Funded Designated Al-Qaeda Affiliate,"" as well as by Fox News , which reported: The Obama administration approved a $200,000 grant to a group in Sudan with ties to Al Qaeda even though it had been designated a terrorist-financing organization by the U.S. years earlier, a conservative think tank revealed. Further, an agency official acknowledged the prior administration allowed taxpayer money to flow to the group even after its designation was discovered. The facts and sequence of events presented by the MEF are broadly accurate and were largely confirmed to us by an official from the international charity World Vision, which acted in partnership with the Islamic Relief Agency (ISRA) in Sudan until 2015. However, contrary to the Daily Wire's headline, we found no evidence that former president Barack Obama himself had any role in either of the two funding decisions related to ISRA which are at the heart of the MEF's report. Background In 2004, the U.S. Treasury Department added the Islamic Relief Agency and several individuals associated with it to a list of organizations and individuals suspected of funding terrorism, blocking its assets and bank accounts in the United States and making it a criminal offense for anyone in the United States to support or conduct financial transactions with ISRA. In announcing their decision , the Treasury Department cited evidence that ISRA (and its officials) had links to Osama bin Laden, Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and others within global Islamic terrorist networks. Apart from its inclusion on the U.S. government's list of terrorism funders, ISRA performed charitable works in parts of the Muslim world — including Sudan, where they partnered with the U.S.-based evangelical Christian non-profit organization World Vision, which in turn received funding and support from the U.S. government, largely through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Sequence of Events In March 2014, USAID signed off on a $723,405 grant to World Vision, with ISRA designated to receive a $200,000 sub-grant from that amount. A World Vision official closely involved in the matter told us that, before listing ISRA as a sub-grantee, the organization had searched the Treasury's ""Sanctions List"" for any group operating in Sudan with ""Islamic Relief"" in their name but turned up no matches, indicating ISRA was not blocked. A USAID official told us that the $200,000 set aside for ISRA was to go towards humanitarian aid to people displaced by the ongoing conflict in Sudan at that time. In November 2014, according to the World Vision official with whom we spoke, the organization was alerted to the possibility that ISRA might be on the Treasury's list of blocked groups and conveyed those concerns to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which is responsible for implementing and tracking economic sanctions. The official told us that World Vision then voluntarily stopped working with ISRA while OFAC investigated ISRA's status. This contradicted the account of a USAID official, who told us that USAID had instructed World Vision to put a hold on all their activities with ISRA. The World Vision official broadly confirmed MEF's claims, which were based on emails released under the Freedom of Information Act, that World Vision was eager for OFAC to quickly clarify the status of ISRA, telling us that the organization was frustrated by the delay in what should have been a straightforward verification of records. In January 2015, OFAC finally confirmed that the Sudan-based Islamic Relief Agency to which USAID had granted $200,000 was indeed on the U.S. Treasury's sanctions list. This meant World Vision (like any other U.S.-based entity or person) could not provide ISRA any support or engage in any financial transactions with that group. However, World Vision still owed ISRA money for services ISRA had already provided in Sudan, on the basis of the $200,000 sub-grant awarded by USAID the previous March. But OFAC's January 2015 ruling meant that ISRA could not be reimbursed for that work, so World Vision applied to OFAC for a license to meet those contractual obligations. The World Vision official told us that the indefinite halt to their work with ISRA had put a severe strain on World Vision's relationship with the Sudanese government. World Vision staff in Sudan had been experiencing harassment related to their debts to ISRA, the official said, and they felt they were at real risk of being kicked out of the country altogether — which would have spelled the end of their humanitarian work there. Paying their remaining debts to ISRA felt like the cost and condition of World Vision's being allowed to continue working in Sudan, the official told us. In the end, OFAC accepted World Vision's application and granted them a license for a one-off transfer of $125,000 to ISRA, which a USAID official told us was for humanitarian assistance work that ISRA had already performed. A World Vision spokesperson told us that the $125,000 transferred to ISRA came from ""USAID funds,"" confirming both the Middle East Forum and Fox News' description of it as ""taxpayer money."" In a statement, the spokesperson wrote: World Vision received reimbursement of $125,000 from USAID of funds paid to ISRA for expenses they incurred and reported under that sub-grant. Conclusion The Middle East Forum is correct in their central claim that an office of the Treasury Department, which had confirmed ISRA was listed as a sanctioned entity, subsequently permitted a private NGO (World Vision) to transfer funds to ISRA. Insofar as every office and agency of every federal government department between 2009 and 2016 was a part of the ""Obama administration,"" it can justifiably be said that this decision was made by the Obama administration. However, we saw no evidence that the decision was made by anyone beyond OFAC, least of all by President Obama himself. We asked the Treasury Department which official directed the license to be given to World Vision for the May 2015 transfer, but an official told us OFAC does not discuss or comment on individual cases. We also contacted John Smith, who was OFAC's director during the period outlined by the Middle East Forum, but did not receive a response in time for publication.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1332
187a5c9d-e69d-49ec-883d-d4a3c5cc274b,"On 27 July 2018, “independent journalist” Rachel Blevins shared an article she penned for the conspiracy-prone Free Thought Project website, about ""dozens of children in Iowa"" having ""vanished"" over the previous two weeks: Why Isn't Anyone Talking About This?? In Just the Last Two Weeks, Dozens of Children in Iowa Have Vanished https://t.co/xJVaWgt7i5 — Rachel Blevins (@RachBlevins) July 27, 2018 The article opened with a discussion of missing Iowa college student Mollie Tibbits, whose disappearance has garnered significant news coverage . Blevins then attempted to make the point that Mollie’s disappearance was part of a much larger and troubling trend by offering up a statistic largely devoid of any context: According to the Missing Person database published by the Iowa Department of Public Safety, 48 people have gone missing in the last two weeks, and 34 of those people are children. Blevins took a snapshot of the Iowa Missing Person database at a given point in time and counted how many individuals on that list had been reported missing over the past two weeks. Such an approach created the impression that the current number of missing persons in that state was unusual, and that a majority of those missing persons cases represented children who were “vanishing” (presumably permanently). But the reported numbers were, unfortunately, not unusual. Due to sensationalized reporting of this type, on 27 July 2018 the Iowa Department of Public Safety (DPS) released a statement putting Blevin’s numbers in context . That context revealed that, from a missing juvenile standpoint, nothing unique, unusual, or alarming had occurred over the previous two weeks in Iowa: In light of the missing person investigation of Mollie Tibbits, concerns have come to light about the number of juveniles reported missing in Iowa in recent weeks. In [fiscal year] 2017 4,311 juveniles were reported missing to The Missing Person Information Clearinghouse. This is an average of approximately 12 juveniles a day. The vast majority of which are found or returned home within 24 hours. Typically these cases are runaway situations. The number of missing juveniles reported in recent weeks is in line with historical numbers. In 2016 , by comparison, a total of 4,108 missing juveniles were reported in Iowa, but only 209 of them actually remained missing at the time of their reporting. In neighboring Missouri , 7,170 juveniles were reported missing (roughly 20 per day) in 2017, but the number of open missing juvenile cases remaining at the end of the year was 52. Indeed, even the list of missing persons provided alongside the 27 July 2018 Iowa DPS statement had changed significantly in the three days after it was posted. That list initially included 37 individuals comprising both adults and juveniles, but as of the publication of this article (according to our count), 13 of those names had already been removed from the list, indicating those cases had been resolved: Moreover, Blevins' article closed by asserting that ""While individual cases such as the disappearance of Mollie Tibbetts do receive some national media attention, the overwhelming majority are swept under the rug and forgotten.""  This statement was also misleading and inaccurate: Mollie Tibbetts is not an example of a missing ""child"" (she's a 20-year-old woman), and in fact the overwhelming majority of missing children (over 97%) are found and returned home: The likelihood of finding an abducted child has sharply increased in recent years due to technological advances in the way searches are conducted and a greater awareness that fast action saves lives, said Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children [NCMEC]. That has boosted the recovery rate for missing children involved in the most dangerous cases in America to 97 percent in 2011 from 62 percent in 1990, according to the center’s statistics. That rate is even higher when it includes all missing children, not just the highest-risk cases , which include abductions by a stranger or a family member wanted on a felony arrest warrant, Allen said. “More than 99 percent of children reported missing in America in recent years have come home alive,” Allen [said]. Also contrary to Blevins' assertion is NCMEC's own website , which proclaims that (at least within their purview) ""no missing child is ever forgotten"": No missing child is ever forgotten, no matter how long they have been missing. Through the Biometrics Team NCMEC coordinates the collection of DNA, dental records and other unique identifiers from family members to search for potential matches, even for long-term cases. The Case Analysis Unit provides direct analytical support to law enforcement for missing and unidentified deceased child cases. Every day NCMEC works to find missing children and reunite them with their families. While the missing persons numbers presented by Free Thought Project were accurate at the time of publication, the implication that they represented an alarming trend or a deviation from normal rates of missing persons — much less an epidemic of ""vanishing children"" underway in Iowa — was without basis.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,952
85e2550e-538a-4020-96af-18d05255f9d5,"Stephen Miller, a senior advisor to President Trump, is often described as the architect of some of Donald Trump’s most exclusionary immigration policies, including the chaotically executed “Muslim ban” and calls to build a border wall. Formerly a member of senator-turned-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ communication staff, he has played a central role in developing the “zero tolerance policy” announced by Sessions on 6 April 2018, which resulted in thousands of children forcibly separated from their parents at the southern border of the United States. On 20 June 2018, widespread public outrage lead the President to sign a vague executive order directing immigration officials to imprison both parents and children together, but Miller remains in favor of the zero tolerance policy and its use as a deterrent against illegal immigration. Memes and think pieces have suggested that Miller’s policy recommendations — which serve to prevent poor or persecuted immigrants from coming into the United States from Latin American countries as well as block people from predominantly Muslim countries — are hypocritical, as his own family is descended from Jewish immigrants who arrived with no money and unable to speak English, escaping the pogroms and poverty of the Russian Empire. Factually speaking, this is an accurate description of how Miller’s mother’s family came to the United States. Stephen Miller’s mother belongs to the Glosser family, which has its ancestral roots in the currently Belarusian (but formerly Russian) city of Antopol . One branch of the family found themselves in Johnstown, Pennsylvania and eventually become proprietors of a prominent department store (named, appropriately, Glosser Bros. Department Store.) That business was so influential to the community that its history was published in 2014, on the 25th anniversary of its closing. That book describes the family’s immigrant origins: We're not sure what last name they had in the Old Country...though members of the family listed the name ""Glotzer"" on their paperwork when they finally emigrated to America. Whatever their last name, the husband and wife who were destined to someday become the Glossers of Johnstown were just Wolf Leib and Bessie of the Eastern European town of Antopol, which was part of the Russian Empire. [...] [Wolf and Bessie] came to Ellis Island on January 7, 1903 aboard the German ship the S.S. Moltke. According to the ship's manifest, he had a grand total of $8.00 in his possession. The early 1900s saw a violent, rising antisemitism in the Russian Empire — an infamous period of history known for the pogroms , which resulted in thousands of Jewish people murdered in brutal, state-sponsored mob violence: When the czar was assassinated in 1881, the crime was blamed, falsely, on a Jewish conspiracy, and the government launched a wave of state-sponsored massacres known as pogroms. Hundreds of Jewish villages and neighborhoods were burned by rampaging mobs, and thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Russian soldiers and peasants. The pogroms caused an international outcry, but they would continue to break out for decades to come. Between 1900 and 1914, when the first Glossers arrived in America, 1.5 million Jews had emigrated from Eastern Europe to escape famine and bloodshed; of those, a vast majority settled in the United States. An 1898 article published in the Atlantic captured the sentiment of Russian Jews during this time: There is no hope for Israel in Russia. The salvation of the downtrodden people lies in other parts, in a land beyond the seas, which knows no distinction of race or faith, which is a mother to Jew and Gentile alike. In the great republic is our redemption from the brutalities and ignominies to which we are subjected in this our birthplace. In America we shall find rest; the stars and stripes will wave over the true home of our people. To America, brethren! To America! Before 1924, there were no immigration laws in existence that the Glossers could have broken (or abided by) during their journey, making it much easier to find legal refuge in the United States as an Eastern European then than it is for those seeking asylum in the United States in 2018. The author of the Glosser Bros. Department Store's history book imagined the family's relief once they arrived: Imagine living in a place where armed Cossacks ride through the streets, looking to cripple or kill you. A place where the non-Jewish peasants sic their dogs on your children. Where the threat of ethnic massacres, or pogroms, constantly hangs over your head. Where your home has a dirt floor, a thatched roof, and no indoor plumbing, and you barely scrape by, selling kerosene, salt, and potato bread in a humble market stall. Now you know how the Glossers felt before they came to Johnstown. One of the founding brothers of Glosser Bros. — Sam Glosser, son of Wolf and Bessie — is the great-grandfather of Stephen Miller. In response to a story highlighting Miller’s connection to Johnstown published in the local Tribune-Democrat , Miller’s uncle David Glosser — who once wrote, “I wish Stephen career success and personal happiness, however I cannot endorse his political preferences” — left a detailed account of his family's roots: Starting with exactly nothing, one branch of the family established the scrap yard business, and our branch built Glosser Brother's department store. [...] We thrived. This was the miracle of America. While there was always a certain amount of anti-Jewish prejudice, it was not universal or state sponsored, we had equal protection of the law, freedom of speech and religion, and we enjoyed good relations with our neighbors. [...] My nephew [Stephen Miller] and I must both reflect long and hard on one awful truth. If in the early 20th century the USA had built a wall against poor desperate ignorant immigrants of a different religion, like the Glossers, all of us would have gone up the crematoria chimneys with the other six million kinsmen whom we can never know. In a 19 June 2018 interview (whose on-the-record audio the New York Times controversially withheld at the request of the White House), Miller described the intended goals of the so-called “zero-tolerance policy” that separated children from their parents as one meant to dissuade people from thinking they could successfully seek refuge in the United States: From where Mr. Miller sits, illegal immigration is driven by a belief among people outside the United States that those who make it across the border will be allowed to stay indefinitely. “The success rate is the predominant factor that drives illegal migration,” he told us. By instituting a zero-tolerance policy, Mr. Miller said, the administration is sending a message that should reduce the flow of illegal immigration into the country. The Glossers, of course, have remained in America indefinitely since their arrival in 1903. So successful have they been, in fact, that one of their descendants is currently a senior advisor to that nation’s highest office. While a lack of immigration laws for Europeans in the 1900s would have made an official asylum request unnecessary, the Glossers did escape state-sponsored ethnic persecution — conditions that could legally form the basis of an asylum claim under the modern immigration system — by seeking refuge in America. As such, we rank the claim that Miller is descended from asylum seekers as true.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1388
7c7cba22-1708-4477-b05d-e77d80fc3eac,"United States President Donald Trump took another swipe at Canada on 19 June 2018 during a speech about ""smugglers"" bringing shoes into the country from the United States, by mixing two pieces of a New York Post story. Trump, speaking at an event hosted by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), said: There was a story two days ago in a major newspaper talking about people living in Canada, coming into the United States and smuggling things back into Canada because the tariffs are so massive. The tariffs to get common items back into Canada are so high that they have to smuggle them in. They buy shoes and they wear them. They scuff them up to make them sound old, or look old. No, we're treated horribly. The president did not identify the ""major newspaper"" that supposedly printed the story, but his statement was based on an op-ed published in the Post three days earlier by reporter Isabel Vincent. She wrote: A Canadian who once lived in Vancouver told me he would cross the border into Seattle to buy outdoor equipment that he simply couldn't find in Canada. ""Before we crossed back into Canada, we'd remove the price tags and make sure that the new equipment looked as dusty as possible,"" he said. Vincent, who said Canadian friends relied on her to help them bring goods across the border, also shared an anecdote regarding shoes, though it did not involve changing their appearance: A Toronto-based designer I know purchased two pairs of shoes (retail $800 each) online from a midtown department store and shipped them to my office. The Italian contraband sat under my desk for weeks until I could entrust them to a carrier who would be crossing the border. I finally convinced my nephew who had been visiting New York to stuff them into his back-pack and rendezvous with the designer in Toronto for the drop-off. My friend saved $159.59 in combined federal and provincial taxes, and $187.26 in estimated customs charges. The NFIB did not respond to a request for comment concerning the remark. The Footware Distributors and Retailers of America, though, rebuked Trump for his comment in a statement. The trade group's president and CEO Matt Priest said that ""anyone from anywhere"" was welcome to purchase shoes in the United States: The President seems misinformed about footwear trade. Consumers buying shoes in America already pay a very high tariff, upwards of 37.5 percent and 67.5 percent. NAFTA is not treating footwear consumers in America unfairly, the American government itself has not lowered footwear duties in a meaningful way in over 80 years. If the President is concerned about treating American footwear companies and consumers fairly, then he should have signed the TPP to lower footwear costs in America. Canada signed the TPP and will eventually get duty free shoes from Vietnam, a major sourcing hub, where American brands will ship directly into Canada duty free. Canadian’s have no real reason to ""smuggle"" their shoes because their government is already helping lower their costs through proper trade deals. The Canadian government does not identify any specific limitations on bringing American footwear into the country. Most goods worth more than 200 Canadian dollars are subject to duty and taxes if brought in more than 24 hours after purchase. Trump's remark was the latest in a series of verbal attacks against Canada and its prime minister, Justin Trudeau, accusing the country of taking economic advantage of the U.S. He has also threatened that the U.S. would exit its partnership in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and did not discount that possibility in his remarks at the NFIB event, saying: We're trying to equalize it. It's not easy but we're getting there. We'll see whether or not we can make a reasonable NAFTA deal.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,725
6c1f780d-f653-42a3-a1e0-73850c5689d1,"In April 2018, the right-leaning Turning Point USA posted a Facebook meme which attacked Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for once supporting a proposal to ""dump nuclear waste"" in a ""poor Latino community in Texas"": In the 90's, Trump supported a bill to dump nuclear waste in Sierra Blanca, a poor Latino community in Texas where the average yearly income was $8,000. When asked if he would visit the site, he said ""Absolutely not."" Oh wait! Never mind, that was Bernie Sanders! And he actually co-sponsored the bill! The meme was re-posted by the ""Capitalism"" Facebook page: In 1997 and 1998, Sanders did indeed support a measure that gave Congressional approval to an arrangement that would have allowed the states of Maine and Vermont to transport and dispose of nuclear waste at a proposed site in the sparsely populated town of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County, close to the Mexican border in West Texas. As the meme suggests, Sierra Blanca was (and is) a predominantly Latino community. U.S. Census Bureau records show that in 2000, two years after the proposal, 73 percent of the town's 533 residents identified as Hispanic or Latino, and almost all of those as Mexican. In 2016, some 69 percent of Sierra Blanca's 557 residents identified as Hispanic or Latino. In 1999, the annual per capita income of Sierra Blanca residents was $10,768, which was 45 percent lower than that of Texans at large ($19,617). In 2016, the median household income in Sierra Blanca was estimated to be $41,875 as compared to $54,727 in the state of Texas. As an Independent member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Vermont, Sanders was one of 23 co-sponsors of House Resolution 629 , which called for Congress to give its consent to the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact — an agreement between the states of Texas, Maine, and Vermont. Speaking on the floor of the house in October 1997, Sanders said he was in ""strong support"" of the resolution for environmental reasons, and stressed that he personally was opposed to the use of nuclear power, but that the waste it produces had to be disposed of as safely as possible. It is worth reading a relatively extensive excerpt from his remarks in order to get a good sense of Sanders' stated reasoning: Let me touch, for a moment, upon the environmental aspects of this issue. And let me address it from the perspective of someone who is an opponent of nuclear power, opposes the construction of nuclear power plants and if he had his way, would shut down the existing nuclear power plants as quickly and as safely as we could. One of the reasons that many of us oppose nuclear power plants is that when this technology was developed, there was not a lot of thought given as to how we dispose of the nuclear waste. But...the reality, as others have already pointed out, is that the waste is here. We can't wish it away. It exists in power plants in Maine and Vermont, it exists in hospitals, it is here...So the real environmental issue here is not to wish it away, but to make the judgement, the important environmental judgement as to what is the safest way of disposing of the nuclear waste that has been created. ...Leaving the radioactive waste at the site where it was produced -- despite the fact that that site might be extremely unsafe in terms of long-term isolation of the waste, and was never intended to be a long-term depository of low-level waste  -- is horrendous environmental policy...No reputable scientist of environmentalist believes that the geology of Vermont or Maine would be a good place for this waste. In the humid climate of Vermont and Maine, it is more likely that ground water will come in contact with that waste and carry off radioactive elements to the accessible environment. There is widespread scientific evidence to suggest, on the other hand, that locations in Texas -- some of which receive less than 12 inches of rainfall a year, a region where the groundwater table is more than 700 feet below the surface -- is a far better location for this waste. This is not a political assertion, it is a geological and environmental reality. A video clip of his comments can be viewed here . Congress passed the resolution comfortably by 305 votes to 117, as did the Senate , by 78 votes to 15. The proposal had much stronger support among Republicans than among Democrats. GOP members of the House voted 197-26 in favor, while Democrats were more evenly split, voting 107-91 in favor. In the Senate, not a single Republican opposed H.R. 629, while 51 of them voted for it. Fifteen Democratic Senators opposed the bill, while 27 of them voted in support. At that time, five out six Senators from Texas, Vermont, and Maine were Republicans. All five of them voted in favor of the proposal. Both of Maine's Representatives voted for the disposal site, as did 10 out of the 13 Republican Congress members from Texas. In the House, the proposal had 23 co-sponsors. Eleven were Republicans, eleven were Democrats, and one was Sanders himself, an Independent. The author of the resolution was Joe Barton, a Republican from Texas. Despite Congressional approval for the agreement, authorities in Texas ultimately rejected the proposal to establish a disposal site at Sierra Blanca. In October 1998, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission voted 3-0 against issuing a permit for the construction of a nuclear waste dump there. According to the Associated Press , commission chairman Barry McBee said the disposal site could have provided a much-needed economic boost to the area, but commission members were sufficiently concerned about safety issues to deny the permit. According to a September 1998 article in the Texas Observer , a group of activists opposed to the Sierra Blanca waste site approached Sanders at an anti-nuclear weapons rally in Vermont that year: Sanders left the stage, which surprised no one in the small Texas delegation. Earlier, he had told them, ""My position is unchanged, and you're not gonna like it."" When they asked if they would visit the site in Sierra Blanca, he said, ""Absolutely not. I'm gonna be running for re-election in the state of Vermont."" We contacted Bill Addison, a leading opponent of the Sierra Blanca proposal, who was identified in the Texas Tribune article as having attended that Springfield rally. He confirmed that he was present and corroborated the article's account of the activists' interaction with Sanders. We asked a spokesperson for Sanders whether he agrees that this exchange took place, but we did not receive a response to that specific question. Instead, the spokesperson offered a broader explanation and defense of the Senator's support of H.R. 629: The only reason Senator Sanders was ever involved is because the constitution requires Congress to approve interstate compacts. Texas Representative Joe Barton introduced such legislation in 1998, and twenty-three members of the Vermont, Texas and Maine congressional delegations cosponsored it. The bill did not endorse a specific site — in fact, it did not mention Sierra Blanca at all. Nor did the bill override the local and state approval process. In the end, the Texas agency in charge of permitting ruled against the Sierra Blanca site, choosing another site in Texas instead.  So, the process worked. The compact, much less the site selection were never Sen. Sanders’ idea.  He disagrees with the very premise of the 1980 law that led to the Texas-Vermont-Maine compact, since it put the burden of disposing of low-level waste on the states, rather the nuclear energy companies that produced much of the waste. In fact, he has long been an opponent of nuclear power precisely it produces waste for which we still have no solution (the Texas site is just for low-level contamination — there is still no plan for all of the high-level nuclear waste all across the country). Sanders' spokesperson is right to point out that the text of H.R. 629 did not mention Sierra Blanca, but the town was widely known and discussed as the proposed location of the disposal site throughout the time that Sanders and others supported the bill.  For example, in April 1998 (three months before Sanders and others in the House voted in favor of H.R. 629) the late Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone condemned the proposed Sierra Blanca site from the floor of the Senate: What has troubled me from the very beginning is that this legislation would result in the dumping of low-level radioactive waste in a small, poor, majority-Latino community in rural West Texas — a town called Sierra Blanca. The Texas legislation in 1991 identified the area where the dump will be located. The Texas Waste Authority designated the site near Sierra Blanca in 1992. A draft license was issued in 1996. Whether we like it or not, this knowledge makes us responsible for what happens to Sierra Blanca. The Turning Point USA meme is accurate in claiming that Sanders supported and co-sponsored a proposal that would have seen nuclear waste from Maine, Vermont and (principally) Texas disposed of at a site in Sierra Blanca, and that Sierra Blanca was (and still is) a predominately Latino and relatively poor community. The meme leaves out important and relevant context by failing to mention the key role that Republicans played in crafting and passing that proposal; instead, it singles out Sanders and does not offer the reader any inkling of his environmentalist rationale. Sanders stood to gain politically from supporting a plan that would remove nuclear waste from his constituency, but this does not necessarily mean he wasn't motivated by a sincere desire to dispose of the waste in a manner and location that he genuinely believed to be safer. However, whether or not you believe his stated rationale was sincere, no proper analysis of a particular politician's policy position or Congressional vote should leave out the reasons put forward by that politician. Finally, we were not able to corroborate the ""Absolutely not"" quotation attributed to Sanders, and his spokesperson did not address our question about it.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1918
8d125e88-ebf3-4877-8c84-6928c7666b46,"A village just north of Chicago, Illinois, began garnering media attention in April 2018 for an ordinance passed by local leaders banning high-capacity firearms and magazines, with hefty fines for violators. The ban, which was passed by the Deerfield village board on 2 April 2018, applies to assault weapons only, which are defined in the ordinance as ""a semiautomatic rifle, pistol, or shotgun that has the capacity to accept more than ten rounds of ammunition plus another feature(s) defined in the ordinance."" The list of weapons covered under the ordinance includes AR-15 rifles, which have been used to commit several mass shootings around the United States, including the February 2018 mass shooting in Parkland, Florida in which a gunman killed seventeen people,  spurring a series of protests around the world . However, a Lake County Circuit Court judge issued a temporary restraining order on 12 June 2018 preventing the measure from being enforced, a day before it was slated to take effect. The measure includes fines of ""no less than $250 and not more than $1,000"" per day for people found to be in violation of the ordinance. However, village employees as well as law enforcement officers and ""the organized militia of this or any other state"" are exempt from having to abide by it. Owners of ""antique firearms manufactured in or before 1898"" are also exempt if their weapons are safely stored or displayed. The village, which is located around 25 miles from Chicago, also released a statement addressing questions about the ordinance, including how it will be enforced: Weapons being illegally possessed will be confiscated as authorized by the ordinance. Any other enforcement of this ordinance, including search or seizure to effect this ordinance, must comply with the requirements of State and Federal law. Members of the Department will not go ""door to door"" to ensure compliance. The ban was passed unanimously by the village's board of trustees. Two days later, the Institute for Legislative Action — the lobbying arm of the National Rifle Association — announced that they would support a lawsuit filed by another group, Guns Save Life, challenging the ordinance. At this moment a court hearing is scheduled for 8 June 2018, with gun advocacy groups seeking a temporary restraining order to halt enforcement of the ban: Gun-rights advocacy groups are asking a Lake County Circuit Court judge to bar the village of Deerfield from enforcing its ban on assault weapons that is set to kick in June 13. The ordinance enacted April 2 by the Deerfield Village Board gives residents until June 13 to turn in any guns that fit the village’s definition of assault weapons, remove them from the village or modify the guns so they’re no longer considered assault weapons. The ordinance empowers the town’s police chief to confiscate the assault weapons of anyone charged under the ordinance. Two lawsuits were filed in April challenging the ordinance on various grounds, including a claim that the ordinance deprives gun owners of property they are legally entitled to possess. The plaintiffs in both lawsuits are asking for a temporary restraining order to block Deerfield from enforcing the ban until the court can hear their arguments for a permanent injunction. A hearing to consider the restraining order motions is set for June 8, just days before the ban is set to take effect. The Deerville measure was reportedly based on a similar ordinance passed in another suburb, Highland Park, in 2013.

cad063fc-9e51-4c46-8c57-e294e1c7b1e2,"The late 2017 decision to allow girls into the Boy Scouts of America caused considerable outrage in certain circles, as some argued that the change would lead to the organization's downfall. In May 2018, as BSA eyed a name change, blogs such as DailyWire.com took advantage of the controversy by publishing articles connecting the change to a policy requiring condoms to be available at the World Scout Jamboree : The Boy Scouts World Scout Jamboree, which is held every four years and next will be held in West Virginia in 2019, may offer something to Scouts that would have been unthinkable years ago: condoms. A WND.com article had similarly misleading paragraphs : The Boy Scouts have decided to accept people who identify as gay and lesbian among their ranks. And girls are welcome now, too, into the iconic organization, which has renamed itself Scouts BSA. So what’s next? A mandate that condoms be made available to ""all participants"" of its global gathering. These articles heavily implied that the condom policy was new, and that it was directly connected to the decision to allow girls into BSA: At best this is misleading, as the policy requiring condoms to be available at the World Scout Jamboree comes from the World Organization of the Scout Movement, not BSA. WOSM is an international scouting organization that oversees a regular Jamboree (usually every four years) attended by scouts from all over the world. In guidelines for the event adopted in March 2016, the WSOM said: The host organization must ensure that condoms are readily and easily accessible for all participants and IST at a number of locations on the site. Heads of Contingent must be informed in advance and made aware of their responsibility in communicating this policy to their Participants, Unite Leaders Contingent Staff, and IST in an appropriate way. When making this information available onsite, consideration shall be given to the various cultures and beliefs present. The 2019 Jamboree will be far from the first time condoms have been made available at the event. A 2011 handbook for an event in Sweden encouraged safe sex and noted the availability of condoms at the health center: It is important to always take care of yourself and others. Sex without a condom or other form of contraception can result in pregnancy, and if your partner has HIV or a sexually transmitted infection (and you might not always know they do), you can become infected too. About sex and relationships If you are considering having sex, condoms are the best way to protect yourself against infections and pregnancy. These are available from the Health Centres or can be purchased from the pharmacy on Four Seasons Square. An article from BBC also reported that condoms would be made available to attendees of the 20th World Scout Jamboree in Thailand in 2002. (Some outlets at the time expressed outrage about the availability of condoms and warned about a Boy Scout "" orgy ."") According to a 2006 report, condoms have been made available at international scouting events at least 1992 : For nearly 15 years the policy of the World Organization of the Scout Movement — which is the authority responsible for the World Scout Jamboree — has been to hand out free condoms in the health centres set up for the event, to all participants that may request them. The fight against AIDS and the resurgence of sexually transmitted illnesses (STIs) prompted WOSM to work closely with UNAIDS, UNICEF, WHO and UNFPA to set up educational programmes that, on the one hand, contribute to the emotional and sexual education of young people by integrating the emotional development of young people - whether boys or girls – and, on the other hand, through the prevention of risks linked to sexually transmitted illnesses (see story). The presence of the Scout Movement in many countries affected by STIs has naturally led national Scout organisations to include this problem into their educational programmes. WSOM officially implemented a policy requiring condoms to be available at the World Scout Jamboree in 2002, releasing a statement about it at the time: It is the policy of the World Organization of the Scout Movement, which is the authority responsible for the World Scout Jamboree, to have condoms freely available in each health centre of the event for any participant that makes this request. The spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has led the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) to coordinate with UNAIDS, UNICEF, the World Health Organisation and the UNFPA to create educational programmes for the emotional and sexual education of young people. These programmes integrate both the emotional development of youth, boys and girls, and the prevention of risks related to sexually transmitted infections. The presence of Scouting in a number of countries particularly affected by STIs has led these National Scout Organizations to include this issue in their educational programmes as well. We reached out to WSOM about the articles attempting to connect the decades old policy to the Boy Scouts of American recent decision to include girls and were told that these two decisions were in no way related. WSOM also clarified that condoms are not ""distributed directly to participants"" but are available at the health center: WOSM is committed to offer a safe space for all participants during World Scout Events. While condoms are not distributed directly to participants at activities during World Scout Jamboree, condoms are still made available as part of the youth-friendly services offered at the health centre and in line with the international best practices recommended by the United Nations. WOSM advises at the beginning of the event the organisers and delegation leaders of all health services provided to participants at the centre. In accordance with WOSM’s guidelines and in line with the best international health practices as recommended by the United Nations specialised agencies, WOSM makes condoms available in each health centre of the event for any participant that makes this request. The policy on condoms started in 2002 and is not connected to the Boy Scouts of America’s decision to open all its educational programmes to young women. Vice Chairperson of the World Scout Committee Andy Chapman confirmed to us that WSOM sets the guidelines for the Jamboree, and that the three host organizations of this year’s event —Scouts Canada, the Scout Association of Mexico, and the Boy Scouts of America — are working to implement the requirements in an appropriate manner. Chapman also noted that the WSOM policies take into account the concerns of a variety of countries, not just the United States: Planning for the 2019 World Scout Jamboree is currently underway between the World Organization of Scout Movement (WOSM) and the three National Scout Organizations who are co-hosting the event - Scouts Canada, the Scout Association of Mexico and the Boy Scouts of America. “The World Scout Jamboree is an official program of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. As a world Scouting event, WOSM previously established the requirements and guidelines for the 2019 World Scout Jamboree. The co-hosts are working with WOSM to appropriately implement these requirements. The World Scout Jamboree organizing team has worked with the co-host countries to align these requirements, which have been in place for the past two World Scout Jamborees, in a manner that is respectful to local laws and preferences. For instance, alcohol will not be offered at the 2019 World Scout Jamboree at the Summit Bechtel Reserve. The 2019 World Scout Jamboree will focus Scouts from around the world on personal development, faith and beliefs, sustainability, adventure and other topics that cross cultural lines. Scouting's founder Lord Baden-Powell of Great Britain believed that bringing youth of the world together would help foster greater cultural awareness, acceptance and cooperation. The 2019 World Scout Jamboree is being planned with this spirit in mind. The articles insinuating that the condom policy was new and somehow connected to Boy Scouts of America's decision to welcome girls into the organization were ignoring the fact that girls already make up a large portion of the global scouting community, and that they have for years been allowed to join the Scouts in a majority of countries (emphasis ours): So, obvious question, but will there be girls at the 2019 World Scout Jamboree? This is still a great question to ask because not only will there be girls at the 2019 WSJ, they will make up about half of all participants attending! In recent years, more girls than boys have joined Scouting globally. If you are curious about how co-ed Scouting works, you have to see how the rest of the world does it. Of the 169 members of the World Organization of the Scouting Movement (WOSM), only fourteen countries have specifically boys-only Scouting. So that means that our co-hosts, Canada and Mexico, will be bringing tons of young women to the 2019 WSJ. Not to mention, almost every other nation across the globe will be joining them! In fact, a group of girls were in attendance at the first World Scout Jamboree in London in 1920. The WSOM has officially accepted female members since the early 1970s, and the majority of scouting programs welcome both boys and girls: This is definitely not the first time that girls will be attending the World Scout Jamboree. A patrol of girls was present at the 1st World Scout Jamboree that was held in London in 1920. In response, the Girl Guide Movement was established by Lord Baden-Powell as a “sister organisation” to Scouting. WOSM itself is made up of 169 National Scout Organizations, and has formally accepted female members since the early 1970s. The majority of these organisations now offer Scouting programmes that welcome both boys and girls, young men and young women. In other words, 2018 headlines about condoms being the latest symptom of scouting decline are little more than warmed-over outrage clickbait.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1822
8bfd5df9-8d55-488a-a1bd-ea7a3bfa9d75,"On 16 May 2018, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology held a hearing ostensibly to discuss the ways in which ""technology could be deployed for climate change adaptation."" As this committee’s hearings are wont to do, however, some committee members used their time to interrogate the expert witness about the veracity of basics of climate science. In this case, that witness was Philip Duffy, the president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts. The most infamous exchange occurred between Duffy and Representative Mo Brooks, a Republican from Alabama. Philip Bump at the Washington Post described it in a gripping play-by-play : Brooks asked Duffy what else might be contributing [to observed sea-level rise besides expanding oceans and melting ice]. Duffy pointed to ground subsidence, which is the sinking of the ground in places that can exacerbate the problem of rising sea levels. [...] “Those are all that I know of,” Duffy replied. “What about erosion!” Brooks exclaimed. “Every single year that we’re on Earth, you have huge tons of silt deposited by the Mississippi River, by the Amazon River, by the Nile, by every major river system — and for that matter, creek, all the way down to the smallest systems. And every time you have that soil or rock whatever it is that is deposited into the seas, that forces the sea levels to rise. Because now you’ve got less space in those oceans because the bottom is moving up. [...] What about the white cliffs of Dover?” Brooks continued. “California, where you have the waves crashing against the shorelines and time and time again you have the cliffs crash into the sea. All of that displaces the water which forces it to rise, does it not?” Brooks is accurate when he says that tons of material — silt, sand, dissolved solids, maybe some rocks from the cliffs of Dover, etc. — are constantly flowing into the world’s ocean basins. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: It is estimated that the rivers and streams flowing from the United States alone discharge 225 million tons of dissolved solids and 513 million tons of suspended sediment annually to the ocean. Throughout the world, rivers carry an estimated four billion tons of dissolved salts to the ocean annually. Though his question makes sense from an elementary physics standpoint, Brooks is inaccurate in suggesting that this contributes in any meaningful way to the sea level rise attributed to anthropogenic global warming. Certainly, when you put something into water, that water is displaced and the water rises relative to the volume of that object — we can thank Archimedes for that one. On human timescales, however, the amount of water displaced by this sediment flow is essentially undetectable. We asked Phil Woodworth, the former director of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level ( PSMSL ), an international organization that maintains tide gauge records worldwide, about Brooks’ question. He told us, ""As large as these river transports of sediments are, the ocean volume is so enormous that they don’t result in a significant change in global-average sea level."" According to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, which is a consensus statement produced with the input of thousands of international scientists and overseen by the United Nations, sea levels overall since 1900 have gone up on average 1.7 millimeters per year with an uncertainty of 0.2 millimeters in either direction. (Satellite data from 1993 onward indicate that this rate has been accelerating in recent years and is now thought to be around 3.3 millimeters per year). That IPCC report also estimated that the annual contribution of sea level rise caused by sediment dumped into ocean basins is about 0.01 millimeters per year — a meaningless number compared to the uncertainty associated with historical sea level data. The Post , using the 3.3 millimeter per year rate estimate relevant to more recent sea level rise, described how much material would need to be carried into the ocean every year: So to make the oceans rise 3.3 millimeters, we would need to displace that 1.2 trillion cubic meters of water upward by dropping in 1.2 trillion cubic meters of dirt or stone or whatever. How much is that? It’s a sphere of earth a bit over 8 miles in diameter. [...] If the sphere were stone, it would weigh about 6.6 quadrillion pounds. Just drop that in the ocean and — bloop! — 3.3 millimeters of sea-level increase [...]. Put another way, it’s a volume of earth equivalent to taking the top five inches of every one of the United States’ 9.1 million square miles of land area and using it to coat the bottom of the world’s oceans [every year]. That would push sea levels up by 3.3 millimeters [annually]. Of course, on geologic time scales (tens of millions of years) such an amount material added to the oceans would, in theory, become meaningful. That would be true if not for the fact that — also on geologic time scales — the ocean floor actively recycles old seafloor at rates comparable to the mass added by sediment each year. On these timescales the major factors driving global sea level variability are much larger-scale processes like the subduction of continents, the rise and fall of ocean ridges, and the volcanic processes that create new rocks. Tim Herbert , a professor of oceanography at Brown University, told us that Brooks’ argument — if looked at on these timescales — is akin to focusing on one side of a cyclic process while ignoring the processes that go the other direction. On relevant timescales, Herbert told us, the most important point is that current rate of sea level rise is substantially higher than what geologists believe to be a normal background rate: [There is] very clear evidence that for thousands of years in the Holocene, sea level rose very modestly. Sea level began to rise at a much steeper rate ~1850 (time of the first measurable sea level response to the input of CO2 that began with the Industrial revolution) and then has been steeply rising over the past few decades in parallel with the steep rise in CO2 and global temperatures. Every good study I know shows that current rates of sea level rise are 3-4 times the natural background rate. While Brooks is correct both in his understanding of Archimedes' principle and in his statement that tons of sediment flow into the oceans each year, his assertion that this sediment flow is in any way a measurable contributor to the sea level rise scientists are discussing in the context of anthropogenic global warming is false.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1264
47fb52e4-4da6-4af1-9b3d-a9203304a7c5,"An April 2018, a Fox News appearance by Rep. Debbie Dingell of Michigan led to another round of stories from right-wing blogs promoting the fear of widespread gun confiscations. Dingell, a Democrat, was interviewed by the right-wing network about her work co-chairing a working group alongside Republican Fred Upton concerning mass shooting attacks at schools. The network preceded her interview by reporting that police in Seattle were ""seizing guns."" In fact, there has been one reported instance of an involuntary gun seizure in Washington state through the use of an extreme risk protection order (ERPO for short) since the law was approved by voters in November 2016. During her appearance, Dingell said that she intended to introduce a federal version of the ""red flag"" laws that allow for use of ERPOs by law enforcement which are currently in effect in Washington and four other states, which contain guidelines through which individuals or police officers can petition courts to issue ERPOs if they believe that a gun owner may be a danger to themselves or others. Many of the blogs accusing Dingell of preparing to act out against gun owners cite the same Washington Post story — mislabeled as an original report by the Salt Lake City Tribune, rather than a republication — saying, ""In Indiana, law enforcement can confiscate weapons without a judge's order. The gun owner must ask the court to get the weapons returned."" This, too, is inaccurate; the law states that in the case of a firearm seizure without a warrant, police must submit ""a written statement under oath or affirmation"" to the circuit or superior court with jurisdiction over the gun owner explaining their reasoning for doing so: If the court finds that probable cause exists to believe that the individual is dangerous, the court shall order the law enforcement agency having custody of the firearm to retain the firearm. If the court finds that there is no probable cause to believe that the individual is dangerous, the court shall order the law enforcement agency having custody of the firearm to return the firearm to the individual. On 9 May 2018, Dingell and Upton joined two other lawmakers, Republican Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana and Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch of Florida, in introducing H.R. 5717, which would provide grants to states that adopt their own version of ""red flag"" laws. ""In the weeks since the horrific shooting in Parkland, Florida, I have met with law enforcement, prosecutors, mental health experts, the ACLU, students, teachers, parents, and other stakeholders to find common ground,"" Dingell said in a statement: One of the biggest takeaways from these conversations is that we need to provide family members and law enforcement the tools needed when they know someone is a threat to themselves or others. According to a statement sent to us by her office, the bill requires officers who seize a firearm without a warrant to file documentation regarding the seizure to the appropriate court within 48 hours. The court would also hold a hearing on the issue within 21 days of the seizure to determine whether the firearm owner is dangerous. Dingell is listed as a co-sponsor on the bill. In July 2017 she introduced a separate gun-related bill, H.R. 3207, which would make it illegal to ""knowingly sell or dispose of a firearm to a person who has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of stalking."" It would also expand misdemeanor domestic violence crimes ""to include the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, by a current or former intimate partner."" Dingell sent us a statement saying that the new bill is based on Indiana's ""red flag"" law, which won support from both Republican Gov. Mitch Daniels and the GOP-controlled state legislature. ""This is commonsense legislation that would give law enforcement a tool to ensure individuals deemed a threat to themselves or their community get help, protecting their due process while keeping them safe and their families and communities safe,"" she said.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,756
d558a072-67a7-415e-9d44-a9dcfa4f7d08,"On 3 May 2018, the ""Occupy Democrats"" Facebook page posted a meme which claimed that the president had violated the constitutional separation of church and state by setting up a ""religious office"": President Trump did sign an executive order in May 2018 to establish a new faith-based initiative within the White House, but nobody from his administration called it a ""religious office"" — that description appears to have come from Occupy Democrats. Furthermore, Trump's initiative represents significant continuity of, rather than a departure from, the previous two administrations. Although every detail and working of the new initiative has not yet been outlined, it certainly does not represent a radical change. Trump's White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative bears a striking resemblance to the White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, which George W. Bush set up in 2001, and which Barack Obama continued during his administration but renamed the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships. In brief, Trump's executive order — which he signed on 3 May 2018, the National Day of Prayer — replaces the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships with the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, keeping it within the Executive Office of the President of the United States. The executive order also sets out the following: The initiative will be led by an Advisor to the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative, based out of the Office of Public Liaison. The executive order abolishes Obama's Advisory Council for Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships Beyond that, Trump's order is somewhat vague on the exact workings of the initiative and the duties of the advisor who will lead it: The initiative will consult with ""experts and faith and various faith and community leaders"" with an interest in poverty, religious freedom, education, crime prevention, ""strengthening marriage and family,"" and other issues The advisor will give the president recommendations about policy relating to the services provided by faith-based and community organizations. One potentially significant provision in the executive order calls for those in charge of the Faith and Opportunity Initiative to contact the Attorney General if they see potential executive branch violations of a religious liberty memorandum published by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in October 2017. The Sessions memorandum reiterated the positions set out by Trump in an earlier executive order , in which the President wrote: It shall be the policy of the executive branch to vigorously enforce Federal law’s robust protections for religious freedom.... All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall, to the greatest extent practicable and to the extent permitted by law, respect and protect the freedom of persons and organizations to engage in religious and political speech. President Trump has prioritized enhancing legal protections for religious freedom, including when it comes to obligations placed on faith-based organizations that receive federal funding, the freedom of employers and employees to abstain from practices (particularly in health care) which they feel compromise their religious beliefs, and in calling for an end to the Johnson Amendment, a long-standing provision that bars religious 501 (c)(3) non-profit groups from engaging in electoral activism. In his 2001 executive order establishing the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives, President George W. Bush emphasized that a driving force behind the policy was a desire to ""level the playing field"" in the disbursement of federal funding, and enhance the funding opportunities available for religious non-profit organizations — especially those focused on poverty, addiction, crime and other social issues: The paramount goal is compassionate results, and private and charitable community groups, including religious ones, should have the fullest opportunity permitted by law to compete on a level playing field, so long as they achieve valid public purposes, such as curbing crime, conquering addiction, strengthening families and neighborhoods, and overcoming poverty. This delivery of social services must be results oriented and should value the bedrock principles of pluralism, nondiscrimination, evenhandedness, and neutrality. The Occupy Democrats meme is largely accurate. In May 2018, Trump did indeed establish an initiative within the White House which would give faith-based organizations what the administration called a ""voice in the White House."" However, the description of the initiative as a ""religious office"" did not come from the Trump administration itself, and that is not its official name. Furthermore, Trump's 2018 initiative represents significant continuity from predecessor offices set up by George W. Bush in 2001 and Barack Obama in 2009, although the exact focus, workings, and influence of Trump's initiative remain to be seen. On 5 May, the ""Being Liberal"" Facebook page and web site published an article with the headline ""Trump quietly signed an Executive Order allowing government to fund religious groups."" This is very misleading, and ignores the fact that the federal government has been providing grants, funding and tax write-offs to religious non-profit organizations for many years, including during the Obama administration. Trump's creation of the White House Faith and Opportunity Initiative did not usher in that state of affairs.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,939
a9895884-bf08-4559-862e-7f57d91dfb34,"Conservative blogs attempted to seize on the death of a sheriff's deputy in Broward County, Florida, in April 2018 as a way to promote conspiracy theories regarding ""questions"" about the mass school shooting attack there two months earlier. Many of the blogs invoved cited a story by Memory Hole Blog promoting the idea that a ""media blackout"" had taken place concerning Deputy Jason Fitzsimons' death. What set Fitzsimons apart from other recently deceased persons, the blog suggested, was that the deputy ""took to social media to question the potential agenda"" behind the assault at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, a mass shooting that resulted in the deaths of 17 people and spurred an uptick in gun safety protests around the U.S. That suggestion was based on a social media post by Fitzsimons depicting one of the high school's students, David Hogg, in a Nazi uniform: According to the Memory Hole Blog, that post and all of Fitzsimons' other social posts from 2018 had been ""scrubbed"": As is suggested in the aftermath of other recent mass shooting events, Fitzsimons simply may have possessed too much information, was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and/or asking sensitive questions of his peers and superiors on the specifics of the Parkland shooting. It is beyond dispute that the sheriff’s deputy had become uncomfortably outspoken on the February 14 event. Other conservative blogs picked up the story, with one saying that Fitsimons had ""exposed"" a conspiracy: But these blogs did not mention Memory Hole's follow-up story, which noted that Fitzsimons had used several different Facebook accounts, and that the account featuring the post criticizing Hogg had not been ""scrubbed"" and was accessible online at press time. Also, Fitzsimons didn't ""expose"" anything about the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — he merely posted criticisms of number of persons associated with that event on social media, primarily David Hogg. A spokesperson for the Broward County Sheriff's Department told us that they did not consider Fitzsimons' death to be suspicious. The spokesperson confirmed to us that detectives were aware of Fitzsimons' controversial social media post about Hogg, adding, ""It has nothing to do with his death."" The Broward County Medical Examiner's office determined that Fitzsimons' death was an accident, and attributed it to the ""combined toxic effects of hydrocodone, alprazolam, dextromethorphan, and doxylamine.""

311bd690-9b1a-4207-9c7d-b7c4d281f6f0,"In April 2018, the right-wing One America News Network (OAN) interviewed California State Assembly member Travis Allen, who is running for governor as a Republican, about Assembly Bill 2943 , a proposed law currently before state legislators. The bill relates to ""gay conversion therapy,"" but according to Allen and ""Tipping Point"" host Liz Wheeler, it would effectively ban the sale of Christian books, including the Bible. 0:00 / 0:00 In less than 24 hours, a clip of the interview was viewed 1.4 million times on Facebook and triggered multiple inquiries to us about its veracity. In reality, California Assembly Bill (A.B.) 2943 would not ban the sale of Bibles in that state. The clip from Wheeler's interview with Allen can be viewed below. Here is a transcript of the most relevant section: Wheeler: This is essentially criminalizing religious beliefs. And I don't mean to speak in hyperbole here, but if this bill were to pass, would this prohibit the sale of the Bible , that teaches these things about sexual morality? Allen: Well, literally, according to how this law is written, yes, it would . This is, you know, PC culture, politically correct culture, gone horribly awry. This is really directly hitting at our First Amendment rights as American citizens. Now the Democrat legislators in this building, right behind me, the California state legislature, they want to tell you how to think, what sort of books that you can read, write and purchase. ﻿ California Assembly Bill 2943 does not mention the Bible, Christianity, or religion at all, so when Allen claimed that the legislation would ""literally"" prohibit the sale of the Bible, he was stating something that is demonstrably and clearly false. In reality the legislation, which was introduced in February 2018 by San Jose-based Democrat Evan Low, enhances California's already-existing prohibition on ""sexual orientation change efforts"" (SOCE), commonly known as ""gay conversion therapy."" In 2012, the California Assembly passed Senate Bill 1172 , which banned mental health professionals from performing SOCE on children under the age of 18. The law defines SOCE as: ""any practices by mental health providers that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex."" A.B. 2943, as it stood on 20 April 2018, would extend that earlier prohibition in the following ways: Prohibit SOCE from being performed on anyone, not only children under the age of 18 Prohibit the advertising or sale of SOCE as a service The bill also appears to prohibit SOCE from being performed by any individual, not just by mental health providers, but the Assembly Judiciary Committee's analysis notes it is not clear whether the text of A.B. 2943 would amount to a blanket prohibition on any and all SOCE. Anthony Samson, a Sacramento attorney and policy advisor told us by email that the bill would prohibit conversion therapy ""as a commercial service in exchange for monetary compensation,"" adding: that "" It does not apply to the sale of books or any other kind of goods, and it does not prevent anyone from speaking or writing on the subject of conversion therapy in any forum ."" Low's bill does not seek to outlaw all religious or moral instruction regarding sexuality and sexual orientation, nor would it ban the sale or possession of generic religious texts such as the Bible. Christian dogma might form the basis of efforts change a person's sexual orientation, but the Bible itself is not a ""gay conversion therapy"" manual. The text of the legislation cites rafts of clinical evidence which conclude that SOCE is not a legitimate treatment because it seeks to ""treat"" same-sex attraction (something that is not classified as a mental illness) and because it can cause harm to the patient. In 2009, the American Psychological Association published the results of a major two-year task force review of peer-reviewed research about SOCE, which concluded by noting that ""Efforts to change sexual orientation are unlikely to be successful and involve some risk of harm, contrary to the claims of SOCE practitioners and advocates."" The review recommended that mental health providers, faced with an individual who wants to change sexual orientation, should implement a therapy based on ""acceptance, support, and understanding"" but should not ""[impose] a specific sexual orientation identity outcome."" In April 2018, Low -- who is openly gay -- made an emotional speech before the California Assembly, recounting his own past struggle with his sexual orientation and describing the anxiety and even suicidal thoughts he had wrestled with: ﻿",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,895

In a statement issued via Facebook Live , Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross defended the actions of officers in the video, saying that they ""did absolutely nothing wrong"": Ross said that Starbucks employees called 911 to report a trespassing complaint. The employees told officers the two men wanted to use the restroom but were told the facilities are only for paying customers. The Starbucks employees then asked the men to leave, but they refused, Ross said. Officers responded and asked the men three times ""politely to leave the location because they were being asked to leave by employees because they were trespassing."" When the men again refused to leave, they were arrested ""without incident,"" Ross said. ""They did a service that they were called to do,"" Ross said of the officers. ""And if you think about it logically, that if a business calls and they say that someone is here that I no longer wish to be in my business, (officers) now have a legal obligation to carry out their duties.

343f076d-5a94-409e-9821-a1d536223ef6,"Immigration is a sensitive and touchy issue, and never more so than in the United States during an election year.  Thus, when stories started to emerge in 2016 about a group of veterans of the U.S. military living in Mexico after they had been deported from the United States (a story we previously reported on) it seemed natural to question what looked like nothing more than a chunk of political kryptonite. However, deported veterans exist , although no one — not even the Department of Homeland Security — knows how many .  Their issue has been slowly brought into mainstream American consciousness largely by the efforts of committed activists in Tijuana. "" The Bunker ,"" also known as the Deported Veterans Support House, is in a small cinderbrick building tucked away on a side street in Mexico's border town of Tijuana, and is frequented by veterans of every branch of the United States military, who fought everywhere from Vietnam to Afghanistan. Former Army paratrooper Hector Barajas, 39, opened it to be a gathering place and a refuge for veterans who, like him, had been deported : ""I started The Bunker because there was a need,"" Barajas told us. He said since his deportation, he had been meeting others like him living in Tijuana, and discovered that they lived throughout Mexico — but not just Mexico.  There are hundreds of deported military vets living in at least twenty countries, he said. Since then, The Bunker has since become less a refuge and more a cause: Our vision is to end the deportations of Deported Veterans, repatriate the ones who have already been deported, and offer support until they all go home. We shouldn't honor our Deported Veterans by allowing them to return upon death. Honor them by allowing them to return home to their families and give them any benefits that they are eligible for. It may come as a surprise to learn that serving in the United States military does not automatically confer citizenship , but it doesn't.  It can smooth the way, provided the aspiring citizen is aware of what they need to do in order to apply for citizenship and gets it done within a certain timeframe . However, it's not uncommon for enlistees to wrongly assume (having never been told otherwise) they have done all they need to do in order to be awarded citizenship, and thus all they have to do after their honorable discharge is wait. Sometimes, too, there are bureaucratic foulups. One man was deported after he was unable to attend a hearing, despite his reason: he was in the hospital receiving surgery at the time.  Others do everything the way they're supposed to, filing their paperwork and appearing at their meetings, but still get deported, and no one seems to know exactly why.  Once they are outside the U.S., they maintain a legal right to VA benefits such as healthcare, and to whatever funds they might be entitled, but they have no way of getting back into the United States to obtain that assistance, and there are no satellite offices outside the country to help them. Because these particular veterans are either in the United States on green cards or without documentation after their discharges, they can be deported with cause, or for no reason at all.  Past and present members of the armed forces are supposed to receive special consideration during deportation hearings, but the guidelines are inconsistently applied. However, some of these veterans have spent time in prison for assault or drug offenses, which makes their situation more difficult to parse, at least politically.  Elected officials (and candidates) who might ordinarily be in full-throated cry about the importance of military rights tend to go oddly silent when confronted with the spectres of undocumented soldiers.  Sympathy for those wounded on the battlefield under the American flag suddenly falters when it turns out they had entered the country without documentation years before. Miguel Perez, a United States Army veteran, falls under that category. The 39-year-old Illinois man, who served two tours in Afghanistan and who has been in the U.S. since he was eight, was convicted of a drug trafficking offense in 2008. The green card holder had served half of a 15-year prison sentence when Immigration, Customs, and Enforcement took him for deportation proceedings. After losing an appeal, Perez was deported in March 2018: Perez was flown from Gary, Indiana, to Brownsville, Texas, where officers escorted him across the border and turned him over to Mexican authorities, ICE officials said. Perez appeared shocked by his treatment during his final moments on U.S. soil. An ICE agent who described himself as a fellow veteran told Perez they would ""fix this"" while leading him to a gate, Perez said. ""When we go there he just closed the gate behind me and he said, 'OK, we're done here,'"" he said. ""He said, 'You see those green lights? You go that way and when you get there just ask for help.'"" Perez recalls thinking, ""Really? This is it?"" The veteran said he immediately contemplated suicide but then said he felt he needed to keep walking and continue the fight to let others know how he and other undocumented veterans are treated by the U.S. Unless something changes for them, the only way most of the deported veterans will be able to return to the United States is by dying. By law, all military veterans (except those who have been dishonorably discharged) are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, and immigration laws don't apply to corpses. On 20 April 2016, lawmakers introduced a bill to readmit military veterans who were deported and who were not previously convicted of serious crimes. It would also prevent the removal of military veterans from the U.S. in the future. On 13 April 2018, Hector Barajas, the deported veteran who was one of the first to shine a spotlight on their plight, received his American citizenship, potentially paving the way for hundreds of other former United States military members:",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1138

The event was organized by activist group Avaaz , which put out a press release clarifying the number (7,000) as well as the manner of death (all gun violence among people under the age of 18): MEDIA ADVISORY— Tuesday March 13, from 8:30am, near the US Capitol: Shoes Memorial to 7,000 kids killed by guns in the US since the Sandy Hook school massacre / More details and contacts here: https://t.co/QP7eEQuyNe #NeverAgain #NotOneMore Follow @Avaaz_News for updates pic.twitter.com/2Q9qY8MtxM — Avaaz (@Avaaz) March 11, 2018 According to a press release issued in advance of the event, the figure of 7,000 came from the Centers for Disease Control. No link to any supporting information was included, but Avaaz said that guns kill more than ""1,300 American kids a year."" Approximately five years and three months passed between the Sandy Hook shooting and the demonstration; in that period of time by those figures, the number of children killed by guns would be roughly 6,825. Using the CDC's database search tool , we were unable to arrive at precisely the same numbers due to the way such information is catalogued and presented. The parameters available were slightly different, and we were able to access statistics for every recorded death of an individual under the age of 18 for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 (the system does not yet have data for 2017). The four-year tally for all firearm deaths in that truncated period was 5,683, which per year broke down slightly higher at 1,421 firearm deaths on average among those under the age of 18. When extrapolated to the five-year, three-month period the empty shoes protest encompasses, the number is closer to 7,460. We contacted Avaaz to ask about the source of their numbers, and they replied: We arrived at the number based on CDC estimates of ~1300 kids killed by guns a year (a number the CDC calls conservative). Since the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Dec 2012 until now, the math shakes out to roughly 7000 kids (0-17) killed by guns since then. The demonstration was genuine and took place on 13 March 2018. Variations: On 16 March 2018, an initiative published by the American Association of Pediatrics (AAP)'s AAP News reiterated CDC statistics indicating 1,300 children in the United States died of gunfire on average each year. A Newsweek article published that day contrasted the number of children killed by guns per year with the number of soldiers killed in all campaigns since 11 September 2001: MORE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KILLED BY GUNS SINCE SANDY HOOK THAN U.S. SOLDIERS IN COMBAT SINCE 9/11 The number of children killed by gunfire in the U.S. since the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, surpasses the total of American soldiers killed in overseas combat since 9/11, according to a Department of Defense report. The report accounts for total deaths in the five military operations since the war on terror began following the September 11, 2001 attacks through 10 a.m. EST Thursday, March 15. Over 17 years of combat, the U.S. has lost 6,929 soldiers. Including Department of Defense civilians killed overseas, that number grows to 6,950. Concurrently, a Facebook meme circulated providing similar (but not identical) figures: Using the above-provided estimate of 7,460 deaths of children since the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for comparison, the Newsweek item held that Department of Defense statistics showed fewer American soldiers died in wars since 9/11 than American children cited in the original estimate. A Department of Defense document did not measure the two against one another, but it did provide the total number of war-related deaths in five separate campaigns after 11 September 2001 [ PDF , archived ]. According to that document updated on 23 March 2018, casualties both in combat and those classed as ""non-hostile"" were listed as follows: Operation Iraqi Freedom: 4,424 Operation New Dawn: 73 Operation Enduring Freedom: 2,350 Operation Inherent Resolve: 61 Operation Freedom's Sentinel: 49 The number of American soldiers killed in all campaigns combined following 9/11 totaled 6,957. The AAP's statistic of 1,300 child deaths annually could be contrasted using the same figures in 16.5 years since 11 September 2001. In that period, approximately 422 soldiers died in active campaigns per year.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1071
9c3591f6-82e0-4d03-9eab-d05126555cfc,"On 26 January 2018, a Connecticut woman posted video to her Facebook page that was apparently video from a hidden camera showing California high school teacher Gregory Salcido talking pejoratively about the U.S. military: Flauto, a family friend of the student who shot the footage, asked Facebook friends to ""make this go viral"" —and they heeded her request. The videos have been viewed millions of times and shared thousands of times. Salcido's comments captured headlines in local and national publications and were blasted by right-wing outlets . Salcido is both a long-time teacher at El Rancho High School and a city councilman in Pico Rivera, a working-class city of roughly 63,000 in southeast Los Angeles County. When we contacted him, he declined to comment. In the videos, which were secretly recorded by senior Victor Quinonez, Salcido's comments were often met with students' laughter. He criticizes military recruitment on the high school's campus and derides the glorification of the military, saying statements made by United States President Donald Trump about the its greatness are overblown. In the quote that drew the most outrage, Salcido said: We got all our freaking night vision goggles, all that kind of stuff, and we can't freaking control these dudes wearing freaking robes and chanclas . Because we got a bunch of dumb shits over there. Think about the people who you know who are over there, your freaking stupid Uncle Louie or whoever, they're dumb shits. They're not like high-level thinkers, they're not academic people, they're not intellectual people. They're the freaking lowest of our low. Not morally. I'm not saying they make bad moral decisions. They're not talented people. [...] How come when you go to like the Rose Bowl, Rose Parade, Dodger opening day, why after the national anthem do we have a killing machine fly over the freaking stadium? You know the stealth bomber's out there and everyone's like, ""Yeah that's what we kill people with!"" Like why would that be something we celebrate? I don't get it. Anyway, you better not freaking go. The comments drew a rather intense round of what has become a familiar pattern of viral Internet outrage and backlash. In response to the controversy, Salcido has been officially admonished by the Pico Rivera City Council and stripped of his committee assignments. He has been placed on leave by the El Rancho Unified School District while the incident is under scrutiny. Even the United States Department of Defense has weighed in, calling Salcido's comments "" uninformed ."" Salcido told the Los Angeles Times he was receiving ""vulgar and violent threats"" directed against himself and his family. Pico Rivera is a tight-knit, primarily Latino suburb that has a strong tradition of honoring veterans and a large military-serving community, with two Veterans of Foreign Wars posts and two American Legion auxiliaries, said Mayor Gustavo Camacho. Speaking by phone, Camacho told us: I respect the First Amendment and freedom of speech and Mr. Salcido is entitled to his freedom of speech. But I want to remind him that the reason he has that freedom is because of the men and women who lost their lives in order for us to have that freedom of speech. Many folks can listen to an audio and interpret it as they see fit. If you have an opinion about recruitment or a particular college recruiter, why don’t we tell our kids, ""These are our options. I think this is a better option and let me help you get there,"" rather than saying they're dumb shits. I and my fellow council members strongly disagree with Mr. Salcido's statements and viewpoints. Frankly we denounce those statements. But Trinity College sociology professor and U.S. Army veteran Johnny Eric Williams said although Salcido's comments were delivered clumsily, the teacher shouldn't be formally punished for making them, calling the response troubling and overblown. Williams himself was the subject of a separate Internet outrage storm in June 2017, when a post on his personal Facebook page intended to criticize structural racism and white supremacy went viral after right-wing web sites interpreted it as racist toward white people. Williams, who is African-American, received death threats and told us that he continues to get them to this day. He added: The classroom is your social space where people can say things they wouldn’t say normally out of the classroom setting so they can seriously interrogate it. It sounds like he was trying to provoke the kids to think about why a student would wear a Marines shirt without thinking about what the Marines do. Clearly it didn’t come across well, but it’s a classroom setting. He’s not doing a major speech, he’s trying to get kids to think about what the role of the military is. It’s not simply to protect freedom, as they say generically. The question is, freedom to do what and whose freedoms? That’s the question that should be asked. Why would a kid record a teacher like that in the first place without him knowing? I think that’s a level of cowardice and of unwillingness to participate that is unfathomable to me. It was done with malice. All education is about integrating people into what it means to be an American. One of the most important things is to be someone who questions, who thinks critically and dissents. That’s the most patriotic thing someone can do. Williams told us that as a veteran, he found Salcido's comments about the intelligence of service members to be unfounded and an excellent example of intellectual elitism: What happens is the U.S. military is the last option for folks in rural and poverty-stricken areas. There’s no other opportunity for them. But the idea that these folks are not smart, I don’t agree with that at all. That’s how I got through college. I had to do it because I didn’t have money. That’s why you have a voluntary army, because these people have nothing else they can do. Then they go and die while the kids with money go to college and don’t even think about the fact that we’re in eternal war. Nevertheless, Williams cautioned that lacking the freedom to criticize the military is akin to fascism. He added: At this historical moment in time, people are more interested in how something is said, rather than what is said and what it means. Quinonez told local news station KTLA he recorded Salcido because he wants to join the Marine Corps and was tired of the teacher's negative commentary on the military. Pico Rivera is a thriving community with a growing economy, but it's no stranger to cut-throat politics and controversy — and neither is Salcido. However, much of the controversy in the city's past has been contained to the local level. In 2010, he ignited debate when he took the helm in the city's rotating mayoral position, then removed a Bible from the Council chamber's dais and put a halt to invocation, saying it was unconstitutional. He was also placed on administrative leave by the school district that year after admonishing a student to be quiet by saying, ""Shut up, Kelly, before I kill you."" Salcido said at the time the comment was purposefully over-the-top and intended in jest. The child's parent, Gerald Kelly, said he was angry because Salcido was talking about marriage equality for LGBTQ people, criticizing organized religion, and (again) speaking critically of the military in class: This is the mayor and he’s out here destroying these kids’ minds. Why allow him to lead this city when he stands for non-religious beliefs and that it’s OK to be against the Bible, [says it’s OK to be] homosexual and defames people in the military? Salcido has clashed with his peers on the city council in the past as well, often as their vocal critic amid allegations of public corruption . Although Salcido has faced widespread criticism for his remarks, he has historically been a popular teacher with students. Some of his current and former students have come to his defense, averring that the teacher also promised to fully support a student if he decided to join the military in spite of Salcido's discouragement. (This purported gesture of reassurance was not shown in the videos.) More generally, students have described Salcido as "" real ,"" "" inspiring "" and "" loved ."" One of Salcido's current students, a senior at El Rancho High School, spoke to us anonymously. (We have verified the student's identity.) That student described Salcido as a teacher who ""cares greatly about his students' success"" but deliberately provokes debate in his classes and encourages his students to have ""deep conversations."" The student also told us that Salcido ""sometimes has a very sarcastic sense of humor, and sometimes it may be taken the wrong way,"" but offered the opinion that the teacher was expressing his ""genuine beliefs"" in the video clips: Not a lot of teachers can keep their students captivated as much as he can. He really is one of a kind. He likes to get us thinking and he genuinely cares about what the students think... He's one of those guys that you would be happy to see every day and a person to always make you laugh. On 20 March 2018, the El Rancho Unified School District Board voted to terminate Salcido's employment as a teacher at El Rancho High School. As reported by the Whittier Daily News , Salcido has one month in which he can appeal the decision, during which time he will remain on unpaid leave.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1850
992eb658-0cd6-491d-af2f-f3528c34d660,"In mid-March 2018, readers began to ask whether it was true that Toys R Us locations had stopped accepting gift cards as a form of payment as of 11 March 2018: is it true toy retailer, Toys R Us is no longer accepting gift cards after 3/11/18? Many linked to a 10 March 2018 Scotsman.com article about a similar situation, but it focused on Toys R Us locations specifically in the United Kingdom: Toys R Us have said on their website: “Gift cards and vouchers will be honoured until Sunday, 11 March [2018]. There are no refunds for cash value on any gift cards. “But customers are encouraged to redeem such vouchers as soon as possible as stores may be subject to closure without notice.” News about UK-based locations proved confusing to some readers, and the gift card announcement coincided with matters related to Toys R Us' fiscal solvency in the United States. A post shared to shopping site SlickDeals in March 2018 posited that those in possession of Toys R Us gift cards ought to use them sooner rather than later: Multiple reports are out there that TRU is going into liquidation bankruptcy next week. If you have gift cards, they'll be trash the moment they announce, most likely. Use those cards this weekend if you don't want them to be worthless. Hold onto receipts if they manage to avoid liquidation, you can just return the items if you didn't have anything much you wanted right now. If not, at least you got something for your paper. Also remember to check your rewards total and use those points/certificates as well! The post referenced a 9 March 2018 CNNMoney article about the closure of UK-based Toys R Us locations, and the state of the retailer's finances in the United States. On 13 March 2018, CNBC cited reports of a liquidation plan in progress: Toys R Us, the iconic U.S. retailer, is in the process of drafting the court motion for its liquidation plan, a source familiar with the situation told CNBC on [13 March 2018]. The retailer could file as soon as the end of [14 March 2018], making the motion official. It will then begin to wind down the storied toy retailer, after more than half a century in business. A liquidation will most likely result in the closing of all of Toys R Us' 800 stores in the U.S. As of midday on 14 March 2018 the web site ToysRUs.com still accepted gift cards as payment, and the site offered customers the option of purchasing physical or virtual versions at checkout: Although articles speculated that Toys R Us gift cards might soon become worthless in the United States, and UK outlets have stopped accepting them, no definitive information about their future is yet available. In response to our inquiry, a representative for Toys R Us replied: Thanks for asking! Please know that we are not going out of business, but we are making changes to the number of stores we have. In the meantime, our stores are operating as usual and you can also continue to shop online at https://www.toysrus.com and https://www.babiesrus.com. Additionally, our customer registry, credit, warranty and loyalty programs will continue as normal. We will also continue to sell and accept gift cards as always. On 15 March 2018, a representative for Toys R Us said the chain planned to honor gift cards for a 30-day period. However, the Better Business Bureau advised consumers to use the cards ""sooner rather than later.""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,663
0c53ffb4-d4e4-4a85-a7ec-4afdbb24df26,"In September 2017, a purported quote from Hillary Clinton began spreading widely on Facebook in which the former Democratic presidential candidate appears to claim that women who voted for Donald Trump did so under pressure from the men around them: Women voted against me because they caved in to pressure from their husbands, fathers, boyfriends and male bosses. This is not, in fact, a direct quote from Clinton; it is instead an oversimplified version of something she said during an interview with National Public Radio that was published on 12 September 2017.  (The relevant portion of this interview, which can be heard here , starts at 3:10.) Interviewer Rachel Martin asks Clinton about whether she believes that sexism played a role in her defeat to Donald Trump, and if she thinks this might be because Clinton failed to inspire them. During her response to this question, Clinton recounts a conversation with Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg: ...Sheryl ended this really sobering conversation by saying that ""Women will have no empathy for you, because they will be under tremendous pressure — and I'm talking principally about white women — tremendous pressure from fathers and husbands and boyfriends and male employers not to vote for the girl."" NPR's audio of the interview skips to another question at this point, but the transcript continues with Clinton observing: And we saw a lot of that during the primaries from Sanders supporters, really quite vile attacks online against women who spoke out for me, as I say, one of my biggest support groups, Pantsuit Nation, literally had to become a private site because there was so much sexism directed their way. So I knew going in that this would be a hurdle for me. Earlier in the interview, Clinton noted: ""I didn't win the vote of white women."" The quote that spread widely on Facebook should not be attributed to Hillary Clinton, because she didn't say those exact words and was quoting someone else to begin with — and she pointedly did not use the word ""caved"". Neither did Clinton speak in such absolute terms about the dynamics at play among female voters or state that pressure from men was a motivating factor for all women who voted for Donald Trump, although she also did not offer any alternative explanations for why she lost among white women in particular. In March 2018, Clinton made similar comments during an event in India. Asked why 52 percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump, and not her in 2016, Clinton pointed out a historical pattern of decline in Democratic voting among white women. However, she also suggested once again that pressure from men was a motivating factor for some married white women in voting for Trump:, especially after former FBI Director James Comey made a bombshell announcement about the investigation into Clinton's private server, days before the election: (Relevant section of video starts at 40:00. ) Part of that [decline] is an identification with the Republican party, and a sort of ongoing pressure to vote the way that your husband, your boss, your son -- whoever -- believes you should. What happened in my election is I was on the way to winning white women until [James Comey] dropped that very ill-advised letter on October the 28th, and my numbers just went down... All of a sudden, white women who were going to vote for me and frankly standing up to the men in their lives and the men in their workplaces, were being told ""She's going to jail, you don't want to vote for her. That'd be terrible, you can't vote for that."" Once again, Clinton did not actually say that women ""caved in"" to pressure from men, and this time, she specifically framed her remarks around married white women, not all women, as well as offering historical context for the Democratic party's declining vote share among the white, female electorate.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,746
e13bf45a-7712-42d5-b2b2-76954b5bf5c7,"In March 2018, various right-wing blogs seized on a police encounter in Seattle to paint a state gun safety law as an example of ""Nazi-Style"" gun confiscations. The blog posts typically used language intended to evoke strong emotions: A man in Seattle has had his gun confiscated by police after breaking no laws. The police took his gun without a warrant and without pressing any charges. Tyranny has officially taken hold on American soil. This sets a precedent that government can now forcefully take guns away from an individual without a crime being committed or an arrest being made and without a warrant. In the name of fear and political exploitation of anti-gun rhetoric, a citizen’s Second Amendment rights have been ripped away from him by the government. On 2 March 2018, officers seized a 31-year-old man's handgun while serving him with an extreme risk protection order (often shortened to ERPO) requiring him to do so. Police said in a statement that the unidentified man had been the subject of ""multiple calls"" concerning his behavior. Before seizing his handgun, they said, the suspect had surrendered a shotgun to them in May 2017, after being served with an anti-harassment order. Police said he ""acknowledged he was experiencing 'stress' and did not want it around."" A spokesperson said: Due to his numerous contacts with police and escalating behavior, SPD's Crisis Response Squad filed for an Extreme Risk Protection Order, requiring the man to turn over all firearms. After the man failed to turn over his firearms or appear in court for a hearing on the order, police obtained a warrant and responded to the man's apartment in the 2200 block of 2nd Avenue just after 1 p.m. on March 1st and took him into custody. However, many of these blogs misrepresented the statement, claiming that no warrants and no arrests were involved and ignoring the man's failure to appear in court to address the protection order: A police spokesperson confirmed to us via email that the unidentified man had been reported for harassing people at a restaurant near his home, saying: The suspect in this case had been standing outside of the location while wearing a holstered pistol and threatening individuals exiting the premises, which in turn caused some people to be fearful that he might hurt them. This is a violation of law in Washinginton State. The man was taken into custody for his violation which ended in a warrant being issued by the judge for his arrest. According to state law: It shall be unlawful for any person to carry, exhibit, display, or draw any firearm, dagger, sword, knife or other cutting or stabbing instrument, club, or any other weapon apparently capable of producing bodily harm, in a manner, under circumstances, and at a time and place that either manifests an intent to intimidate another or that warrants alarm for the safety of other persons. According to the department spokesperson, the suspect -- who lives directly above the restaurant -- stood on a sidewalk in front of the business ""yelling obscenities and accusing them of 'talking to him through the floor.'"" He later called officers back to the scene, saying that he could hear ""taunting and voices"" emanating from the restaurant. While meeting with police, they said, he said that he wanted a restaurant employee ""arrested or shot."" He was detained and later taken to receive medical services. Sergeant Eric Pisconski, who heads the unit responsible for carrying out protection order-related seizures, said of the case: We attempted multiple times to get the individual to fulfill that order of turning over their firearms. And he refused multiple times. We were forced, at that point, to take the next step in the ERPO law which is petitioning for a search warrant to go in and enter their home and remove the firearms from them. The involuntary gun seizure was reportedly the first of its kind, though not the first seizure overall, to be done under the auspices of the risk order, which was created by Initiative 1491, a Washington state ballot measure that was approved by voters on 8 November 2016 and also called a "" red flag "" law. The law allows for orders to be filed against a firearm owner by police or family members if they feel that the firearm owner ""poses a significant danger of causing personal injury to self or others by having in his or her custody or control, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm."" The law, which went into effect in 2017, states that confiscations conducted as a result of the orders may last a year. Washington is one of five states with red flag laws. Around 24 other states — including Florida, where a mass shooting attack in February 2018 reignited the gun safety debate throughout the United States — are reportedly considering passing similar legislation. However, the American Civil Liberties Union has opposed such laws; its Rhode Island chapter said in an analysis released on 2 March 2018: The legislation allows a court to intervene in potentially major and intrusive ways on a person's liberty and property interests without any indication, much less suggestion, that the person has engaged in any criminal conduct – or even that he or she may do so imminently. In that regard, the bill places judges in the unenviable – indeed, impossible – position of trying to predict who may and may not become a mass murderer. Psychiatry and the medical sciences have not succeeded in this realm, and there is no basis for believing courts will do any better. The result will likely be a significant impact on the rights of many innocent individuals in the hope of preventing a tragedy.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1068
881356e2-9d31-4fe4-ac69-c206e0cb516b,"On 15 November 2017, several news organizations reported that President Donald Trump had reversed Obama-era conservation efforts involving the import of ivory from Zimbabwe and Zambia, sparking outrage among animal rights supporters.  CNN attributed the regulatory change to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service: US authorities will remove restrictions on importing African elephant trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia. That means Americans will soon be able to hunt the endangered big game, an activity that garnered worldwide attention when a Minnesota dentist took Cecil, perhaps the world's most famous lion, near a wildlife park in Zimbabwe. A US Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman said the move will allow the two African countries to include US sport hunting as part of their management plans for the elephants and allow them to put ""much-needed revenue back into conservation."" Critics, however, note the restrictions were created by the Obama administration in 2014 because the African elephant population had dropped. The animals are listed in the US Endangered Species Act, which requires the US government to protect endangered species in other countries. The 2014 restriction on importing elephant trophies included those that were hunted legally in Zimbabwe and Zambia.  However, a provision of the Endangered Species Act allows for restricted activities such as the import of animal trophies if they are undertaken ""to enhance the propagation or survival of the affected species."" In order to fulfill its obligations under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the United States restricts the number of legally-hunted elephant trophies to two per year. Safari Club International, a hunting advocacy group that filed a lawsuit challenging the 2014 restriction, first announced the regulation change on their web site. In November 2017, a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service confirmed the change to the 2914 regulations and explained the rationale behind it: Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve those species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that the hunting and management programs for African elephants in Zimbabwe and Zambia will enhance the survival of the species in the wild. These enhancement findings are required prior to allowing import of these trophies under Endangered Species Act regulations. The finding applies to elephants hunted in Zimbabwe on or after January 21, 2016, and on or before December 31, 2018, and to elephants hunted in Zambia during calendar years 2016, 2017 and 2018, for applications that meet all other applicable permitting requirements. On 17 November 2017, the Trump administration announced that it would place a "" hold "" on reversing the ban, pending further review, and a few days later President Trump tweeted about the issue: Big-game trophy decision will be announced next week but will be very hard pressed to change my mind that this horror show in any way helps conservation of Elephants or any other animal. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017 However, the President appeared to have been at odds with others in his administration over this issue, as NPR reported in March 2018: ""I didn't want elephants killed and stuffed and have the tusks brought back into this [country]. And people can talk all they want about preservation and all other things that they're saying,"" [Trump] told British broadcaster Piers Morgan , referring to the argument proffered by his own interior secretary, Ryan Zinke, and others that fees paid by big-game hunters could help fund conservation programs. ""In that case, the money was going to a government that was probably taking the money, OK?"" ""That was done by a very high-level government person,"" he added in reference to the agency's decision. ""As soon as I heard about it, I turned it around."" But Trump appears to have lost that battle in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which in December 2017 ruled in a case brought by the National Rifle Association and Safari Club International  that the Obama-era regulations had been improperly implemented Among other aspects, the two organizations challenged the Endangered Species Act [ESA] findings on which the regulation was based and argued that the Fish and Wildlife Service ""impermissibly relied on standards that are more stringent than the statutory requirements in the ESA."" That ruling already appears to have affected a number of other endangered species trophies. The Fish and Wildlife Service released a memo on 1 March 2018 in response to the ruling, withdrawing Endangered Species Act findings from various years for trophies of elephants from Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa, and Namibia; lions from Zimbabwe and South Africa; and bontebok in South Africa; and stating that applications would be considered on an individual basis: However, the Service intends to use the information cited in these findings and contained in its files as appropriate, in addition to the information it receives and has available when it receives each application, to evaluate individual permit applications. The Fish and Wildlife Service will now review permits on a case-by-case basis. The agency did not announce this change, however, and the memo only began receiving media attention when The Hill and other news outlets reported on it in March 2018.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,988
d0f2d421-84a6-427c-89ba-9cd0838b3b01,"In February 2018, a spate of blogs published posts pushing the idea that the Guaraní Aquifer in South America was in danger of being privatized by Coca-Cola and Nestle, with little in the way of evidence. Many of the posts cite a Brazilian blog, Correido do Brasil, which reported in 2016 that the companies were negotiating for control of the aquifer, a water reserve that spans about 460,000 square miles under the surface of Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Bolivia. According to that blog, a ""senior official"" at the Brazilian National Water Agency (in Portugese Agência Nacional de Águas or ANA) warned that talks between the government and the two firms were ""striding forward."" The article also mentioned Nestle chairman emeritus Peter Brabeck-Letmathe's heavily-criticized 2005 remarks about water privatization. But the article did not provide any information corroborating their anonymous source's allegation. We contacted both Coca-Cola and Nestle seeking comment, and each company denied the allegations. A spokesperson for Coca-Cola's Brazilian division said in statement: Coca-Cola is not negotiating with any government of any country the exploitation of the Guaraní Aquifer System. The Coca-Cola Company considers water as a precious resource for life and a universal right for the healthy development of ecosystems, communities, agriculture and commerce. Nestle's also sent a statement: We do not extract water from any part of the Guarani Aquifer in South America, including in Brazil. We have no plans to do so and neither are we discussing this matter with the Brazilian authorities. Suggestions to the contrary are incorrect. Wherever we bottle water, we conduct water resource studies and constantly monitor our withdrawals to ensure we do not negatively affect local watersheds and aquifers. We are fully committed to water stewardship and the human right to water. Meanwhile, both Correido do Brasil and the claims of corporate influence upon the aquifer have come under question from Brazilian journalists; the fact-checking site Boatos rated that claim false in both 2016 and 2018. According to Boatos, the claim also appeared an online petition in 2018 on the site Avaaz.org, asking readers to sign if they opposed the Brazilian government's concession of the aquifer to the two companies. A spokesperson for Avaaz told us in a phone interview that the petition was not generated by the organization, but was most likely created by an individual user on its platform. However, we were unable to locate the petition online in March 2018. The petition was removed, the spokesperson said, and both the person who created it and the users who signed it received a message stating that it was based on a debunked claim. Boatos also reported that after first debunking the claim the site received threats of a libel lawsuit (which never materialized), and that one of their reporters was threatened personally. Reached for comment via email, the site did not identify the party who made the threat, but called it ""an attempt to intimidate us."" Boatos also attributed the resurgence of the claim to the upcoming World Water Forum, which will be held in Brazil in March 2018. Another Brazilian fact-checking site, E-Farsas, debunked another iteration of the same claim in January 2017 . Natalia Viana, co-director of the non-profit journalism agency Agência Pública, which operates the fact-checking site Truco, described Correido do Brazil to us via email as ""an ultra-partisan website"" and pointed out that the site's 2016 article did not substantiate its claim. A fourth fact-checking outlet, UYCheck in Uruguay, told us by email that they had not seen any news stories -- fake or otherwise -- promoting claims related to the aquifer in their country. But according to Laura Zommer, executive director of the Argentinian fact-checking site Chequeado, confirmed to us via email that partisan web sites in her country had also picked up the debunked story.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,711
597d870e-36ab-4ca9-9c67-0de8ed79ae56,"On 6 December 2017, Breitbart added to their highly shareable series of articles that falsely claim to have found proof climatologists manipulate data to exaggerate the threat of global warming. Taking a break from their usual misreading of global temperature records, Breitbart this time dipped their toes into sea level records. The claim, like many others pushed by Breitbart author James Delingpole, was based on a research paper first highlighted by a post on a blog with a history of misrepresenting or manipulating data. The study itself was written by an ex-Fiat engineer with no formal training in sea level data publishing under an assumed name, someone who is infamous within the climate community for pushing a high volume of questionable studies in journals desperate for submissions. The study, which did not appear to have been copy edited, asserted that scientists had been arbitrarily adjusting historical tide gauge data to inflate estimates of sea level rise. As evidence, the study focused on the routine corrections scientists applied to a single record in Aden, Yemen. How Do Scientists Know Sea Levels are Rising? Scientists around the world have arrived at the consensus that sea levels have risen by about 1.7 millimeters on average per year since the 1900s, and that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Researchers arrived at this conclusion mostly by using tide gauge records, some of which go back as far as the 1700s. These records, created by simple instruments in harbors around the world that measure the height of sea level relative to a fixed point on land, provide scientists with the longest record of changing sea level based on human-made measurements. Marta Marcos, a sea-level researcher at the University of the Balearic Islands in Spain, told us by email that raw data from tide gauges comes with a number of natural challenges: Land sometimes rises or sinks for example, and the ocean’s currents and global mass distribution shift over time. Like many historical records, the data are subject to human or instrument errors and differ in quality, geographic coverage, and temporal range. Accounting for all these factors to get a global picture is the main focus of most contemporary sea-level research, Macros said. Philip Woodworth, a former director of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL), told us that one of the main challenges for scientists working with tide gauge records is inconsistencies in documentation -- like if a station moves to a new location or a harbor changes its measurement methods. The PSMSL, which is part of Britain's Natural Environment Research Council, is one of the primary organizations that works to compile sea level data from tide gauge records. Yet, all the methods scientist use to adjust the data generally agree on the same thing, according to the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment : that it is “very likely” that the sea level has been rising by about 1.7 mm per year globally from 1900-2010 -- a rate that is now accelerating. The paper Breitbart promotes attempts to cast doubt on both PSMSL and their large dataset , which includes over 2,000 stations around the world. As proof, it uses the adjustments made to a single one of these records in Yemen. Are Scientists Fabricating Data? In a paper (“Is the Sea Level Stable at Aden, Yemen?”) published in the second issue of a brand new journal Earth Systems and Environment , Albert Parker (an ex-Fiat engineer with no university affiliation), and Cliff Ollier (a retired geologist from the University of Western Australia and a member of an Australian climate skeptic organization ) claim without evidence that the corrections applied to one of the oldest tide gauge records in the Indian Ocean — a record from Aden, Yemen — were “arbitrary” and manufactured to exaggerate sea level rise. The authors’ main proof that this is the case? Their description of the raw data at Aden, Yemen (which doesn’t show dramatic rise in sea level) and that of the corrected data (which does show a rise in sea level) in a tone suggesting: “we caught you!” They then conclude that the adjustments to the Aden record were arbitrarily “composed to produce a high trend, high acceleration record.” (The data they describe are freely available on the PSMSL web site ). To prove their point, they created their own arbitrary correction to the raw data showing that it should actually show virtually no sea level rise. However, they provide no basis for their adjustments to the raw data -- they merely compare them to records from two other stations, without ever proving that these comparisons have merit. John Church, a sea level expert at Australia’s University of New South Wales and the lead author on the IPCC’s sea level rise chapter, described Parker and Ollier’s work this way: Parker and Ollier dismiss this work by PSMSL saying it is incorrect and arbitrary. However, they provide absolutely no information to support their allegations. Instead they make up their own adjustments to the sea level record so that the trend over the series is minimal. Parker and Ollier also never address the scientific rationale documented by scientists working with the Aden dataset. Oftentimes, these adjustments were based on interpretations of documentation from the Aden port and are checked against nearby records theoretically likely to present similar tide histories. They have been further supported by modern instrumentation installed at Aden in the mid 2000s . Woodworth told us the most recent adjustments to the Aden record were based on his work, and came from a reassessment of the Aden data’s documentation: It is not out of the question that, if new documentation becomes available or if there is new interpretation of the existing documentation, that sections of the record could be altered again. There is nothing sinister about that, one always tries to provide records that are as reliable as possible, and there is no conspiracy to make them look as if sea level is rising. Parker and Ollier could perhaps direct blame toward the PSMSL for not digitizing literally every bit of untranslated, raw Aden tide gauge data documentation. However, Parker and Ollier are categorically wrong when they suggest that scientists made these adjustments without rationale, as detailed in a formal response from PSMSL. Further, the two authors provide no credible evidence that their version of corrected data is superior to the PSMSL’s. Who Is Albert Parker and Why is Breitbart Quoting Him? Numerous scientists have alleged that Albert Parker is actually a former Fiat engineer named Alberto Boretti . Boretti, who listed an engineering Ph.D. on an archived faculty page , held a professorship at Australia’s now-defunct University of Ballarat and he appears to have started using the name Parker professionally sometime around 2012 when he took on a teaching role at Australia’s RMIT University. In a press release about his then-affiliation with their “Green Engines Research Facility,” RMIT described him as an “engine technology expert.” According to Woodworth (who also echoed claims that Parker and Boretti are the same person), Parker is “a prolific author of unreadable papers,” which he publishes in journals desperate for submissions. This paper certainly fits that profile, as it was published in the second issue of Earth Systems and Environment . Not overloaded with submissions by any stretch, the journal accepted a second Parker and Ollier study in that same issue . Under the name Albert Parker, he served as a reviewer for the sea level chapter of the IPCC’s most recent climate assessment report. His primary contribution as a reviewer was to suggest that eight Alberto Boretti papers and four Albert Parker papers should have been mentioned. The final draft of the IPCC chapter devotes a paragraph to these works, largely dismissing them as lacking merit. Church, who was the lead author of that chapter told us: The hurdle for being an IPCC reviewer is set very low and yes [Parker] was a reviewer. We had to respond to his comments, which included that we had not previously referred to his long list of papers. You can look up his comments and our responses on the IPCC web site – everything is [...] open for inspection. Scientists have publicly criticized the scientific conclusions of his papers for being nonsensical and inaccurate. Responding to a 2013 Parker paper, oceanographer John Hunter described his analysis as “collection of the authors' personal views masquerading as a comment.” We reached out to Parker to confirm his academic background. Outside of telling us he had a Ph.D. and master’s in engineering, Parker/Boretti ignored our multiple requests for clarification about where he got his degrees and what professorships he has held. His co-author, Ollier, also refused to tell us anything about Parker’s background outside of his being an engineer. How, then, could so many red flags have been ignored by Breitbart’s James Delingpole? Because, as he explained in an October 2017 open letter, he does not read the papers he reports on and instead blindly trusts the analysis of a skeptic blog called the No Tricks Zone. That blog searches for papers that sound like they challenge the consensus on global warming (whether or not they actually do). “Life’s too short” to spend any more time than he has to on his climate stories, he wrote.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1754
639aa3d9-a785-4ad2-836e-a2ff5577d73a,"On 21 February 2018, a week after a gunman killed seventeen people during a mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, a survivor of the attack accused CNN of trying to dictate what he should say during a town hall the event hosted to address gun safety arguments in the wake of the massacre. Following the broadcast on 21 February 2018, Colton Haab, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, told local news station WPLG-TV: CNN had originally asked me to write a speech and questions and it ended up being all scripted. Haab, a member of the school's junior ROTC program who protected some of his fellow students during the assault by using Kevlar marksmanship sheets, was shown on camera with questions he said he had written prior to the event. He said: I expected to be able to ask my questions and give my opinion on my questions. According to WPLG, Haab wanted to suggest that military veterans be employed as school security guards. But because CNN wanted him to ask ""scripted"" questions, he said, he opted not to appear. In a separate appearance on Fox News on 17 February 2018, Haab said that teachers who are willing to carry their firearm on campus and had received appropriate training would also make schools safer. President Donald Trump also called for more schoolteachers to be armed during a televised meeting with survivors of the Parkland attack, when a gunman killed seventeen people. The network responded to Haab's allegations on 22 February 2018 in a statement posted on its communication team's Twitter account: There is absolutely no truth to this. CNN did not provide or script questions for anyone in last night's town hall, nor have we ever. After seeing an interview with Colton Haab, we invited him to participate in our town hall along with other students and administrators from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Colton's father withdrew his name from participation before the forum began, which we regretted but respected. We welcome Colton to join us on CNN today to discuss his views on school safety. Haab reiterated his account in another Fox News interview on 22 February 2018. He said that a CNN producer first asked him to write a speech for the event, then asked him to submit questions. However, he said, the producer later asked him to ask one question (which appears around the two-minute mark): What they had actually done is wrote out a question for me 'cause in my interview with CNN I talked about arming the teachers— if they were willing to arm [themselves] to carry on campus. She had taken that of what I had briefed on and actually wrote that question out for me. CNN responded again on Twitter, saying: There is absolutely no truth to this story — and we can prove that. CNN did not provide or script questions for anyone in last night's town hall, nor have we ever. Those are the facts. While a number of Douglas High students have advocated for tighter gun safety laws in the wake of the shooting — and been accused of being "" crisis actors "" since doing so — Haab is, to date, the only student to accuse CNN of trying to script their statements at the town hall event. On the afternoon of 23 February 2018, CNN released its e-mail exchange between the network, Colton Haab, and his father, Glenn Haab, along with the following statement: The Stand Up: The Students of Stoneman Douglas Demand Action Town Hall was intended to be a forum for students, parents and teachers to speak directly to the elected leaders and stakeholders that are at the center of this critical issue. It is unfortunate that an effort to discredit CNN and the town hall with doctored emails has taken any attention away from the purpose of the event. However, when presented with doctored email exchanges, we felt the need to set the record straight. In the exchange, Glenn Haab had presented the network with several pages of ""background points"" that he wished his son to recite before asking a question of Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Florida): Opening statement: page 1 Ladies & gentlemen, lawmakers, fellow students, parents, teachers, faculty – last Wednesday will change our lives forever. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families of this horrific attack on our school. To me, it’s totally incomprehensible how this attacker was able to exit an Uber ride, walk into our freshman building and start shooting. There’s been a lot of talk about Gun Control since this senseless attack. Many of my peers are in Tallahassee with lawmakers now – unfortunately yesterday did not go in the right direction for us. I hope the much needed changes to Gun Laws can be made and implemented by the time the next generation (my kids) enters high school. The way I see it- 3 main things have to happen: 1) Tighten up gun laws 2) Secure the school and make it safe 3) Defend the school I BASED MY QUESTIONS TONIGHT ON #2 & # 3 Question 1) The Number One responsibility of the Federal Government is: To keep Americans safe & secure. We will be called back to school next week … How do we come back if Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School is not safe? Many of us students are afraid to go back until this school is safe & secure. Only 1 School Resource Officer cannot secure a 45 acre campus with multiple entry and exist points. So my 1st question is: What is being done to drastically improve the security of the school? Question 2) page 2 There are armed security defending our President, Congressmen, court houses, IRS buildings, banks, jewelry stores, even the Smithsonian has guards with guns. Yet a gunman walked into our school’s freshman building with a rifle… and hero’s like Coach Fies ….unarmed… died trying to stop him. This is totally unacceptable. Schools are defended with a sign that reads: This is a gun free zone/it might as well also say: (Call someone with a gun if there’s an emergency). It is my opinion and the opinion of many – that this makes us an easy target for evil people to do their evil with little, if any resistance. I personally would much rather see a sign that read: “Please be aware that certain staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas are legally armed and may use whatever force necessary to protect our students”. We students should not have to beg to be kept safe. I ask you: are our students’ lives not as significant as court documents? As tax returns? As cash money? As a diamond ring or a fine watch? ARE our lives, our security & safety not as important as old dinosaur bones? My 2nd question is: What measures are being taken to defend our school from future attacks? And how can we get select faculty trained and armed to give them a fighting chance, if GOD forbid, there is another attack? Question 3) page 3 There are over 450,000 unemployed Veterans living in the United States. Many are able, willing & trainable and would find a real purpose in the job of keep our schools safe and defend our students & faculty against evil. What steps can be taken to utilize our select retired military in this capacity? Closing Statement: page 4 President Trump, Governor Scott, Senators Nelson, Rubio and Deutch, Sherriff Israel, Superintendent Runcie, Principle Thompson – I urge you, the student body urges you, our parents urge you: to secure our school. We cannot wait for legislative Gun Law Changes to be approved and implemented. We are going to be called back to school next week. We need Action Now! We have attended way too many funerals this week. We need to make MSD SAFE Now! Secure all Broward schools, secure all Florida Schools and secure all schools across this Nation. The Number One responsibility of the Federal Government is: To keep Americans safe & secure. We students should not have to beg to be kept safe. Please secure our school from outside threats from evil people and give the right people the training & tools needed to defend our lives. It’s time for a change! Don’t let the 17 lives lost last week be just another statistic. Is time to make MSD SAFE! MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN # MSD STRONG Thank you! In response, the producer wrote: Hi Glenn. That really is way too long. These are quick questions so that we can get to as many people as possible. This is what Colton and I discussed on the phone that he submitted. He needs to stick to this. Senator Nelson, if Coach Feis had had his firearm in school that day, I believe that he could have most likely stopped the threat. Have we thought about having a class for teachers who are willing to be armed trained to carry on campus? According to CNN, the elder Haab declined the invitation after the network rejected the full speech. He later reportedly admitted to inadvertently ""omitting some words from the email.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1742
a4eb5dd2-67e2-4a0f-8342-9f657b3e2a72,"One aspect of President Donald Trump's proposed federal budget for the 2018 fiscal year has come under criticism for its potential effect on low-income seniors, particularly during winter months in colder parts of the U.S. The president's proposed budget eliminated funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which assists people who need help paying their energy bills. According to a ""budget blueprint"" released by the Office of Budget and Management (OMB): Compared to other income support programs that serve similar populations, LIHEAP is a lower-impact program and is unable to demonstrate strong performance outcomes. During the 2016-17 fiscal year, LIHEAP reportedly distributed $3.4 billion in aid to around 6 million households. Lawmakers in cold-weather states have consistently opposed cuts. On 15 February 2017—before Trump's administration first announced its proposed budget—Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Sen. Jack Reed (D-Rhode Island) were part of a bipartisan group of 45 senators who sent a letter to both the president and OMB calling for ""robust funding"" for the program in 2016. They said: More than 90 percent of LIHEAP recipients have at least one household member who is a child, elderly, or disabled, and the percentage of households with at least one veteran has grown to 20 percent. The program helps to ensure that eligible recipients do not have to choose between paying their energy bills and affording other necessities like food and medicine. Following the release of the proposal in May 2017, independent Maine Sen. Angus King—a member of the Senate Budget Committee—said in a statement: Many of the reductions proposed in this budget – from the cuts to Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program to LIHEAP – will hammer thousands of people across Maine, including older, disabled, and lower-income people. Hard working Maine people who pay taxes expect a government that works for them, but they are the ones who will suffer when the tax cuts proposed in this budget directly benefit those who need it least. Trump's proposal was rejected by both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, each of which allocated $3.39 billion toward LIHEAP for fiscal year 2018, consistent with the initiative's funding for the previous fiscal year. On 8 September 2017, the president signed House Resolution 601 into law, enabling the release of $3.03 billion in LIHEAP funding, good for 90 percent of what both committees allocated. A Senate aide confirmed to us that the release of that money will allow the program to run into calendar year 2018. However, the Trump administration's proposed budget for fiscal year 2019 once again calls for LIHEAP to be scuttled.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,491
d81a6988-e17e-4ebe-a31f-183029d81357,"On 16 November 2017, under the leadership of House Speaker Paul Ryan, the United States House of Representatives passed their version of what would later become the sweeping GOP tax reform bill of 2017. Thirteen days later, Charles and Elizabeth Koch donated $247,000 apiece to Paul Ryan’s fundraising campaign, ""Team Ryan,"" according to filings published by investigative journalism outfit ProPublica. ""Team Ryan"" is not a single campaign fund but rather a joint-fundraising committee that raises money for Paul Ryan’s re-election fund (Ryan for Congress), the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and Paul Ryan's leadership PAC named Prosperity Action. Because of that factor, it is important to be precise about where money given to ""Team Ryan"" is actually going. Columbia Law School professor and government ethics expert Richard Briffault told us that only a portion of those donations would benefit Ryan directly, making the contributions ""less a reward for Ryan personally"" and more of a win for House Republicans generally: Most of the money cannot have gone to Ryan's campaign committee — the most that committee could legally receive is $10,800 — $5400 from each of the husband and wife Kochs. Each could also give $237,000 (or $474,000 for the two of them) — the maximum allowable — to the NRCC — the Congressional Campaign arm of the Republican party, presumably to be used in races other than, or in addition to, Ryan's own. The remainder appears to have gone to Prosperity Action, Ryan's Leadership PAC — probably $5000 from each of them. The Leadership PAC can only give to other candidates. The Koch donations have raised eyebrows, given the financial benefit that the Kochs and their business ventures would seemingly enjoy under the new tax plan. Adam Smith, communications director at campaign finance reform nonprofit Every Voice, told the International Business Times (IBT) that: Republicans never hid the fact that this tax bill was about pleasing their big donors. And it looks like House Speaker [Paul] Ryan is quickly being rewarded for passing this legislation that overwhelmingly benefits the Kochs and billionaires like them. Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, co-director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, and a Professor of Law at the University of Minnesota Law School, concurs. He told us via e-mail that this seemed ""pretty close to an illegal gratuity ,"" which in this case would be a payment as thanks for an official action, a lesser but related offense to bribery, according to the Department of Justice . Casting aside the massive grey area within the interpretation of laws pertaining to political fundraising, we note it is equally important to point out that the Kochs were far from the only ones to participate in similar political giving activity. Six other $100,000 donations were made to Team Ryan after the passage of the bill, according to the IBT: [The Koch] donations were by far the largest sums added to Ryan’s coffers in the fourth quarter of 2017, but they were by no means the only major contributions: Marlene Ricketts, the wife of billionaire TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts, donated $100,000, as did five other individuals. When we asked Professor Briffault whether these donations were something to get worked up about or simply ""politics as usual,"" he told us that he rejected the premise of the question, suggesting instead that it could be both: ""I am tempted to suggest that you've made a false opposition — that this is both something to get worked up about and politics as usual,"" he wrote.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,692

But while it's true that at least one member of the group received one, it is unclear how many constituents at large have as well. A spokesperson for Cotton's office, Caroline Rabbitt Tabler, confirmed the existence of the letters, saying that they were issued ""under extreme circumstances."" She also said that it was rare to send any constituent such a letter. There has been no confirmed tally of how many times it has happened. The letters began getting attention when the liberal group Ozark Indivisible posted a picture of one on Twitter on 17 January 2018, along with a message taunting the senator: #TraitorTommy @TomCottonAR scared of his constituents calling so he's sending out cease and desist letters.

All other contact will be deemed harassment and will be reported to the United States Capitol Police. The letters themselves, however, are not recent; the one posted by Ozark Indivisible was dated 17 October 2017. A Fayetteville resident, Stacey Lane, identified herself as the recipient of the letter posted online. Rabbitt Tabler said Cotton's office did not accuse her of saying anything threatening but did not go into detail on why it sent her the letter. Ozark Indivisible confirmed to us on 19 January 2018 that Lane is a member of their organization. They also disputed reports that Lane threatened anyone or called a staffer a ""cunt."" The group added: There have been others who have received the letters, but they do not want to come forward. They are not OI members. According to reports, ""an unspecified number of individuals"" received letters that month. Rabbitt Tabler said in a statement that they are ""only used under extreme circumstances"": Senator Cotton is always happy to hear from Arkansans and encourages everyone to contact his offices to express their thoughts, concerns, and opinions. In order to maintain a safe work environment, if an employee of Senator Cotton receives repeated communications that are harassing and vulgar, or any communication that contains a threat, our policy is to notify the U.S. Capitol Police's Threat Assessment Section and, in accordance with their guidance, send a cease and desist letter to the individual making the harassing or threatening communication. Another person, who did not identify themselves, told the Arkansas Times that they received a similar letter. They said: I believe if Tom Cotton's office were to respond as to why they sent this letter, I think they just honestly don't want to listen to any citizen's opposing view or hear the numerous grave concerns U.S. citizens have about the serious & ongoing attack on our Democracy and past election cycle in which a foreign, hostile Russian government interfered, they don't want U.S. citizens to call and speak their mind and truth in a very direct manner and they obviously don't want to be held accountable for their words and actions while serving all the people in this nation. I may have used unprofessional and unbecoming language at times as the anxiety and stress of what I'm witnessing is at times too great a burden to control and I have vehemently expressed my righteous anger at Senator Cotton's complicitness with this harmful regime. Cotton, whose current term in office runs through 2020, has come under criticism from his constituents in the past.

The government's statement was circulated both through both through Botswana's non-""verified"" Twitter account and via their Facebook page, which is directly linked to the country's official web site : PRESS RELEASE |Botswana condemns remarks made by President Trump @VensonMoitoi @MIACBW @OfficialMasisi pic.twitter.com/16i7CUMR4x — Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) January 12, 2018 Botswana officials noted that they had ""summoned"" U.S. Ambassador Earl R. Miller regarding the  statements that President Trump had made during a meeting with lawmakers a day earlier, during which the chief executive allegedly exclaimed: ""What do we want Haitians here for? Why do we want all these people from Africa here? Why do we want all these people from shithole countries?"" The statement from Botswana said (in part): The Botswana Government has also enquired from the US Government through the Ambassador, to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a ""shithole"" country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US, and also that some of Botswana may wish to visit the US. The Government of Botswana is wondering why President Trump, must use this descriptor and derogatory word, when talking about countries with whom the US has had cordial and mutually beneficial bilateral relations for so many years. * Officials in Ghana, Haiti, Senegal, and South Africa have also reportedly called for meetings with U.S. diplomats because of the alleged comment. In a separate statement, the African Union, which represents all 55 countries on the continent, also condemned the reported remark and called for both a retraction and ""an apology not only to the Africans but to all people of African descent around the globe."" Trump, who opened his presidential campaign in 2015 by calling some Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and ""criminals,"" reportedly made the remark during a meeting concerning a deal that would allow for increased security along the U.S.-Mexico border, while also allowing for the continuation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Around 700,000 people are currently enrolled in the DACA program, which allows enrollees to live and work in the U.S. for two-year periods. A federal judge ruled on 9 January 2018 that the Trump administration must accept renewal applications from enrollees. The president later said of his controversial remarks on Twitter that ""The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made — a big setback for DACA!""  He also specifically denied saying anything insulting about Haiti : Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said ""take them out."" Made up by Dems. I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians. Probably should record future meetings — unfortunately, no trust! Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) has corroborated the reports concerning Trump's alleged remarks, saying that he was at the meeting along with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), who also objected to them.

aed1ce48-278f-4a70-b8d7-d4a5a511d0af,"On 24 December 2017, the New York Times reported that the Trump administration was scaling back an Obama-era policy that ramped up the use of fines on skilled nursing facilities for actions that endangered vulnerable patients: The Trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury, part of a broader relaxation of regulations under the president. The shift in the Medicare program’s penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. The American Health Care Association, the industry’s main trade group, has complained that under President Barack Obama, federal inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve. As would be expected, the Times report (which was published on Christmas Eve) resulted in a number of aggregated stories crafted to play up the outrage angle with sensational headlines reporting, essentially, that the president was going to kill Grandma on Christmas. Over-the-top wording as in this headline, ""Trump Will Permit Abuse Of Elderly In Nursing Homes,"" prompted readers to inquire whether the story was true. Elder abuse is a crime , and that has not changed. However, the Trump administration did begin the process of rolling back an Obama administration policy that uses hefty fines as leverage against facilities that cause serious harm to patients. The Trump administration issued two Notices of Proposed Rule-Making (NPRMs) in May and June of 2017 which will reverse rules requiring the presence of a designated facility grievance officer to handle allegations of wrongdoing, and prohibiting nursing homes from requiring patients to sign pre-dispute arbitration agreements as a condition of admission. These changes do not mean that rampant, unchecked abuse will be allowed to take place, as some headlines have suggested however. In November 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also issued a moratorium on a requirement that nursing homes develop a baseline care plan for new patients within 48 hours of admission, along with seven other requirements on things like behavioral health care, psychotropic medication and facility assessments. The effects of the rollbacks are not yet known, but Toby Edelman, senior attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy, told the Times , ""They’ve pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak."" According to federal records reviewed by the Times , four in every ten nursing homes have been cited at least once since 2013 for a serious violations such as neglect, mistreatment and failing to protect residents from accidents and bed sores. CMS put an 18-month moratorium on a requirement that nursing homes develop a basic care plan for new patients within 48 hours. This rule was put in place after the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found in a study published in 2014 that one in five Medicare patients experienced medical complications within an average 15 days of admission to nursing facilities, most of which were serious, preventable and resulted in millions in additional medical expenses billed to Medicare. However in a memo to state health departments, CMS noted that the moratorium does not mean violation of requirements will result in no enforcement. Requirements that fall under the purview of the moratorium, like the baseline care plan, will simply be handled differently until the end of the moratorium period. In a statement, Center for Medicare Advocacy policy attorney Dara Valanejad told us: The Center for Medicare Advocacy is greatly concerned by the Administration's actions rolling back the minimum standards of care set out in the Medicare and Medicaid Requirements of Participation. CMS should be protecting the rights of residents, who should be its primary focus, not referring to the nursing home industry as its “ customer .” The minimum nursing home standards were implemented because there was an unmet need for urgent resident protections. For example, the HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) reported in 2014 that one in five residents experienced harm within the first month of admission (the average was 15.5 days) to a skilled nursing facility, 20 percent of these cases resulted in life-sustaining interventions or death, and 59 percent of these adverse events were “clearly or likely preventable.” The Baseline Care Plan, one of the Phase 2 Requirements that CMS placed an 18-month moratorium on, requires nursing homes to develop a basic care plan within 48 hours to address the type of problems that the OIG found. How can nursing home residents and their families feel safe knowing that such vital requirements, meant to protect them from harm, injury, or death, will not be properly enforced? Per the Times report, the American Health Care Association sent a letter to then-President Elect Trump in December 2016 asking for ""relief"" from regulations and complained to CMS: Rather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn’t increase the quality of care they provide.

bd8d05f5-f17f-47aa-bb4d-f0f66e22e224,"In the waning hours of 2017, Business Insider published a terrifying headline for sweets lovers: “Chocolate is on track to go extinct in 40 years.” That claim was repeated uncritically around the internet as the story gained viral strength, capping a year of difficult news. Contrary to its click-ready headline, however, the primary focus of article concerned a joint effort by scientists with the UC Berkeley Innovative Genomics Institute and the Mars candy company to create a genetically modified form of cacao (the plant used in chocolate production) resistant to the future effects of climate change and habitat loss. The motivation for such an effort, which remains largely theoretical , rests on sound (but not  new) research highlighting the likely negative effects of climate change on the world’s major cocoa producing countries. As an introduction to their article, the first item on Business Insider’s three point summary stated ""Cacao plants are slated to disappear by as early as 2050 thanks to warmer temperatures and dryer weather conditions."" That sentence, which was the primary reason for the story’s viral success, was a wholly inaccurate representation of both the article it topped and the research concerning climate change and cocoa production it purported to rest on. The body of the actual story presented a slightly less apocalyptic description of the situation: Over half of the world's chocolate now comes from just two countries in West Africa — Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. But those areas won't be suitable for chocolate in the next few decades. By 2050, rising temperatures will push today's chocolate-growing regions more than 1,000 feet uphill into mountainous terrain — much of which is currently preserved for wildlife, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That information came from the 2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability report, which concluded (Table 9-5, pg. 627) that under a “business as usual” scenario of future carbon emissions, Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire would experience a 2.1ºC increase in temperature and no change in rainfall, resulting in a “considerable reduction in [suitable growing] area” for cocoa production in Ghana and an “almost total elimination [of suitable growing area] in Ivory Coast.” Biological extinction, as implied by the headline this information was packaged under, refers to the complete and total removal of a species from the planet -- a far cry from a “considerable reduction in area” reported by the IPCC. Ingrid Parker, a professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at UC Santa Cruz, told us that while climate change may make it harder to grow cocoa in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, other countries are capable of growing the crop as well: ""Cacao [cocoa] is grown in other places, like Australia, and it’s not even native to Africa (it comes from the New World)."" While climate change presents a credible threat to future cocoa production and to the economies of the countries that grow it, that story was lost in an effort to lure worried chocolate lovers to click on a link. The question is not whether or not chocolate will be around in 2058 (it will be around), the question is how much will it cost future generations to buy it and whether genetic modification can play a role in its future production.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,634
2209f6db-6b06-4324-b94a-2e6f7de186f7,"Under current United States tax law, every flight sold by an “aircraft management company” to a passenger comes with a two-part tax on that passenger: a fee that is 7.5 percent of the value of the flight, as well as a flat dollar amount for each individual segment of a domestic flight. As written, there's a lack of clarity surrounding the question of whether the companies that maintain and staff private jets on behalf of a plane's private owner can be counted as an aircraft management company. If so, there's also the question of whether they would be required to tax their owner-passengers under this regulation. In March 2012, the IRS released a memo arguing that the rule does indeed apply in cases in which a company managing a plane for a private owner. This had the result of making such aircraft management companies potentially liable for years of back-taxes that would have been — but were not — levied on their passengers and/or aircraft owners. After significant lobbying, the IRS froze efforts to collect such taxes until after completing a review of the policy. In July 2017, the IRS announced that it would be shelving all pending audits relating to these “ticket taxes” on private aircraft management companies. As of its final markup by the Senate Committee on Finance, released on 15 November 2017, the Senate GOP-sponsored tax reform bill includes a provision that formalizes the IRS policy (it is not in the recently passed House version) of not applying this ticket tax to aircraft management companies servicing private jets: The proposal exempts certain payments related to the management of private aircraft from the excise taxes imposed on taxable transportation by air. Exempt payments are those amounts paid by an aircraft owner for management services related to maintenance and support of the owner’s aircraft or flights on the owner’s aircraft. This provision was included in the final version of the Senate Bill passed on 1 December 2017. The Senate's version of the law would have the effect of making explicit the de facto policy that transportation via private jet is not subject to the same taxes that passengers on commercial airlines incur. Critics of the bill suggest that, because the United States air traffic services are funded from these taxes, the non-private-jet-owning American public ends up essentially subsidizing the cost of air travel for the ultra-wealthy. As reported by Bloomberg in September 2017: On a per flight basis, a private jet could generate as little as two percent of the taxes and fees paid by airline passengers on an identical route, Bloomberg found in its review. High-performance private planes make up about 10 percent of U.S. flights under air-traffic control, yet pay less than 1 percent into a trust fund that finances air-traffic control and other Federal Aviation Administration operations, an agency study found this year. Supporters of the bill, which include Ohio Democrat senator and co-sponsor of legislation that inspired this measure Sherrod Brown, argue that it merely provides certainty to private aviation industry, which has acted without formal guidance for years. In a statement lauding the proposal, National Air Transportation Association President Martin H. Hiller said: Tax reform legislation has a long way to go, but this is an important step and small aviation businesses are appreciative of the inclusion of this provision, which provides them the tax certainty they have long sought. Because this provision is not literally a tax cut or deduction explicitly given to private-jet owners, but because it has the effect of reducing the tax burden of private-jet passengers relative to the commercial airline flying public, we rank the claim of a private jet tax cut in the senate GOP tax bill as mostly true. We note, however, that the bill in effect does nothing but codify a status quo.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,698

The Bluemont, Virginia resident was convicted in May on misdemeanor charges of disorderly conduct and parading or demonstrating on capitol grounds stemming from the incident, but the verdict was overturned by a Superior Court judge on the grounds that laughter alone wasn't sufficient cause for conviction. She was to have been re-tried on 13 November. The January 2017 arrest wasn't the first for the longtime Code Pink member, who was jailed for disorderly conduct and assaulting a police officer in October 2007 after covering her hands with fake blood and disrupting a Congressional hearing attended by then-U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, among other incidents.

58e41902-f536-4787-a312-421d53a3ae7b,"In August 2017 , rumors began to spread on social media that anti-fascists (a name often shortened to ""antifa"", which has become shorthand for a subset of protestors, usually clad in black and accessorized with bandannas and who are evidently unnerving bloggers and vloggers enough to be the pet topic of many an angry online rant) were planning extended unrest, riots, killing random citizens, or outright civil war beginning on 4 November 2017: Depending on the source, ""antifa"" (always treated as though it is one homogenous, unified group) is purportedly planning extended riots, joint violence alongside Black Lives Matter and the Black Panthers, or a coup of the American government. The rumors seem to have originated from a video originally published on 30 August 2017 by an individual named Jordan Peltz. Peltz was widely (and incorrectly) identified as a ""U.S. Marshal"" in the video, which shows him wearing what looked like an official badge that is actually simply printed on his shirt. However, he is not actually law enforcement or military — Peltz instead evidently works as some combination of bail bondsman and bounty hunter. (Claiming to be a United States marshal is very popular among the sovereign citizen set; those involved claim to answer only to their interpretation of common law and maintain they are not subject to other legal conventions, including getting driver's licenses and paying taxes . Local, state, and federal governments tend to disagree.) On Instagram , Peltz describes his work as ""#fugitiverecovery"" and ""#warrantservice"": Peltz published a video to ""clear the air"" on 27 September 2017 after reporter JJ MacNab , whose beat includes anti-government and sovereign citizen groups, wrote a thread on Twitter about how militia groups are being goaded into taking up arms against anti-fascists: Peltz responded by stating that his video, which gave an impression he was either predicting or calling for a November 2017 civil war, had been edited — although he didn't specify when, by whom, or why, despite millions of views and thousands of comments, he had remained unaware it had been altered until he saw reports: Finding out my video meant for me and few friends had been taken and edited.

Far-left militants plan to “gather in the streets and public squares of cities and towns across this country” in the hope of building momentum for civil unrest that leads to nothing less than domestic regime change. “Our protest must grow day after day and night after night—thousands becoming hundreds of thousands, and then millions—determined to act to put a stop to the grave danger that the Trump/Pence Regime poses to the world by demanding that this whole regime be removed from power,” states a call to action on the RefuseFascism website. A longer screed posted on the Revolutionary Communist website makes it clear that Antifa is not prepared to wait for electoral change from Democrats, and will engage in a “ferocious struggle,” based on plans outlined in a book written by Bob Avakian, the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party, which is called The Coming Civil War. The page also cited ""antifa"" web sites, neither of which threatened violence. One provided a list of Facebook events, and the other read in its entirety : ON NOVEMBER 4, 2017: We will gather in the streets and public squares of cities and towns across this country, at first many thousands declaring that this whole regime is illegitimate and that we will not stop until our single demand is met: This Nightmare Must End: the Trump/Pence Regime Must Go!

Weekly reported on both the freeway protest and upcoming events: Their placards bore letters that spelled out ""NOV 4 IT BEGINS."" But they couldn't get enough volunteers to hold all 12 letters, so the tallest among them, the ones with the broadest wingspans, held up two letters each. The eight people weren't enough to block the on-ramp, so some motorists were able to swerve around. [Organizer and USC film professor Perry] Hoberman says the protest was conceived in part to get the word out about a Nov. 4 demonstration the group is planning. He says it's being modeled on the Women's March held in January at Pershing Square and that organizers hope the action will include an encampment in a public place, à la Occupy Wall Street, or at least a prolonged series of protests over several days. At one point on Tuesday they knelt on the freeway, which organizer Michelle Xai says was to acknowledge ""black and Latino people who have been and continue to be murdered by police."" A video of the protest uploaded to the group's Facebook page has more than 700,000 views. Many of the 24,000-plus commenters ask for more information about Nov. 4. Plenty of others object to the group's inconveniencing motorists, and some appear to endorse running them over. It is true that some groups linked to the antifa movement planned co-ordinated protests on 4 November 2017, but that had nothing to do with Peltz's video expressing disdain for the group in August 2017, nor did he appear to have any insider law enforcement knowledge, as he does not work as law enforcement himself. When a wave of rumors about 4 November anti-fascist protests began, his clip became part of the claim as ""evidence"" that a ""federal officer"" warned of coming violence. In reality, a list of apparently peaceful protests were paired with an older, unrelated video to create the impression of a looming threat. Peltz himself walked the claims far back after his video brought him unwanted attention and scrutiny.

dfbb1d41-e3f6-4a04-92ee-23b3880a31fd,"On 1 November 2016, the liberal blog Occupy Democrats posted a story headlined, ""FBI Just Announced It’s Looking Into the Trump Campaign’s Ties to Russia"" that made it appear as if a criminal case against Donald Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, were imminent: It’s official. NBC is now reporting that Donald Trump’s campaign management has fallen under the scrutiny of an FBI inquiry, which is sure to blossom into a formal criminal investigation centered on Trump’s disgraced ex-manager Paul Manafort’s stewardship of the Republican campaign and his close ties to Ukraine. When he departed, Manafort was facing felony charges, and now the FBI’s suspicions have been confirmed by the evidence. New York Times found Ukrainian documents which outlined $12.7 million in previously unreported payments from a Ukrainian political party to Manafort, precipitating his departure from the campaign. In August 2016, the New York Times published a report that a secret ledger had been unearthed in Ukraine showing $12.7 million in payments designated from Viktor Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party to Manafort between 2007 and 2012. When the story was published, anti-corruption officials in Ukraine told the paper that they had not yet determined whether Manafort had actually received the money. The Occupy Democrats story was based on a later 1 November 2016 NBC report : The FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort's foreign business connections, law enforcement and intelligence sources told NBC News. Word of the inquiry, which has not blossomed into a full-blown criminal investigation, comes just days after FBI Director James Comey's disclosure that his agency is examining a new batch of emails connected to an aide to Hillary Clinton. While an unnamed source apparently spoke to NBC, the FBI at that time had not not announced an inquiry into Manafort's activities — the Bureau, generally, does not officially confirm whether or not they are investigating a matter, and they responded to our inquiry by saying just that. Similarly, they gave no formal statement to NBC. But on 20 March 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey broke from that practice to announce the FBI was in fact investigating allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. During a public hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, Comey said : The FBI, as part of our counterintelligence effort, is investigating the Russian government’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 president election. Less than two months later, President Trump fired Comey, prompting Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosenstein, who had been given oversight of the Russia investigation after Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself amid questions about his own communications with Russians, hired Special Counsel Robert Mueller. On 26 July 2017, FBI agents conducted an early-morning raid on the home of then-candidate Trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort. On 27 October 2017, CNN reported that Mueller had filed the first charges in the investigation and at least one person was expected to be in custody within days.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,571
9111c17c-776b-42dd-8544-df153b1f4d87,"Lawful permanent residents of the U.S. (popularly known as ""green card"" holders) enlisting in the Army or any other service branch will face an extended delay before entering active duty as of October 2017. U.S. Army Recruiting Command (USAREC) said in a statement on 24 October that enlistees holding a Form I-551 card (a green card) will be placed in the Army's existing delayed entry program for recruits awaiting their boot camp assignment dates. According to USAREC, green card holders who enlist will now have to complete their background checks, which could take up to a year, before being allowed to begin boot camp. Previously they were eligible to begin their training as soon as their background check began. Stephanie Miller, director of accessions for the Department of Defense, is quoted as saying: Effective immediately, all green card holders must complete a background investigation and receive a favorable military security suitability determination prior to entering any component of the armed forces Enlistments by green card holders into the Army Reserve, however, are ""temporarily on hold,"" according to USAREC's statement, while a separate delayed entry pool is created for those recruits to be placed in while their background checks are completed. Jennie Pasquarella, director of immigrants' rights for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of California, told us that while the policy is not an outright ban, it would discourage enlistment on the part of green card holders. She also said that even if enlistees' background checks took less than a year, it represented a significant delay: When you combine that with the fact that most people are enlisting when they're coming out of high school. They're teenagers. A year is a very long time in the scope of a person's life when they're graduating from high school and trying to figure out the next step in their life. Either way, it's going to have an enormous impact on the number of [green card holders] who are able, ultimately, to enlist in the military. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. David Eastburn, told us on 26 October 2017 that the policy shift would provide better continuity of service for enlistees: A service member would leave and sometimes these background checks take a really long time. So these guys would complete basic training and then they couldn't go on to their tech school or their specialty school because the background check wasn't complete. They would end up sitting there for months, or they would have to choose a different job with a lower security requirement because it wasn't complete yet. The new policy allows the recruit to have that complete prior to entering service so when they finish they can go on to their tech school and they can progress naturally throughout their military career. There's no speed bump, for lack of a better term. On 13 October 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) said that green card holders enlisted in military reserve components like the Army Reserve and National Guard would be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship if they completed their background checks and served for one year: For example, the individual drilled successfully, he achieved all of his points, he did his two weeks of annual training and as a result, achieved one good federal year. At that time, the department would render that person's service as honorable, and then the department would sign the form that he would include in the naturalization packet for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Current green card holders, USAREC said, can still enlist for active duty ""with the understanding that they will be part of the Delayed Entry Pool until the screening process is complete."" Before that statement, a Mic.com article reported that the Army Reserve had banned green card holders from enlisting entirely, quoting from an email sent to recruiters by Gregory C. Williamson, chief of the Accessions Suitability Office Guard Strength Division: EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY DO NOT ‘SHIP’ OR ‘ENLIST’ ANY FOREIGN NATIONAL’S (ALL I-551 CARD HOLDERS) UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. Such a ban would have violated federal law allowing for any ""alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence"" to enlist for military service. On 18 October 2017, it published the following update: On Wednesday, an Army public affairs officer responded to Mic ’s Tuesday report, clarifying that “for the time being,” green card holders cannot enlist in the Army Reserve specifically, rather than barring enlistment in the Army overall. According to the Immigration and Naturalization Act, active and retired U.S. service members are eligible to become naturalized citizens if they served for at least one year and, if applicable, were discharged honorably. In 2016 the Pentagon suspended the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest program (MAVNI), which offered an expedited path to U.S. citizenship for green card holders in exchange for six years of service. Two separate lawsuits have been filed by recruits in connection with the move, and some recruits have reported that their enlistment contracts have been terminated. On 25 October 2017, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia granted a preliminary injunction to the three plaintiffs in one suit. The court determined that Mahlon Kirwa, Santhosh Meenhallimath, and Ashok Viswanathan ""are suffering, and will continue to suffer, irreparable harm due to DOD's inaction"" and stated that DOD may not refuse to certify MAVNI enlistees ""who have served for one day or more in the Selected Reserve as having honorable service."" Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on 13 October 2017 that the MAVNI program may be revived: We are taking the steps obviously to save the program, if it can be saved. And I believe it can. We contacted U.S. Army Recruiting Command seeking further comment. A spokesperson for the U.S. Navy, Lt. Cmdr. Nick Sherrouse, told us: All green card holders must complete a background investigation and receive a favorable military security suitability determination prior to entering any component of the armed forces. A recruiting suspension remains in effect while current personnel complete vetting requirements -- no new accessions have signed enlistment contracts since June 2016. However, we will continue to process existing Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI) Pilot Program recruits who successfully clear all security screening requirements and are determined to be vital to the national interest.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1194
b2e83cc7-fdde-4da8-b7a3-f969ece628e4,"Conservative social media users circulated an image of a purported Facebook post from 17 October 2017 which they said showed Gold Star widow Myeshia Johnson accusing Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-Florida) of exploiting a presidential condolence call over the death of her husband, U.S. Army Sgt. La David Johnson, for political gain: The picture allegedly depicts a post from Myeshia Johnson's Facebook page dated ""17 October 2017 at 3:27 p.m."" saying: I want to set the record straight! I'm getting sick and tired of this so called politician using my husband as a political platform. Even buy [sic] her own words she did not hear all of the conversation she only heard part of it. This is what actually was said. ""They know the risk, they know what they sign up for but they still volunteer to put their lives on the line for their fellow Americans. We owe them a debt that can never be repaid"" A phone call from President Donald Trump to Johnson is at the center of what has become a public dispute between Johnson and the Trump administration. But the validity of the screenshot is doubtful. While the date of the post corresponds with that of the 17 October 2017 condolence call, the time listed is actually more than an hour before the reported time of President Trump's phone call, which was 4:45 p.m. Eastern time. Also, the picture shows a Facebook profile bearing a square profile picture. But the social media site implemented an update in August 2017 that changed the shape of users' profile pictures in the Facebook newsfeed from square to round, as seen in this example from the Snopes.com Facebook page (top left): La David Johnson was killed while serving in Niger on 4 October 2017, in what has been described as an ambush by Islamic insurgents. Three other U.S. service members, Staff Sgt. Bryan C. Black, Staff Sgt. Jeremiah W. Johnson, and Staff Sgt. Dustin M. Wright, were also killed in the attack, as were four Nigerien troops. Rep. Wilson said she was riding with the Army sergeant's widow and members of her family to receive his body when the President called, telling CNN host Don Lemon that night: I heard what [Trump] said because the phone was on speaker. Basically he said, ""Well, I guess he knew what he signed up for, but I guess it still hurt."" That's what he said. Wilson accused Trump of being insensitive not only to La David Johnson's family but ""to the family of every soldier that has paid the ultimate price for our freedom."" The sergeant's mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, has corroborated Wilson's account of the phone call, saying that ""President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband."" President Trump responded by denying what Rep. Wilson had claimed: I didn't say what that congresswoman said. Didn't say it all. She knows it. I had a very nice conversation with the woman, with the wife who was — sounded like a lovely woman. Did not say what the congresswoman said, and most people aren't too surprised to hear that. On 23 October 2017, Myeshia Johnson told ABC News that Wilson was ""100 percent"" in her description of the phone call. She said: The President said that he knew what he signed up for, but it hurts anyway. And it made me cry cause I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said he couldn't remember my husband's name.  The only way he remembered my husband's name is because he told me he had my husband's report in front of him and that's when he actually said La David. I heard him stumblin' on, trying to remember my husband's name and that's what hurt me the most, because if my husband is out here fighting for our country and he risked his life for our country why can't you remember his name. But while President Trump suggested he had proof to support his account of events, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that the call had not been not recorded. Instead, Sanders said, Chief of Staff Gen. John Kelly and other White House staff members were near President Trump when he phone Myeshia Johnson and heard what he said. For his part, Kelly called Wilson an ""empty barrel"" and accused her of taking credit in 2015 for the funding of a Federal Bureau of Investigation field office in Miami, a claim that was debunked by footage of Wilson's remarks that was posted online on 20 October 2017. Despite Sanders' statement that the president's conversation with Myeshia Johnson was not recorded, Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and host of a Facebook broadcast devoted to what his administration calls ""real news,"" asserted on 20 October 2017 that she had read a transcript of the call which confirmed Trump spoke the words in question, albeit with additional context: [Trump] said, ""Your husband went into battle, you know, knowing that he could be injured, knowing that he could be killed, and he still did it because he loved this country, and he did it for the American people."" Wilson came under additional criticism after she responded to Kelly's allegations by exclaiming that ""You mean to tell me that I've become so important that the White House is following me and my words? This is amazing. That's amazing. I'll have to tell my kids that I'm a rockstar now."" Two days earlier, Rep. Wilson had issued a statement reading: Despite President Trump's suggestion that I have recanted my statement or misstated what he said, I stand firmly by my original account of his conversation with Myeshia Johnson, the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson. Moreover, this account has been confirmed by family members who also witnessed Mr. Trump's incredible lack of compassion and sensitivity. The Johnson family and the families of the three other soldiers who tragically lost their lives in the Niger ambush are experiencing what I am certain must feel like an unbearable loss. Rather than engage in a petty war of words with Mr. Trump, it is so much more important to embrace and support the families and honor these fallen heroes. We reached out to Rep. Wilson for comment but have not yet received a response.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1213
07f87094-159d-42d7-bef8-57d4f023f282,"President Donald Trump made an eye-catching claim early on the morning of 20 October 2017, linking or attributing a 13 percent annual increase in crime in the ""U.K."" with the ""spread of radical Islamic terror."" Just out report: ""United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror."" Not good, we must keep America safe! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2017 The statistical report Trump is alluding to actually relates specifically to England and Wales and not the U.K., which also includes Scotland and Northern Ireland. In any case - Trump's linking of Islamist terrorism to a 13 percent rise in recorded crime ""in the U.K."" (or in England and Wales, for that matter) is grossly misleading. The source of his claim appears to have been a segment aired on the conservative One America News Network (OANN) just a few minutes before he sent his tweet. As reported by Media Matters , the OANN segment carried a graphic that read: ""Migrant Crisis - Report: U.K. Crime Rises 13% Annually Amid Spread of Radical Islamic Terror."" The segment can be viewed here . OANN states that the rise in crime was driven by increases in violent and sexual offenses and harassment. Without citing any evidence, the report claims ""Officials speculate the surge in crime may have resulted from the mass migration and spread of violent ideologies including Sharia law and radical Islam."" In reality, no U.K. official has said this, and migration from outside the European Union actually slowed in the year ending March 2017, as compared to the year before that. The Overall Rise in Police-Recorded Crime On 19 October 2017, the U.K.'s Office of National Statistics published its June 2017 Crime Survey of England and Wales (CSEW). As part of the presentation of the CSEW, the Office of National Statistics (ONS) included statistics on offenses recorded by police in the 12 months ending in June 2017. The data show that between July 2016 and June 2017, police recorded a total of 5,156,928 offenses in England and Wales, an increase of 583,782 offenses (12.77 percent) from the number recorded between July 2015 and June 2016, which was 4,573,146. ( Table A4 .) The ONS offers this context for that rise: The 13% increase in police recorded crime from the previous year reflects a range of factors including continuing improvements to crime recording and genuine increases in some crime categories, especially in those that are well-recorded. To be included in the crime statistics, an offense does not need to culminate in a criminal conviction, or even an arrest. It need only be reported to police, or recorded by police. Known Islamist Terror Offenses vs Other Offenses The police-recorded crime statistics include 35 homicides and 294 attempted murder offenses relating to three Islamist terrorist attacks during the past 12 months: the March 2017 Westminster attack, the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing, and the June 2017 London Bridge attack. A separate October 2017 briefing paper for the House of Commons states that there were 379 arrests relating to terrorism in the year ending June 2017, an increase of 153 on the previous 12 months. Around 75 percent of these arrests related to ""international terrorism"" (Islamist terrorism, largely speaking.) So let's add an estimated 115 additional reported crimes to those homicides and attempted murder offenses. That's a total of 444 additional arrests and known offenses relating to Islamist terrorism, which represents just 0.08 percent of the annual increase in police-reported crime in England and Wales in the 12 months between July 2016 and June 2017. Other categories of crime were responsible for much larger portions of that 13 percent overall rise in crime. For example, an increase in stalking and harassment represented the equivalent of 11.12 percent of the overall increase, a rise in thefts represented the equivalent of 31.8 percent of the overall increase, and a significant rise in rape offenses represented the equivalent of 1.42 percent of the overall increase - a proportion 19 times larger than that of Islamist terror-related arrests, homicides and attempted murder offenses. If we isolate ""racially or religiously aggravated"" offenses (that is, hate crimes) we see that there were 52,925 such offenses in the year leading up to June 2017, an increase of 10,577 (25 percent) from the figure for the previous year. This represents 1.8 percent of the overall rise in crime, and is 24 times greater than the increase in ""international terrorism"" arrests and known criminal offenses relating to the three terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. There were 36,607 more shoplifting offenses recorded between July 2016 and June 2017, than in the year before that - meaning shoplifting contributed 82 times more greatly to the overall increase in crime than arrests, homicides and attempted murder offenses relating to ""radical Islamist terror"" did. Unknown Islamist Terror Offenses However, we have to look beyond the 329 known homicides and attempted murder offenses, and the estimated 115 additional terror-related arrests. Remember, these crime statistics also include reported and recorded offenses that don't culminate in arrests. The Crime Statistics division of the U.K. Office of National Statistics told us that other terrorism-related offenses could be included elsewhere in the recorded crime statistics, namely in a sub-category called ""Other offenses against the state and public order."" This sub-category contains specific offenses such as ""Engaging in conduct, or assisting another, in preparation of committing an act of terrorism,"" ""failure to disclose information about acts of terrorism,"" and ""distribute/circulate a terrorist publication,"" along with many other non-terrorism-related offenses. Unfortunately, there is no breakdown available of the number of each offense within this sub-category, so we don't know exactly how many terrorist-related offenses there were in the last 12 months, nor how many there were in the 12 months before that. (Nor is there a breakdown of which kind of terrorism these offenses relate to - international terrorism, Northern Ireland, and so on.) However, we do know that there were 50,976 recorded offenses in the sub-category of ""Other offenses against the state and public order"" and that this represents an increase of 10,110 (or 25 percent) over the previous year. So from a statistical and logical point of view, the absolute maximum possible increase in Islamist terror-related offenses in the past year is 10,439 (the 329 known homicides and attempted murder offenses from the London and Manchester attacks, added to the 10,110 increase under ""other offenses against the state and public order."") This figure represents 1.79 percent of the overall increase of 583,782 in total crimes recorded, but even at that, it is almost certainly a significant over-estimation (because not all crimes under ""other offenses against the state and public order"" would have been terrorism-related, and not all of those would have been related to Islamist terror.) Compare this to the fact that theft offenses, for example, increased by 185,865 - representing 31.8 percent of the overall increase in crime, or that there was an increase of 88,822 in ""violence without injury"" offenses (kidnapping, child abduction, assault without injury), representing 15.2 percent of the overall increase. Stalking and harassment (up 64,924 from the previous year) represented 11.1 percent of the overall rise in crime, and the additional 40,273 domestic burglary offenses in the year ending in June 2017 represented 6.9 percent of the overall increase. There are many other offenses and sub-categories of offense whose contribution to the overall 13 percent increase in crime was greater than the maximum possible contribution made by Islamist terror-related offenses. They can all be found in Table 4 of an official Office of National Statistics spreadsheet, which you can download here . This should clearly demonstrate that Donald Trump's highlighting of ""radical Islamic terror"" as being linked to a 13 percent increase in crime is grossly misleading. From a factual and statistical point of view, he would have accurately reflected the actual data if his tweet had read: Just out report: ""England and Wales crime rises 13% annually amid spread of theft, violence without injury, stalking and harassment and domestic burglary."" The Crime Survey of England and Wales, which is separate to the police statistics we've been analyzing (and to which Trump was alluding), found a nine percent overall drop in crime in the year leading up to June 2017. The CSEW is a survey given to residents in England and Wales which asks them about their experience of crime and policing in the preceding 12 months. The statistics gathered from this survey are therefore not limited to crimes that are actually reported to police in England and Wales. It is conducted and published on a quarterly basis (four times a year.)",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1644
b63a3a34-2f54-46ca-be7c-544d74b9420b,"As part of his push for tax cuts and tax reform, United States President Donald Trump held a press conference at the Rose Garden on 16 October 2017, during which he made an interesting comparison between the United States and other countries, in particular,  Ireland: You look at other countries, what they've done, and we're competing with other countries. When China's at 15 percent [corporate tax], when — I hear that Ireland is going to be reducing their corporate rates down to 8 percent from 12. But you have other countries also reducing — we can't be at 35 percent and think we're going to remain competitive in terms of companies and in terms of jobs. The relevant section begins at 1:34 below: His claim regarding Ireland's corporate tax rate is entirely false. Not only does the Irish government have no plans to reduce the country's rate of corporation tax to eight percent, but no such proposal has ever even been brought up. As it happens, Ireland reset all its taxation rates just days before Trump's comments as part of the country's annual budget, which took place on 10 October 2017.  The government kept the rate of corporation tax at 12.5 percent (not 12 percent, as Trump stated), and Paschal Donohoe, Ireland's Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform (roughly equivalent to Treasury Secretary) said at the time: We have a stable and competitive corporation tax system, which is internationally recognised as one of the most transparent in the world. Our position is clear. The 12.5 per cent tax rate is, and will remain, a core part of our offering. In a statement, a spokesperson for Donohoe directly refuted President Trump's claim: There are no proposals to change the corporation tax rate... Ireland’s corporation tax regime and 12.5 percent corporation tax rate will continue to be competitive, while also offering long-term certainty to international business. As always, we will remain alert and responsive to any changes in the U.S. or global tax environment. On 18 October 2017, Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar called Trump's claim ""fake news."" In answer to a question from an opposition politician, Varadkar told the Irish parliament: In relation to our corporate tax, I can confirm that President Trump's claim that we're proposing to reduce our corporation profit tax to eight percent is indeed fake news. There is no such plan do so. (You can watch a video of the Taoiseach's remarks here . The relevant section starts at 25.29.) It's not clear what the basis of Donald Trump's claim was, or where he had ""heard"" that Ireland would be lowering its corporation tax rate to eight percent. A reduction from 12.5 to 8 percent was not ever brought up by the Irish government in the runup to the October 2017 budget, nor was it proposed by any opposition political party. At the last general election in 2016, no political party proposed reducing the corporate tax rate in their manifesto. One economic analysis has estimated that the effective rate of corporation tax in Ireland — tax paid on a company's net operating surplus — is 8.4 percent, and it is just about conceivable that this is what President Trump had in mind. However, his claim that Ireland is about to reduce the corporate tax rate down from ""12 percent"" is a reference to the country's headline corporate tax rate (which is actually 12.5 percent), so it's still not clear what the source or logic of Trump's claim was. Ireland has one of the lowest headline rates of corporate tax in the European Union, but has been under pressure from some European Union leaders seeking to establish harmonized tax policies across the continent, which would likely entail an increase from Ireland's current rate of 12.5 percent.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,731
11abac78-5895-411e-b423-aad9c0e31a3c,"In September 2017, amid renewed controversy around football players kneeling during the U.S. national anthem to protest police targeting of African Americans, the ""satirical"" web site AsAmericanAsApplePie.com falsely reported that the Cleveland Browns and certain other National Football League (NFL) teams had been ""forced"" to refund season tickets, with the Browns refunding 90%. NFL teams have been issuing quite a lot of refunds to season ticket holders after players declared war on Donald Trump for correctly pointing out that they should respect the country that allows them to make millions of dollars throwing, kicking, and holding a football, but no team has been hit harder than the Cleveland Browns. Fox News reported last night that former fans are angrily calling every single team and demanding that they be given their money back for their season tickets – purchases made in good faith – after the NFL betrayed them by siding with whiny “athletes” who think that it’s OK to kneel during the National Anthem and disrespect our country and flag. The Dallas Cowboys have refunded money for 65% of season tickets. The Pittsburgh Steelers have given fans money back for 53% of season tickets. But the hardest hit have been the Cleveland Browns, who recently entertained the idea of signing Colin Kaepernick who started this fiasco by kneeling in support of thugs who attack police. The Browns have given a whopping 90% of season ticket holders their money back according to Fox. At the time that the As American As Apple Pie article was published, Fox News had not reported any of these claims. It's true that at the time some fans on Twitter claimed to have demanded refunds for season tickets, angry at NFL team owners' support for players who protested during the national anthem on the opening Sunday of the season. There have been reports that DirectTV has given some customers a refund on NFL season packages, in light of the protests, but we were unable to confirm the veracity of these reports. President Donald Trump added fuel to the fire of an ongoing debate about such protests by saying owners faced with a protesting player should ""get that son of a bitch off the field,"" and encouraging fans to boycott NFL games unless protesting players were fired or suspended. Trump's comments seemed only to have solidified many team owners' support for their players. Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan even locked arms with protesting players during the national anthem before a game against the Baltimore Ravens on 24 September 2017. Dee and Jimmy Haslam, owners of the Cleveland Browns - whom As American As Apple Pie claims have been ""forced to refund"" 90% of season tickets - released a statement expressing support for protesting players, and criticism of President Trump's intervention. We must not let misguided, uninformed and divisive comments from the President or anyone else deter us from our efforts to unify. Our stance in support of the liberties of peaceful, personal expression afforded to our players and all Americans will remain strong, and we will continue to encourage our players to respectfully use their earned platform to inspire positive change in our nation and throughout society.

ae995b4f-a5f8-47f7-bf9b-d8c6156ecf2e,"On 24 July 2017, dubious web site FreedomDaily.com posted a story containing the claim that Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-Florida) had been the subject of a raid by federal officials because of an investigation into her former aide, 37-year-old Imran Awan. According to the story, FBI agents ""seized smashed computers and hard drives"" from the lawmaker's home. But the Daily Caller story cited by FreedomDaily.com contradicts that argument, saying that it was Awan — not her — who had lived on the premises: FBI agents seized smashed computer hard drives from the home of Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s information technology (IT) administrator, according to two sources with knowledge of the investigation. The report also describes the site of the alleged raid as ""Wasserman-Shultz’s home that had previously belonged to the Muslim IT administrator,"" but that statement is also debunked by the Daily Caller story, which states that the equipment was reported by an unidentified couple who took over the Virginia home after Awan ""abruptly"" moved out in February 2017: One of the new tenants — a Marine Corps veteran married to a female Navy Officer — said he found “wireless routers, hard drives that look like they tried to destroy, laptops, [and] a lot of brand new expensive toner.” The tenants called the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and, not long after, FBI agents arrived together with the Capitol Police to interview them and confiscate the equipment. The Marine spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his wife’s naval career, saying she doesn’t want to be associated with a national security incident. “It was in the garage. They recycled cabinets and lined them along the walls. They left in a huge hurry,” the Marine said. “It looks like government-issued equipment. We turned that stuff over.” We contacted not only the FBI, but Capitol Police and the U.S. Attorney's office for the District of Columbia, all of whom refused to comment on whether any hard drives had been taken from Awan's former home. Awan was arrested on 24 July 2017 at Dulles International Airport in Virginia while trying to leave the U.S. He was fired from Wasserman-Schultz's office the following day. Wasserman-Schultz terminated Awan's employment months after he and his wife, Hina Alvi, were fired by two of Wasserman-Schultz's colleagues, Rep. Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-New York), respectively. Awan was accused of providing false information to the Congressional Federal Credit Union while seeking a loan. He pleaded not guilty to one count of bank fraud, and was released on the condition that he wear a GPS monitor, turn over all of his passports, remain within 50 miles of his current home, and abide by a curfew. A grand jury indicted Awan and Alvi on 17 August 2017 on charges of bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, engaging in unlawful monetary transactions, and making false statements on a loan or credit application. Awan is due back in court on 21 August 2017 for a preliminary hearing.

And more. So what have Republican lawmakers done? They’ve just voted to allow horses to be slaughtered in the United States for human consumption, a reversal of previous measures that prevented the practice. No specific vote to that effect was cast; Congress did pass a spending bill opening the door for that to happen in 2011 — but two bills approved in July 2017 by the House Appropriations Committee did ease its previous stances on the issue. On July 12 2017, the committee approved the Agriculture Appropriations Bill for the 2018 fiscal year, but unlike previous iterations of the bill, this one did not include an amendment blocking funding for United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) inspectors to visit facilities where horses are being slaughtered. That provision was part of a spending bill passed by Congress in 2011, which effectively constituted a slaughter ban because any meat sold in the U.S. must be approved by the USDA. The Fiscal Year 2017 version of the bill, for example, contained this amendment by Reps. Charlie Dent (R-Pennsylvania) and Sam Farr (D-California): None of the funds made available in this Act may be used to pay the salary or expenses of personnel-- to inspect horses under section 3 of the Federal Meat Inspection Act; to inspect horses under section 903 of the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996; or to implement or enforce section 352.19 of title 9, Code of Federal Regulations (or a successor regulation). Another Democratic lawmaker from California, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, introduced her own amendment banning slaughter inspections in the 2018 fiscal year version of the bill, but it was struck down in a 27-25 vote. Six days after the committee approved the agriculture bill, it approved the 2018 Fiscal Year Interior and Environment Bill, which contained an amendment by Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah) removing language concerning a ban on ""the destruction of healthy, unadopted wild horses and burros"" on the part of the Bureau of Land Management or its contractors. The committee has not released the full markup of the bill. But according to Stewart's office, the amended version reads in part: Appropriations herein made shall not be available for the sale of wild horses and burros that results in their destruction for processing into commercial products, including for human consumption. The lifting of the ban potentially affects a reported 67,000 wild horses. During debate on the bill, Stewart said that the horses are ""crowding out the deer and the elk"" and ""destroying the range."" He also reiterated his disdain for the idea of slaughtering horses for food: I would never eat horse meat. I feel the same way about horses that most of us feel about our pets, like cats and dogs: I view them as companions, not as a source of food. Another bill (H.R. 113, a.k.a. the Safeguard American Food Exports Act of 2017) was introduced in the House in January 2017 by Rep. Vern Buchanan (R-Florida): This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to deem equine (horses and other members of the equidae family) parts to be an unsafe food additive or animal drug. The bill prohibits the knowing sale or transport of equines or equine parts for human consumption. The measure was referred to the House Subcommittee on Health on 25 January 2017. On 3 August 2017, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-New Jersey) and three of his colleagues introduced a companion to Buchanan's bill which would permanently ban the slaughter of horses for human consumption in the United States and ""the export of horse meat or the transport of horses to slaughterhouses in other countries.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,743
36aca148-0d34-4983-a57b-6f1dbcc930d2,"On 27 June 2017, the Washington Post published an article about decor at four of President Donald Trump's golf resorts. It revealed that the resorts contained bogus magazine covers made up to look like issues of Time , featuring Trump on the cover and promoting his reality television show ""The Apprentice"": It is not clear who created this fake Time cover — or why. Its date might be a clue: March 1, 2009, was the season debut of Trump’s show “The Celebrity Apprentice.” But a transcript of that show offers no answers. In that episode, various B-list celebrities competed to sell cupcakes, and Trump fired comedian Andrew Dice Clay for poor performance. Nobody mentioned Time magazine. While it’s not difficult to mock up a fake cover using graphic-design software, whoever made this one sought out real Time headlines, to add to the fake. The faux covers were dated 1 March 2009 (the same day ""The Apprentice"" premiered), but as the Washington Post article noted, the magazine did not publish an issue on that date. However, it did publish an issue a day later with actress Kate Winslet on the cover which did not mention Trump at all. Two of the headlines used in the actual 2 March 2009 issue of Time (""How Stressed Is Your Bank? A Checkup"" and ""Obama's Next Move: Can He Curb Health Care Costs?"") appeared on the mocked-up cover, which was spotted on display in Trump resorts in Colorado, New York, New Jersey, Virginia and his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida among others. Employees at the Turnberry resort in Scotland also reported that the cover had been displayed there until they took it down because of ""grumbling about all the stuff like that up on the walls"" by American tourists. The Washington Post, which published the story, later reported that it was also taken down from Trump's golf course in Ireland. The fake magazine cover included a fake bar code which was used in a graphic design tutorial posted by graphic designer Leonardo Amoretti on his blog in 2010, which also displayed a mockup of a ""Time"" cover: Amoretti noted in his post that ""The use of TIME magazine logo on this tutorial is just for instructional purposes and not intended to violate the magazine copyrights."" A spokesperson for the magazine said that it had requested the removal of the faux Time covers from display at Trump resorts. White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders has not commented on whether the president was aware of the fake nature of the magazine covers.

One easily remembers how tense and long-lasting the Cold War was, and it left Russia very angry that they suffered such a demoralizing defeat as a world power. While the United States should not become Vladimir Putin’s best friend, we also have to realize that Russia is a super power in this world and we must take them seriously.

But now , As of Sunday, October 23, Putin has ordered the Russian Defense Ministry to begin training and managing all local authorities, law enforcement, and state security as they are preparing for a nuclear war with the United States.

Although this rumor was picked up by a diverse range of outlets, ranging from NBC to Uproxx to Vibe to Raw Story , these reports were all based on a single source: a tweet from CNBC finance reporter Josh Brown: NBA champion Warriors skipping the White House visit, as a unanimous team decision per reports. — Downtown Josh Brown (@ReformedBroker) June 13, 2017 Brown did not cite a source for the information, nor did he quote or link to any first-hand accounts of the team's plans. Several Warriors members have talked about their dislike for the current administration, but that talk came before the team won the 2017 NBA championship. Head coach Steve Kerr, for instance, said that Donald Trump was ""ill-suited to be President"" in November 2016, while point guard Steph Curry slyly called the president an ass (saying, ""I agree with that description ... if you remove the 'et' from asset."") Power forward David West was less coy regarding his opinion of President Trump and the president's supporters: “The things that he said, the things that he represented, that’s the way that the majority of this nation feels,” West said. “I think he just emboldened them because he’s able to say it publically. He got the platform."" “It is kind of unnerving and unsettling ... The man’s 70 years old, so he is who he is. It’s just a shame that, throughout the process, a lot of these people were in hiding and waited for the cover of the ballot to represent who they are.” So although it's true that several members of the Golden State Warriors have openly expressed their dislike for President Trump, reports that the team has unanimously voted to skip the traditional visit to the White House is based on of a single unconfirmed tweet. USA Today NBA reporter Jeff Zillgitt tweeted that the Golden State Warriors had neither received nor turned down an invitation from the White House: Per multiple NBA sources, reports right now on Warriors not going to White House are untrue; team hasn't received invitation or discussed. — Jeff Zillgitt (@JeffZillgitt) June 13, 2017 The Golden State Warriors released a statement confirming that the reports claiming that the team had rejected the White House's invitation were premature: ""Today is about celebrating our championship.

a7c03b14-8a97-4086-b39d-a24df998b41b,"King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Sau of Saudi Arabia reportedly issued an order in April 2017 that would allow greater freedom for women in his country, while retaining codified examples of its ""guardianship"" policies. According to local media , Saudi women would be allowed to access education and healthcare services from government agencies without needing permission from, or accompaniment by, a male guardian. However, the decree will not apply to areas where ""there is a regulatory obligation for this request,"" meaning companies or services that already have regulations mandating the approval of a male relative are not affected. The country's ""guardianship"" system mandates that a woman's husband, father, brother, or son grant permission to her if she wishes to study internationally, rent an apartment, apply for a passport, or marry, among other actions. Women were also subject to an informal ban on driving, in that it is heavily discouraged by traditional mores. In November 2016 the Shura Council, which advises the king but has no legislative power, refused to consider a petition calling for a study of the issue that reportedly would have included the question, ""What is required to allow them to drive?"" However, the country's foreign ministry announced on 26 September 2017 that by royal decree, Saudi women would be allowed to take driving lessons without a man's permission and be allowed to drive. The civil rights advocacy group Human Rights Watch said in an online post that they had ""reviewed"" the two-page order, which provides government agencies a three-month period during which they must compile a list of services requiring male approval. However, the group said they could not provide us with a version of the order translated into English. Sarah Leah Whitson, Human Rights Watch's Middle East director, said: Saudi Arabia has a tremendous opportunity to root out all vestiges of the guardianship system, and should use the three-month review period King Salman ordered to immediately declare all guardian consent requirements null and void. The king should also require state agencies to actively prevent discrimination by private individuals and businesses. Maha Akeel, a spokesperson for the Saudi Arabia-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation, noted that the easing of guardianship rules could allow women more chances to pursue employment or represent themselves in court, saying: ""Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women. Some [men] take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it.

06b9031e-ba0a-4efe-b409-74cf60911274,"In May 2017, after the Department of Homeland Security reportedly tapped Wisconsin sheriff David Clarke for a job, stories appeared about the medals he typically wears to adorn his lapels, with many pointing out that Clarke has never served in the military. These articles mainly dealt with the sensitive topic of what military veterans know as ""stolen valor"", which is the act of misleading the public by wearing unearned military medals or dressing in military uniform without having served. Clarke, who already cuts a controversial figure as the sheriff of Milwaukee County, received a round of scrutiny after he announced in mid-May 2017 that he would accept an assistant secretary position with the Department of Homeland Security (although DHS has not yet confirmed such a position has been offered). Among the topics of scrutiny were the many pins he wears on his dress uniform. For example, Salon.com posted a story on 19 May 2017 with the headline, ""Looks like Sheriff David Clarke’s 'army' medals might be B.S."" They reported: In the wake of that, an interesting charge against Clarke surfaced in the form of a Twitter rant on Thursday. At almost all of his public appearances, Clarke either wears a pristine cowboy hat with a natty suit or, more famously, a uniform festooned with shiny military medals. On Thursday, Twitter user Charles Clymer, an army veteran, pointed out that those military medals might not be all that legit. “Look at this fucking guy’s uniform,” Clymer said, in the second of a long string of tweets on the subject. “You see all that shit pinned all over his dress uniform jacket? That’s not supposed to be there.” Clymer went on to break down each individual medal, their placement and their apparently spurious provenance. Clymer acknowledged that legitimate medals are earned, and should be worn with pride, but accuses Clarke of “stolen valor” and calls Clarke’s collection, “a sloppy assortment of badge replicas arranged neatly, [that] looks imposing.” We reached out to Clarke's spokesman, Craig Peterson, and the spokeswoman for the Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office. Neither responded to our questions regarding Clarke's uniform. But Clarke himself went on the record about the issue as a guest on Newsmax TV's ""The Joe Pags Show"", where he said he doesn't wear ""medals"" and never falsely claimed to have served in the military. He said he wears pins that have personal and emotional value for him, and called the attacks on the items a smear: You know they're talking about some of the pins on my uniform, first of all they're not medals, they're pins. And they have very significant emotional and real value to me. Some of these have been handed to [me] by people who have lost sons and daughters in the line of duty, or a spouse. So in support of like the C.O.P.S. Concerns of Police Survivors organization, I wear a ribbon for that. Some of these I have earned and some of these designate my completion of the FBI National Academy — they give you a pin. I wear that pin on my uniform. The FBI National Executive Institute, the Secret Service Dignitary Protection School, on and on and on. But I've also been given pins by survivors of the 9/11 terror attacks in New York City, from cops, from people who lost sons and daughters in those attacks, talking about form law enforcement. And those things mean something to me, you know I honor them, I put them on the thing that's most important to me and that's the uniform. They're not medals, they're pins that designate that, I don't care what anybody says about it... There are ulterior motives. It's just to smear me. However, many people who served in the armed forces took issue with the implication of the pins, even without an overt declaration that he was a military hero. Will Fischer, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, compared Clarke's pins to the "" flair "" placed on waiters' uniforms at the restaurant Chotchkie's in the Mike Judge cult film Office Space. Fischer told us: Is it stolen valor? No. Is it pathetic? Yes. It's almost like he walks around and finds something shiny on the ground and just pins it upon himself. Some of it looks like things that came with a Halloween costume or ""flair"" in Office Space . I think he knows that if he puts things upon his uniform it can exude authority, or a tough guy persona. But criticism of Clarke's uniform is purely subjective. John Lilyea, a retired Army sergeant who runs the blog ""This Ain't Hell"" which often deals with stolen valor cases, said he saw nothing wrong with Clarke's pins, and thought the kerfuffle was much ado about nothing. In an e-mail, he told us: I don't see anything wrong with what Sheriff Clarke is wearing. None of it is military-related... The people in the Salon article were just having an emotional reaction to the sight of the Sheriff in his uniform rather than anything substantial. Lilyea directed us to a blog post he had written on the topic (categorized under ""Dumbass Bullshit"") in which he characterized the controversy as nothing more than partisanship: The whole thing is childish and it's a political attack. We've busted phonies here on both sides of the political aisle, irrespective of their politics because that’s the nature of stolen valor. I can't find any articles on Salon that take [Democratic Connecticut Senator] Dick Blumenthal to task on his fake claims that Blumenthal was a Vietnam veteran. Anthony Anderson, a staff sergeant who runs the web site ""Guardian of Valor"" and has taken on the task of busting military impostors, agreed with Lilyea. He told us by e-mail: From what we can see there are no official military badges or insignia on this man's uniform. We see a bunch of pro-American and Law Enforcement pins. Not sure why anyone would approach this man and accuse him of Stolen Valor. Unless there is a background that we don't know of, there's nothing offensive or wrong with what he is wearing. Opinions on whether or not Clarke's pins and uniform are inappropriate seem to be influenced by viewers' opinions on the man himself. Clarke is a lightning rod of a political figure. He began his law enforcement career with the Milwaukee Police Department in 1978, working his way up to the rank of captain, and only left the department in 2002 to take the position of Milwaukee County Sheriff. Clarke is a staunch and outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, and frequently stumped for him during the 2016 presidential campaign. He has controversially compared the Black Lives Matter movement to terrorists , and is also the target of several lawsuits dealing with prisoner fatalities in his jail system as well as and harassment of a private citizen. The Anti-Defamation League also cautions that Clarke has ties to two groups it classifies as extremist anti-government organizations: the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association ( CSPOA ), and the Oath Keepers . Actual ""stolen valor"" is a serious offense — it's a federal crime to fraudulently present oneself as the recipient of authentic military medals like a silver star, a Purple Heart or a Combat Infantryman's Badge with the intent of benefiting from doing so. Although Clarke has a penchant for meticulously arranging his personal pins on his dress uniform, he never claimed to have served in the military and says the items are personal belongings, not military-issued medals or badges. It may be a gray area for some, but the level of offense taken is in the eye of the beholder. Clarke does not misrepresent his past nor does he masquerade as a veteran of the armed forces.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1498
e00f271f-b8aa-46ce-9089-50cb8d2f48cf,"On 23 September 2016, the conspiratorial site 21stCenturyWire.com , which essentially serves as a propaganda mouthpiece for Russian and Syrian regime disinformation in the ongoing civil war, reported without any evidence that the volunteer search-and-rescue organization that has come to be known widely as the White Helmets has ties to terrorism. Through the course of the bloody seven-year war in Syria, in which the regime of Bashar al-Assad has allied with Russia, a network of Western pro-Assad activists and bloggers (two of whom serve as editors of 21stCenturyWire.com) have helped spread to English-speaking audiences a series of conspiracy theories that deflect blame for atrocities away from the regime.. A common theme is the baseless but relentless claim that the White Helmets, known officially as Syria Civil Defense, are either terrorists or are "" staging "" mass casualty events like chemical weapons attacks. The writer of the 2016 iteration of the narrative in question, Vanessa Beeley, was scheduled to speak at an event in the U.K. in May 2018 meant to lobby for terrorism charges to be brought against journalists who covered the Syrian civil war for Britain's Channel 4 in 2016 and BBC coverage of Libya in 2011. The event has since been cancelled . Beeley wrote in 2016: For the REAL Syria Civil Defence you call 113 inside Syria. There is no public number for the White Helmets. Why not? Why does this multi-million dollar US & NATO state-funded first repsonder ‘NGO,’ with state of the art equipment supplied by the US and the EU via Turkey, have no central number for civilians to call when the “bombs fall”? Before we introduce the real Syria Civil Defence, who are Syria’s real ICDO certified civil fire and rescue organisation, let’s first take a closer look at the imposters; terrorists in white hats, and agents of war – NATO’s pseudo ‘NGO’ construct, embedded exclusively in terrorist-held parts of Syria. While the article accuses the White Helmets of having terrorist ties in the headline (""EXCLUSIVE: The REAL Syria Civil Defence Exposes Fake ‘White Helmets’ as Terrorist-Linked Imposters""), it does not provide any evidence in the body of the story. It instead heavily implies that the White Helmets are terrorists because they operate in areas held by the opposition, and because unnamed crew members of what the article calls the ""REAL Syria Civil Defense in Aleppo""  (the Syrian government, in other words) told Beeley that was the case and she reported it uncritically. The article also contains an interview with a man she identifies as Dr. Bassem Hayak, who claims civilians in east Aleppo have never heard of the White Helmets organization. As we reported in 2018, statements made by civilians in regime-held territories and in the presence of armed government soldiers should be weighed for their credibility, considering they may have been made under duress. Beeley speculates that the White Helmets possibly only exist as ""NATO ghosts"" who stage photo ops with ""crisis actors"" or stolen bodies: Where do these bodies come from? Are they victims of air strikes as we are told by these NATO funded “activists” and “first responders” or are they taken from among the thousands of “disappeared” that have been kidnapped by Nusra Front and other terrorist gangs in East Aleppo? Are they gruesome props being used inhumanely, to polish the image of this faux NGO embedded in East Aleppo, HQ for Al Nusra Front... It is not unreasonable, based upon the statements given by eminent members of the Aleppo medical fraternity and crew members of the REAL Syria Civil Defence in Aleppo, to draw the conclusion that the White Helmets are nothing more than common terrorists, being paid to present themselves as respectable first responders when the need arises for “reports from inside Aleppo” or elsewhere in Syria. The White Helmets, also known as the Syria Civil Defense, is a nongovernmental, nonprofit organization led by Raed al-Saleh, a Syrian who helped found the group, and funded by Mayday Rescue, an organization founded by James Le Mesurier, a former intelligence officer with the British military. According to the web site for his Mayday Rescue organization, funding for the program comes largely from the UK, Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan, and Germany. The White Helmets have a tendency to draw criticism from Assad and his supporters because they carry small cameras with them during their rescues and often document war crimes. As The Guardian reports: The White Helmets, officially known as the Syria Civil Defence, is a humanitarian organisation made up of 3,400 volunteers – former teachers, engineers, tailors and firefighters – who rush to pull people from the rubble when bombs rain down on Syrian civilians. They’ve been credited with saving thousands of civilians during the country’s continuing civil war. They have also exposed, through first-hand video footage, war crimes including a chemical attack in April . Their work was the subject of an Oscar-winning Netflix documentary and the recipient of two Nobel peace prize nominations. Despite this positive international recognition, there’s a counter-narrative pushed by a vocal network of individuals who write for alternative news sites countering the “MSM agenda”. Their views align with the positions of Syria and Russia and attract an enormous online audience, amplified by high-profile alt-right personalities, appearances on Russian state TV and an army of Twitter bots. The way the Russian propaganda machine has targeted the White Helmets is a neat case study in the prevailing information wars. It exposes just how rumours, conspiracy theories and half-truths bubble to the top of YouTube, Google and Twitter search algorithms. The group was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize, but was not selected as winners, though they did receive an award known as the ""alternative Nobel prize"" from the Right Livelihood Award Foundation for ""outstanding bravery, compassion and humanitarian engagement in rescuing civilians."" They were also the subject of an eponymous Netflix documentary . Le Mesurier said the group has roughly 3,000 Syrian volunteers, both men and women, and he founded the organization with Turkish search-and-rescue specialists in 2013. They claim to have rescued 60,000 people since they began tracking that figure in 2014, and say more than 140 volunteers have died while serving. The group claims to be impartial, only interested in saving lives amid the chaos and atrocities of war. Their motto, taken from the Muslim holy book, the Quran, is ""To save a life is to save all of humanity."" To date, we have found no credible evidence or reports that link the White Helmets organization with terrorism.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1234
1d01aa69-1f03-46db-8dc6-cfc0b608cc40,"In late August 2021, readers asked us about reports that a portion of the southern border wall built during the Trump administration was damaged by seasonal rains in Arizona. During his presidential campaign, former U.S. President Donald Trump had stated he would build a wall covering the roughly 2,000-mile U.S. border with Mexico, and that ""Mexico"" would pay for the project. Aside from the fact that parts of the border already had walls, experts had stated that in some places where it didn't, such a project would not be possible. The Mexican government unsurprisingly refused to pay for another country's construction project. The Trump administration pushed forward with construction, ignoring in some regions environmental regulations. Some saw the damage to the wall in Arizona in August 2021, therefore, as the expected fate of a boondoggle. Border Report, a news agency that focuses on the U.S.-Mexico border, reported on Aug. 17, 2021, that 2.15 inches of rain fell in Cochise County, Arizona. Those rains, though not out of character for the region, damaged a ""controversial special movable border wall gates that were built in river beds during the Trump administration."" We reached out to the U.S. Department of Home Security, which oversees border security, asking whether the damaged portion of the wall would be rebuilt and how much it would cost. We also asked that if the wall would be repaired and what would be done to prevent this damage from being a regular occurrence. In response, we received only the following emailed statement from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is conducting safety work to secure the project sites and will remove monsoon-related debris that impedes this work. Once these projects are turned over, CBP will assess any remaining make-safe/incomplete items and address them in accordance with the Department of Homeland Security's border wall plan The portion of the wall that was damaged consisted of movable gates placed in a riverbed that ""did not hold up to several feet of rising water that coursed through the desert borderlands region,"" per Border Report. According to the technology news site Gizmodo , the failure of that portion of the wall was predictable, reporting: It turns out ignoring bedrock environmental laws may not have been the best choice for a multibillion-dollar construction project. Photos show former President Donald Trump’s border wall in deep disrepair after summer monsoon rains literally blew floodgates off their hinges. Laiken Jordahl, borderlands campaigner for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Border Report: For years, we have been warning and predicting that exactly this would happen and while this was a significant rainfall, it wasn’t atypical. We always have heavy rains in the monsoon season. This was a highly predictable occurrence. The construction of this wall was so ill-advised and ill-conceived and rushed and inflicted a huge amount of damage for a wall that washed away in its first summer.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,546

U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have been pushing people to get vaccinated, though numerous videos and social media posts would claim this was not always the case. According to heavily edited footage, and claims by conservative outlets and Republicans, during the 2020 presidential elections Harris was an anti-vaxxer who discouraged people from getting the vaccine, and refused to get the “Trump vaccine.” Some of that footage can be seen here: Republican Rep. Billy Long from Missouri, while talking to NPR in July 2021 about vaccine hesitancy among his constituents, claimed, “Kamala Harris refused to take the vaccine when she was campaigning because it was a Trump vaccine.” Conservative blog Powerline stated, “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were themselves the most prominent of anti-vaxxers, and if some people took their skepticism too seriously, they have only themselves to blame.” These claims are incorrect, Harris never expressed doubt about the efficacy of the vaccine itself, but rather showed skepticism about the vaccine rollout under Trump and his inaccurate statements regarding COVID-19. She referenced Trump’s claims that were not based in scientific fact, such as his suggestion that people could inject disinfectants as a form of treatment for COVID-19. In an interview with CNN in September 2020 ( see transcript ), Harris responded to a question about whether she would get vaccinated if there was a vaccine approved before the elections. She said: Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us. I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump. And it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he's talking about. I will not take his word for it. He wants us to inject bleach. I -- no, I will not take his word. When asked by Bash if she would take Dr. Anthony Fauci’s word on whether the vaccine was safe, she added, “No, I think Dr. Fauci has proven, for anyone who's been watching him for years and years, to put the public health of the American people as the highest priority in terms of his work and his reputation and his priority.

97b3735a-448f-495b-a063-013af580422a,"U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation on Aug. 25, 2021, that allows veterans to train and then adopt service dogs trained to help veterans living with post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. The new law, Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers, or PAWS Act, was passed with bipartisan support in Congress. According to the law's text , placing a service dog with a veteran costs approximately $25,000. But research indicates these dogs can literally save lives by ameliorating the symptoms of PTSD and thus preventing veteran suicides. Under the law, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will partner with nonprofit organizations like K9s for Warriors, which provides service dogs to disabled veterans. It will give the veterans dogs to train that they will then have the opportunity to adopt. Service dogs help people with various disabilities navigate life. In the case of PTSD, the service dogs -- which can be any breed and, in the case of K9s for Warriors, are often shelter rescues -- are trained to do specific tasks that alleviate depression and anxiety. Tasks include interrupting panic attacks and provide assurance by providing physical cover to a veteran in the types of situations that trigger their PTSD. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health, suicide or substance use crisis or emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at suicidepreventionlifeline.org to connect to a trained crisis counselor.

a00f9bc8-b0a3-43dc-b2c4-889eb3b0389c,"As the Taliban took over major cities across Afghanistan, including Kabul, in August 2021, the U.S. government began efforts to repatriate its many citizens who were working and residing in the country. Desperate scenes of Afghans trying to board flights at Kabul airport went viral, along with reports of gunfire, and large crushing crowds resulting in many deaths . Amid this chaos, one State Department mandate came under scrutiny : Americans trying to catch one of the government chartered flights out of the country were to be charged $2,000 or more for the ticket. This rule was brought to the forefront by Politico , and caused outrage among U.S. politicians such as Ted Cruz, and many on social media. The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), a State Department division that provides security cooperation between the government and American private sector groups around the world, posted a notification on its website on Aug. 14, 2021, titled “Afghanistan, Repatriation Assistance for U.S. Citizens."" The alert said people eligible to board a repatriation flight had to be U.S. citizens, and were required to pay for the flight costs. It stated, “Repatriation flights are not free, and passengers will be required to sign a promissory loan agreement and may not be eligible to renew their U.S. passports until the loan is repaid. The cost may be $2,000USD or more per person.” After outrage spread, Ned Price, State Department spokesperson, told The Hill and Politico that “In these unique circumstances, we have no intention of seeking any reimbursement from those fleeing Afghanistan.” When asked by a Politico reporter if they would stop requiring evacuating citizens to sign a promissory loan agreement, he said, “Yes.” Mere days after the original OSAC security alert, it now carries this amendment to the statement, “OSAC notes that the costs involved in repatriation have changed since the U.S. Embassy in Kabul released this Alert. It remains correct for the date of its release, 8/14/2021, but has been superceded by follow-up alerts from the Embassy.” We should note that normally under federal law , “U.S. citizens must reimburse the State Department for evacuation and repatriation expenses incurred on their behalf.” This time, however, the State Department appears to have made an exception. We thus rate this claim as “True,” with the caveat that evacuees are no longer expected to reimburse the government for repatriation fees.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,451
b5278e69-cfd5-4795-910b-18839c2c3d0b,"On Aug. 22, 2021, as former U.S. President Donald Trump held a rally in Alabama, a photograph started circulating on social media that supposedly showed a list of prohibited items: This is a genuine list of items prohibited from Trump rallies. The majority of the items come from a list of prohibited objects maintained by the U.S. Secret Service . While the majority of the items listed above were culled from that Secret Service list, the above-displayed list also prohibits several additional items, such as alcohol, tripods, and appliances or toasters. The above-displayed list appears to be relatively standard for Trump rallies. We found guidelines for several of Trump's previous rallies that also prohibited these items. Before a rally at Eerie National Airport in October 2020, for example, the local news outlet YourErie.com reported that the following items were prohibited at the event: Prohibited Items List • Aerosols • Alcoholic beverages • Backpacks, bags, roller bags, suitcases bags exceeding size restrictions (12”x14”x5”) • Balloons • Balls • Banners, signs, placards • Chairs • Coolers • Drones and other unmanned aircraft systems • Explosives of any kind (including fireworks) • Glass, thermal and metal containers • Laser lights and laser pointers • E-Cigarrettes and Vaping Devices • Mace and/or pepper spray • Noisemakers, such as air horns, whistles, drums, bullhorns, etc. • Packages • Poles, sticks and selfie sticks • Spray containers • Structures • Supports for signs/placards • Tripods • Umbrellas • Appliances (i.e. Toasters) • And any other items that may pose a threat to the security of the event as determined by and at the discretion of the security screeners. The Sheriff's Department in Cullman County, where the August 2021 Trump rally was held, told us that the prohibited items list was put together by the Secret Service and the event organizers. As the Secret Service's list of prohibited items does not include appliances, it seems reasonable that this item was added by the Trump team. It should be noted, however, that while the idea that ""Trump bans toasters"" may sound funny, there could be a good reason for prohibiting appliances. One possible reason is that some appliances, such as pressure cookers , have been used to make homemade bombs. We reached out to the Secret Service, Trump's Save America Pac, and rally host York Family Farms for more information, and we will update this article accordingly if we hear back. While there may be a good reason to prohibit appliances, we viewed the prohibited items list for a few large events held for Trump's predecessor, former President Barack Obama, and found no mention of toasters.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,505
4785e8be-b9f2-46b5-8c92-85acf4815885,"As the Taliban took over Afghanistan in mid-August 2021, and foreign powers departed from the region, many analyzed the role of successive U.S. governments in creating and exacerbating the problem. One meme in particular targeted the administration of former U.S. President Donald Trump for its part in releasing a major Taliban figure, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. The meme claims that, “In 2018 Trump helped Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar get released from prison. In 2020, Trump’s Secretary of State met with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. In 2021, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar appears set to become the new president of Afghanistan under Taliban rule.” Baradar was captured by American and Pakistani agents in 2010, and was held by Pakistan for most of the decade. Then-President Hamid Karzai had been trying to get the Pakistani government to release him for years, hoping that it would jumpstart peace talks. As the U.S. began the process of peace talks with the Taliban, the U.S. also worked on pressuring the Pakistani government to release him. Then finally in 2018 , the Pakistani government succumbed to U.S. pressure and released Baradar. Trump selected special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to facilitate the peace process. Khalilzad admitted in a 2019 talk at the U.S. Institute for Peace that he had requested the release of Baradar. He argued that Baradar had a reputation of being more “pro-peace.” He made the comments around 39 minutes into the video below: In September 2020, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted a photograph of himself meeting with Baradar, to mark the beginning of peace negotiations between the U.S. and the Taliban. This is the same photograph that was used in the above meme. Baradar met Pompeo twice in 2020, and even spoke to Trump on the phone, according to The Economist . Negotiators described Baradar as quiet and difficult to read, but also as someone who was always able to facilitate a breakthrough. Others complained that he controlled communication very tightly, not allowing much room for dialogue in other meetings. Right before the Taliban took over Kabul, Baradar was its public face, assuring American diplomats that they could evacuate before they arrived. He is widely considered to be one of the main, publicly known leaders among the Taliban since the collapse of the Afghan government, making statements that have been spread on social media. He has also been a central figure in the movement from its earliest days under Mullah Omar, acting as a military commander during the Taliban takeover in 1994, according to The Wall Street Journal. Despite Baradar currently being a central figure in the Taliban, it is not yet known how it will form a government, nor has it made any announcement of who would be a possible “president” or similar figure. Many online outlets are predicting that he could be the possible leader of Afghanistan under the Taliban.

82764695-61a0-431e-a995-105a305f6ca1,"On Aug. 13, 2021, a new Facebook meme appeared to compare gasoline prices under U.S. Presidents Trump and Biden. The post was virally shared well over 66,000 times in just four days. The viral meme. In reality, this comparison was highly misleading. The picture on the left side of the gas prices meme, labeled ""Trump,"" shows a price range from $1.22 to $1.72. We found the original photograph . The caption said that the picture was taken on April 20, 2020, in Plano, Texas. Trump was then in the final year of his presidency. According to the Associated Press , the price at the Plano pump was less than the national average at the time, which was around $1.78 per gallon. The photograph on the right side of the meme, labeled ""Biden,"" likely shows high gas prices in a big city such as Los Angeles. It was likely was shot in 2021. We were unable to find a source for the picture. A comparison of two seemingly cherry-picked pictures of gas prices that were likely from different states might lead to viral shares and perhaps some personal political validation. However, in the end, it makes very little sense. On April 21, 2020, the day after the photograph on the left half of the meme was shot in Plano, Texas, showing gas prices between $1.22 and $1.72, The Associated Press published that a barrel of oil cost ""less than a cheap bottle of wine."" The reason for this was simple: The demand for oil had dropped dramatically due to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The reporting also mentioned that pumps were ""still running"" and ""extracting oil from the ground,"" and ""all that oil has to go somewhere."" This continual flow of supply drove down gas prices. On May 26, 2021, The Associated Press reported again on gas costs, explaining why prices were so much higher than the year before. The story partially focused on the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack , described as ""a cyberextortion attempt on a vital U.S. pipeline that carries fuel from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast."" Biden’s policies aren’t behind the price increases. Gas prices are up because of a rapid and unexpected bounce-back in demand, and because of lingering problems from the forced shutdown early this month of the Colonial Pipeline , which provides 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast. ... Gasoline prices didn’t fall [in 2020] because of the Trump administration, as Trump often claims; they plunged because of the coronavirus forcing people to abandon their offices, schools, business trips, and vacations. Underscoring the connection to the pandemic shutdown, U.S. gas prices were at their lowest in April 2020 when people were staying home most but have mostly risen since then, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration, even when Trump was still in office. In July 2021, the average gas price in Los Angeles County and other surrounding counties in California was $4.15, well under the cost of $5.59 seen in the meme. Further, as of July 25, the average national gas price was $3.22 per gallon , a far cry from $5.59. In sum, though it's true that average gasoline prices nationwide were significantly lower at one particular point during the Trump administration than they were in July 2021 under Biden, the Trump/Biden meme doesn't provide an accurate snapshot of what those national averages actually looked like at each point in time. Moreover, the ups and downs of gasoline prices aren't necessarily a function of a given administration's policies. We've seen other gas price memes and claims before. In December 2020, we looked at a grossly misleading post that attempted to claim that one gas station near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., was representative of the average cost of fuel nationwide. We also previously reported the facts on claims of energy independence, finding that fossil fuel exports began to decline in 2020, before Biden took office. Additionally, we published a story about Facebook commenters being fooled by a picture of a single expensive California gas station that's notorious for jacking up prices.",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,800

The U.S. rushed in troops to protect its own evacuating diplomats and others at the Kabul airport. But the president expressed no second thoughts about his decision to stick by the U.S. commitment, formulated during the Trump administration, to end America’s longest war, no matter what.

Locke's remarks, which were first reported by Right Wing Watch , came in the context of his Aug. 8 sermon at the Global Vision Bible Church in Juliet, Tennessee.

Look, if that don't bother you, you might as well show up at another church next week. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD8g1loSeoU While it's not entirely clear what ""its own authorized pages of a signature"" means, it appears Locke was referring to Executive Order 83 , signed by Lee on Aug. 6, which was entitled ""An Order to Facilitate the Continued Response to COVID-19."" Examination of the text of the order reveals that Locke either fundamentally misunderstood, or grossly misrepresented, its contents, and we are issuing a rating of ""False."" Section 8 of that order grants the governor discretion to deploy the National Guard and State Guard in certain supplementary healthcare roles if hospital and care facility capacity and human resources are stretched, including ambulance driving and COVID-19 testing. Section 18 is subtitled ""Temporary quarantine and isolation facilities may be constructed,"" and states: The provisions of Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 68-11-202(c)(1)-(8), are hereby suspended to allow for the construction of temporary structures, the plans for which would otherwise be subject to review for new construction, additions, or substantial alterations, as directed by the Commissioner of Health and the Director of TEMA in response to COVID-19; provided, that there shall be inspections of such structures to ensure safety, as necessary. Section 68-11-202(c) of the Tennessee Code sets out various planning and building regulations that relate to any facility that requires licensing by the state Department of Health (i.e. healthcare facilities), including the requirement to submit detailed construction and use plans to the department, and obtain permission to begin construction. In suspending those regulations, Lee's order would speed up the process of building temporary quarantine and isolation facilities, should they be required, for individuals who are obliged to quarantine or self-isolate because they have tested positive for COVID-19, or are a close contact of someone in that position. Although many private businesses require proof of vaccination in order to access goods and services, and some state and local governments are considering proposals to introduce ""vaccine passports,"" quarantine and self-isolation regulations are in place for those who have tested positive for COVID-19 , and their close contacts — not individuals who are unvaccinated.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a debate has arisen over the influx of migrants from the U.S.-Mexico border, and their alleged role in spreading the virus in the United States. The argument that they have played such a role was repeated by Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz on Fox News and in his public statements, and by right-wing news outlets like Breitbart. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also said , ""I can tell you, whatever variants are around the world, they're coming across that southern border."" Our readers referenced a Fox News report from border town McAllen, Texas, which said around 7,000 migrants who tested positive for COVID-19 after being released by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) — and were later quarantined by Catholic Charities — have been released into the city since February 2021. We received questions about circulating claims to the effect that U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration was allowing ""hundreds of thousands"" of “illegal” migrants to enter the country without being testing for COVID-19, quarantining, or even getting vaccinated. According to numerous public health experts, and as reported by The Associated Press and The Washington Post , migrants and asylum seekers are not behind a surge in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. In fact, they enter the country through a process of detainment, where high-risk people are tested by health services, with some being isolated, and some getting vaccinations. How does the process at the border start? According to data released from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), officials logged around 1.1 million ""apprehensions"" at the U.S.-Mexico border this fiscal year until June 2021. Some 34% of those crossing the border in June had tried to cross the border at least once before in the past year. According to a Washington Post analysis, apprehensions at the border fall under two categories: Title 8 and Title 42. The former involves apprehending someone at the border and taking the person to a detention facility. The latter, which was implemented under former U.S. President Donald Trump, allows border officials to use the pandemic as a reason to immediately turn people away at the border. According to CBP numbers , hundreds of thousands of people apprehended at the border were almost immediately expelled under Title 42, or on COVID-19 grounds. According to The Associated Press , the CBP stopped and expelled 82% of single adults attempting to enter the country in June 2021, for example. So the claim that ""hundreds of thousands"" of migrants were entering the country is belied by the fact that many recorded apprehensions have resulted in immediate expulsion on health grounds. But according to The Washington Post that still leaves many migrants in U.S. custody, including around 75,000 in June 2021 alone. Those migrants are put through a range of processes depending on their health, symptoms, and more. We reached out to the CBP, who gave us this statement: CBP provides migrants with PPE from the moment they are taken into custody, and migrants are required to keep masks on at all times, including when they are transferred or in the process of being released. If anyone exhibits signs of illness in CBP custody, they are referred to local health systems for appropriate testing, diagnosis, and treatment. CBP takes its responsibility to prevent the spread of communicable diseases very seriously. We value our partners in local communities whose work is critical to moving individuals safely out of CBP/USBP custody and through the appropriate immigration pathway. While CBP does not appear to be testing everyone in custody, the agency does transfer migrants to other health facilities and federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), where the procedures vary. ICE claims to test everyone in its custody. According to its COVID-19 response requirements , the agency does, “Test all newly detained persons before they join the rest of the population in the detention facility.” Border Patrol officials in Texas said that they simply did not have the capacity to test everyone for coronavirus upon arrival and doing so would force migrants to remain in crowded facilities for longer, leaving it to nonprofits like Catholic Charities to arrange testing. According to The Associated Press , ICE also began vaccinating detained immigrants, and the government innoculated unaccompanied children over 12 with the Pfizer vaccine. ICE told CNN in July that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had begun administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, with an initial allocation of 10,000 doses that would be replenished on a rolling basis. As of early July , more than 8,000 ICE detainees had received one dose of a vaccine, and 1,307 received two doses. Now, whether these official policies are being effectively applied is another story. According to one report by The Washington Post , there have been numerous recorded instances of ICE failing to notify partner agencies of known COVID-positive asylum seekers arriving in their midst. In such cases, the immigrants had to handle the notifying themselves, like a man from Cameroon who asked volunteers meeting him to “Stand back” when he arrived in a California border city. Many advocates have complained that ICE had given them no advance notice. Some advocates say that migrants are catching COVID-19 once they're in the U.S. because of poor planning by ICE, and not bringing it in themselves. In August 2021, reports emerged of a COVID outbreak in a Tacoma, Washington, facility housing ICE detainees, infecting around 150 since June. Other reports detail how asylum seekers are being released without receiving their COVID-19 test results in states like Louisiana and Mississippi, though these do not number in the hundreds of thousands. Whistleblowers from the DHS sent a letter in late June to Biden administration officials urging them to do more work vaccinating immigrants in federal custody. They claimed that immigrant detention facilities “continue to be a significant source of spread for COVID and [cause] disproportionate harm to detainees, workers and the public, yet DHS has still not implemented a comprehensive plan to address the spread of COVID in immigration detention facilities.” What about the thousands who are reportedly being released in Texas? The data being shared by conservative media about the 7,000 migrants in McAllen, Texas, who tested positive, lacks context . According to American Immigration Council’s Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, who spoke to The Washington Post , “Migrants are in many ways the most tested group in the country. No other group of people in the entire country is being tested at a near-100 percent rate. So when we talk about infection rates of migrants, what we actually know is that a lot of people who are testing positive are asymptomatic; who, if they were in the United States, would have just never been tested.” Migrants who test positive are moved to hotels and other spaces to quarantine, for the most part. Indeed, the Fox News article about McAllen stated , “Immigrants released by CBP are dropped off with Catholic Charities and tested for COVID by a third party. If they test positive, they are asked to quarantine and offered a room at a quarantine site.” (This particular statement did not appear in an archived version of the Fox News story, but cropped up later .) As of August 2021, an estimated 2,000 migrant s are being quarantined in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, after testing positive. Public health experts by and large agree that the rise in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is not due to migrants who are isolated and tested in larger numbers than communities in the United States. Dr. Joseph McCormick, a physician and former CDC epidemiologist, told The Associated Press that the number of migrants entering the country is too small to be behind the uptick in cases. COVID-19 has been spreading outside of border states, and many argue it is due in part to the large numbers of unvaccinated people already in the country. Dr. Iván Meléndez, a health official in Hidalgo County said in an August press conference, ""Is this a pandemic of the migrants? No, it’s a pandemic of the unvaccinated."" According to a New York Times report, in Hidalgo County, Texas, the migrant positivity rate was about 16 percent in early August 2021, compared with 17.59 percent for residents. The exact total number of asylum seekers who were released untested, unvaccinated, or positive with COVID-19 to third parties are difficult to determine. We know based on a number of cases publicly available to us that a few hundred fell through the cracks over an extended period of time largely due to federal agencies inefficiencies, but those groups are not responsible for the surge in cases overall. Overall, the assertion that thousands of migrants entering the country are not being tested, quarantined, or vaccinated, and are spreading COVID-19 as a result, is incorrect. However, it appears federal agencies could do more to ensure effective health facilities are provided to migrants and comprehensive vaccination plans are developed. As such, we rate this claim as “Mostly False.”",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1768

Since a public apology of that kind would constitute official government acknowledgement of the conspiracy theory, it is clearly the most significant and substantive claim made in the video. As such, we are issuing a rating of ""False."" The video was posted on July 26 by @tcezy, and contained the following text: Mind-blowing things you didn't know, [Part] 1. ""Stranger Things"" was based on true events. The Montauk Project, 1940s-1980s... The ""Montauk monsters."" They were found on an insland [sic] washed up right near where the Montauk experiments were happening. Bill Clinton even had to apologize on live TV for the experiments and runaway orphans. At the point, the video incorporated a clip of Clinton, standing at a podium saying: What was done cannot be undone... What the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry. In reality, Clinton's remarks were part of his historic official apology, made in 1997, for the Tuskegee experiment — a 40-year government-run study of syphilis in Black men — which is now regarded as a stark and shocking example of unethical and racist biomedical research. From the 1930s until the 1970s, hundreds of Black men in rural Alabama were told by researchers that they were being treated for syphilis, but were not in fact given any treatment, even though penicillin was widely available from the 1940s onwards. Hundreds of men died of syphilis, or from syphilis-related complications, as a direct result of this inhumane treatment. In May 1997, Clinton delivered a speech in the East Room of the White House, and issued a formal presidential apology, on behalf of the U.S. government, for the treatment of the men involved, and their families: The United States government did something that was wrong — deeply, profoundly, morally wrong. It was an outrage to our commitment to integrity and equality for all our citizens. To the survivors, to the wives and family members, the children and the grandchildren, I say what you know: No power on Earth can give you back the lives lost, the pain suffered, the years of internal torment and anguish. What was done cannot be undone. But we can end the silence. We can stop turning our heads away. We can look at you in the eye and finally say on behalf of the American people, what the United States government did was shameful, and I am sorry. The American people are sorry — for the loss, for the years of hurt. You did nothing wrong, but you were grievously wronged. I apologize and I am sorry that this apology has been so long in coming. https://youtu.be/F8Kr-0ZE1XY?t=1346 It is true that ""Stranger Things"" was based in part on the Montauk Project conspiracy theory (though that theory itself is not accurate). The series begins in November 1983, with the disappearance of a local boy in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, and the escape from a secret government research facility of a young girl with telekinetic abilities. When Netflix first commissioned the series in 2015, it had the working title of ""Montauk,"" and was set in Montauk, on Long Island, New York.

Biden said he was ""raised by an automobile man"" (his father used to sell cars ) and then added that he ""used to drive an 18-wheeler ... I got to."" Biden did not elaborate on this comment as the tour moved on to the next vehicle. The nine-second clip above can be seen at the eight-minute mark of the following video: So, did Biden ever drive an 18-wheeler? The president certainly was never a professional trucker . As the RNC notes above, Biden has spent the vast majority of his professional life as a politician. He became a U.S. senator in 1973. Before that, he worked at a law firm. Biden appears to be referring to a 500-mile trip he took in 1973 on a 47,000-pound cargo truck carrying hollow-shell pipe. Biden, a freshman senator at the time, said that he took the trip because he ""wanted a firsthand account from the truckers, who say they carry 50 percent of all the goods shipped within the United States.""

In July 2021, unreliable sources reported that the security detail of French President Emanuel Macron had resigned en masse, in protest against COVID-19 vaccine passport requirements. On July 24, for example, the website of right-wing radio personality Hal Turner, a frequent source of misinformation in recent years, published an article with the headline: ""SHOCK! Protective Detail of France President ALL Resign over COVID Restrictions; will no longer protect President Macron."" The article asserted that: The Republican Guard, a security detail established to protect the President of France, have ALL resigned, and will no longer protect President Macron! The mass resignation comes on the heels of his Presidential Decree requiring French citizens to have and use a ""Sanitary Passport"" (i.e. Vaccine Certificate) or be denied access to stores, bars, even DENIED VOTING! On July 26, TheBL.com (The Beauty of Life) posted a similar report , based on Turner's article. In 2019, a Snopes investigation revealed close links between TheBL.com and The Epoch Times, a controversial pro-Trump publication known for promulgating politically-motivated misinformation . Both articles cited initial remarks made by Martine Wonner, a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic and member of the French Assemblée Nationale (equivalent to the U.S. House of Representatives). The claim that the Republican Guard (""Garde républicaine"") had resigned en masse over the impending introduction of vaccine passports in France was false. The article on Turner's website also inaccurately characterized that body as being Macron's personal security detail. The video of Wonner was taken from a July 22 interview she conducted for an anti-lockdown, COVID-19-skeptic Facebook group called Les Colères des Rues (""Anger on the Streets."") In it, Wonner railed against the COVID-19 mitigation policies introduced by Macron's centrist government and passed by the Senate and Assembly, in particular the "" pass sanitaire "" — a health passport certifying full vaccination, recent recovery from COVID-19, or a negative COVID-19 test — which will be required in order to attend public venues and events. At one point in the interview, around 27 minutes in, Wonner claimed she had spoken with law enforcement officers who told her they had ""had enough,"" and were ""on the side of the people"" in opposing COVID-related restrictions. She added: You know the Republican Guard, who protect the president, Macron? They've quit. The Republican Guard no longer wishes to ensure the protection of the president. It's absolutely incredible. Of course, they've put in place a different protection set-up, but I mean, that is a highly symbolic message to send. It reassures the public, but also shows where we're at... In reality, the Republican Guard had not resigned. A spokesperson for the Gendarmerie Nationale — one of two branches of France's national police, and the one to which the Republican Guard reports — confirmed for the Agence France-Presse news agency that the body was continuing to perform its duties. According to the Republican Guard's website , those duties include: taking part in important state ceremonies and providing musical accompaniment; guarding and providing security at several prominent state buildings, including the Elysée Palace, the French president's official residence; providing ad hoc assistance to other law enforcement agencies; providing escorts to dignitaries and officials. While the Republican Guard does indirectly provide a measure of security for the president, through its guarding of the Elysée Palace, the body responsible specifically for the president's personal protection is the Groupe de sécurité de la Presidence de la République ( GSPR ), which is an agency of France's second national police force, the Police Nationale. We could find no official statement, social media post or reputable news report in France which supported the claim that either the Republican Guard or GSPR had abandoned their duties or were refusing to provide protection to Macron.

0251c952-ea0d-4e69-8ce3-9f8337f352d9,"On July 27, 2021, a bipartisan group of politicians began their investigation into the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 by hearing testimony and posing questions to four police officers from the U.S. Capitol Police and Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department. As this hearing got underway, members of the Republican Party, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, held a press conference in which they attempted to place partial blame for the attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. McCarthy made similar accusations during an appearance on Fox News a week prior. During that appearance, the minority leader posed the question: ""Was there a decision by the Speaker not to have the National Guard at the Capitol that day?"" Pelosi did not prevent the National Guard from responding to the attack on the Capitol. Pelosi does not have direct control of the National Guard. Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, told CNN : ""The Speaker of the House does not oversee security of the U.S. Capitol, nor does this official oversee the Capitol Police Board."" There are still some questions as to why Capitol Police appeared ill-prepared for the attack and why the National Guard's response was delayed. We looked more into those questions here . Generally speaking, however, the National Guard in Washington, D.C., reports to the president of the United States. Neither the speaker of the House (Pelosi), nor the minority leader of the Senate (Mitch McConnell), has control of the National Guard. The D.C. National Guard writes on its websites (emphasis ours): Today’s D.C. National Guard remains strong with more than 2,700 Soldiers and Airmen available to execute its missions. D.C. National Guard Soldiers and Airmen resides within the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, and are proud to be from the communities in which we protect and serve. The D.C National Guard was formed in 1802 by President Thomas Jefferson to defend the newly created District of Columbia. As such, the Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard is subordinate solely to the President of the United States. This authority to activate the D.C. National Guard has been delegated, by the President, to the Secretary of Defense and further delegated to the Secretary of the Army. The D.C. National Guard is the only National Guard unit, out of all of the 54 states and territories, which reports only to the President. The D.C. National Guard provides mission-ready personnel and units for active duty in the armed services in the time of war or national emergency. The D.C. National Guard also retains the mission as protector of the District of Columbia. The Capitol Police Board, which oversees the Capitol Police, did request assistance from the National Guard after the riot broke loose. While a member of this board, the House sergeant-at-arms, does report to Pelosi, there's no indication that Pelosi prevented this official from calling the National Guard. Furthermore, another member of the board, the Senate sergeant-at-arms, reports to the leading Republican member of the Senate, Mitch McConnell. There's no evidence that McConnell prevented this official from calling for support either. Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for Pelosi, said in a statement : “The Speaker believes security officials should make security decisions. The Speaker immediately signaled her support for the deployment of the National Guard when she was presented with that recommendation on the afternoon of January 6th. Public testimony confirms the fact that the Speaker was not made aware of any request for such a deployment prior to then."" It should also be noted that Steven A. Sund, then-U.S. Capitol Police chief, Paul D. Irving, then-House sergeant-at-arms, and Michael C. Stenger, then-Senate sergeant-at-arms, have all testified about the events of Jan. 6, and none of them insinuated that they were prevented from calling the National Guard by congressional leadership. Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser also requested for the National Guard to be called in during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. That request was denied by the Pentagon, not Pelosi: In March 2021, Major General William Walker, the commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, testified before a House subcommittee that he relayed a request from the Capitol Police for military support to the Army at around 2 p.m. It wasn't until after 5 p.m., however, that request was approved by the Defense Department. The Associated Press reported : Defense Department leaders placed unusual restrictions on the National Guard for the day of the Capitol riot and delayed sending help for hours despite an urgent plea from police for reinforcement, according to testimony Wednesday that added to the finger-pointing about the government response. Maj. Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, told senators that the then-chief of the Capitol Police requested military support in a “voice cracking with emotion” in a 1:49 p.m. call as rioters began pushing toward the Capitol. Walker said he immediately relayed the request to the Army but did not learn until after 5 p.m. that the Defense Department had approved it. Guard troops who had been waiting on buses were then rushed to the Capitol, arriving in 18 minutes, Walker said. The hourslong delay cost the National Guard precious minutes in the early hours of the Jan. 6 rioting, with Walker saying he could have gotten personnel into the building within 20 minutes of getting approval. As it stood, the support did not happen until the evening. The delay also stood in contrast to the swift authorization for National Guard deployment that Walker said was granted in response to the civil unrest that roiled Washington last June as an outgrowth of racial justice protests. Pelosi did not prevent the National Guard from responding to the Capitol attack. Pelosi does not have control of the National Guard.

b8173796-f79c-41ce-89d7-f3177bd75933,"In July 2021, we received several inquiries from Snopes readers regarding remarks that U.S. President Joe Biden made about baseless QAnon-related conspiracy theories which posit that Democrats and political progressives, as a group, ""suck the blood of children."" During a CNN townhall event in Cincinnati, Ohio on July 21, host Don Lemon asked Biden about the partisan rancor surrounding efforts by congressional Democrats to set up an inquiry into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, and struck a pessimistic note about the broader prospects of bipartisan collaboration, asking Biden: ""If Republicans and Democrats can’t come together — right? — to investigate the biggest attack on our Capitol in 200 years, what makes you think that they can come together on anything?"" In response, Biden spoke about misinformation around the events at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and the role of misinformation and conspiracy theories in deepening mutual misunderstanding and conflict between Democrats and Republicans in the United States. A video of the exchange can be watched below, but the following is an edited transcript of Biden's response: The fact is, you can’t look at that television and say, “Nothing happened on the 6th.”  You can’t listen to people who say this was a “peaceful march.” ...I’ve been through the other end of this when the Democrats, 35 years ago, were way off to the other side. ...I have faith in the American people — I really do — to ultimately get to the right place. And, by the way, many times Republicans are in the right place.  I don’t mean that the Repub- — that it’s always the Democratic point of view. But some of the stuff — I mean, QAnon: The idea that the Democrats or that Biden is hiding people and sucking the blood of children and — no, I’m serious.  That’s — Now, you may not like me, and that’s your right... But the kinds of things that are being said of late, I think you’re beginning to see some of the — and both — and by Democrats as well — sort of the venom get — sort of — sort of leak out a lot of it.  We got to get beyond this. Biden was referring to a set of false claims , linked to the QAnon cluster of conspiracy theories, that ""globalist elites"" including Biden, Bill and Hillary Clinton, and other prominent figures in progressive politics, the news media, and the Democratic party, engage in mass satanic ritual child abuse, including drinking the blood of children . Such claims are utterly false. During the 2020 presidential election campaign, followers of those theories predominantly supported outgoing President Donald Trump, whom they largely viewed as a tacit supporter or even leader of their (QAnon's) movement, and vehemently opposed Biden, whom they viewed as either complicit, or an active participant in, the nonexistent liberal conspiracy of child sacrifice. In context, then, the sense of Biden's remarks at the CNN townhall in July 2021 was clear, and he was making the perfectly uncontroversial point that while he strongly supports bipartisan collaboration on important matters of policy and procedure, such collaboration is made much more difficult in light of what he regards as misinformation and disagreement about basic facts — for example, in relation to the events of Jan. 6 — and the fact that a non-trivial cohort of those who typically vote for Republican House and Senate candidates, believe Biden and other Democrats are engaged in the worst kind of ritual child abuse imaginable. Biden made another reference to the ""drinking children's blood"" theory, while speaking to reporters upon his return to the White House after the CNN townhall on July 21. Shelby Talcott, from the right-wing Daily Caller website, asked Biden about the Democratic position on police reform and the ""defund the police"" movement. It's important to note that Biden has long since repeatedly clarified that he opposes efforts to ""defund the police,"" and prominent congressional Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer have also pushed back against that movement, popular among some left-wing activists within the Democratic coalition. A video of the brief exchange between Talcott and Biden can be viewed here . Below is a transcript: Talcott: Mr. President, can you clarify what you said about no — that there’s no — no one in the Democratic Party is anti-police? Biden: I didn’t say that. Talcott: I know that you said you don’t want to defund the police — Biden: I said that that — that is not the Democratic Party’s position. Talcott: Okay. Biden: I’m the Democratic Party; I am President.  So is the Speaker of the House and so is the –- the Majority Leader.  We are not the defunding the police. Talcott: Okay.  And are there people who — in the Democratic Party, who want to defund the police? Biden: Are there people in the Republican Party who think we’re sucking the blood out of kids? Talcott: I'm not sure... Biden: [Laughs and walks away]. In context, the sense of Biden's remarks was again clear in this second instance. After Biden made it clear that he and other leaders within the Democratic Party are opposed to defunding the police, Talcott again asked whether some people within the party favored that policy. Biden retorted by asking whether some people within the Republican Party supported the belief that Biden and other Democrats were engaged in child blood harvesting, making the point that controversial views among some party members was not the sole province of the Democrats, and also that those prevalent on the fringes of the GOP were much more destructive and outrageous. One can dispute the accuracy of that argument, but the point being made by Biden was clear and, in itself, coherent. Despite this context, and despite the fact that ""child sacrifice,"" ritual child abuse, and ""blood harvesting"" theories were a highly publicized and widely reported fringe feature of the 2020 presidential election (Trump himself even promoted the false claim that Biden was a pedophile), several right-wing commentators expressed apparent bafflement at Biden's references to ""sucking the blood of children,"" and some described the president as being ""obsessed"" with the subject, thus passively promoting the underlying conspiracy theory of Biden's personal involvement in child sacrifice. 'Perhaps His Answer Is Part of Some Weird Fantasy' For example, on July 23 the right-wing, pro-Trump commentator Benny Johnson, a known source of politically-motivated disinformation, posted a video to Facebook with the headline ""Biden rants about sucking children's blood at the White House,"" a formulation of words which could quite foreseeably promote the outrageous conspiracy itself, because it conspicuously did not make clear that Biden was referring critically to the belief in the conspiracy theory , among some Republicans, rather than ""ranting about sucking children's blood"" itself. The video was also accompanied by a mocked-up photograph of Biden with vampire fangs: Johnson said the president's exchange with Talcott was evidence that he is ""clinically unwell,"" but speculated he may have been referring to ""some fringe QAnon conspiracy theory that no one's ever heard of,"" even though it was widely reported during the 2020 presidential election campaign, and evidently well known enough for Johnson himself to quickly make the obvious connection, which was made even more obvious by the fact that, earlier that same evening, Biden had already explicitly referred to it as a ""QAnon"" theory. Similarly, former Trump campaign attorney Jenna Ellis tweeted out a video clip from the exchange with Talcott, along with the text:  ""Anyone else concerned how obsessed Joe Biden is with sucking blood out of kids?"" Again, this characterization grossly misrepresented the fact that Biden was, for the second time in one evening, citing the existence of a right-wing conspiracy theory about child sacrifice to make a broader point about the difficulties of bipartisan consensus, rather than articulating a personal fixation on the fictional practice of blood harvesting itself. By reframing Biden's remarks in this way, and describing him as ""obsessed,"" Ellis' tweet likely served to further promulgate the underlying conspiracy theory, namely that Biden himself is personally involved in drinking children's blood. Likewise, the conservative website Red State called Biden's remarks ""creepy"" and speculated : ""Perhaps his answer is part of some weird fantasy he’s been suppressing..."" If, at first glance, Biden's remarks appeared odd, that's because the conspiracy theory to which he was referring is, itself, exceedingly weird. In bringing it up on July 21, Biden was highlighting a real, widely known and highly publicized conspiracy theory, popular among a vocal cohort of right-wing Americans and supporters of Trump, as an example of the kind of rhetorical excesses that have taken root among sections of the right in recent years, as well as an inflammatory set of allegations that, for obvious reasons, has the potential to constitute a two-way obstacle to bipartisan cooperation. Any response or commentary that expresses bafflement or concern about the sense of Biden's remarks must therefore be indicative of either blatant intellectual dishonesty, or an unfortunate lack of basic knowledge about political rhetoric in the United States in the past few years. Finally, Snopes itself was caught up in the wave of reactions to Biden's remarks. On July 23, Kyle Mann, editor-in-chief of the self-described satirical website the Babylon Bee, tweeted out what appeared to be a screenshot from a Snopes fact check of the claim ""Do Democrats suck the blood of children?"" along with the rating ""Mostly False."" Mann added: ""Well that's a relief,"" with the point being that any rating other than ""False"" would seem to imply there was, rather worryingly, an element of truth to the claim that Democrats ""suck the blood of children"": Of course, the screenshot was entirely bogus, and there is not an iota of truth to that claim. Snopes had not published any such fact check at the time Mann posted his tweet, and this fact check carries an unequivocal rating of ""False.""",fake,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,1958
59930580-3f11-4449-9444-a8b0d8791c1d,"On July 21, 2021, comedian Adam Carolla shared a video on social media that supposedly showed two people stealing merchandise from a store. The video was accompanied by a message claiming that ""thefts under $950 will not be prosecuted"" thanks to California's Proposition 47 law. This is not true. For one, Prop 47 is not a new law. It was approved by a majority of California voters back in 2014. More importantly, Prop 47 does not legalize theft under $950. The judicial branch of California explains on its page about Prop 47 that the new law ""reclassifies certain theft and drug possession offenses from felonies to misdemeanors."" Thanks to Prop 47, shoplifting offenses involving property valued at less than $950 are prosecuted as misdemeanors, not felonies, but they are still prosecuted. Such offenses are punishable by up to six months in county jail. Shoplifting. The proposition added Penal Code section 459.5 to create a new misdemeanor offense called ""shoplifting,"" punishable by up to 6 months in county jail. Shoplifting would be defined as ""entering a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny while that establishment is open during regular business hours"" where the value of the property does not exceed $950. Any other entry into a commercial establishment with intent to commit larceny is burglary. Any act of shoplifting as defined above must be charged as shoplifting. No person charged with shoplifting may also be charged with burglary or theft of the same property. The above-displayed video, which reportedly shows two people shoplifting from a TJ Maxx in Granada Hills , is one of several videos that was circulated online in the summer of 2021 in support of the claim that crime was on the rise in California. However, San Francisco Police Chief William Scott said that the statistics don't support that narrative, pointing to a mid-year report showing that burglaries were down 6 % in the first six months of 2021. It should also be noted that California is not the only state that has raised the bar for felony convictions. Since 2000, at least 37 states have enacted laws that raised the threshold for what constitutes felony theft. In 2017, Pew Charitable Trusts examined how these laws impacted the crime rate and found that ""raising the felony theft threshold has no impact on overall property crime or larceny rates."" Pew Trusts wrote: Critics have warned that these higher cutoff points might embolden offenders and cause property crime, particularly larceny, to rise. To determine whether their concerns have proved to be true, The Pew Charitable Trusts examined crime trends in the 30 states that raised their felony theft thresholds between 2000 and 2012, a period that allows analysis of each jurisdiction from three years before to three years after the policy change. Pew also compared trends in states that raised their thresholds during this period with those that did not. This chartbook, which updates and reinforces an analysis published in 2016, illustrates three important conclusions: Raising the felony theft threshold has no impact on overall property crime or larceny rates. States that increased their thresholds reported roughly the same average decrease in crime as the 20 states that did not change their theft laws. The amount of a state’s felony theft threshold—whether it is $500, $1,000, $2,000, or more—is not correlated with its property crime and larceny rates. We looked at a similar claim back in 2020.

Without social media, Trump has started to issue statements via email which are then reposted to social media by his supporters and journalists. As social media users can't see these statements posted on Trump's own timeline for themselves, they are often left wondering if they are authentic. We've been asked about a few of these statements in the past. For example: Yes, Trump wished a happy Father's Day to the "" the losers of the world, "" and yes, he wished a Happy Easter to the "" radical left crazies .""",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,403
08a3eebb-0134-4d31-957a-0e5563225e0e,"In the first half of 2021, more of Florida’s manatees have died than in any other year in state history records, according to new estimates published by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. At least 841 manatees died in Florida waters between Jan. 1 and July 2, 2021, breaking a previous record of 830 manatee deaths in 2013 following a red tide outbreak. (By comparison, the five-year average has been 352 deaths per year.) Wildlife officials blame the mass mortality event on a large die-off of seagrass, manatees’ primary food source, along a large mangrove wetland area known as Indian River Lagoon. ""Unprecedented manatee mortality due to starvation was documented on the Atlantic coast this past winter and spring,"" wrote the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI). ""Most deaths occurred during the colder months when manatees migrated to and through the Indian River Lagoon, where the majority of seagrass has died off."" Known colloquially as “sea cows,” Florida’s West Indian manatees head to the warmer waters of the Indian River Lagoon to forage. These large grazers can consume up to 9% of their body weight in a day in seagrass and other species of submerged aquatic plants, but for unknown reasons, this vital food source is declining rapidly. “The long-term health effects of prolonged starvation in manatees that survived the Atlantic event to this point are not yet known,” wrote the FWC in its report. “FWC remains committed to monitor and investigate manatee health, respond to manatees in need of rescue, and implement science-based conservation measures that protect manatees and their habitat.” It comes after wildlife officials declared an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) in March, which prompts a federal government collaboration between state and local entities to immediately investigate the cause of deaths, as was first reported by southeastern Florida’s digital newspaper TC Palm. And while a preliminary report indicated that a reduction in the seagrass was primarily responsible for the die-off, the FWC has not yet determined what is causing the seagrass die-off. As temperatures warmed up in the later months of the year, manatees on the Atlantic coast dispersed to other habitats for foraging, lessening the number that died from starvation. In June, boat strikes once again became the leading cause of death: as of this writing, a total of 63 manatees had been killed by boats.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,450

92e3243d-83db-4753-8b94-87fbcb2b6ffc,"In July 2021, Snopes readers contacted us to determine the legitimacy of reports claiming an Utah group representing Black Lives Matter described the American flag as a ""symbol of hatred,"" and called those who fly it racists, on the Fourth of July. The underlying claim was true, though some context is necessary to make sense of the group's role within the national Black Lives Matter movement — a decentralized effort to call attention to police brutality's disproportionate impact on Black Americans. Firstly, below is a transcribed version of an authentic July 4 post by a Facebook group titled ""Black Lives Matter Utah Chapter,"" which we also included as the feature image for this report. When we Black Americans see this flag we know the person flying it is not safe to be around. When we see this flag we know the person flying it is a racist. When we see this flag we know that the person flying it lives in a different America than we do. When we see this flag, we question your intelligence. We know to avoid you. It is a symbol of hatred. As the post spread rapidly online, Lex Scott , founder of Black Lives Matter Utah, told The Salt Lake Tribune the post was authored after she saw photos of a white nationalist hate group, Patriot Front, marching through Philadelphia carrying the American flag. “We are seeing that symbol used in every racist hate group’s messaging across this nation,"" Scott told the local newspaper. ""I am telling you when I see an American flag, I begin to feel fear for the simple fact that every time I am faced with hatred, it is at the hands of someone carrying an American flag.” In a statement on the group's website , Scott said again she stood by the sentiment, and shared dozens of voicemails and messages filled with racial slurs and threats from people condemning the post. ""They are proving our point,"" the message read. However, let us note here: The Facebook post went viral, in part, due to social media posts (like the one displayed below) that erroneously claimed all supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement believed in the Utah group's statement about the American flag. In reality, that was not the case. While it was true the Utah chapter called the flag a ""symbol of hatred"" and those who fly it racists, there was no widely-available evidence of other Black Lives Matter groups or like-minded activists making similar proclamations on the Fourth of July. In fact, Jeanetta Williams, president of the NAACP Utah State Conference, condemned the above-transcribed post, writing in a statement to local media outlets : ""The NAACP ... rejects the idea that flying the American flag is a racist message,"" the statement read, according to The Salt Lake Tribune . ""The flag stands for all the people who have lived and served to bring about the best of the American experience, that all people are created equal."" Furthermore, the Utah group was not formally part of the Black Lives Matter Global Network — the civil rights movement's parent organization that connects local chapters across the world with a political action committee and partnerships with corporations and politicians. The Utah group's website included following disclaimer: ""We are an independent chapter,"" the website stated. ""Each chapter of black lives matter has different objectives."" To conclude our analysis, we reached out to the Black Lives Matter Utah Chapter with a series of questions including whether it was aware of any other BLM groups or activists expressing similar statements and why it was not part of the broader network. We have not received a response, but we will update this report when, or if, that changes. In sum, we rate this claim ""True"" with the important caveat that Snopes found no evidence of other groups affiliated with, or representing, the Black Lives Matter movement taking a similar stance on the American flag.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,753

Lauren Boebert (R-Co), who has been a frequent critic of ""government handouts"" or social programs, had received a $233,000 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan to help her restaurant during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is not true. Boebert's restaurant did not receive a $233,000 PPP loan. Boebert owns a restaurant in Rifle, Colorado called Shooters Grill . This business did not receive a PPP loan. The claim that it did is based on someone's confusion over an entirely different restaurant, Shooters Sports Grill in Ohio, that did receive a $233,000 PPP loan. CNN's Daniel Dale was among the first to point out that this claim about Boebert's PPP loan was false. We can fact-check and confirm Dale's reporting by looking up some data from the U.S. Small Business Administration . ProPublica maintains an easily searchable database that allows people to search for businesses that received PPP loans. We found a number of loans for restaurants with names similar to ""Shooters Grill,"" but none for Boebert's restaurant in Rifle, Colorado. We did find the $233,000 loan at the center of this claim, but it's for a restaurant in Ohio, not Colorado. The claim that Boebert received a $233,000 PPP loan (while simultaneously criticizing government handouts) is not true. Many of the social media accounts that helped this claim go viral, such as the above-displayed tweet from Brian Tyler Cohen, a progressive political commentator with more than 400,000 followers, have been deleted. Cohen wrote on social media : Deleted this tweet. The PPP check was for a bar of the same name in a different state. My job is to stop misinformation, not spread it; no excuse for getting this wrong.

The Four Seasons confusion began in November 2020, when then-U.S. President Donald Trump was engaged in an aggressive disinformation campaign aimed at undermining the results of the presidential election, which he lost to current President Joe Biden. Trump took to his now- permanently suspended Twitter account to announce there would be a ""Lawyers Press Conference at Four Seasons, Philadelphia."" Turns out, it wasn't the ritzy Four Seasons hotel. It was the parking lot of a landscaping company — a parking lot shared with a crematorium and an adult book store — that sparked an internet sensation.

Try and get this through your thick skulls, you freedom-hating Communist dirtbags: I would rather see every child in this country dead than pass any new gun laws.

7e0925f6-d0b1-4a37-a1d6-959bc49e83f7,"In summer 2021, reports surfaced claiming Caitlyn Jenner , a former Olympic champion and TV personality who months earlier launched a campaign for California governor, laid out her solution to Los Angeles County's homelessness problem. According to the reports, the Republican candidate suggested moving chronically-homeless people — particularly those living on the Venice Beach boardwalk — to ""big open fields."" The underlying claim was true, though absent of some context, which we explain below. Firstly, Los Angeles County's homeless population is estimated at more than 60,000, according to The Associated Press . Among them were dozens of people living in makeshift shelters and tents along Venice Beach's famous boardwalk at the time of Jenner's comments on June 29. (Note: On July 8, The Los Angeles Times reported city crews were clearing those homeless camps.) In the interview with KTLA 5, a local TV news station for the Los Angeles area, Jenner indeed said the following: Jenner: Just the other day I went to Venice Beach, just to kind of see, got my bike. [...] Rode my bike down there. We have to clean those places up. We have to provide some place for those people to go, whether it's an open field out someplace. Or, if you've noticed, at the veteran's facility, there's these big open fields and a lot of places there. We have to be able to get them out there. It's just not fair. Venice Beach is destroyed. KTLA anchor Frank Buckley: So are you suggesting that those people would camp in some of these open fields? Jenner: We're going to find some place, if they are going to be camping [...]. They're destroying Venice Beach; they're destroying all the businesses down there; they don't need to be there. The crime rate is going up. [...] It's mostly homeless-on-homeless murders. We have to, we can't have that in our streets. We have to clean that up. But then also we have to provide, 'Here's a place where you can go — wherever it may be, we can find some open land — this is where you can pitch your tent.' Not right down there in the center. So, the businesses, you know, can open up. People can go enjoy our wonderful Southern California. In other words, Jenner suggested that government officials should do a better job cleaning up the popular boardwalk, and said that that effort should include kicking out the homeless people living there and providing them new places to sleep. Among her suggested locations for moving those people were unspecified ""big open fields,"" without elaborating further. However, she did not affirm the journalist's follow-up question about whether she indeed believed homeless people should camp in big open fields. Rather, Jenner stressed ""we can't have [homeless people living] in our streets"" and that officials need to provide a new place for them to go ""wherever it may be."" With that said, Jenner indeed floated the idea of moving people living on city streets to ""big open fields,"" though she also appeared open to other types of locations for setting up new homeless encampments. The gubernatorial candidate roughly 31-minute interview with Buckley was video recorded (watch the segment in which Jenner made the above-transcribed statements here ), as well as recirculated by other news outlets.

On June 29, CBS News reported: Hammer thrower and activist Gwen Berry has received fierce backlash after she appeared to turn her back to the American flag as the national anthem was being played at the U.S. Olympic Trials over the weekend. Berry, who famously protested during the anthem in the 2019 Pan American Games , caught attention for turning her body toward the stands and away from the flag as ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" was playing at the trials in Eugene, Oregon on Saturday. Toward the end of the song, she put a black T-shirt with the words ""Activist Athlete"" on her head. Her competitors DeAnna Price, who won first place, and Brooke Andersen, second place winner, put their hands over their hearts and faced the flag. Following her protest of the anthem, she drew ire from some conservative voices. Texas congressman Dan Crenshaw said Monday that Berry should be removed from the team . While sharing an article of the incident, Senator Ted Cruz tweeted , ""Why does the Left hate America?""

The claim was true. First, the 6-foot statue to memorialize the 46-year-old Black man who was killed by Minneapolis police in 2020 was unveiled on June 19 — the anniversary of one of the final acts of emancipation of slaves in the U.S. Then, on the morning of June 24, the wooden monument was found covered in black spray paint, including an inscription in white spray paint reading, ""PATRIOTFRONT.US,"" according to visual evidence from the scene on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn and the New York City's police department (NYPD) . The ""PATRIOTFRONT.US"" label represents a group of white nationalists that was founded in 2017 by Thomas Rousseau , the same person who led a Neo-Nazi group called Vanguard America , according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors far-right extremism. SPLC describes Patriot Front as ""an image-obsessed organization that rehabilitated the explicitly fascist agenda of Vanguard America with garish patriotism."" Lindsay Eshelman, who helped produce the statue, told ABC reporters the vandalism was devastating. ""Someone in the name of hate, came through the night and defaced it. [...] They snuck in,"" Eshelman said. ""They seem to be incredibly focused on patriotism. But, in my eyes, this was not 'patriotism', this was terrorism."" The NYPD was investigating the incident as a hate crime, which means detectives believed the suspects were motivated by racism, or other prejudice, to deface the monument. Law enforcement officials told The New York Times that, at least twice, people with ties to the group have allegedly unveiled large banners bearing its slogans and other information across major avenues in New York City. CBS New York reported NYPD considered Patriot Front to be an organized extremist group. As of this writing, authorities had not made any arrests, and it was unknown who exactly committed the crime. NYPD had released photos from surveillance video supposedly showing four male suspects — one of whom Al Jazeera reported was holding a spray can — in the area just hours before the property destruction was discovered. In the tweet displayed below, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was indeed a far-right extremist group that vandalized the statue, and that NYPD's investigation to find the individuals would lead to criminal charges. Gov. Andrew Cuomo commented on the incident, too, posting the below-displayed statement in which he said he directed state authorities who investigate hate crimes to assist NYPD in making arrests. ""To the group of neo-Nazis who did this, I want to be absolutely clear: get the hell out of our state,"" the governor tweeted. Around the same time, Chris Carnabuci, the artist who created the sculpture, told The New York Times that crews were working to remove the paint and fix any other damage to the statue, which is to remain in Brooklyn for several weeks before a planned move to Union Square in Manhattan. “I’m saddened by it,” he told the newspaper, referring to the vandalism. ""I''m not completely shocked."" Meanwhile, officials in Newark, New Jersey, were also searching for an individual or group that defaced a recently installed, 700-pound bronze statue of Floyd at City Hall, according to news reports . Here's how the monument looked before the vandalism: The statue's graffiti featured the web address of the same white supremacist group, reading: ""LIFE...LIBERTY VICTORY PATRIOTFRONT.US,"" according to ABC7 New York . ""The defacing of the statue of George Floyd has been a trend around the country,"" Mayor Ras Baraka told reporters . ""This horrible act is the very reason that this statue needs to remain and be upheld. As this is not just about George Floyd, it's a deliberate effort to push back against and ultimately dismantle systems of hatred, racism, and white supremacy.""

On June 22, Mother Jones highlighted what it characterized as a glaring democratic deficit in the vote to halt the For the People Act, writing that: The 50 Democratic senators who support the For the People Act (or least Sen. Joe Manchin’s compromise proposal keeping some key elements of the bill while excluding others) represent 43 million more Americans than the 50 Republican senators who oppose it, according to data compiled by Alex Tausanovitch of the Center for American Progress. Yet because of the 60-vote requirement to pass most legislation, 41 Republican senators representing just 21 percent of the country can block the bill from moving forward, even though it’s supported by 68 percent of the public, according to recent polling. The composition of the U.S. Senate — two members from each state, regardless of each state's population — has always disproportionately favored states with smaller populations. This is not by accident, but rather is a feature of the way the United States' bicameral national legislature is constructed, with House districts based on population size, and the Senate designed, in principle, to counter-balance that influence by giving smaller states outsized power. Nonetheless, the figure calculated by Alex Tausanovitch from the Center for American Progress, and presented by Ari Berman for Mother Jones — that the 50 Republicans opposed to the For the People Act represented 43 million fewer people than the 50 Democrats who supported it — was remarkable and, as it turns out, accurate. The Democratic-majority House passed H.R. 1, the For the People Act, in March 2021. Its companion bill in the Senate, S. 2093, was introduced on June 16. On June 22, senators debated a motion to proceed , followed by a motion of cloture on that motion to proceed. A motion of cloture is a proposal, signed by at least 16 senators, to end the current debate on a particular motion, and advance the underlying legislation, with the ultimate aim of holding a full vote on the bill. In order to progress the For the People Act, Democrats in the Senate needed a three-fifths majority on the cloture motion on June 22. However, the vote ended 50-50 , along strict party lines, thus effectively bringing the bill's progress to a halt. All 48 Democratic senators voted for the motion, along with independents Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Angus King of Maine, who both caucus with the Democrats. All 50 Republican senators voted against the motion, and therefore against the advancement of the underlying legislation. Using the most accurate and recent data available — the resident population for all 50 states, taken from the Census Bureau's "" 2020 Census Apportionment Results "" — we calculated the total population represented by each senator. A quick housekeeping note: In reality, each individual senator represents a whole state, but because, in some states, the two senators voted differently, we interpreted each individual senator as effectively representing half the state's population, for the purposes of these calculations. A detailed breakdown can be found here . In summary, though, the 50 senators — Democrats and independents — who voted for the motion, effectively represent close to 187 million people. By contrast, the 50 Republican senators who voted against it effectively represent 144 million people. That's a difference of slightly more than 43 million people, exactly as Tausanovitch and Berman stated.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,728

Given the high-profile nature of his announcement, it was perhaps unsurprising that the episode quickly turned political, with claims that Nassib is registered to vote as a Republican. On June 22, for example, right-wing activist Brigitte Gabriel tweeted : ""FUN FACT: The first openly gay active NFL player, Carl Nassib, is a registered Republican voter."" Some left-leaning and LGBTQ observers expressed disappointment at such claims , and others posted what appeared to be screenshots of voter registration details relating to Nassib. In general, readers should be wary of claims about a specific individual's party affiliation and voter registration, which often crop up in the aftermath of arrests, scandals and other controversies. Links and screenshots purporting to contain such details often come from unofficial and unreliable sources. It should also be noted that Nassib's personal political beliefs and party affiliation are of no inherent interest to the writers and editors at Snopes, and that this fact check is simply in response to widespread and substantive factual claims about a public figure currently in the news. In any event, Snopes has checked official, reliable voter registration data from Nevada and Florida, and can confirm that Nassib is indeed registered to vote as a Republican, and has been in at least two states, since May 2019 at the latest. We are therefore issuing a rating of ""True."" Nassib joined the Raiders in March 2020, and lives in Las Vegas. On June 23, Snopes downloaded voter rolls from the 16th state assembly district, from the official website of Clark County, Nevada. That database contains an entry for Carl Paul Nassib, born in 1993, with an address in Las Vegas, and shows that he is an active voter who registered as a Republican on Nov. 3, 2020 — the date of the most recent general election. In the screenshot below, we have redacted certain columns which, although public record, contained personal details including Nassib's home address: Before joining the Raiders, Nassib played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and lived in Hillsborough County, Florida. We checked registration information on the official website of the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections, and found that Nassib registered as a Republican there on May 15, 2019. We have redacted Nassib's voter registration number, as well as his residential and permanent addresses, from the screenshot below: Before joining the Buccaneers, Nassib played for the Cleveland Browns. Information found on the official website of the Medina County Board of Elections showed that he voted there in the 2016 general election, on Nov. 8, but did not indicate his party affiliation at that time, if any. As we have shown, Nassib has been registered as a Republican in two different states — Florida and Nevada — since May 2019 at the latest, and he was registered as a Republican for the most recent general election, in November 2020. The claim that Nassib is registered to vote, as a Republican, is therefore undoubtedly accurate, as of June 2021.",real,news article,human,post-GPT,x-Gen,592
